      <title>Dynamics of nano-scale assemblies of amphiphilic PEG-PDMS-PEG copolymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micelles and vesicles are promising candidates in targeted drug/gene delivery, bioreactors, and templates for nanoparticle synthesis. We investigated the morphology and dynamics of PEG-PDMS-PEG triblock copolymer nano-scale assemblies regarding the membrane dynamics because the molecular dynamics of the membrane govern mechanical properties like the stability of a membrane. We studied the structure by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, small-angle neutron scattering, and the dynamics by dynamic light scattering and neutron spin echo spectroscopy. We changed the length of the hydrophilic block to obtain micellar and vesicular systems. The vesicle has a membrane rigidity, $\kappa_\eta = 16 \pm 2 k_B T$, the same order of magnitude as the corresponding liposome value but one order of magnitude higher than polymeric interfaces in microemulsions. Hence, the height-height fluctuations of polymers in a polymersome seem much less than those measured for surfactants at an oil-water interface. Therefore, the polymersome is substantially more stable. The value is very close to liposomes, indicating a similar stability.</description>

      <title>Flow dichroism of DNA can be quantitatively predicted via coarse-grained molecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of multiscale polymer modelling to quantitatively predict DNA linear dichroism (LD) in shear flow. LD is the difference in absorption of light polarised along two perpendicular axes, and has long been applied to study biopolymer structure and drug-biopolymer interactions. As LD is orientation-dependent, the sample must be aligned in order to measure a signal. Shear flow via a Couette cell can generate the required orientation, however it is challenging to separate the LD due to changes in polymer conformation from specific interactions, e.g. drug-biopolymer. In this study, we have applied a combination of Brownian dynamics and equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations to accurately predict polymer alignment, and hence flow LD, at modest computational cost. As the optical and conformational contributions to the LD can be explicitly separated, our findings allow for enhanced quantitative interpretation of LD spectra through the use of an in-silico model to capture conformational changes. Our model requires no fitting and only five input parameters, the DNA contour length, persistence length, optical factor, solvent quality, and relaxation time, all of which have been well characterized in prior literature. The method is sufficiently general to apply to a wide range of biopolymers beyond DNA, and our findings could help guide the search for new pharmaceutical drug targets via flow LD.</description>

      <title>Reversible-to-irreversible transition of colloidal polycrystals under cyclic athermal quasistatic deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclic loading on granular packings and amorphous media exhibits a transition from reversible elastic behavior to irreversible plasticity. The present study compares the irreversibility transition and microscopic details of colloidal polycrystals under oscillatory tensile-compressive and shear strain. Under both modes, the systems exhibit a reversible to irreversible transition. However, the strain amplitude at which the transition is observed is larger in the shear strain than in the tensile-compressive mode. The threshold strain amplitude is confirmed by analyzing the dynamical properties, such as mobility and atomic strain (von-Mises shear strain and the volumetric strain). The structural changes are quantified using a hexatic order parameter. Under both modes of deformation, dislocations and grain boundaries in polycrystals disappear, and monocrystals are formed. We also recognize the dislocation motion through grains. The key difference is that strain accumulates diagonally in oscillatory tensile-compressive deformation, whereas, in shear deformation, strain accumulation is along the $x$ or $y$ axis.</description>

      <title>Spectral approaches to stress relaxation in epithelial monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the viscoelastic relaxation to equilibrium of a disordered planar epithelium described using the cell vertex model. In its standard form, the model is formulated as coupled evolution equations for the locations of vertices of confluent polygonal cells. Exploiting the model's gradient-flow structure, we use singular-value decomposition to project modes of deformation of vertices onto modes of deformation of cells. We show how eigenmodes of discrete Laplacian operators (specified by constitutive assumptions related to dissipation and mechanical energy) provide a spatial basis for evolving fields, and demonstrate how the operators can incorporate approximations of conventional spatial derivatives. We relate the spectrum of relaxation times to the eigenvalues of the Laplacians, modified by corrections that account for the fact that the cell network (and therefore the Laplacians) evolve during relaxation to an equilibrium prestressed state, providing the monolayer with geometric stiffness. While dilational modes of the Laplacians capture rapid relaxation in some circumstances, showing diffusive dynamics, geometric stiffness is typically a dominant source of monolayer rigidity, as we illustrate for monolayers exposed to unsteady stretching deformations.</description>

      <title>Harmonic chain driven by active Rubin bath: transport properties and steady-state correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the properties of an extended system driven by active reservoirs is a question of increasing importance. Here we address this question in two steps. We start by investigating the dynamics of a probe particle connected to an `active Rubin bath' -- a linear chain of overdamped run-and-tumble particles. We derive exact analytical expressions for the effective noise and dissipation kernels, acting on the probe, and show that the active nature of the bath leads to a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation. In the next step, we study the properties of an activity-driven system, modeled by a chain of harmonic oscillators connected to two such active reservoirs at the two ends. We show that the system reaches a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS), remarkably different from that generated due to a thermal gradient. We characterize this NESS by computing the kinetic temperature profile, spatial and temporal velocity correlations of the oscillators, and the average energy current flowing through the system. It turns out that, the activity drive leads to the emergence of two characteristic length scales, proportional to the activities of the reservoirs. Strong signatures of activity are also manifest in the anomalous short-time decay of the velocity autocorrelations. Finally, we find that the energy current shows a non-monotonic dependence on the activity drive and reversal in direction, corroborating previous findings.</description>

Abstract: Bacteriophages spreading through populations of bacteria offer relatively simple, tuneable systems for testing mathematical models of range expansion. However, such models typically assume a static state into which to expand, which is not generally valid for bacterial-bacteriophage populations, where both the host (bacteria) and the infectious agent (bacteriophage) have similar growth rates. Here, we build on the classical FKPP theory of expanding fronts to study an infectious bacteriophage front propagating into an exponentially growing population of bacteria, focusing on the situation where the hosts are also mobile, e.g., swimming bacteria. In this case, both the infectious agent and the infected host populations take on the form of self-similar travelling waves with a fixed wave speed, as in FKPP theory, but the infected host wave also grows exponentially. Depending on the population under consideration, wave speeds are either advanced or retarded compared to the non-growing case. We identify a novel speed selection mechanism in which the shape of the bacteriophage wave controls these various wave speeds. We propose experiments to test our predictions.</description>

      <title>Universal symmetry of optimal control at the microscale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimizing the energy efficiency of driving processes provides valuable insights into the underlying physics and is of crucial importance for numerous applications, from biological processes to the design of machines and robots. Knowledge of optimal driving protocols is particularly valuable at the microscale, where energy supply is often limited. Here we investigate experimentally and theoretically the paradigmatic optimization problem of moving a potential carrying a load through a fluid, in a finite time and over a given distance, in such a way that the required work is minimal. An important step towards more realistic systems is the consideration of memory effects in the surrounding fluid, which are ubiquitous in real-world applications. Therefore, our experiments were performed in viscous and viscoelastic media, which are typical environments for synthetic and biological processes on the microscale. Despite marked differences between the protocols in both fluids, we find that the optimal control protocol and the corresponding average particle trajectory always obey a time-reversal symmetry. We show that this symmetry, which surprisingly applies here to a class of processes far from thermal equilibrium, holds universally for various systems, including active, granular, and long-range correlated media in their linear regimes. The uncovered symmetry provides a rigorous and versatile criterion for optimal control that greatly facilitates the search for energy-efficient transport strategies in a wide range of systems. Using a machine learning algorithm, we demonstrate that the algorithmic exploitation of time-reversal symmetry can significantly enhance the performance of numerical optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Predicting the morphology of multiphase biomolecular condensates from protein interaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase-separated biomolecular condensates containing proteins and RNAs can assemble into higher-order structures by forming thermodynamically stable interfaces between immiscible phases. Using a minimal model of a protein/RNA interaction network, we demonstrate how a "shared" protein species that partitions into both phases of a multiphase condensate can function as a tunable surfactant that modulates the interfacial properties. We use Monte Carlo simulations and free-energy calculations to identify conditions under which a low concentration of this shared species is sufficient to trigger a wetting transition. We also describe a numerical approach based on classical density functional theory to predict concentration profiles and surface tensions directly from the model protein/RNA interaction network. Finally, we show that the wetting phase diagrams that emerge from our calculations can be understood in terms of a simple model of selective adsorption to a fluctuating interface. Our work shows how a low-concentration protein species might function as a biological switch for regulating multiphase condensate morphologies.</description>

      <title>Nanocrystal Programmable Assembly Beyond Hard Spheres (or Shapes) and Other (Simple) Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ligands are the key to almost any strategy in the assembly of programmable nanocrystals (or nanoparticles) and must be accurately considered in any predictive model. Hard Spheres (or Shapes) provide the simplest and yet quite successful approach to assembly, with remarkable sophisticated predictions verified in experiments. There are, however, many situations where hard spheres/shapes predictions fail. This prompts three important questions: {\em In what situations should hard spheres/shapes models be expected to work?} and when they do not work, {\em Is there a general model that successfully corrects hard sphere/shape predictions?} and given other successful models where ligands are included explicitly, and of course, numerical simulations, {\em can we unify hard sphere/shape models, explicit ligand models and all atom simulations?}. The Orbifold Topological Model (OTM) provides a positive answer to these three questions. In this paper, I give a detailed review of OTM, describing the concept of ligand vortices and how it leads to spontaneous valence and nanoparticle "eigenshapes" while providing a prediction of the lattice structure, without fitting parameters, which accounts for many body effects not captured in (two-body) potentials. I present a thorough survey of experiments and simulations and show that, to this date, they are in full agreement with the OTM predictions. I will conclude with a discussion on whether NC superlattices are equilibrium structures and some significant challenges in structure prediction.</description>

      <title>X-LoRA: Mixture of Low-Rank Adapter Experts, a Flexible Framework for Large Language Models with Applications in Protein Mechanics and Molecular Design</title>

Abstract: We report a mixture of expert strategy to create fine-tuned large language models using a deep layer-wise token-level approach based on low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Starting with a set of pre-trained LoRA adapters, our gating strategy uses the hidden states to dynamically mix adapted layers, allowing the resulting X-LoRA model to draw upon different capabilities and create never-before-used deep layer-wise combinations to solve tasks. The design is inspired by the biological principles of universality and diversity, where neural network building blocks are reused in different hierarchical manifestations. Hence, the X-LoRA model can be easily implemented for any existing large language model (LLM) without a need for modifications of the underlying structure. We develop a tailored X-LoRA model that offers scientific capabilities including forward/inverse analysis tasks and enhanced reasoning capability, focused on biomaterial analysis, protein mechanics and design. The impact of this work include access to readily expandable and adaptable models with strong domain knowledge and the capability to integrate across areas of knowledge. Featuring experts in biology, mathematics, reasoning, bio-inspired materials, mechanics and materials, chemistry, protein biophysics, mechanics and quantum-mechanics based molecular properties, we conduct a series of physics-focused case studies. We examine knowledge recall, protein mechanics forward/inverse tasks, protein design, adversarial agentic modeling including ontological knowledge graph construction, as well as molecular design. The model is capable not only of making quantitative predictions of nanomechanical properties of proteins or quantum mechanical molecular properties, but also reasons over the results and correctly predicts likely mechanisms that explain distinct molecular behaviors.</description>

      <title>Memory in cyclically crumpled sheets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the crumpling of a sheet as it is repeatedly crushed onto itself by rolling it into a cylinder and twisting it axially while allowing the end-to-end length to evolve freely. As deduced from its plastic deformations, the sheet creases and collapses into structures which repeat and sharpen over hundreds of cycles to a remarkable degree before forming new configurations. The observed metastablilty increases with applied cycles leading to recurrent structures over a significant range of loading, but reconfigurations can continue to occur for large enough loading as the creases develop tears. The evolution of the sheet structure as measured by the mean curvature and the total crease length is found to increase logarithmically with cycle number with a rate which increases with degree of compression. We explain the overall extent of creasing using flat folding models, and show the logarithmic growth as being a consequence of individual creases becoming sharper with number of folding cycles, and due to the bifurcation in the curvature field leading to the formation of new creases and folding pathways. Thus, we show that elastoplastic sheets can follow complex folding pathways to form convergent structures after a sufficiently large number of training cycles provided material fatigue remains unimportant.</description>

Abstract: Connectedness percolation phenomena in the two-dimensional (2D) packing of binary mixtures of disks with different diameters were studied numerically. The packings were produced using random sequential adsorption (RSA) model with simultaneous deposition of disks. The ratio of the particle diameters was varied within the range $D=1$-$10$, and the selection probability of the small disks was varied within the range 0-1. A core-shell structure of the particles was assumed for the analysis of connectivity. The packing coverages in a jamming state for different components, connectivities through small, large and both types of disks, the behavior of electrical conductivity were analyzed. The observed complex effects were explained accounting for the formation of conductive "bridges" from small disks in pores between large disks.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the universal conformational properties of complex copolymer macromolecules, based on two topologies: the rosette structure containing $f_c$ linear branches and $f_r$ closed loops grafted to the central core, and the symmetric pom-pom structure, consisting of a backbone linear chain terminated by two branching points with functionalities $f$. We assume that the constituent strands (branches) of these structures can be of two different chemical species $a$ and $b$. Depending on the solvent conditions, the inter- or intrachain interactions of some links may vanish, which corresponds to $\Theta$-state of the corresponding polymer species. Applying both the analytical approach within the frames of direct polymer renormalization and numerical simulations based on the lattice model of polymer, we evaluated the set of parameters characterizing the size properties of constituent parts of two complex topologies and estimated quantitatively the impact of interactions between constituent parts on these size characteristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surface tension of monolayers with mixtures of anionic and nonionic surfactant at the liquid/vapour interface is studied. Previous works have observed that calculations of the surface tension of simple fluids show artificial oscillations for small interfacial areas, indicating that the surface tension data fluctuate due to the finite size effects and periodic boundary conditions. In the case of simulations of monolayers composed of surfactant mixtures, the surface tension not only oscillates for small areas but can also give non-physical data, such as negative values. Analysis of the monolayers with different surfactant mixtures, ionic (DTAB, CTAB, SDS) and nonionic (SB3-12), was done for density profiles, parameters of order and pair correlation functions for small and large box areas and all of them present similar behaviour. The fluctuations and the non-physical values of the surface tension are corrected when boxes with large interfacial areas are considered. The results indicate that in order to obtain reliable values of the surface tension, in computer simulations, it is important to choose not only the correct force field but also the appropriate size of the simulation box.</description>

Abstract: This research focuses on the unique phase behavior of non-spherical patchy colloids in porous environments. Based on the theory of scaled particle (SPT), methods have been refined and applied to analyze the thermodynamic properties of non-spherical patchy particles in a disordered porous medium. Utilizing the associative theory of liquids in conjunction with SPT, we investigated the impact of associative interactions and connections between the functional nodes of particles on the formation of the nematic phase. Calculations of orientational and spatial distributions were conducted, which helped to understand the phase behavior of particles during the transition from isotropic to nematic phase under the spatial constraints imposed by the disordered matrix of the porous medium.</description>

      <title>Active drive towards elastic spinodals</title>

Abstract: Active renewable matter, a distinctive feature of adaptive living materials, can exhibit highly unusual mechanical responses by actively navigating the space of material parameters. In particular, it can self-drive towards elastic spinodals where the presence of inhomogeneous floppy modes, makes the matter elastically degenerate. The main effect of the implied marginality is stress localization leading to the emergence of force chains which can be actively assembled and disassembled. In this Letter we formalize the concept of spinodal states for general elastic solids and show how such extreme mechanical regimes can be actively navigated.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Thickness of the Air-Water Interface from Two Extremes of Interface Hydrogen Bond Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The air-water interface plays a crucial role in many aspects of science, because of its unique properties, such as a two-dimensional hydrogen bond (HB) network and completely different HB dynamics compared to bulk water. However, accurately determining the boundary of interfacial and bulk water, that is, the thickness of the air-water interface, still challenges experimentalists. Various simulation-based methods have been developed to estimate the thickness, converging on a range of approximately 3 to 10 Angstroms. In this study, we introduce a novel approach, grounded in density functional theory-based molecular dynamics (DFTMD) simulations, to measure the air-water interface thickness, offering a different perspective based on prior research. To capture realistic HB dynamics in the air-water interface, two extreme scenarios of the interface HB dynamics are obtained: one {underestimates} the interface HB dynamics, while the other overestimates it. Surprisingly, our results suggest that the interface HB dynamics in both scenarios converge as the thickness of the air-water interface increases to 4.0 Angstroms. This convergence point, indicative of the realistic interface thickness, is confirmed by our calculation of anisotropic decay of OH stretch at the air-water interface and supported by the results from recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of viscoelasticity of two-dimensional fluid membranes under oscillatory loadings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11074v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biomembranes consisting of two opposing phospholipid monolayers, which comprise the so-called lipid bilayer, are largely responsible for the dual solid-fluid behavior of individual cells and viruses. Quantifying the mechanical characteristics of biomembrane, including the dynamics of their in-plane fluidity, can provide insight not only into active or passive cell behaviors but also into vesicle design for drug delivery systems. Despite numerous studies on the mechanics of biomembranes, their dynamical viscoelastic properties have not yet been fully described. We thus quantify their viscoelasticity based on a two-dimensional (2D) fluid membrane model, and investigate this viscoelasticity under small amplitude oscillatory loadings in micron-scale membrane area. We use hydrodynamic equations of bilayer membranes, obtained by Onsager's variational principle, wherein the fluid membrane is assumed to be an almost planar bilayer membrane. Simulations are performed for a wide range of oscillatory frequencies $f$ and membrane tensions. Our numerical results show that as frequencies increase, membrane characteristics shift from an elastic-dominant to viscous-dominant state. Furthermore, such state transitions obtained with a 1-$\mu$m-wide loading profile appear with frequencies between $O(f) = 10^1-10^2$ Hz, and almost independently of surface tensions. We discuss the formation mechanism of the viscous- or elastic-dominant transition based on relaxation rates that correspond to the eigenvalues of the dynamical matrix in the governing equations.</description>

      <title>An electronic structure investigation of PEDOT with AlCl4- anions, a promising redox combination for energy storage applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is one of the most researched materials. The 1980s bipolaron model remains the dominant interpretation of the electronic structure of PEDOT. Recent theoretical studies have provided updated definitions of key concepts such as bipolarons or polaron pairs, but these have not yet become widely known. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the electronic structure of PEDOT oligomers with co-located AlCl4- anions, a promising combination for energy storage. By considering the influence of oligomer length, oxidation or anion concentration and spin state, we find no evidence for self-localisation of positive charges in PEDOT as predicted by the bipolaron model at the hybrid functional level. Our results show distortions that exhibit either a single or a double peak in bond length alternations and charge density. Either can occur at different oxidation or anion concentrations. We note that other distortion shapes are also possible. Rather than representing bipolarons or polaron pairs in the original model, these are electron distributions driven by a range of factors. Localisation of distortions occurs with anions, and distortions can span an arbitrary number of nearby anions. Conductivity in conducting polymers has been observed to reduce at anion concentrations above 0.5. We show at high anion concentrations, the energy of the localised, non-bonding anionic orbitals approaches that of the system HOMO due to Coulombic repulsion between anions. We hypothesize that with nucleic motion in the macropolymer, these orbitals will interfere with the hopping of charge carriers between sites of similar energy, lowering conductivity.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Bayesian Inference for Molecular Simulations using Local Gaussian Process Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Bayesian inference is the gold standard for uncertainty quantification and propagation, its use within physical chemistry encounters formidable computational barriers. These bottlenecks are magnified for modeling data with many independent variables, such as X-ray/neutron scattering patterns and electromagnetic spectra. To address this challenge, we apply a Bayesian framework accelerated via local Gaussian process (LGP) surrogate models. We show that the time-complexity of LGPs scales linearly in the number of independent variables, in stark contrast to the computationally expensive cubic scaling of conventional Gaussian processes. To illustrate the method, we trained a LGP surrogate model on the experimental radial distribution function of liquid neon, and observed a remarkable 288,000-fold speed-up compared to molecular dynamics with insignificant loss in predictive accuracy. We conclude that LGPs are robust and efficient surrogate models, poised to expand the application of Bayesian inference in molecular simulations to a broad spectrum of ever-advancing experimental data.</description>

      <title>Mechanical stability of homogeneous holographic solids under finite shear strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the linear stability of holographic homogeneous solids (HHS) at finite temperature and in presence of a background shear strain by means of a large scale quasi-normal mode analysis which extends beyond the hydrodynamic limit. We find that mechanical instability can arise either as a result of a complex speed of sound -- gradient instability -- or of a negative diffusion constant. Surprisingly, the simplest HHS models are linearly stable for arbitrarily large values of the background strain. For more complex HHS, the onset of the diffusive instability always precedes that of the gradient instability, which becomes the dominant destabilizing process only above a critical value of the background shear strain. Finally, we observe that the critical strains for the two instabilities approach each other at low temperatures. We conclude by presenting a phase diagram for HHS as a function of temperature and background shear strain which shows interesting similarities with the physics of superfluids in presence of background superfluid velocity.</description>

      <title>Explaining the thickness-dependent dielectric permittivity of thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.18061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dielectric properties of thin films are of paramount important in a variety of technological applications, and of fundamental importance for solid state research. In spite of this, there is currently no theoretical understanding of the dependence of the dielectric permittivity on the thickness of thin films. We develop a confinement model within the Lorentz-field framework for the microscopic Langevin-equation description of dielectric response in terms of the atomic-scale vibrational modes of the solid. Based on this, we derive analytical expressions for the dielectric permittivity as a function of thin film thickness, in excellent agreement with experimental data of Barium-Strontium-Titanate (BST) thin films of different stoichiometry. The theory shows that the decrease of dielectric permittivity with decreasing thickness is directly caused by the restriction in $k$-space of the available eigenmodes for field-induced alignment of ions and charged groups.</description>

      <title>The Anomalous Long-Ranged Influence of an Inclusion in Momentum-Conserving Active Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that an inclusion placed inside a dilute Stokesian suspension of microswimmers induces power-law number-density modulations and flows. These take a different form depending on whether the inclusion is held fixed by an external force, for example an optical tweezer, or if it is free. When the inclusion is held in place, the far-field fluid flow is a Stokeslet, while the microswimmer density decays as $1/r^{2+\epsilon}$, with $r$ the distance from the inclusion, and $\epsilon$ an anomalous exponent which depends on the symmetry of the inclusion and varies continuously as a function of a dimensionless number characterizing the relative amplitudes of the convective and diffusive effects. The angular dependence takes a non-trivial form which depends on the same dimensionless number. When the inclusion is free to move, the far-field fluid flow is a stresslet and the microswimmer density decays as $1/r^2$ with a simple angular dependence. These long-range modulations mediate long-range interactions between inclusions that we characterize.</description>
