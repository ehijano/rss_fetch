      <title>Optimizing VO2max Prediction in Gamified Cardiac Assessment: Leveraging Effective Feature Selection and Refined Protocols for Robust Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VO2max is a critical indicator of cardiopulmonary fitness, reflecting the maximum amount of oxygen the body can utilize during intense exercise. Accurately measuring VO2max is essential for assessing cardiovascular health and predicting outcomes in clinical settings. However, current methods for VO2max estimation, such as Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing (CPET), require expensive equipment and the supervision of trained personnel, limiting accessibility for large-scale screening. Preliminary efforts have been made to create a more accessible method, such as the Cardiopulmonary Spot Jog Test (CPSJT). Unfortunately, these early attempts yielded high error margins, rendering them unsuitable for widespread use. In our study, we address these shortcomings by refining the CPSJT protocol to improve prediction accuracy. A crucial contribution is improved feature extraction which include gender, body mass index, aerobic duration, and anaerobic duration. This targeted approach helps in streamlining the model to enhance prediction precision while minimizing the risk of overfitting. In a cohort of 44 participants from the Indian population, we assessed the performance of various machine learning models using these features. With Stratified 5-Fold Cross-Validation, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values were 5.78 for Linear Regression, 5.15 for Random Forest, and 5.17 for Support Vector Regression. All models demonstrated strong test correlations and low RMSE values, underscoring their robust and reliable performance.</description>

      <title>DIVER-0 : A Fully Channel Equivariant EEG Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique widely used in brain-computer interfaces and clinical applications, yet existing EEG foundation models face limitations in modeling spatio-temporal brain dynamics and lack channel permutation equivariance, preventing robust generalization across diverse electrode configurations. To address these challenges, we propose DIVER-0, a novel EEG foundation model that demonstrates how full spatio-temporal attention-rather than segregated spatial or temporal processing-achieves superior performance when properly designed with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) for temporal relationships and binary attention biases for channel differentiation. We also introduce Sliding Temporal Conditional Positional Encoding (STCPE), which improves upon existing conditional positional encoding approaches by maintaining both temporal translation equivariance and channel permutation equivariance, enabling robust adaptation to arbitrary electrode configurations unseen during pretraining. Experimental results demonstrate that DIVER-0 achieves competitive performance with only 10% of pretraining data while maintaining consistent results across all channel permutation conditions, validating its effectiveness for cross-dataset generalization and establishing key design principles for handling the inherent heterogeneity of neural recording setups.</description>

Abstract: The Recursive KalmanNet, recently introduced by the authors, is a recurrent neural network guided by a Kalman filter, capable of estimating the state variables and error covariance of stochastic dynamic systems from noisy measurements, without prior knowledge of the noise characteristics. This paper explores its generalization capabilities in out-of-distribution scenarios, where the temporal dynamics of the test measurements differ from those encountered during training.

      <title>Estimating Markers of Driving Stress through Multimodal Physiological Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and mitigating driving stress is vital for preventing accidents and advancing both road safety and driver well-being. While vehicles are equipped with increasingly sophisticated safety systems, many limits exist in their ability to account for variable driving behaviors and environmental contexts. In this study we examine how short-term stressor events impact drivers' physiology and their behavioral responses behind the wheel. Leveraging a controlled driving simulation setup, we collected physiological signals from 31 adult participants and designed a multimodal machine learning system to estimate the presence of stressors. Our analysis explores the model sensitivity and temporal dynamics against both known and novel emotional inducers, and examines the relationship between predicted stress and observable patterns of vehicle control. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of linking physiological signals with contextual and behavioral cues in order to improve real-time estimation of driving stress.</description>

      <title>Graph Convolutional Neural Networks to Model the Brain for Insomnia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insomnia affects a vast population of the world and can have a wide range of causes. Existing treatments for insomnia have been linked with many side effects like headaches, dizziness, etc. As such, there is a clear need for improved insomnia treatment. Brain modelling has helped with assessing the effects of brain pathology on brain network dynamics and with supporting clinical decisions in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, etc. However, such models have not been developed for insomnia. Therefore, this project attempts to understand the characteristics of the brain of individuals experiencing insomnia using continuous long-duration EEG data. Brain networks are derived based on functional connectivity and spatial distance between EEG channels. The power spectral density of the channels is then computed for the major brain wave frequency bands. A graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) model is then trained to capture the functional characteristics associated with insomnia and configured for the classification task to judge performance. Results indicated a 50-second non-overlapping sliding window was the most suitable choice for EEG segmentation. This approach achieved a classification accuracy of 70% at window level and 68% at subject level. Additionally, the omission of EEG channels C4-P4, F4-C4 and C4-A1 caused higher degradation in model performance than the removal of other channels. These channel electrodes are positioned near brain regions known to exhibit atypical levels of functional connectivity in individuals with insomnia, which can explain such results.</description>

      <title>Visible Light Indoor Positioning with a Single LED and Distributed Single-Element OIRS: An Iterative Approach with Adaptive Beam Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Optical Intelligent Reflective Surfaces (OIRSs) into Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems is gaining momentum as a valid alternative to RF technologies, harnessing the existing lighting infrastructures and the vast unlicensed optical spectrum to enable higher spectral efficiency, improved resilience to Line-of-Sight (LoS) blockages, and enhanced positioning capabilities. This paper investigates the problem of localizing a low-cost Photo Detector (PD) in a VLC-based indoor environment consisting of only a single Light Emitting Diode (LED) as an active anchor, and multiple spatially distributed single-element OIRSs. We formulate the problem within an indirect, computationally efficient localization framework: first, the optimal Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimators of the LoS and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) distances are derived, using a suitable OIRS activation strategy to prevent interferences. To overcome the grid-based optimization required by the ML NLoS estimator, we devise a novel algorithm based on an unstructured noise variance transformation, which admits a closed-form solution. The set of estimated LoS/NLoS distances are then used within a low-complexity localization algorithm combining an Iterative Weighted Least Squares (IWLS) procedure, whose weights are set according to the inverse of the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), with an adaptive beam steering strategy that allows the OIRSs network to dynamically align with the PD, without any prior knowledge of its position. Accordingly, we derive the CRLB for both LoS/NLoS distance estimation and PD position estimation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of localization accuracy, robustness against OIRSs misalignment conditions, and low number of iterations required to attain the theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Self-DANA: A Resource-Efficient Channel-Adaptive Self-Supervised Approach for ECG Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are large-scale machine learning models trained on extensive, diverse datasets that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks with minimal fine-tuning. In the last two years, interest in FMs has also grown for applications in the cardiological field to analyze the electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. One of the key properties of FMs is their transferability to a wide range of downstream scenarios. With the spread of wearable and portable devices, keen interest in learning from reduced-channel configurations has arisen. However, the adaptation of ECG FMs to downstream scenarios with fewer available channels still has to be properly investigated. In this work, we propose Self-DANA, a novel, easy-to-integrate solution that makes self-supervised architectures adaptable to a reduced number of input channels, ensuring resource efficiency and high performance. We also introduce Random Lead Selection, a novel augmentation technique to pre-train models in a more robust and channel-agnostic way. Our experimental results on five reduced-channel configurations demonstrate that Self-DANA significantly enhances resource efficiency while reaching state-of-the-art performance. It requires up to 69.3% less peak CPU memory, 34.4% less peak GPU memory, about 17% less average epoch CPU time, and about 24% less average epoch GPU time.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-enabled river water quality monitoring using lithography-free 3D-printed sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: River water quality monitoring is important for aquatic life, livestock, and humans because clean water is critical to meeting food demand during the global food crisis. Excessive contaminants, including phosphate, deplete dissolved oxygen and trigger eutrophication, leading to serious health and ecological problems. Continuous sensors that track phosphate levels can therefore help prevent eutrophication. In this work we present a lithography-free phosphate sensor (P-sensor) that detects phosphate in river water at parts-per-billion levels. The device uses a solid-state indicator electrode formed by 3D-printed periodic polymer patterns (8 um feature size) coated with a thin phosphate ion-selective membrane. The P-sensor detects as little as 1 ppb phosphate across 0 - 475 ppm with a response time under 30 seconds. We validated the sensor on Rappahannock River water, Virginia (less than 0.8 ppm phosphate) at sites upstream and downstream of a sewage treatment plant and benchmarked the results against a commercial phosphate meter. A feed-forward neural network was trained to predict phosphate levels, achieving a mean-squared error below 1e-3, zero standard deviation, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.997 for river samples. These results demonstrate a practical tool for continuous water-quality monitoring that can inform stakeholders and policymakers and ultimately improve public health.</description>

      <title>Surface EMG Profiling in Parkinson's Disease: Advancing Severity Assessment with GCN-SVM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) poses challenges in diagnosis and monitoring due to its progressive nature and complex symptoms. This study introduces a novel approach utilizing surface electromyography (sEMG) to objectively assess PD severity, focusing on the biceps brachii muscle. Initial analysis of sEMG data from five PD patients and five healthy controls revealed significant neuromuscular differences. A traditional Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved up to 83% accuracy, while enhancements with a Graph Convolutional Network-Support Vector Machine (GCN-SVM) model increased accuracy to 92%. Despite the preliminary nature of these results, the study outlines a detailed experimental methodology for future research with larger cohorts to validate these findings and integrate the approach into clinical practice. The proposed approach holds promise for advancing PD severity assessment and improving patient care in Parkinson's disease management.</description>

      <title>Extreme Value Theory-based Distributed Interference Prediction for 6G Industrial Sub-networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference prediction that accounts for extreme and rare events remains a key challenge for ultra-densely deployed sub-networks (SNs) requiring hyper-reliable low-latency communication (HRLLC), particularly under dynamic mobility, rapidly varying channel statistics, and sporadic traffic. This paper proposes a novel calibrated interference tail prediction framework, a hybrid statistical and machine learning (ML) approach that integrates an inverted quantile patch transformer (iQPTransformer) within extreme value theory (EVT). It captures interference dynamics and tail behavior while quantifying uncertainty to provide statistical coverage guarantees. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by leveraging the estimated interference tail distribution to design predictive, risk-aware resource allocation. In resource-constrained SN scenarios, we introduce the split-iQPTransformer, enabling collaborative training by distributing neural network components between sensor-actuator (SA) pairs and the SN controller, while maintaining minimal performance disparity compared to the centralized iQPTransformer. The framework effectively handles deep fading, random traffic, and time-division duplexing (TDD) misalignments and is resilient to rare and extreme interference events. Extensive evaluations are performed under two mobility models and two realistic SN traffic patterns, using a spatially consistent 3GPP channel model across all scenarios. Experimental results show consistent achievement of block error rate (BLER) targets beyond the 95th percentile in the hyper-reliable regime, significantly outperforming baseline approaches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present UniPhyNet, a novel neural network architecture to classify cognitive load using multimodal physiological data -- specifically EEG, ECG and EDA signals -- without the explicit need for extracting hand-crafted features. UniPhyNet integrates multiscale parallel convolutional blocks and ResNet-type blocks enhanced with channel block attention module to focus on the informative features while a bidirectional gated recurrent unit is used to capture temporal dependencies. This architecture processes and combines signals in both unimodal and multimodal configurations via intermediate fusion of learned feature maps. On the CL-Drive dataset, UniPhyNet improves raw signal classification accuracy from 70% to 80% (binary) and 62% to 74% (ternary), outperforming feature-based models, demonstrating its effectiveness as an end-to-end solution for real-world cognitive state monitoring.</description>

      <title>A Denoising VAE for Intracardiac Time Series in Ischemic Cardiomyopathy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of cardiac electrophysiology (EP), effectively reducing noise in intra-cardiac signals is crucial for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias and cardiomyopathies. However, traditional noise reduction techniques fall short in addressing the diverse noise patterns from various sources, often non-linear and non-stationary, present in these signals. This work introduces a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model, aimed at improving the quality of intra-ventricular monophasic action potential (MAP) signal recordings. By constructing representations of clean signals from a dataset of 5706 time series from 42 patients diagnosed with ischemic cardiomyopathy, our approach demonstrates superior denoising performance when compared to conventional filtering methods commonly employed in clinical settings. We assess the effectiveness of our VAE model using various metrics, indicating its superior capability to denoise signals across different noise types, including time-varying non-linear noise frequently found in clinical settings. These results reveal that VAEs can eliminate diverse sources of noise in single beats, outperforming state-of-the-art denoising techniques and potentially improving treatment efficacy in cardiac EP.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal IoT Node for Energy-Efficient Environmental Monitoring with Edge AI Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has significantly advanced environmental monitoring (EM) by enabling cost-effective and scalable sensing solutions. Concurrently, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are introducing powerful tools for the efficient and accurate analysis of complex environmental data. However, current IoT platforms for environmental sensing are typically limited to a narrow set of sensors, preventing a comprehensive assessment of environmental conditions and lacking sufficient computational capabilities to support the deployment of advanced ML and AI algorithms on the edge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a compact (17x38 mm2), multi-modal, MCU-based environmental IoT node integrating 11 sensors, including CO2 concentration, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), light intensity, UV radiation, pressure, temperature, humidity, visual sensing via an RGB camera, and precise geolocation through a GNSS module. It features GAP9, a parallel ultra-low-power system-on-chip, enabling real-time, energy-efficient edge processing of advanced ML models directly on-device. We implemented a YOLOv5-based occupancy detection pipeline (0.3 M parameters, 42 MOP per inference), demonstrating 42% energy savings over raw data streaming. Additionally, we present a smart indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring setup that combines occupancy detection with adaptive sample rates, achieving operational times of up to 143 h on a single compact 600 mAh, 3.7 V battery.

      <title>Automated Vigilance State Classification in Rodents Using Machine Learning and Feature Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preclinical sleep research remains constrained by labor intensive, manual vigilance state classification and inter rater variability, limiting throughput and reproducibility. This study presents an automated framework developed by Team Neural Prognosticators to classify electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings of small rodents into three critical vigilance states paradoxical sleep (REM), slow wave sleep (SWS), and wakefulness. The system integrates advanced signal processing with machine learning, leveraging engineered features from both time and frequency domains, including spectral power across canonical EEG bands (delta to gamma), temporal dynamics via Maximum-Minimum Distance, and cross-frequency coupling metrics. These features capture distinct neurophysiological signatures such as high frequency desynchronization during wakefulness, delta oscillations in SWS, and REM specific bursts. Validated during the 2024 Big Data Health Science Case Competition (University of South Carolina Big Data Health Science Center, 2024), our XGBoost model achieved 91.5% overall accuracy, 86.8% precision, 81.2% recall, and an F1 score of 83.5%, outperforming all baseline methods. Our approach represents a critical advancement in automated sleep state classification and a valuable tool for accelerating discoveries in sleep science and the development of targeted interventions for chronic sleep disorders. As a publicly available code (BDHSC) resource is set to contribute significantly to advancements.</description>

      <title>Attention-Based Fusion of IQ and FFT Spectrograms with AoA Features for GNSS Jammer Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jamming devices disrupt signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and pose a significant threat by compromising the reliability of accurate positioning. Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors. Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth, and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>CQI-Based Interference Prediction for Link Adaptation in Industrial Sub-networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel interference prediction scheme to improve link adaptation (LA) in densely deployed industrial sub-networks (SNs) with high-reliability and low-latency communication (HRLLC) requirements. The proposed method aims to improve the LA framework by predicting and leveraging the heavy-tailed interference probability density function (pdf). Interference is modeled as a latent vector of available channel quality indicator (CQI), using a vector discrete-time state-space model (vDSSM) at the SN controller, where the CQI is subjected to compression, quantization, and delay-induced errors. To robustly estimate interference power values under these impairments, we employ a low-complexity, outlier-robust, sparse Student-t process regression (SPTPR) method. This is integrated into a modified unscented Kalman filter, which recursively refines predicted interference using CQI, enabling accurate estimation and compensating protocol feedback delays, crucial for accurate LA. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves over 10x lower complexity compared to a similar non-parametric baseline. It also maintains a BLER below the 90th percentile target of 1e-6 while delivering performance comparable to a state-of-the-art supervised technique using only CQI reports.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Generalization in PPG-Based Emotion Measurement with a CNN-TCN-LSTM Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human computer interaction has become integral to modern life, driven by advancements in machine learning technologies. Affective computing, in particular, has focused on systems that recognize, interpret, and respond to human emotions, often using wearable devices, which provide continuous data streams of physiological signals. Among various physiological signals, the photoplethysmogram (PPG) has gained prominence due to its ease of acquisition from widely available devices. However, the generalization of PPG-based emotion recognition models across individuals remains an unresolved challenge. This paper introduces a novel hybrid architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to address this issue. The proposed model integrates the strengths of these architectures to improve robustness and generalization. Raw PPG signals are fed into the CNN for feature extraction. These features are processed separately by LSTM and TCN. The outputs from these components are concatenated to generate a final feature representation, which serves as the input for classifying valence and arousal, the primary dimensions of emotion. Experiments using the Photoplethysmogram Dataset for Emotional Analysis (PPGE) demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model achieves better model generalization than standalone CNN and LSTM architectures. Our results show that the proposed solution outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN architecture, as well as a CNN-LSTM model, in emotion recognition tasks with PPG signals. Using metrics such as Area Under the Curve (AUC) and F1 Score, we highlight the model's effectiveness in handling subject variability.</description>

      <title>NeuroHD-RA: Neural-distilled Hyperdimensional Model with Rhythm Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel and interpretable framework for electrocardiogram (ECG)-based disease detection that combines hyperdimensional computing (HDC) with learnable neural encoding. Unlike conventional HDC approaches that rely on static, random projections, our method introduces a rhythm-aware and trainable encoding pipeline based on RR intervals, a physiological signal segmentation strategy that aligns with cardiac cycles. The core of our design is a neural-distilled HDC architecture, featuring a learnable RR-block encoder and a BinaryLinear hyperdimensional projection layer, optimized jointly with cross-entropy and proxy-based metric loss. This hybrid framework preserves the symbolic interpretability of HDC while enabling task-adaptive representation learning. Experiments on Apnea-ECG and PTB-XL demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional HDC and classical ML baselines, achieving 73.09\% precision and an F1 score of 0.626 on Apnea-ECG, with comparable robustness on PTB-XL. Our framework offers an efficient and scalable solution for edge-compatible ECG classification, with strong potential for interpretable and personalized health monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent spaces offer an efficient and effective means of summarizing data while implicitly preserving meta-information through relational encoding. We leverage these meta-embeddings to develop a modality-agnostic, unified encoder. Our method employs sensor-latent fusion to analyze and correlate multimodal physiological signals. Using a compressed sensing approach with autoencoder-based latent space fusion, we address the computational challenges of biosignal analysis on resource-constrained devices. Experimental results show that our unified encoder is significantly faster, lighter, and more scalable than modality-specific alternatives, without compromising representational accuracy.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Impedance Encoding-Decoding Method for Online Impedance Network Construction of Wind Farms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impedance network (IN) model is gaining popularity in the oscillation analysis of wind farms. However, the construction of such an IN model requires impedance curves of each wind turbine under their respective operating conditions, making its online application difficult due to the transmission of numerous high-density impedance curves. To address this issue, this paper proposes an AI-based impedance encoding-decoding method to facilitate the online construction of IN model. First, an impedance encoder is trained to compress impedance curves by setting the number of neurons much smaller than that of frequency points. Then, the compressed data of each turbine are uploaded to the wind farm and an impedance decoder is trained to reconstruct original impedance curves. At last, based on the nodal admittance matrix (NAM) method, the IN model of the wind farm can be obtained. The proposed method is validated via model training and real-time simulations, demonstrating that the encoded impedance vectors enable fast transmission and accurate reconstruction of the original impedance curves.</description>

      <title>Traffic Signal Phase and Timing Estimation with Large-Scale Floating Car Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective modern transportation systems depend critically on accurate Signal Phase and Timing (SPaT) estimation. However, acquiring ground-truth SPaT information faces significant hurdles due to communication challenges with transportation departments and signal installers. As a result, Floating Car Data (FCD) has become the primary source for large-scale SPaT analyses. Current FCD approaches often simplify the problem by assuming fixed schedules and basic intersection designs for specific times and locations. These methods fail to account for periodic signal changes, diverse intersection structures, and the inherent limitations of real-world data, thus lacking a comprehensive framework that is universally applicable. Addressing this limitation, we propose an industrial-grade FCD analysis suite that manages the entire process, from initial data preprocessing to final SPaT estimation. Our approach estimates signal phases, identifies time-of-day (TOD) periods, and determines the durations of red and green lights. The framework's notable stability and robustness across diverse conditions, regardless of road geometry, is a key feature. Furthermore, we provide a cleaned, de-identified FCD dataset and supporting parameters to facilitate future research. Currently operational within our navigation platform, the system analyses over 15 million FCD records daily, supporting over two million traffic signals in mainland China, with more than 75\% of estimations demonstrating less than five seconds of error.</description>

      <title>Boosted Enhanced Quantile Regression Neural Networks with Spatiotemporal Permutation Entropy for Complex System Prognostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for pattern prediction and system prognostics centered on Spatiotemporal Permutation Entropy analysis integrated with Boosted Enhanced Quantile Regression Neural Networks (BEQRNNs). We address the challenge of understanding complex dynamical patterns in multidimensional systems through an approach that combines entropy-based complexity measures with advanced neural architectures. The system leverages dual computational stages: first implementing spatiotemporal entropy extraction optimized for multiscale temporal and spatial data streams, followed by an integrated BEQRNN layer that enables probabilistic pattern prediction with uncertainty quantification. This architecture achieves 81.17% accuracy in spatiotemporal pattern classification with prediction horizons up to 200 time steps and maintains robust performance across diverse regimes. Field testing across chaotic attractors, reaction-diffusion systems, and industrial datasets shows a 79% increase in critical transition detection accuracy and 81.22% improvement in long-term prediction reliability. The framework's effectiveness in processing complex, multimodal entropy features demonstrates significant potential for real-time prognostic applications.</description>

      <title>UWB Radar-based Heart Rate Monitoring: A Transfer Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar technology presents untapped potential for continuous, contactless, and passive heart rate monitoring via consumer electronics like mobile phones. However the variety of available radar systems and lack of standardization means that a large new paired dataset collection is required for each radar system. This study demonstrates transfer learning between frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) and impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar systems, both increasingly integrated into consumer devices. FMCW radar utilizes a continuous chirp, while IR-UWB radar employs short pulses. Our mm-wave FMCW radar operated at 60 GHz with a 5.5 GHz bandwidth (2.7 cm resolution, 3 receiving antennas [Rx]), and our IR-UWB radar at 8 GHz with a 500 MHz bandwidth (30 cm resolution, 2 Rx). Using a novel 2D+1D ResNet architecture we achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.85 bpm and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.42% for heart rate monitoring with FMCW radar (N=119 participants, an average of 8 hours per participant). This model maintained performance (under 5 MAE/10% MAPE) across various body positions and heart rate ranges, with a 98.9% recall. We then fine-tuned a variant of this model, trained on single-antenna and single-range bin FMCW data, using a small (N=376, avg 6 minutes per participant) IR-UWB dataset. This transfer learning approach yielded a model with MAE 4.1 bpm and MAPE 6.3% (97.5% recall), a 25% MAE reduction over the IR-UWB baseline. This demonstration of transfer learning between radar systems for heart rate monitoring has the potential to accelerate its introduction into existing consumer devices.</description>

      <title>Explainable Parallel CNN-LSTM Model for Differentiating Ventricular Tachycardia from Supraventricular Tachycardia with Aberrancy in 12-Lead ECGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and Objective: Differentiating wide complex tachycardia (WCT) is clinically critical yet challenging due to morphological similarities in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals between life-threatening ventricular tachycardia (VT) and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy (SVT-A). Misdiagnosis carries fatal risks. We propose a computationally efficient deep learning solution to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide model interpretability for clinical deployment.
  Methods: A novel lightweight parallel deep architecture is introduced. Each pipeline processes individual ECG leads using two 1D-CNN blocks to extract local features. Feature maps are concatenated across leads, followed by LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies. Final classification employs fully connected layers. Explainability is achieved via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) for local/global interpretation. The model was evaluated on a 35-subject ECG database using standard performance metrics.
  Results: The model achieved $95.63\%$ accuracy ($95\%$ CI: $93.07-98.19\%$), with sensitivity=$95.10\%$, specificity=$96.06\%$, and F1-score=$95.12\%$. It outperformed state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and computational efficiency, requiring minimal CNN blocks per pipeline. SHAP analysis demonstrated clinically interpretable feature contributions.
  Conclusions: Our end-to-end framework delivers high-precision WCT classification with minimal computational overhead. The integration of SHAP enhances clinical trust by elucidating decision logic, supporting rapid, informed diagnosis. This approach shows significant promise for real-world ECG analysis tools.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Benchmark for Electrocardiogram Time-Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram~(ECG), a key bioelectrical time-series signal, is crucial for assessing cardiac health and diagnosing various diseases. Given its time-series format, ECG data is often incorporated into pre-training datasets for large-scale time-series model training. However, existing studies often overlook its unique characteristics and specialized downstream applications, which differ significantly from other time-series data, leading to an incomplete understanding of its properties. In this paper, we present an in-depth investigation of ECG signals and establish a comprehensive benchmark, which includes (1) categorizing its downstream applications into four distinct evaluation tasks, (2) identifying limitations in traditional evaluation metrics for ECG analysis, and introducing a novel metric; (3) benchmarking state-of-the-art time-series models and proposing a new architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed benchmark is comprehensive and robust. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed metric and model architecture, which establish a solid foundation for advancing research in ECG signal analysis.</description>

      <title>Toward intelligent wireless networks in computer chassis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Processing the exponentially growing amount of data produced daily requires efficient communication between different processing units in a computer. Traditionally, wired interconnects have been used to maintain these data links due to their energy efficiency and ability to support high data rates. However, as computing demands continue to increase in size and speed, these wired interconnects can become longer and less effective. One possible solution is to enhance the wired interconnects with short-range wireless communication (SRWC), which offers flexible resource allocation and the ability to broadcast data. However, implementing SRWC inside a computer chassis presents challenges due to multiple scattering. This scattering stretches the channel impulse response (CIR), leading to inter-symbol interference (ISI) and limiting data rates. To address this issue, we propose transforming the computer chassis into a smart radio environment by utilizing a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The RIS elements adjust the phase of reflected waves so that the multipath components combine at the receiver in a way that creates a pulse-like CIR. This approach has been experimentally validated within a typical computer chassis. The results of this study pave the way for integrating RIS-enabled SRWC to enhance wireless links in both current and future data processing units.</description>

      <title>System Design and Performance Analysis for RIS-assisted Terahertz Self-Alignment Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of Internet of Things(IoT) devices underscores the need for sustainable wireless solutions capable of simultaneously transferring both energy and information. Terahertz (THz) band-enabled simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems offer ultra-high data rates and expansive bandwidth. However, THz waves are inherently susceptible to severe path loss and beam misalignment due to their narrow-beam characteristics. In this context, this paper proposes a reconfigurable intelligent surface(RIS)-assisted transmitter architecture for the THz-SWIPT system, which enables end-to-end self-alignment for steady-state transmission. The proposed system incorporates phase conjugate circuits to achieve self-aligned beamforming, facilitating the dynamic tracking of mobile IoT devices without the need for beam training. Additionally, active amplification within the RIS arrays compensates for cascaded channel attenuation through an iterative power cycle, thereby enhancing the energy transmission efficiency. Theoretical models and simulations indicate that the proposed system significantly mitigates sidelobe interference, achieving a transmission efficiency of up to 73.26% over a 2 meter distance with self-alignment.</description>

      <title>Distributed Machine Learning Approach for Low-Latency Localization in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-latency localization is critical in cellular networks to support real-time applications requiring precise positioning. In this paper, we propose a distributed machine learning (ML) framework for fingerprint-based localization tailored to cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, an emerging architecture for 6G networks. The proposed framework enables each access point (AP) to independently train a Gaussian process regression model using local angle-of-arrival and received signal strength fingerprints. These models provide probabilistic position estimates for the user equipment (UE), which are then fused by the UE with minimal computational overhead to derive a final location estimate. This decentralized approach eliminates the need for fronthaul communication between the APs and the central processing unit (CPU), thereby reducing latency. Additionally, distributing computational tasks across the APs alleviates the processing burden on the CPU compared to traditional centralized localization schemes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed distributed framework achieves localization accuracy comparable to centralized methods, despite lacking the benefits of centralized data aggregation. Moreover, it effectively reduces uncertainty of the location estimates, as evidenced by the 95\% covariance ellipse. The results highlight the potential of distributed ML for enabling low-latency, high-accuracy localization in future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Advanced Space Mapping Technique Integrating a Shared Coarse Model for Multistate Tuning-Driven Multiphysics Optimization of Tunable Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces an advanced space mapping (SM) technique that applies a shared electromagnetic (EM)-based coarse model for multistate tuning-driven multiphysics optimization of tunable filters. The SM method combines the computational efficiency of EM single-physics simulations with the precision of multiphysics simulations. The shared coarse model is based on EM single-physics responses corresponding to various nontunable design parameters values. Conversely, the fine model is implemented to delineate the behavior of multiphysics responses concerning both nontunable and tunable design parameter values. The proposed overall surrogate model comprises multiple subsurrogate models, each consisting of one shared coarse model and two distinct mapping neural networks. The responses from the shared coarse model in the EM single-physics filed offer a suitable approximation for the fine responses in the multiphysics filed, whereas the mapping neural networks facilitate transition from the EM single-physics field to the multiphysics field. Each subsurrogate model maintains consistent nontunable design parameter values but possesses unique tunable design parameter values. By developing multiple subsurrogate models, optimization can be simultaneously performed for each tuning state. Nontunable design parameter values are constrained by all tuning states, whereas tunable design parameter values are confined to their respective tuning states. This optimization technique simultaneously accounts for all the tuning states to fulfill the necessary multiple tuning state requirements. Multiple EM and multiphysics training samples are generated concurrently to develop the surrogate model. Compared with existing direct multiphysics parameterized modeling techniques, our proposed method achieves superior multiphysics modeling accuracy with fewer training samples and reduced computational costs.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based translation between unpaired spontaneous premature neonatal EEG and fetal MEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and objective: Brain activity in premature newborns has traditionally been studied using electroencephalography (EEG), leading to substantial advances in our understanding of early neural development. However, since brain development takes root at the fetal stage, a critical window of this process remains largely unknown. The only technique capable of recording neural activity in the intrauterine environment is fetal magnetoencephalography (fMEG), but this approach presents challenges in terms of data quality and scarcity. Using artificial intelligence, the present research aims to transfer the well-established knowledge from EEG studies to fMEG to improve understanding of prenatal brain development, laying the foundations for better detection and treatment of potential pathologies. Methods: We developed an unpaired diffusion translation method based on dual diffusion bridges, which notably includes numerical integration improvements to obtain more qualitative results at a lower computational cost. Models were trained on our unpaired dataset of bursts of spontaneous activity from 30 high-resolution premature newborns EEG recordings and 44 fMEG recordings. Results: We demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvement upon previous results obtained with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by almost 5% on the mean squared error in the time domain, and completely eliminating the mode collapse problem in the frequency domain, thus achieving near-perfect signal fidelity. Conclusion: We set a new state of the art in the EEG-fMEG unpaired translation problem, as our developed tool completely paves the way for early brain activity analysis. Overall, we also believe that our method could be reused for other unpaired signal translation applications.</description>

      <title>Design of A New Multiple-Chirp-Rate Index Modulation for LoRa Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multiple chirp rate index modulation (MCR-IM) system based on Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences that overcomes the problems of low transmission rate and large-scale access in classical LoRa networks. We demonstrate the extremely low cross-correlation of MCR-IM signals across different spread factors, showing that the proposed MCR-IM system also inherits the characteristics of ZC sequences modulation. Moreover, we derive an approximate closed-form expression for the bit-error rate (BER) of the proposed MCR-IM system over Nakagami-m fading channels. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the derived closed-form expression and demonstrate that the MCR-IM system achieves higher levels of spectral efficiency (SE) compared to existing systems. In this context, assigning multiple chirp rates to each user results in a reduction in the number of parallel channels. To mitigate this issue, we propose a peak detection based successive interference cancellation (PD-SIC) algorithm to accommodate more users. Compared to orthogonal scatter chirp spreading spectrum system that names OrthoRa, the MCR-IM system with PD-SIC algorithm achieves lower BER levels. For a similar number of collision signals, the throughput of the MCR-IM system is enhanced by 16% to 21%. Owing to these advantages, the proposed MCR-IM is well suited for large-scale, high-rate LoRa network applications.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Minimization in UAV-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) capabilities are envisioned to play a pivotal role in future wireless networks due to their enhanced flexibility and efficiency. However, jointly optimizing UAV trajectory planning, multi-user communication, and target sensing under stringent resource constraints and time-critical conditions remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose an Age of Information (AoI)-centric UAV-ISAC system that simultaneously performs target sensing and serves multiple ground users, emphasizing information freshness as the core performance metric. We formulate a long-term average AoI minimization problem that jointly optimizes the UAV's flight trajectory and beamforming. To tackle the high-dimensional, non-convexity of this problem, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm capable of providing real-time decisions on UAV movement and beamforming for both radar sensing and multi-user communication. Specifically, a Kalman filter is employed for accurate target state prediction, regularized zero-forcing is utilized to mitigate inter-user interference, and the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm is applied for training the DRL agent on continuous actions. The proposed framework adaptively balances the trade-offs between sensing accuracy and communication quality. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently achieves lower average AoI compared to baseline approaches.</description>

      <title>Fast and Robust Stationary Crowd Counting with Commodity WiFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for estimating the size of seated crowds with commodity WiFi signals, by leveraging natural body fidgeting behaviors as a passive sensing cue. Departing from prior binary fidget representations, our approach leverages the bandwidth of the received signal as a finer-grained and robust indicator of crowd counts. More specifically, we propose a mathematical model that relates the probability density function (PDF) of the signal bandwidth to the crowd size, using a principled derivation based on the PDF of an individual's fidget-induced bandwidth. To characterize the individual fidgeting PDF, we use publicly available online videos, each of a seated individual, from which we extract body motion profiles using vision techniques, followed by a speed-to-bandwidth conversion inspired by Carson's Rule from analog FM radio design. Finally, to enhance robustness in real-world deployments where unrelated motions may occur nearby, we further introduce an anomaly detection module that filters out non-fidget movements. We validate our system through 42 experiments across two indoor environments with crowd sizes up to and including 13 people, achieving a mean absolute error of 1.04 and a normalized mean square error of 0.15, with an average convergence time of 51 seconds, significantly reducing the convergence time as compared to the state of the art. Additional simulation results demonstrate scalability to larger crowd sizes. Overall, our results show that our pipeline enables fast, robust, and highly accurate counting of seated crowds.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Network Performance and Resource Allocation in HAPS-UAV Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative approach by leveraging uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) as base stations (BSs) and a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) as the central processing unit (CPU) in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system for 6G networks. We explore the challenges, applications, and advantages of ISAC systems in next-generation networks, highlighting the significance of optimizing position and power control. Our approach integrates HAPS and UAVs to enhance wireless coverage, particularly in remote areas. UAVs function as dual-purpose access points (APs), using their maneuverability and line-of-sight (LoS) aerial-to-ground (A2G) links to transmit combined communication and sensing signals. The scheme operates in two time slots: in the first slot, UAVs transmit dedicated signals to communication users (CUs) and potential targets. UAVs detect targets in specific ground locations and, after signal transmission, receive reflected signals from targets. In the second slot, UAVs relay these signals to HAPS, which performs beamforming to align signals for each CU from various UAVs. UAVs decode information from HAPS and adjust transmissions to maximize the beam pattern efficiency toward the desired targets. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize both the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for CUs and the echo signal power from the targets. This is achieved by finding the optimal power allocation for CUs in each UAV, subject to constraints on the maximum total power in each UAV and the transmitted beam pattern gain. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in enhancing network performance, resource allocation, fairness, and system optimization. Using HAPS as the CPU, computational tasks are offloaded from UAVs, which conserves energy and improves network performance.</description>

      <title>Spatially tailored spin wave excitation for spurious-free, low-loss magnetostatic wave filters with ultra-wide frequency tunability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Yttrium iron garnet magnetostatic wave (MSW) radio frequency (RF) cavity filters are promising for sixth-generation (6G) communication systems due to their wide frequency tunability. However, the presence of severe spurious modes arising from the finite cavity dimensions severely degrades the filter performance. We present a half-cone transducer that spatially tailors spin wave excitation to selectively enhance the primary cavity modes comprising the MSW filter passband, while strongly suppressing the undesired spurious modes. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations and experiments verify the effectiveness of the spatially tailored technique. We utilize the half-cone transducer to demonstrate a spurious-free, single-cavity half-cone MSW filter (HC-MSWF) with an insertion loss (IL) of 2.4-3.2 dB over a frequency tuning range of 6.3-16.8 GHz. Extending our study, we further demonstrate a spurious-free, dual-cavity HC-MSWF with an unprecedented tuning range of 21.7 GHz (9.8-31.5 GHz) while maintaining a low IL of 2.9-3.8 dB. This significant advance in performance will enable highly reconfigurable and robust 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Propagation Channel Modeling for LEO Satellite Missions Using Ray-Tracing Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a high-resolution, ray-tracing-based channel modeling for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite-to-ground links in a suburban environment at X-band. Using simulations conducted in Wireless InSite, we develop a parametric channel model that characterizes both large- and small-scale fading effects across different satellite elevation angles. Large-scale fading incorporates attenuation due to terrain-induced shadowing and dynamic environmental factors such as weather conditions, and is compared with 3GPP NTN channel model. Additionally, we quantify link degradation resulting from ground station (GS) antenna misalignment, considering both fixed single-element and electronically steerable phased-array antennas. Small-scale fading is modeled by fitting a shadowed and non-shadowed Rician distribution to the fading statistics at various satellite elevations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to propose a comprehensive elevation-aware channel model for satellite-to-ground propagation at X-band, integrating ray-traced environmental dynamics, elevation-dependent fading, and phased-array beam misalignment effects.</description>

      <title>Movable-Element STARS-Aided Secure Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel movable-element (ME) enabled simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surface (ME-STARS)-aided secure communication system is investigated. Against the full-space eavesdropping, MEs are deployed at the STARS for enhancing the physical layer security by exploiting higher spatial degrees of freedom. Specifically, a sum secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the passive beamforming and the MEs positions at the ME-STARS, as well as the active beamforming at the base station. To solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem involving highly-coupled variables, an alternating optimization-based iterative algorithm is developed, decomposing the original problem into three subproblems. In particular, for the MEs position optimization subproblem, a gradient ascent algorithm is employed to iteratively refine the MEs' locations within the confined region. Moreover, the the active and passive beamforming subproblems are solved by employing successive convex approximation. Numerical results unveil that: 1) ME-STARS significantly improves the secrecy performance compared to the conventional STARS with fixed-position elements; and 2) The secrecy rate achieved by the ME-STARS gets saturated within limited movable region size.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna-based Communications: Spectral Efficiency Analysis and Deployment Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiple-waveguide pinching-antenna (PA)-based multi-user communication system is investigated. With a given number of PAs, two deployment strategies are considered, namely the centralized PA deployment, where all PAs are switched between waveguides to serve users in a time-division manner to avail of beamforming gain, and the distributed PA deployment, where a single PA is deployed on each waveguide to simultaneously serve multiple users by leveraging the multiplexing gain. The spectral efficiency (SE) achieved by each deployment strategy is analyzed: i) For the centralized deployment, the positioning strategy of PAs on each waveguide is determined first with the aim of maximizing the channel gain of the corresponding nearest served user. Based on this, the corresponding system SE is derived. ii) For the distributed deployment, the system SE under the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is first obtained. To obtain an analytically tractable form, the stationary phase method is utilized to approximate the system SE. The approximation result reveals that the average inter-user interference can be negligible with a large waveguide spacing and thus the simple MRT is appealing for PA-based multi-user communications. Furthermore, the system SEs achieved by the two strategies are compared in both the high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Our analysis suggests that at high SNRs, the distributed deployment is superior to achieve the maximal system SE, while the centralized deployment is more suitable for the low-SNR regime. Finally, the theoretical analysis is verified through simulations.</description>

      <title>Integrated Radio Sensing Capabilities for 6G Networks: AI/ML Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth-generation wireless communications (6G) is often labeled as "connected intelligence". Radio sensing, aligned with machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), promises, among other benefits, breakthroughs in the system's ability to perceive the environment and effectively utilize this awareness. This article offers a tutorial-style survey of AI and ML approaches to enhance the sensing capabilities of next-generation wireless networks. To this end, while staying in the framework of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), we expand the term "sensing" from radar, via spectrum sensing, to miscellaneous applications of radio sensing like non-cooperative transmitter localization. We formulate the problems, explain the state-of-the-art approaches, and detail AI-based techniques to tackle various objectives in the context of wireless sensing. We discuss the advantages, enablers, and challenges of integrating various sensing capabilities into an envisioned AI-powered multimodal multi-task network. In addition to the tutorial-style core of this work based on direct authors' involvement in 6G research problems, we review the related literature, and provide both a good start for those entering this field of research, and a topical overview for a general reader with a background in wireless communications</description>

      <title>Stabilization of the bias point in MZM modulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article mainly introduces the role of MZM in practical communication systems, the materials used to make MZM modulators such as lithium niobate, and its working principle. It also explains why it changes due to environmental factors. This leads to the introduction of a method that controls the stable points of MZM by algorithmically controlling the voltage, and the algorithm is verified through experiments. Finally, a summary and outlook on the future development of MZM are provided.</description>

      <title>Phase-optimised linearly-constrained minimum-variance beamformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel procedure for the determination of the optimal group-delay for a Linearly-Constrained Minimum-Variance (LCMV) beamformer is proposed. Two ways of selecting the optimal delay are recommended: the first is the solution that minimizes the noise power; the second is the solution that minimizes the processing delay. The potential of this hitherto unexplored degree of design freedom is explored using simulated Very-High-Frequency (VHF) communication, and Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) bistatic radar, applications.</description>

      <title>Jamming-Resistant AAV Communications: A Multichannel-Aided Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jamming cancellation is essential to reliable unmanned autonomous vehicle (AAV) communications in the presence of malicious jammers. In this paper, we develop a practical multichannel-aided jamming cancellation method to realize secure AAV communications. The proposed method is capable of simultaneously achieving timing/frequency synchronization as well as jamming cancellation. More importantly, our method does not need the signal's/jammer's channel state information. It only utilizes the knowledge of the legitimate sender's preamble sequence that is available in existing communication protocols. We also analyze the length of the preamble sequence required for successful synchronization and signal recovery. Experimental results on the built hardware platform show that, with a two-antenna receiver, the proposed method can successfully decode the signal of interest even when the jamming signal is $40$dB stronger than the communication signal.</description>

      <title>Latent-attention Based Transformer for Near ML Polar Decoding in Short-code Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer architectures have emerged as promising deep learning (DL) tools for modeling complex sequence-to-sequence interactions in channel decoding. However, current transformer-based decoders for error correction codes (ECCs) demonstrate inferior performance and generalization capabilities compared to conventional algebraic decoders, especially in short-code regimes. In this work, we propose a novel latent-attention based transformer (LAT) decoder for polar codes that addresses the limitations on performance and generalization through three pivotal innovations. First, we develop a latent-attention mechanism that supersedes the conventional self-attention mechanism. This architectural modification enables independent learning of the Query and Key matrices for code-aware attention computation, decoupling them from the Value matrix to emphasize position-wise decoding interactions while reducing context correlation interference. Second, we devise an advanced training framework incorporating three synergistic components: entropy-aware importance sampling that emphasizes low-probability regions in the signal constellation space, experience reflow that introduces empirical labels to improve characterization of decoding boundaries, and dynamic label smoothing for likelihood-based regularization. Third, we propose a code-aware mask scheme which allows dynamic adaptation for varying code configurations. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed LAT decoder achieves near maximum-likelihood (ML) performance in terms of both bit error rate (BER) and block error rate (BLER) for short-length polar codes. Furthermore, the architecture exhibits robust generalization capabilities across diverse code rates and code lengths.</description>

      <title>How Many Simultaneous Beamformers are Needed for Integrated Sensing and Communications?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a downlink integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system in which a base station employs linear beamforming to communicate to $K$ users, while simultaneously uses sensing beams to perform a sensing task of estimating $L$ real parameters. How many beamformers are needed to achieve the best performance for both sensing and communications? This paper establishes bounds on the minimum number of downlink beamformers, in which sensing performance is measured in terms of the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound for parameter estimation and communications performance is measured in terms of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios. We show that an ISAC system requires at most $K + \sqrt{\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$ beamformers if the remote users have the ability to cancel the interference caused by the sensing beams. If cancelling interference due to the sensing beams is not possible, the bound becomes $\sqrt{K^2 + \frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$. Interestingly, in the latter case, the bound on the number of beamformers is less than the sum of the bounds for each task individually. These results can be extended to sensing tasks for which the performance is measured as a function of $d$ quadratic terms in the beamformers. In this case, the bound becomes $K + \sqrt{d}$ and $\sqrt{K^2 + d}$, respectively. Specifically, for estimating complex path losses and angles-of-arrival of $N_\text{tr}$ targets while communicating to $K$ users, the bound on the minimum number of beamformers scales linearly in $K$ and in $N_\text{tr}$, assuming interference from sensing can be cancelled. When interference cancellation is not possible, the following exact characterization for the case of $N_\text{tr} = 1$ can be obtained: when $K=0$ or $1$, two beamformers should be used; when $K \ge 2$, exactly $K$ beamformers should be used, i.e., communication beamformers alone are already sufficient.</description>

      <title>PAPR Analysis for MIMO FTN Signaling with Gaussian Symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faster-than-Nyquist signaling serves as a promising solution for improving spectral efficiency in future generations of communications. However, its nature of fast acceleration brings highly overlapped pulses that lead to worse peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) performance. In this paper, we investigate the PAPR behavior of MIMO FTN using Gaussian symbols under optimal power allocation for two power constraints: fixed transmit power and fixed received signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR). Our findings reveal that PAPR is mainly determined by the acceleration factor and the power constraint, but power allocation optimization does not change the PAPR behavior for Gaussian signaling.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention Networks for Detecting Epilepsy from EEG Signals Using Accessible Hardware in Low-Resource Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goal: Epilepsy remains under-diagnosed in low-income countries due to scarce neurologists and costly diagnostic tools. We propose a graph-based deep learning framework to detect epilepsy from low-cost Electroencephalography (EEG) hardware, tested on recordings from Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau. Our focus is on fair, accessible automatic assessment and explainability to shed light on epilepsy biomarkers. Methods: We model EEG signals as spatio-temporal graphs, classify them, and identify interchannel relationships and temporal dynamics using graph attention networks (GAT). To emphasize connectivity biomarkers, we adapt the inherently node-focused GAT to analyze edges. We also designed signal preprocessing for low-fidelity recordings and a lightweight GAT architecture trained on Google Colab and deployed on RaspberryPi devices. Results: The approach achieves promising classification performance, outperforming a standard classifier based on random forest and graph convolutional networks in terms of accuracy and robustness over multiple sessions, but also highlighting specific connections in the fronto-temporal region. Conclusions: The results highlight the potential of GATs to provide insightful and scalable diagnostic support for epilepsy in underserved regions, paving the way for affordable and accessible neurodiagnostic tools.</description>

      <title>MEETI: A Multimodal ECG Dataset from MIMIC-IV-ECG with Signals, Images, Features and Interpretations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) plays a foundational role in modern cardiovascular care, enabling non-invasive diagnosis of arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, and conduction disorders. While machine learning has achieved expert-level performance in ECG interpretation, the development of clinically deployable multimodal AI systems remains constrained, primarily due to the lack of publicly available datasets that simultaneously incorporate raw signals, diagnostic images, and interpretation text. Most existing ECG datasets provide only single-modality data or, at most, dual modalities, making it difficult to build models that can understand and integrate diverse ECG information in real-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext ECG-Text-Image), the first large-scale ECG dataset that synchronizes raw waveform data, high-resolution plotted images, and detailed textual interpretations generated by large language models. In addition, MEETI includes beat-level quantitative ECG parameters extracted from each lead, offering structured parameters that support fine-grained analysis and model interpretability. Each MEETI record is aligned across four components: (1) the raw ECG waveform, (2) the corresponding plotted image, (3) extracted feature parameters, and (4) detailed interpretation text. This alignment is achieved using consistent, unique identifiers. This unified structure supports transformer-based multimodal learning and supports fine-grained, interpretable reasoning about cardiac health. By bridging the gap between traditional signal analysis, image-based interpretation, and language-driven understanding, MEETI established a robust foundation for the next generation of explainable, multimodal cardiovascular AI. It offers the research community a comprehensive benchmark for developing and evaluating ECG-based AI systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transceiver Design in Over-the-Air Federated Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation and growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the development of federated learning (FL). FL allows wireless devices (WDs) to cooperatively learn by sharing only local model parameters, without needing to share the entire dataset. However, the emergence of large AI models has made existing FL approaches inefficient, due to the significant communication overhead required. In this paper, we propose a novel over-the-air federated distillation (FD) framework by synergizing the strength of FL and knowledge distillation to avoid the heavy local model transmission. Instead of sharing the model parameters, only the WDs' model outputs, referred to as knowledge, are shared and aggregated over-the-air by exploiting the superposition property of the multiple-access channel. We shall study the transceiver design in over-the-air FD, aiming to maximize the learning convergence rate while meeting the power constraints of the transceivers. The main challenge lies in the intractability of the learning performance analysis, as well as the non-convex nature and the optimization spanning the whole FD training period. To tackle this problem, we first derive an analytical expression of the convergence rate in over-the-air FD. Then, the closed-form optimal solutions of the WDs' transmit power and the estimator for over-the-air aggregation are obtained given the receiver combining strategy. Accordingly, we put forth an efficient approach to find the optimal receiver beamforming vector via semidefinite relaxation. We further prove that there is no optimality gap between the original and relaxed problem for the receiver beamforming design. Numerical results will show that the proposed over-the-air FD approach achieves a significant reduction in communication overhead, with only a minor compromise in testing accuracy compared to conventional FL benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A Novel Domain-Aware CNN Architecture for Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based detector for faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling that employs structured fixed kernel layers with domain-informed masking to mitigate intersymbol interference (ISI). Unlike standard CNNs with sliding kernels, the proposed method utilizes fixed-position kernels to directly capture ISI effects at varying distances from the central symbol. A hierarchical filter allocation strategy is also introduced, assigning more filters to earlier layers for strong ISI patterns and fewer to later layers for weaker ones. This design improves detection accuracy while reducing redundant operations. Simulation results show that the detector achieves near-optimal bit error rate (BER) performance for $\tau \geq 0.7$, closely matching the BCJR algorithm, and offers computational gains of up to $46\%$ and $84\%$ over M-BCJR for BPSK and QPSK, respectively. Comparative analysis with other methods further highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of a fixed-kernel CNN architecture tailored for FTN detection in the literature.</description>

      <title>BEAM-Net: A Deep Learning Framework with Bone Enhancement Attention Mechanism for High Resolution High Frame Rate Ultrasound Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pocket-sized, low-cost point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) devices are increasingly used in musculoskeletal (MSK) applications for structural examination of bone tissue. However, the image quality in MSK ultrasound is often limited by speckle noise, low resolution, poor contrast, and anisotropic reflections, making bone images difficult to interpret without additional post-processing. Typically, medical ultrasound systems use delay and sum beamforming (DASB) for image reconstruction, which is not specifically optimized for bone structures. To address these limitations, we propose BEAM-Net, a novel end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) that performs high-frame-rate ultrasound beamforming with integrated bone enhancement, using single-plane-wave (SPW) radio frequency (RF) data as input. Our approach embeds a Bone Probability Map (BPM), which acts as an attention mechanism to enforce higher structural similarity around bony regions in the image. The proposed approach is the first of its kind to incorporate bone enhancement directly into ultrasound beamforming using deep learning. BEAM-Net was trained and evaluated on in-vivo MSK and synthetic RF ultrasound datasets. This paper introduces the Edge Preservation Index (EPI) as a new region-focused metric for evaluating structural fidelity in bone-enhanced ultrasound images. The performance of BEAM-Net was compared with conventional DASB and existing deep learning architectures using the EPI, Contrast Ratio (CR), Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR), Speckle Similarity Index (SSI), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). BEAM-Net showed substantial gains over SPW-DASB, achieving 51.4-51% higher CR and 94.2-73.3% higher SNR on in-vivo MSK and synthetic RF datasets. It outperformed multiple steered plane wave DASB (MPW-DASB), with 19.8-24.0% improvements in CR and SNR on in-vivo MSK and 2.5-12.8% improvements on synthetic data.</description>

      <title>EEG-based Epileptic Prediction via a Two-stage Channel-aware Set Transformer Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic, noncommunicable brain disorder, and sudden seizure onsets can significantly impact patients' quality of life and health. However, wearable seizure-predicting devices are still limited, partly due to the bulky size of EEG-collecting devices. To relieve the problem, we proposed a novel two-stage channel-aware Set Transformer Network that could perform seizure prediction with fewer EEG channel sensors. We also tested a seizure-independent division method which could prevent the adjacency of training and test data. Experiments were performed on the CHB-MIT dataset which includes 22 patients with 88 merged seizures. The mean sensitivity before channel selection was 76.4% with a false predicting rate (FPR) of 0.09/hour. After channel selection, dominant channels emerged in 20 out of 22 patients; the average number of channels was reduced to 2.8 from 18; and the mean sensitivity rose to 80.1% with an FPR of 0.11/hour. Furthermore, experimental results on the seizure-independent division supported our assertion that a more rigorous seizure-independent division should be used for patients with abundant EEG recordings.</description>

      <title>Robust ISAC Transceiver Beamforming Design under Low-Resolution AD/DA Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the robust beamforming design for an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system featuring low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Taking into account quantization noise, we aim at maximizing the radar signal-to-quantization-plus-noise ratio (SQNR) while guaranteeing the minimum required signal-to-quantization-plus-interference-plus-noise ratio (SQINR) for communication users. To address this nonconvex design problem, we first examine a scenario involving a point target and uniform-resolution DACs, where the globally optimal solution is obtained by applying the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. For more general scenarios, including those with mixed-DACs and/or an extended target, we develop a low-complexity majorization-minimization (MM)-based algorithm to tackle the problem iteratively. Compared to the non-robust algorithm, the proposed algorithm demonstrates improved detection performance under practical quantization. Simulation results confirm the robustness and efficacy of our proposed algorithm in low-resolution quantization scenarios.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we derive the distribution of a two-dimensional (complex) random walk in which the angle of each step is restricted to a subset of the circle. This setting appears in various domains, such as in over-the-air computation in signal processing. In particular, we derive the exact joint and marginal distributions for two steps, numerical solutions for a general number of steps, and approximations for a large number of steps. Furthermore, we provide an exact characterization of the support for an arbitrary number of steps. The results in this work provide a reference for future work involving such problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable-antennas (MAs) are revolutionizing spatial signal processing by providing flexible beamforming in next-generation wireless systems. This paper investigates an MA-empowered autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) system in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) for uplink data collection from ground users. We aim to maximize the sum achievable rate by jointly optimizing the AAV trajectory, receive beamforming, and MA positions. An efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that incorporates successive convex approximation, weighted minimum mean square error, and particle swarm optimization is developed. The analysis of the computational complexity and convergence features is provided. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior performance in terms of the sum achievable rate and the service reliability comparing to several benchmark schemes. These results demonstrate the distinctive advantages of the proposed scheme: enhanced spectral efficiency via adaptive beam-user alignment and improved collection reliability through spatial interference management, highlighting the implementation potential of the MA-empowered LAWNs.</description>

      <title>Sum-Rate Maximization for Movable-Antenna Array Enhanced Downlink NOMA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) systems have recently attracted significant attention in the field of wireless communications owing to their exceptional capability to proactively reconfigure wireless channels via flexible antenna movements. In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation design for an MA array-enhanced downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where a base station deploys multiple MAs to serve multiple single-antenna users. Our goal is to maximize the sum rate of all users by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming, positions of MAs, successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order, and users' corresponding decoding indicator matrix, while adhering to constraints on the maximum transmit power and finite MA moving region. The formulated problem is inherently highly non-convex, rendering it challenging to acquire a globally optimal solution. As a compromise, we propose a low-complexity two-stage optimization algorithm to obtain an effective suboptimal solution. Specifically, in stage one, the SIC decoding order is first determined by solving a channel gain maximization problem. Then, in stage two, with the given SIC decoding order, the beamforming vectors, MA positions, and users' decoding indicator matrix are iteratively optimized by capitalizing on alternating optimization, successive convex approximation (SCA), and genetic algorithm (GA). Simulation results unveil that the sum-rate performance of the proposed MA-enabled downlink NOMA system significantly outperforms that of conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems. Moreover, the results also show that the antenna position optimization in the proposed algorithm can further enhance the advantages of NOMA over space division multiple access (SDMA).</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS based Multiuser Uplink in Doubly-Spread Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless users with different characteristics will be expected to share spectrum in next generation communication networks. One of the great strengths of wireless networks based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is the ease with which different non-overlapping time-frequency (TF) resources can be allocated to different users by simply shifting each user's signal in time and frequency. However, a significant weaknesses of OFDM is the inflexibility of sub-carrier spacing. Since OFDM does not allow users to have different sub-carrier spacing, a single user subject to inter-carrier interference causes carrier spacing to increase for all users. Zak-OTFS is an alternative delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme, where, in contrast to OFDM, the Input-Output (I/O) relation is predictable. We match the strength of OFDM by designing a novel DD domain method of shaping the transmitted Zak-OTFS pulse on the uplink that enables flexible non-overlapping TF resource allocation. The base station (BS) receives a superposition of uplink signals and applies individual matched filters to obtain the data specific to individual users. We develop theoretical measures of interference between users, and present numerical simulations for a vehicular channel model representative of next generation propagation environments. We demonstrate single-user performance in a multiuser Zak-OTFS uplink system without needing to provision guard bands between TF resources allocated to different users. These performance results demonstrate that the benefits of a predictable Zak-OTFS waveform can be realized within an architecture for uplink communication.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna-enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing, Computing and Semantic Communication for Emerging Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for next-generation technologies. With high-frequency bands and large-scale antenna arrays, the Rayleigh distance extends, necessitating near-field (NF) models where waves are spherical. Although NF-ISAC improves both sensing and communication, it also poses challenges such as high data volume and potential privacy risks. To address these, we propose a novel framework: near-field integrated sensing, computing, and semantic communication (NF-ISCSC), which leverages semantic communication to transmit contextual information only, thereby reducing data overhead and improving efficiency. However, semantic communication is sensitive to channel variations, requiring adaptive mechanisms. To this end, fluid antennas (FAs) are introduced to support the NF-ISCSC system, enabling dynamic adaptability to changing channels. The proposed FA-enabled NF-ISCSC framework considers multiple communication users and extended targets comprising several scatterers. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize data rate while accounting for sensing quality, computational load, and power budget. Using an alternating optimization (AO) approach, the original problem is divided into three sub-problems: ISAC beamforming, FA positioning, and semantic extraction ratio. Beamforming is optimized using the successive convex approximation method. FA positioning is solved via a projected Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm, and the semantic extraction ratio is optimized using bisection search. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves higher data rates and better privacy preservation.</description>

      <title>Geophysics-informed neural network for model-based seismic inversion using surrogate point spread functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-based seismic inversion is a key technique in reservoir characterization, but traditional methods face significant limitations, such as relying on 1D average stationary wavelets and assuming an unrealistic lateral resolution. To address these challenges, we propose a Geophysics-Informed Neural Network (GINN) that integrates deep learning with seismic modeling. This novel approach employs a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to simultaneously estimate Point Spread Functions (PSFs) and acoustic impedance (IP). PSFs are divided into zero-phase and residual components to ensure geophysical consistency and to capture fine details. We used synthetic data from the SEAM Phase I Earth Model to train the GINN for 100 epochs (approximately 20 minutes) using a 2D UNet architecture. The network's inputs include positional features and a low-frequency impedance (LF-IP) model. A self-supervised loss function combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) was employed to ensure accurate results. The GINN demonstrated its ability to generate high-resolution IP and realistic PSFs, aligning with expected geological features. Unlike traditional 1D wavelets, the GINN produces PSFs with limited lateral resolution, reducing noise and improving accuracy. Future work will aim to refine the training process and validate the methodology with real seismic data.</description>

      <title>A Disentangled Representation Learning Framework for Low-altitude Network Coverage Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The expansion of the low-altitude economy has underscored the significance of Low-Altitude Network Coverage (LANC) prediction for designing aerial corridors. While accurate LANC forecasting hinges on the antenna beam patterns of Base Stations (BSs), these patterns are typically proprietary and not readily accessible. Operational parameters of BSs, which inherently contain beam information, offer an opportunity for data-driven low-altitude coverage prediction. However, collecting extensive low-altitude road test data is cost-prohibitive, often yielding only sparse samples per BS. This scarcity results in two primary challenges: imbalanced feature sampling due to limited variability in high-dimensional operational parameters against the backdrop of substantial changes in low-dimensional sampling locations, and diminished generalizability stemming from insufficient data samples. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a dual strategy comprising expert knowledge-based feature compression and disentangled representation learning. The former reduces feature space complexity by leveraging communications expertise, while the latter enhances model generalizability through the integration of propagation models and distinct subnetworks that capture and aggregate the semantic representations of latent features. Experimental evaluation confirms the efficacy of our framework, yielding a 7% reduction in error compared to the best baseline algorithm. Real-network validations further attest to its reliability, achieving practical prediction accuracy with MAE errors at the 5dB level.</description>

      <title>U-DREAM: Unsupervised Dereverberation guided by a Reverberation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the outcome of training state-ofthe-art dereverberation models with supervision settings ranging from weakly-supervised to fully unsupervised, relying solely on reverberant signals and an acoustic model for training. Most of the existing deep learning approaches typically require paired dry and reverberant data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. We develop instead a sequential learning strategy motivated by a bayesian formulation of the dereverberation problem, wherein acoustic parameters and dry signals are estimated from reverberant inputs using deep neural networks, guided by a reverberation matching loss. Our most data-efficient variant requires only 100 reverberation-parameter-labelled samples to outperform an unsupervised baseline, demonstrating the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method in low-resource scenarios.</description>

      <title>Fiduciary AI for the Future of Brain-Technology Interactions</title>

Abstract: Brain foundation models represent a new frontier in AI: instead of processing text or images, these models interpret real-time neural signals from EEG, fMRI, and other neurotechnologies. When integrated with brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), they may enable transformative applications-from thought controlled devices to neuroprosthetics-by interpreting and acting on brain activity in milliseconds. However, these same systems pose unprecedented risks, including the exploitation of subconscious neural signals and the erosion of cognitive liberty. Users cannot easily observe or control how their brain signals are interpreted, creating power asymmetries that are vulnerable to manipulation. This paper proposes embedding fiduciary duties-loyalty, care, and confidentiality-directly into BCI-integrated brain foundation models through technical design. Drawing on legal traditions and recent advancements in AI alignment techniques, we outline implementable architectural and governance mechanisms to ensure these systems act in users' best interests. Placing brain foundation models on a fiduciary footing is essential to realizing their potential without compromising self-determination.</description>

      <title>Spatial-Temporal Transformer with Curriculum Learning for EEG-Based Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition plays an important role in developing adaptive brain-computer communication systems, yet faces two fundamental challenges in practical implementations: (1) effective integration of non-stationary spatial-temporal neural patterns, (2) robust adaptation to dynamic emotional intensity variations in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes SST-CL, a novel framework integrating spatial-temporal transformers with curriculum learning. Our method introduces two core components: a spatial encoder that models inter-channel relationships and a temporal encoder that captures multi-scale dependencies through windowed attention mechanisms, enabling simultaneous extraction of spatial correlations and temporal dynamics from EEG signals. Complementing this architecture, an intensity-aware curriculum learning strategy progressively guides training from high-intensity to low-intensity emotional states through dynamic sample scheduling based on a dual difficulty assessment. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various emotional intensity levels, with ablation studies confirming the necessity of both architectural components and the curriculum learning mechanism.</description>

      <title>Information Theoretic Analysis of a Dual-Band MIMO Cellphone Antenna with ANSYS HFSS SBR+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Historically, the design of antenna arrays has evolved separately from Shannon theory. Shannon theory adopts a probabilistic approach in the design of communication systems, while antenna design approaches have relied on the deterministic Maxwell theory alone. In this paper, we investigate an information-theoretic analysis approach which we apply to evaluate the design of a dual-band, dual-polarized multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) array on a cellphone. To this end, we use ANSYS HFSS, a commercial electromagnetic (EM) simulation software suitable for the numerical optimization of antenna systems. HFSS is used to obtain an accurate model of the cellphone MIMO antenna array and HFSS SBR+ is utilized to obtain channel matrices for a large number of users. Taking advantage of linear and optimal processing at the cellphone, we estimate the outage probability curves. The curves are then used to determine the diversity gain in a moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime and the multiplexing gain at a high SNR regime. This approach is then compared with the method of estimating the diversity gain from the envelope correlation coefficients or the beam-coupling matrix showing substantial differences in the two methodologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers uplink asynchronous massive machine-type communications, where a large number of low-power and low-cost devices asynchronously transmit short packets to an access point equipped with multiple receive antennas. If orthogonal preambles are employed, massive collisions will occur due to the limited number of orthogonal preambles given the preamble sequence length. To address this problem, we propose a delay-calibrated joint user activity detection, channel estimation, and data detection algorithm, and investigate the benefits of oversampling in estimating continuous-valued time delays at the receiver. The proposed algorithm is based on the expectation-maximization method, which alternately estimates the delays and detects active users and their channels and data by noting that the collided users have different delays. Under the Bayesian inference framework, we develop a computationally efficient iterative algorithm using the approximate message passing principle to resolve the joint user activity detection, channel estimation, and data detection problem. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of the normalized mean-squared errors of channel and data symbols, and the probability of misdetection.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Resilience Against Jamming Attacks: A Cooperative Anti-Jamming Method Using Direction Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent vulnerability of wireless communication necessitates strategies to enhance its security, particularly in the face of jamming attacks. This paper uses the collaborations of multiple sensing nodes (SNs) in the wireless network to present a cooperative anti-jamming approach (CAJ) designed to neutralize the impact of jamming attacks. We propose an eigenvector (EV) method to estimate the direction of the channel vector from pilot symbols. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that with an adequate number of pilot symbols, the performance of the proposed EV method is comparable to the scenario where the perfect channel state information (CSI) is utilized. Both analytical formulas and simulations illustrate the excellent performance of the proposed EV-CAJ under strong jamming signals. Considering severe jamming, the proposed EV-CAJ method exhibits only a 0.7 dB degradation compared to the case without jamming especially when the number of SNs is significantly larger than the number of jamming nodes (JNs). Moreover, the extension of the proposed method can handle multiple jammers at the expense of degrees of freedom (DoF). We also investigate the method's ability to remain robust in fast-fading channels with different coherence times. Our proposed approach demonstrates good resilience, particularly when the ratio of the channel's coherence time to the time frame is small. This is especially important in the case of mobile jammers with large Doppler shifts.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Communications and Sensing Simultaneously by Zero-Order Optimization of MTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurface (MTS) comprises an array of metaatoms, each reflecting and inducing a phase shift into the incident wireless signal. We seek the optimal combination of phase shifts across all the meta-atoms to maximize the channel strength from transmitter to receiver. Unlike many existing works that heavily rely on channel state information (CSI), this paper proposes a statistical approach to the phase shift optimization in the absence of CSI, namely blind configuration or zero-order optimization. The main idea is to extract the key features of the wireless environment from the received signal strength (RSS) data via conditional sample mean, with provable performance. Furthermore, as a windfall profit, we show that the proposed blind configuration method has a nontrivial connection to phase retrieval which can be utilized for active sensing. In a nutshell, by configuring a pair of MTSs blindly without channel estimation, we not only enhance the channel strength to facilitate wireless communication, but also enable receiver to localize transmitter. All we need is the RSS data that can be readily measured at receiver. Our algorithm is verified in prototype systems in the 2.6 GHz spectral band. As shown in field tests, the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarks (e.g., MUSIC) in the active sensing task, and in the meanwhile raises the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) significantly by about 10 dB.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models for CLP Speech Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for cleft lip and palate (CLP) detection and severity classification. In CLP, nasalization increases with severity due to the abnormal passage between the oral and nasal tracts; this causes oral stops to be replaced by glottal stops and alters formant trajectories and vowel space. Since foundation models are trained for grapheme prediction or long-term quantized representation prediction, they may better discriminate CLP severity when fine-tuned on domain-specific data. We conduct experiments on two datasets: English (NMCPC) and Kannada (AIISH). We perform a comparative analysis using embeddings from self-supervised models Wav2Vec2 and WavLM, and the weakly supervised Whisper, each paired with SVM classifiers, and compare them with traditional handcrafted features eGeMAPS and ComParE. Finally, we fine-tune the best-performing Whisper model using PEFT techniques: Low-Rank Adapter (LoRA) and Decomposed Low-Rank Adapter (DoRA). Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves relative improvements of 26.4% and 63.4% in macro-average F1 score over the best foundation model and handcrafted feature baselines on the NMCPC dataset, and improvements of 6.1% and 52.9% on the AIISH dataset, respectively.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Antenna Arrays With Tunable Loads: Expanding Solution Space via Coupling Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging reconfigurable antenna (RA) array technology promises capacity enhancement through dynamic antenna positioning. Traditional approaches enforce half-wavelength or greater spacing among RA elements to avoid mutual coupling, limiting the solution space. Additionally, achieving sufficient spatial channel sampling requires numerous discrete RA positions (ports), while high-frequency scenarios with hybrid processing demand many physical RAs to maintain array gains. This leads to exponential growth in the solution space. We propose two techniques to address the former challenge: (1) surrounding a limited number of active RAs with passive ones terminated to tunable analog loads to \textit{exploit} mutual coupling and increase array gain, and (2) employing tunable loads on each RA in an all-active design to \textit{eliminate} mutual coupling in the analog domain. Both methods enable arbitrary RA spacing, unlocking the full solution space. Regarding the latter challenge, we develop greedy and meta-heuristic port selection algorithms, alongside low-complexity heuristic variants, that efficiently handle over $10^{20}$ array configurations, and optimize the loading values to maximize the sum-rate in a multiple-input single-output broadcast channel under transmission power constraints, assuming a heuristic linear precoder. Furthermore, we analyze performance degradation from quantized loads and propose corresponding robust designs. Numerical simulations reveal significant performance gains over benchmarks and provide valuable insights.</description>

      <title>Explainable Artificial Intelligence based Soft Evaluation Indicator for Arc Fault Diagnosis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel AI-based arc fault diagnosis models have demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of classification accuracy. However, an inherent problem is whether these models can actually be trusted to find arc faults. In this light, this work proposes a soft evaluation indicator that explains the outputs of arc fault diagnosis models, by defining the the correct explanation of arc faults and leveraging Explainable Artificial Intelligence and real arc fault experiments. Meanwhile, a lightweight balanced neural network is proposed to guarantee competitive accuracy and soft feature extraction score. In our experiments, several traditional machine learning methods and deep learning methods across two arc fault datasets with different sample times and noise levels are utilized to test the effectiveness of the soft evaluation indicator. Through this approach, the arc fault diagnosis models are easy to understand and trust, allowing practitioners to make informed and trustworthy decisions.</description>

      <title>Learning to Gridize: Segment Physical World by Wireless Communication Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gridization, the process of partitioning space into grids where users share similar channel characteristics, serves as a fundamental prerequisite for efficient large-scale network optimization. However, existing methods like Geographical or Beam Space Gridization (GSG or BSG) are limited by reliance on unavailable location data or the flawed assumption that similar signal strengths imply similar channel properties. We propose Channel Space Gridization (CSG), a pioneering framework that unifies channel estimation and gridization for the first time. Formulated as a joint optimization problem, CSG uses only beam-level reference signal received power (RSRP) to estimate Channel Angle Power Spectra (CAPS) and partition samples into grids with homogeneous channel characteristics. To perform CSG, we develop the CSG Autoencoder (CSG-AE), featuring a trainable RSRP-to-CAPS encoder, a learnable sparse codebook quantizer, and a physics-informed decoder based on the Localized Statistical Channel Model. On recognizing the limitations of naive training scheme, we propose a novel Pretraining-Initialization-Detached-Asynchronous (PIDA) training scheme for CSG-AE, ensuring stable and effective training by systematically addressing the common pitfalls of the naive training paradigm. Evaluations reveal that CSG-AE excels in CAPS estimation accuracy and clustering quality on synthetic data. On real-world datasets, it reduces Active Mean Absolute Error (MAE) by 30\% and Overall MAE by 65\% on RSRP prediction accuracy compared to salient baselines using the same data, while improving channel consistency, cluster sizes balance, and active ratio, advancing the development of gridization for large-scale network optimization.</description>

      <title>DWTGS: Rethinking Frequency Regularization for Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Federated Split Learning with Improved Communication and Storage Efficiency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is one of the popular distributed machine learning (ML) solutions but incurs significant communication and computation costs at edge devices. Federated split learning (FSL) can train sub-models in parallel and reduce the computational burden of edge devices by splitting the model architecture. However, it still requires a high communication overhead due to transmitting the smashed data and gradients between clients and the server in every global round. Furthermore, the server must maintain separate partial models for every client, leading to a significant storage requirement. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel communication and storage efficient federated split learning method, termed CSE-FSL, which utilizes an auxiliary network to locally update the weights of the clients while keeping a single model at the server, hence avoiding frequent transmissions of gradients from the server and greatly reducing the storage requirement of the server. Additionally, a new model update method of transmitting the smashed data in selected epochs can reduce the amount of smashed data sent from the clients. We provide a theoretical analysis of CSE-FSL, rigorously guaranteeing its convergence under non-convex loss functions. The extensive experimental results further indicate that CSE-FSL achieves a significant communication reduction over existing FSL solutions using real-world FL tasks.</description>

      <title>The Capacity of Semantic Private Information Retrieval with Colluding Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of semantic private information retrieval (Sem-PIR) with $T$ colluding servers (Sem-TPIR), i.e., servers that collectively share user queries. In Sem-TPIR, the message sizes are different, and message retrieval probabilities by any user are not uniform. This is a generalization of the classical PIR problem where the message sizes are equal and message retrieval probabilities are identical. The earlier work on Sem-PIR considered the case of no collusions, i.e., the collusion parameter of $T=1$. In this paper, we consider the general problem for arbitrary $T &lt; N$. We find an upper bound on the retrieval rate and design a scheme that achieves this rate, i.e., we derive the exact capacity of Sem-TPIR.</description>

      <title>Recursive and non-recursive filters for sequential smoothing and prediction with instantaneous phase and frequency estimation applications (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07089v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple procedure for the design of recursive digital filters with an infinite impulse response (IIR) and non-recursive digital filters with a finite impulse response (FIR) is described. The fixed-lag smoothing filters are designed to track an approximately polynomial signal of specified degree without bias at steady state, while minimizing the gain of high-frequency (coloured) noise with a specified power spectral density. For the IIR variant, the procedure determines the optimal lag (i.e. the passband group delay) yielding a recursive low-complexity smoother of low order, with a specified bandwidth, and excellent passband phase linearity. The filters are applied to the problem of instantaneous frequency estimation, e.g. for Doppler-shift measurement, for a complex exponential with polynomial phase progression in additive white noise. For this classical problem, simulations show that the incorporation of a prediction filter (with a one-sample lead) reduces the incidence of (phase or frequency) angle unwrapping errors, particularly for signals with high rates of angle change, which are known to limit the performance of standard FIR estimators at low SNR. This improvement allows the instantaneous phase of low-frequency signals to be estimated, e.g. for time-delay measurement, and/or the instantaneous frequency of frequency-modulated signals, down to a lower SNR. In the absence of unwrapping errors, the error variance of the IIR estimators (with the optimal phase lag) reaches the FIR lower bound, at a significantly lower computational cost. Guidelines for configuring and tuning both FIR and IIR filters are provided.</description>

      <title>Constant Modulus Waveform Design with Space-Time Sidelobe Reduction for DFRC Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18951v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) is a key enabler of location-based services for next-generation communication systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing constant modulus waveforms for DFRC systems. We consider the joint optimization of the spatial beam pattern and space-time correlation levels for better separating multiple targets in different angle and delay bins. In particular, we use the space-time correlation function to quantify the correlations between different angle and delay bins and formulate integrated sidelobe levels (ISLs). To serve communication users, we employ constructive interference (CI)-based precoding to modulate information symbols, which leverages distortion induced by multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) and radar transmission. We propose two solution algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and majorization-minimization (MM) principles, which are effective for small and large block sizes, respectively. The proposed ADMM-based solution decomposes the nonconvex formulated problem into multiple tractable subproblems, each of which admits a closed-form solution. To accelerate convergence of the MM-based solution, we propose a novel majorizing function for complex quadratic functions. After majorization, we decompose the approximated problem into independent subproblems for parallelization, mitigating the complexity that increases with block size. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in comparison to the existing DFRC algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods can substantially enhance the detection and estimation performance due to reduced space-time correlation levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming 6G mobile communication standard will offer a revolutionary new feature: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) reuses mobile communication signals to realize multi-static radar for various applications including localization. Consequently, applied ISAC propagation research necessitates to evolve from classical monostatic radar cross section (RCS) measurement of static targets on to bistatic radar reflectivity characterization of dynamic objects. Here, we introduce our Bistatic Radar (BIRA) measurement facility for independent spherical positioning of two probes with sub-millimeter accuracy on a diameter of up to 7 m and with almost continuous frequency coverage from 0.7 up to 260 GHz. Currently, BIRA is the only bistatic measurement facility capable of unrestricted ISAC research: In addition to vector network analysis, it employs advanced wideband transceiver technology with an instantaneous bandwidth of up to 4 GHz. These transceivers grant BIRA the unique capability to characterize dynamic targets in both Doppler and range, while also significantly accelerating measurements on static objects. Additionally, the installation is capable of spherical near-field antenna measurements over these wide frequency ranges.</description>

      <title>THz Channels for Short-Range Mobile Networks: Multipath Channel Behavior and Human Body Shadowing Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The THz band (0.1-10 THz) is emerging as a crucial enabler for sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication systems, overcoming the limitations of current technologies and unlocking new opportunities for low-latency and ultra-high-speed communications by utilizing several tens of GHz transmission bandwidths. However, extremely high spreading losses and various interaction losses pose significant challenges to establishing reliable communication coverage, while human body shadowing further complicates maintaining stable communication links. Although point-to-point (P2P) fixed wireless access in the THz band has been successfully demonstrated, realizing fully mobile and reliable wireless access via highly directional communication remains a challenge. This paper addresses the key challenges faced by THz mobile networks, focusing particularly on the behavior of multipath channels and the impact of human body shadowing (HBS). It presents the environment-dependent characteristics of multipath clusters through empirical measurements at 300~GHz using a consistent setup, highlighting the need to account for environmental factors in system design. In addition, it presents a motion capture-based approach for precise measurement and prediction of HBS to enable proactive path scheduling and enhances link reliability, offering key insights for robust THz communication systems in future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Fluid Antenna System for Wireless Communications: Design, Modeling, Algorithm, Fabrication, and Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19643v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the concept, design, channel modeling, beamforming algorithm development, prototype fabrication, and experimental measurement of an electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna system (ER-FAS), in which each FAS array element features electromagnetic (EM) reconfigurability. Unlike most existing FAS works that investigate spatial reconfigurability by adjusting the position and/or orientation of array elements, the proposed ER-FAS enables direct control over the EM characteristics of each element, allowing for dynamic radiation pattern reconfigurability. Specifically, a novel ER-FAS architecture leveraging software-controlled fluidics is proposed, and corresponding wireless channel models are established. Based on this ER-FAS channel model, a low-complexity greedy beamforming algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the analog phase shift and the radiation state of each array element. The accuracy of the ER-FAS channel model and the effectiveness of the beamforming algorithm are validated through (i) full-wave EM simulations and (ii) numerical spectral efficiency evaluations. These results confirm that the proposed ER-FAS significantly enhances spectral efficiency in both near-field and far-field scenarios compared to conventional antenna arrays. To further validate this design, we fabricate prototypes for both the ER-FAS element and array, using Galinstan liquid metal alloy, fluid silver paste, and software-controlled fluidic channels. The simulation results are experimentally validated through prototype measurements conducted in an anechoic chamber. Additionally, several indoor communication experiments using a pair of software-defined radios demonstrate the superior received power and bit error rate performance of the ER-FAS prototype.</description>

Abstract: With low-altitude economies emerging as a pivotal sector, this study explores an integrated sensing, communication, and computation system over low-altitude wireless networks. A full-duplex autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) operates as an AAV-enabled low-altitude platform (ALAP), concurrently executing data transmission, target sensing, and mobile edge computing services. To minimize systemic energy consumption under sensing beampattern constraints and computational demands, we formulate an optimization problem coordinating task allocation, computation resource allocation, and transmit/receive beamforming. Given the non-convexity and highly variable coupling, an efficient iterative convex approximation framework based on alternating optimization decomposes the problem into tractable subproblems. Moreover, the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm are rigorously analyzed. Simulations verify up to 54.12\% energy savings versus benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Targeting integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in future 6G radio access networks (RANs), this paper presents a novel device-free localization (DFL) framework based on distributed antenna networks (DANs). In the proposed approach, radio tomographic imaging (RTI) leverages the spatial and temporal diversity of multi-link multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels in DANs to achieve accurate localization. Furthermore, a prototype system was developed using software-defined radios (SDRs) operating in the sub-6 GHz band, and comprehensive evaluations were conducted under indoor conditions involving varying node densities and target types. The results demonstrate that the framework achieves sub-meter localization accuracy in most scenarios and maintains robust performance under complex multipath environments. In addition, the use of Bayesian optimization to fine-tune key parameters, such as sparsity and path thickness, led to significant improvements in image reconstruction quality and target estimation accuracy. These results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of DAN-based DFL as a scalable and infrastructure-compatible ISAC solution, capable of delivering accurate, passive localization without dedicated sensing hardware.</description>

      <title>A Smooshed BMOCZ Zero Constellation for CFO Estimation Without Channel Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (BMOCZ) zero constellation, which we call smooshed binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (SBMOCZ), to address carrier frequency offset (CFO)-induced zero rotation without depending on channel coding. In our approach, we modify the phase mapping of Huffman BMOCZ by shrinking the angle between adjacent zeros, except for the first and last, to introduce a gap in the zero constellation. By discerning the gap location in the received polynomial, the receiver can estimate and correct the phase rotation. We demonstrate the error rate performance of SBMOCZ relative to Huffman BMOCZ, showing that SBMOCZ addresses a CFO-induced rotation at the cost of a modest performance reduction compared to Huffman BMOCZ in the absence of a CFO. Finally, we compare SBMOCZ to Huffman BMOCZ using a cyclically permutable code (CPC), showing a 4 dB bit error rate (BER) improvement in a fading channel, while demonstrating comparable performance across other simulations.</description>

      <title>The Perception of Phase Intercept Distortion and its Application in Data Augmentation</title>

Abstract: Phase distortion refers to the alteration of the phase relationships between frequencies in a signal, which can be perceptible. In this paper, we discuss a special case of phase distortion known as phase-intercept distortion, which is created by a frequency-independent phase shift. We hypothesize that, though this form of distortion changes a signal's waveform significantly, the distortion is imperceptible. Human-subject experiment results are reported which are consistent with this hypothesis. Furthermore, we discuss how the imperceptibility of phase-intercept distortion can be useful for machine learning, specifically for data augmentation. We conducted multiple experiments using phase-intercept distortion as a novel approach to data augmentation, and obtained improved results for audio machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Achieving Robust Channel Estimation Neural Networks by Designed Training Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channel estimation is crucial in wireless communications. However, in many papers neural networks are frequently tested by training and testing on one example channel or similar channels. This is because data-driven methods often degrade on new data which they are not trained on, as they cannot extrapolate their training knowledge. This is despite the fact physical channels are often assumed to be time-variant. However, due to the low latency requirements and limited computing resources, neural networks may not have enough time and computing resources to execute online training to fine-tune the parameters. This motivates us to design offline-trained neural networks that can perform robustly over wireless channels, but without any actual channel information being known at design time. In this paper, we propose design criteria to generate synthetic training datasets for neural networks, which guarantee that after training the resulting networks achieve a certain mean squared error (MSE) on new and previously unseen channels. Therefore, trained neural networks require no prior channel information or parameters update for real-world implementations. Based on the proposed design criteria, we further propose a benchmark design which ensures intelligent operation for different channel profiles. To demonstrate general applicability, we use neural networks with different levels of complexity to show that the generalization achieved appears to be independent of neural network architecture. From simulations, neural networks achieve robust generalization to wireless channels with both fixed channel profiles and variable delay spreads.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Semantic-Bit Coexisting Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11693</link>

Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) is emerging as a key technology for future sixth-generation (6G) systems. Unlike traditional bit-level communication (BitCom), SemCom directly optimizes performance at the semantic level, leading to superior communication efficiency. Nevertheless, the task-oriented nature of SemCom renders it challenging to completely replace BitCom. Consequently, it is desired to consider a semantic-bit coexisting communication system, where a base station (BS) serves SemCom users (sem-users) and BitCom users (bit-users) simultaneously. Such a system faces severe and heterogeneous inter-user interference. In this context, this paper provides a new semantic-bit coexisting communication framework and proposes a spatial beamforming scheme to accommodate both types of users. Specifically, we consider maximizing the semantic rate for semantic users while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements for bit-users. Due to the intractability of obtaining the exact closed-form expression of the semantic rate, a data driven method is first applied to attain an approximated expression via data fitting. With the resulting complex transcendental function, majorization minimization (MM) is adopted to convert the original formulated problem into a multiple-ratio problem, which allows fractional programming (FP) to be used to further transform the problem into an inhomogeneous quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQP) problem. Solving the problem leads to a semi-closed form solution with undetermined Lagrangian factors that can be updated by a fixed point algorithm. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed beamforming scheme significantly outperforms conventional beamforming algorithms such as zero-forcing (ZF), maximum ratio transmission (MRT), and weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE).</description>

      <title>CP-OFDM Achieves the Lowest Average Ranging Sidelobe Under QAM/PSK Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to answer a fundamental question in the area of Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC): What is the optimal communication-centric ISAC waveform for ranging? Towards that end, we first established a generic framework to analyze the sensing performance of communication-centric ISAC waveforms built upon orthonormal signaling bases and random data symbols. Then, we evaluated their ranging performance by adopting both the periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF), and defined the expectation of the integrated sidelobe level (EISL) as a sensing performance metric. On top of that, we proved that among all communication waveforms with cyclic prefix (CP), the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is the only globally optimal waveform that achieves the lowest ranging sidelobe for quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and phase shift keying (PSK) constellations, in terms of both the EISL and the sidelobe level at each individual lag of the P-ACF. As a step forward, we proved that among all communication waveforms without CP, OFDM is a locally optimal waveform for QAM/PSK in the sense that it achieves a local minimum of the EISL of the A-ACF. Finally, we demonstrated by numerical results that under QAM/PSK constellations, there is no other orthogonal communication-centric waveform that achieves a lower ranging sidelobe level than that of the OFDM, in terms of both P-ACF and A-ACF cases.</description>

      <title>Semantics-Guided Diffusion for Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding in Wireless Image Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Joint source-channel coding (JSCC) offers a promising avenue for enhancing transmission efficiency by jointly incorporating source and channel statistics into the system design. A key advancement in this area is the deep joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC) technique that designs a direct mapping of input signals to channel symbols parameterized by a neural network, which can be trained for arbitrary channel models and semantic quality metrics. This paper advances the DeepJSCC framework toward a semantics-aligned, high-fidelity transmission approach, called semantics-guided diffusion DeepJSCC (SGD-JSCC). Existing schemes that integrate diffusion models (DMs) with JSCC face challenges in transforming random generation into accurate reconstruction and adapting to varying channel conditions. SGD-JSCC incorporates two key innovations: (1) utilizing some inherent information that contributes to the semantics of an image, such as text description or edge map, to guide the diffusion denoising process; and (2) enabling seamless adaptability to varying channel conditions with the help of a semantics-guided DM for channel denoising. The DM is guided by diverse semantic information and integrates seamlessly with DeepJSCC. In a slow fading channel, SGD-JSCC dynamically adapts to the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) directly estimated from the channel output, thereby eliminating the need for additional pilot transmissions for channel estimation. In a fast fading channel, we introduce a training-free denoising strategy, allowing SGD-JSCC to effectively adjust to fluctuations in channel gains. Numerical results demonstrate that, guided by semantic information and leveraging the powerful DM, our method outperforms existing DeepJSCC schemes, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Smarter Together: Combining Large Language Models and Small Models for Physiological Signals Visual Inspection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in visually interpreting medical time-series data. However, their general-purpose design can limit domain-specific precision, and the proprietary nature of many models poses challenges for fine-tuning on specialized clinical datasets. Conversely, small specialized models (SSMs) offer strong performance on focused tasks but lack the broader reasoning needed for complex medical decision-making. To address these complementary limitations, we introduce \ConMIL{} (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a novel decision-support framework distinctively synergizes three key components: (1) a new Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mechanism, QTrans-Pooling, designed for per-class interpretability in identifying clinically relevant physiological signal segments; (2) conformal prediction, integrated with MIL to generate calibrated, set-valued outputs with statistical reliability guarantees; and (3) a structured approach for these interpretable and uncertainty-quantified SSM outputs to enhance the visual inspection capabilities of LLMs. Our experiments on arrhythmia detection and sleep stage classification demonstrate that \ConMIL{} can enhance the accuracy of LLMs such as ChatGPT4.0, Qwen2-VL-7B, and MiMo-VL-7B-RL. For example, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B and MiMo-VL-7B-RL both achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision on confident samples and (70.61% and 78.02%)/(78.10% and 71.98%) on uncertain samples for the two tasks, compared to 46.13% and 13.16% using the LLM alone. These results suggest that integrating task-specific models with LLMs may offer a promising pathway toward more interpretable and trustworthy AI-driven clinical decision support.</description>

      <title>Downlink and Uplink ISAC in Continuous-Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed for both downlink and uplink scenarios. Within this framework, continuous operator-based signal models are employed to describe the sensing and communication processes. The performance of communication and sensing is analyzed using two information-theoretic metrics: the communication rate (CR) and the sensing rate (SR). 1) For downlink ISAC, three continuous beamforming designs are proposed: i) the communications-centric (C-C) design that maximizes the CR, ii) the sensing-centric (S-C) design that maximizes the SR, and iii) the Pareto-optimal design that characterizes the Pareto boundary of the CR-SR region. A low-complexity signal subspace-based approach is proposed to derive the closed-form optimal beamformers for the considered designs. On this basis, closed-form expressions are derived for the achievable CRs and SRs, and the downlink rate region achieved by CAPAs is characterized. 2) For uplink ISAC, the C-C and S-C successive interference cancellation-based methods are proposed to manage inter-functionality interference. Using the subspace approach closed-form expressions for the optimal detectors as well as the achievable CRs and SRs are derived. The uplink SR-CR region is characterized based on the time-sharing technique. Numerical results demonstrate that, for both downlink and uplink, CAPA-based ISAC achieves higher CRs and SRs as well as larger CR-SR regions compared to conventional spatially discrete array-based ISAC.</description>

Abstract: Brain foundation models (BFMs) have emerged as a transformative paradigm in computational neuroscience, offering a revolutionary framework for processing diverse neural signals across different brain-related tasks. These models leverage large-scale pre-training techniques, allowing them to generalize effectively across multiple scenarios, tasks, and modalities, thus overcoming the traditional limitations faced by conventional artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in understanding complex brain data. By tapping into the power of pretrained models, BFMs provide a means to process neural data in a more unified manner, enabling advanced analysis and discovery in the field of neuroscience. In this survey, we define BFMs for the first time, providing a clear and concise framework for constructing and utilizing these models in various applications. We also examine the key principles and methodologies for developing these models, shedding light on how they transform the landscape of neural signal processing. This survey presents a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in BFMs, covering the most recent methodological innovations, novel views of application areas, and challenges in the field. Notably, we highlight the future directions and key challenges that need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of BFMs. These challenges include improving the quality of brain data, optimizing model architecture for better generalization, increasing training efficiency, and enhancing the interpretability and robustness of BFMs in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity-Aware Convolutional Neural Networks for Map-Based Path Loss Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Path loss modeling is a widely used technique for estimating point-to-point losses along a communications link from transmitter (Tx) to receiver (Rx). Accurate path loss predictions can optimize use of the radio frequency spectrum and minimize unwanted interference. Modern path loss modeling often leverages data-driven approaches, using machine learning to train models on drive test measurement datasets. Drive tests primarily represent downlink scenarios, where the Tx is located on a building and the Rx is located on a moving vehicle. Consequently, trained models are frequently reserved for downlink coverage estimation, lacking representation of uplink scenarios. In this paper, we demonstrate that data augmentation can be used to train a path loss model that is generalized to uplink, downlink, and backhaul scenarios, training using only downlink drive test measurements. By adding a small number of synthetic samples representing uplink scenarios to the training set, root mean squared error is reduced by &gt; 8 dB on uplink examples in the test set.</description>
