      <title>How Early Could the Milky Way's Disk Form?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate early, $z &gt; 3$, galaxy formation in a cosmological zoom-in simulation of a close, early-forming Milky Way (MW) analog extracted from TNG50 simulation and re-simulated with detailed modeling of cold interstellar medium (ISM) formation, coupled with on-the-fly UV radiative transfer, turbulence-regulated star formation, and stellar feedback. In our enhanced-physics simulation, the galaxy develops a bi-stable ISM structure (warm, with $T \sim 10^4$ K, and cold, with $T &lt; 100$ K) and exhibits significantly more efficient, early, and bursty star formation than in TNG. Notably, the stellar disk of this MW progenitor forms extremely early, around $z\sim6-7$, and exhibits chemo-kinematic properties consistent with the low-metallicity population of the MW stars. The disk forms rapidly, on a timescale of $\sim$0.2 Gyr which is significantly shorter than the timescale implied by the observable chemo-kinematic signatures of disk spinup, $\sim$0.7 Gyr, due to the scatter in the age-metallicity relation. The rotational support of the gas disk and the location of the galaxy on the main sequence are consistent with early disk galaxies observed by JWST and ALMA at $z\sim4-7$, suggesting that some of these galaxies could be progenitors of MW-like systems. Remarkably, the variation of the global star formation rate (SFR) before disk formation is similar to the observed SFR scatter at these early times. Our findings underscore the critical role of modeling a turbulent cold ISM and turbulence-regulated star formation and feedback in driving early SFR variability, while at the same time enabling early disk formation, without destroying it with overly efficient stellar feedback.</description>

      <title>Stacking and Analyzing $z\approx 2$ MOSDEF Galaxies by Spectral Types: Implications for Dust Geometry and Galaxy Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine star-formation and dust properties for a sample of 660 galaxies at $1.37\leq z\leq 2.61$ in the MOSDEF survey by dividing them into groups with similarly-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs). For each group, we combine the galaxy photometry into a finely-sampled composite SED, and stack their spectra. This method enables the study of more complete galaxy samples, including galaxies with very faint emission lines. We fit these composite SEDs with Prospector to measure the stellar attenuation and SED-based star-formation rates (SFRs). We also derive emission-line properties from the spectral stacks, including Balmer decrements, dust-corrected SFRs, and metallicities. We find that stellar attenuation correlates most strongly with mass, while nebular attenuation correlates strongly with both mass and SFR. Furthermore, the excess of nebular compared to stellar attenuation correlates most strongly with SFR. The highest SFR group has 2 mag of excess nebular attenuation. Our results are consistent with a model in which star-forming regions become more dusty as galaxy mass increases. To explain the increasing excess nebular attenuation, we require a progressively larger fraction of star formation to occur in highly-obscured regions with increasing SFR. This highly-obscured star formation could occur in dusty clumps or central starbursts. Additionally, as each galaxy group represents a different evolutionary stage, we study their locations on the UVJ and SFR-mass diagrams. As mass increases, metallicity and dust attenuation increase, while sSFR decreases. However, the most massive group moves towards the quiescent region of the UVJ diagram, while showing less obscuration, potentially indicating removal of dust.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Variations of Stellar Populations in Barred Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bars are expected to impact the distribution of stellar populations both during bar formation, as they rearrange stars into new orbits, and afterwards, due to the redistribution of star-formation-fuelling gas and transfer of angular momentum. We study the impact of stellar bars on the azimuthal variation of stellar population age, metallicity and mass surface density in $\sim1\,000$ nearby barred galaxies from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey. Bars have higher stellar mass density ($0.113^{+0.065}_{-0.067}$ dex) and are more metal-rich ($0.028^{+0.033}_{-0.040}$ dex) than the discs at the same radii. Stellar ages show a variety of bar to inter-bar contrasts with no consistent trend. The difference in metallicity increases with total stellar mass of the galaxy and distance below the star-forming main sequence. We discuss a combination of potentially responsible processes including kinematic separation, more extended star formation histories and more efficient recycling in bars and at bar-spiral arm connections. Additionally, we observe an offset (10{\deg}-40{\deg}) of the peak metallicity to the bar major axis in star-forming bars in low-mass galaxies, and more metal-rich regions outside the ends of the bar in long bars and quenched galaxies. Furthermore, there is a subtle trend of lower metallicities on the leading side of spiral arms compared to the trailing side. Finally, we report a spiral arm surface density feature, which could point towards a dominant bar-spiral connection and pitch angle of $\alpha \sim 25${\deg}. We interpret these features in the context of bar formation and the impact of large-scale gas flows associated with their presence.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Vertical Distribution of HI Absorbing Clouds in the Solar Neighborhood. II. Constraints from a Large Catalog of 21 cm Absorption Observations at High Galactic Latitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cold neutral medium (CNM) is where neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) is converted into molecular clouds, so the structure and kinematics of the CNM are key drivers of galaxy evolution. Here we provide new constraints on the vertical distribution of the CNM using the recently-developed $\texttt{kinematic_scaleheight}$ software package and a large catalog of sensitive HI absorption observations. We estimate the thickness of the CNM in the solar neighborhood to be $\sigma_z\sim50$$\unicode{x2013}$$90~\mathrm{pc}$, assuming a Gaussian vertical distribution. This is a factor of $\sim2$ smaller than typically assumed, indicating the thickness of the CNM in the solar neighborhood is similar to that found in the inner Galaxy, consistent with recent simulation results. If we consider only structures with HI optical depths $\tau&gt;0.1$ or column densities $N(\mathrm{HI})&gt;10^{19.5}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, which recent work suggests are thresholds for molecule formation, we find $\sigma_z\sim50~\mathrm{pc}$. Meanwhile, for structures with $\tau&lt;0.1$ or column densities $N(\mathrm{HI})&lt;10^{19.5}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$, we find $\sigma_z\sim120~\mathrm{pc}$. These thicknesses are similar to those derived for the thin- and thick-disk molecular cloud populations traced by CO emission, possibly suggesting that cold HI and CO are well-mixed. Approximately $20\%$ of CNM structures are identified as outliers, with kinematics that are not well-explained by Galactic rotation. We show that some of these CNM structures $\unicode{x2014}$ perhaps representing intermediate velocity clouds $\unicode{x2014}$ are associated with the Local Bubble wall. We compare our results to recent observations and simulations, and we discuss their implications for the multiphase structure of the Milky Way's interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>"Little Red Dots" cannot reside in the same dark matter halos as comparably luminous unobscured quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a new population of candidate broad-line AGN emerging in the early Universe, named ''little red dots'' (LRDs) because of their compactness and red colors at optical wavelengths. LRDs appear to be surprisingly abundant ($\approx 10^{-5}\,\mathrm{cMpc}^{-3}$) given that their inferred bolometric luminosities largely overlap with the ones of the UV-luminous quasars identified at high $z$ in wide-field spectroscopic surveys. In this work, we investigate how the population of LRDs and/or other UV-obscured AGN relates to the one of unobscured, UV-selected quasars. By comparing their number densities, we infer an extremely large and rapidly evolving obscured:unobscured ratio, ranging from $\approx20:1$ at $z\approx4$ to $\approx2300:1$ at $z\approx7$, and possibly extending out to very high ($\approx10^{47}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$) bolometric luminosities. This large obscured:unobscured ratio is incompatible with the UV-luminous duty cycle measured for unobscured quasars at $z\approx4-6$, suggesting that LRDs are too abundant to be hosted by the same halos as unobscured quasars. This implies that either (a) the bolometric luminosities of LRDs are strongly overestimated (possibly because LRDs are dominated by stellar galaxy light) or (b) LRDs follow different scaling relations than the ones of UV-selected quasars, representing a new population of accreting SMBHs emerging in the early Universe. A direct comparison between the clustering of LRDs and the one of faint UV-selected quasars will ultimately confirm these findings, and shed light on key properties of LRDs such as their host mass distribution and duty cycle. We provide a mock analysis for the clustering of LRDs and show that it is feasible with current and upcoming JWST surveys.</description>

      <title>IllustrisTNG + Cosmic Rays with a Simple Transport Model: From Dwarfs to L$^\star$ Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a simple model for cosmic ray (CR) production and transport to assess the impact of CRs on $z$\,$=$\,$0$ galaxy, circumgalactic medium (CGM), and halo properties. To do so, we run the first suite of large-volume cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations (25\,Mpc\,h$^{-1}$ boxes) with the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model including CR physics. We select CR transport parameters that yield a reasonable trade off between realistic large-scale integrated properties, and galactic CR pressure profiles predicted by more complex models. The resulting simulations show that, at fixed halo mass, including CRs does not strongly impact the temperature, density, or (total) pressure structure of the CGM with respect to the fiducial TNG model. However, cosmic rays add significant non-thermal pressure support to the halo. This suppresses the star formation activity and thus stellar masses of galaxies, from dwarf to L$^\star$ halos. The cosmic star formation rate density, stellar mass function, and stellar mass to halo mass relation are all reshaped by CRs. Galaxy sizes and halo-scale gas fractions are more mildly affected, while lower gas densities in the interstellar medium inhibit supermassive black hole growth. Halo gas is also less magnetized, and less metal enriched. These differences are primarily driven by suppressed gas accretion onto halos and galaxies, as well as weaker galactic outflows in the presence of CRs. Our findings are in qualitative agreement with previous studies of the impact of CRs on galactic outflows, and motivate the inclusion of CR physics in future large-scale cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>A determination of the cosmic microwave background temperature using Galactic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new, reliable determination of the CN excitation temperature of diffuse molecular clouds in the Milky Way, based on ultra high spectral resolution observations. Our determination is based on CN $B^{2}\Sigma^{+}-X^{2}\Sigma^{+}$ (0,0) vibrational band absorption spectra seen along the lines of sight to eight bright Galactic stars. Our analysis is conducted blind, and we account for multiple sources of systematic uncertainty. Like previous studies, our excitation temperature measures exhibit an intrinsic scatter that exceeds the quoted uncertainties. Accounting for this scatter, we derive a 3% determination of the typical CN excitation temperature, $T_{01}=2.769^{+0.084}_{-0.072}~{\rm K}$, which is consistent with the direct determination of the cosmic microwave background temperature. We also perform a single joint fit to all sightlines, and find that our data can be simultaneously fit with an excitation temperature $T_{01}=2.725\pm0.015~{\rm K}$ -- a 0.55% measure that is consistent with the CMB temperature. We propose a future observational strategy to reduce systematic uncertainties and firmly test the limitations of using CN as a cosmic microwave background thermometer.</description>

      <title>The complex effect of gas cooling and turbulence on AGN-driven outflow properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) Accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at close to the Eddington rate can influence the host galaxy via powerful winds. Theoretical models of such winds can explain observational correlations between SMBHs and their host galaxies and the powerful multi-phase outflows observed in a number of active galaxies. Analytic models usually assume spherical symmetry and a smooth gas distribution with an adiabatic equation of state. However, the interstellar medium in real galaxies is clumpy and cooling is important, complicating the analysis. We used a suite of idealised hydrodynamical simulations to isolate the effects of turbulence and cooling on the development and global properties of AGN wind-driven outflows on kiloparsec scales. We measured the outflow velocity, mass outflow rate and momentum and energy loading factors as the system evolved over 1.2 Myr and estimated plausible observationally derived values.
  We find that adiabatic simulations approximately reproduce the analytical estimates of outflow properties independently of turbulence or clumpiness. However, cooling reduces the outflow energy rate by 1-2 orders of magnitude in the smooth simulations and by up to one order of magnitude in the turbulent ones. The interplay between cooling and turbulence depends on AGN luminosity: in Eddington-limited AGN, turbulence enhances the coupling between the AGN wind and the gas, while the opposite happens in lower-luminosity simulations. This occurs because dense gas clumps are resilient to low-luminosity AGN feedback but get driven away by high-luminosity AGN feedback. The overall properties of multi-phase outflowing gas in our simulations qualitatively agree with observations of multi-phase outflows. We also find that using `observable' outflow properties leads to their parameters being underestimated by a factor of a few compared with real values.</description>

      <title>Growth of Massive Black-Holes in FFB Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scenario of feedback-free starbursts (FFB), which predicts excessively bright galaxies at cosmic dawn as observed using JWST, may provide a natural setting for black hole (BH) growth. This involves the formation of intermediate-mass seed BHs and their runaway mergers into super-massive BHs with high BH-to-stellar mass ratios and low AGN luminosities. We present a scenario of merger-driven BH growth in FFB galaxies and study its feasibility. BH seeds form within the building blocks of the FFB galaxies, namely, thousands of compact star clusters, each starbursting in a free-fall time of a few Myr before the onset of stellar and supernova feedback. The BH seeds form by rapid core collapse in the FFB clusters, in a few free-fall times, sped up by the migration of massive stars due to the young, broad stellar mass function and stimulated by a `gravo-gyro' instability due to internal cluster rotation and flattening. BHs of $10^4 M_\odot$ are expected in $10^6 M_\odot$ FFB clusters within sub-kpc galactic disks at $z \sim 10$. The BHs then migrate to the galaxy center by dynamical friction, hastened by the compact FFB stellar galactic disk configuration. Efficient mergers of the BH seeds will produce $10^{6-8} M_\odot$ BHs with a BH-to-stellar mass ratio $\sim 0.01$ by $z \sim 4-7$, as observed. The growth of the central BH by mergers can overcome the bottleneck introduced by gravitational wave recoils if the BHs inspiral within a relatively cold disk or if the escape velocity from the galaxy is boosted by a wet compaction event. Such events, common in massive galaxies at high redshifts, can also help by speeding up the inward BH migration and by providing central gas to assist with the final parsec problem. The cold disk version of the FFB scenario provides a feasible route for the formation of supermassive BHs.</description>

      <title>Geometric deep learning for galaxy-halo connection: a case study for galaxy intrinsic alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forthcoming cosmological imaging surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory LSST, require large-scale simulations encompassing realistic galaxy populations for a variety of scientific applications. Of particular concern is the phenomenon of intrinsic alignments (IA), whereby galaxies orient themselves towards overdensities, potentially introducing significant systematic biases in weak gravitational lensing analyses if they are not properly modeled. Due to computational constraints, simulating the intricate details of galaxy formation and evolution relevant to IA across vast volumes is impractical. As an alternative, we propose a Deep Generative Model trained on the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation to sample 3D galaxy shapes and orientations to accurately reproduce intrinsic alignments along with correlated scalar features. We model the cosmic web as a set of graphs, each graph representing a halo with nodes representing the subhalos/galaxies. The architecture consists of a SO(3) $\times$ $\mathbb{R}^n$ diffusion generative model, for galaxy orientations and $n$ scalars, implemented with E(3) equivariant Graph Neural Networks that explicitly respect the Euclidean symmetries of our Universe. The model is able to learn and predict features such as galaxy orientations that are statistically consistent with the reference simulation. Notably, our model demonstrates the ability to jointly model Euclidean-valued scalars (galaxy sizes, shapes, and colors) along with non-Euclidean valued SO(3) quantities (galaxy orientations) that are governed by highly complex galactic physics at non-linear scales.</description>

      <title>Photometry and kinematics of dwarf galaxies from the Apertif HI survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Understanding the dwarf galaxy population in low density environments is crucial for testing the LCDM cosmological model. The increase in diversity towards low mass galaxies is seen as an increase in the scatter of scaling relations such as the stellar mass-size and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), and is also demonstrated by recent in-depth studies of an extreme subclass of dwarf galaxies of low surface brightness, but large physical sizes, called ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). Aims. We select galaxies from the Apertif HI survey, and apply a constraint on their i-band absolute magnitude to exclude high mass systems. The sample consists of 24 galaxies, and span HI mass ranges of 8.6 &lt; log ($M_{HI}/M_{Sun}$) &lt; 9.7 and stellar mass range of 8.0 &lt; log ($M_*/M_{Sun}$) &lt; 9.7 (with only three galaxies having log ($M_*/M_{Sun}$) &gt; 9). Methods. We determine the geometrical parameters of the HI and stellar discs, build kinematic models from the HI data using 3DBarolo, and extract surface brightness profiles in g-, r- and i-band from the Pan-STARRS 1 photometric survey. Results. We find that, at fixed stellar mass, our HI selected dwarfs have larger optical effective radii than isolated, optically-selected dwarfs from the literature. We find misalignments between the optical and HI morphologies for some of our sample. For most of our galaxies, we use the HI morphology to determine their kinematics, and we stress that deep optical observations are needed to trace the underlying stellar discs. Standard dwarfs in our sample follow the same BTFR of high-mass galaxies, whereas UDGs are slightly offset towards lower rotational velocities, in qualitative agreement with results from previous studies. Finally, our sample features a fraction (25%) of dwarf galaxies in pairs that is significantly larger with respect to previous estimates based on optical spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>A multi-ion non-equilibrium solver for ionised astrophysical plasmas with arbitrary elemental abundances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many astrophysical plasmas can be modelled successfully assuming ionisation and thermal equilibrium, in some cases this is not appropriate and a non-equilibrium approach is required. In nebulae around evolved stars the local elemental abundances may also strongly vary in space and time. Here we present a non-equilibrium multi-ion module developed for the fluid-dynamics code \textsc{pion}, describing the physical processes included and demonstrating its capabilities with some test calculations. A non-equilbrium ionisation solver is developed that allows arbitrary elemental abundances for neutral and ionised (but not molecular) gas, for the elements H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Si, S and Fe. Collisional ionisation and recombination, photoionisation and charge-exchange reactions are included, and ion-by-ion non-equilibrium radiative cooling is calculated based on the instantaneous ion fractions of each element. Element and ion mass-fractions are advected using passive scalars, operator-split from the microphysical processes. The module is validated by comparing with equilibrium and non-equilibrium calculations in the literature. Effects of charge exchange on ion abundances in cooling plasmas are discussed. Application to modelling shocks and photoionised H~\textsc{ii} regions is demonstrated. The time-dependent expansion of a Wolf-Rayet nebula is studied, including photoionisation and collisional processes, and spectral-line luminosities calculated for non-equilibrium and equilibrium plasma states. The multi-ion module enables simulation of ionised plasmas with spatially varying elemental abundances using self-consistent ion abundances and thermal evolution. This allows prediction of spectral lines in UV, optical, IR and X-ray even in cases where the plasma is out of ionisation equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Forecasts Constrained by JWST AGN Observations for Early Massive Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive black holes (BHs) grow by gas accretion and mergers, observable through electromagnetic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) emission. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has detected faint active galactic nuclei (AGNs), revealing an abundant population of accreting BHs with masses of $M_\bullet\sim 10^{6-8}~M_\odot$. This mass range overlaps with the detection scopes of space-based GW interferometers and approaches the upper bounds of the predicted mass of seed BHs. We model BH mass assembly in light of the new JWST findings to investigate their formation channels and predict merger events. Two types of seed BHs are considered: heavy seeds ($M_\bullet\sim 10^{2-5}~M_\odot$) formed in rare and overdense cosmic regions, and light seeds ($M_\bullet\sim 10^{1-3}~M_\odot$) formed as stellar remnants in less massive dark-matter halos. The BHs grow through episodic accretion and merger events, which we model by fitting the AGN luminosity function to observational data including JWST-identified AGNs at $z\sim 5$. We find that heavy seeds alone struggle to explain quasars and faint JWST-selected AGNs simultaneously, requiring the more abundant light seeds. The observed merger rate of BHs from heavy seeds alone is limited to $\lesssim 10^{-1}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for major mergers at $z\geq5$. However, the presence of light seeds increases the major merger rate by several orders of magnitude, which peaks at a total BH mass of $M_\bullet\simeq 2\times 10^3~M_\odot$ over $5&lt;z&lt;10$ at a rate of $\sim 30~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. These events are detectable by future GW observatories such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Precise sky localization and distance measurement of those GW events, with solid angle and luminosity distance uncertainties $\Delta\Omega\Delta\log D_L\lesssim 10^{-4}~\rm deg^2$, will enable EM identification of mergers at $z\geq5$ and multi-messenger follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>Demography of stellar radio population within 500 pc: A VLASS-Gaia DR3 study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have carried out a systematic analysis of the VLASS quick look catalogs together with \textit{Gaia DR3} to identify the optical counterparts of 3~GHz radio emitters within 500~pc to obtain a homogeneous statistical sample of stellar radio sources. We have identified distinct populations of 3 GHz emitters across the \textit{Gaia DR3} color-magnitude diagram. We also present candidate sources (transient, highly variable or background artifacts) which can be confirmed by follow-up observations. A majority of the detected sources constitute main sequence G, K and M-type stars including ultra-cool dwarfs. Pinning down the origin of radio emission from these populations can help us gain further insights into the origin of stellar and planetary magnetic fields. By analyzing the variation of brightness temperature of the sources with their spectral type, we have tentatively associated possible emission mechanisms with different object types. We inspected the correlation between quiescent radio and X-ray emission for our sample that can provide crucial insights into the current understanding of the Gudel-Benz relationship, which is essential for modeling steady radio emission and coronal heating. This VLASS-\textit{\textit{Gaia DR3}} analysis acts as a pilot study for follow-up observations at multiple wavelengths to better understand stellar structure, model flaring activities and detect radio emission caused by star-planet interactions.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Supradense Matter from Dissecting Scaled Stellar Structure Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong-field gravity in General Relativity (GR) realized in neutron stars (NSs) renders the Equation of State (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of supradense neutron star (NS) matter to be essentially nonlinear and refines the upper bound for $\phi\equiv P/\varepsilon$ to be much smaller than the Special Relativity (SR) requirement with linear EOSs, where $P$ and $\varepsilon$ are respectively the pressure and energy density of the system considered. Specifically, a tight bound $\phi\lesssim0.374$ is obtained by anatomizing perturbatively the intrinsic structures of the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations without using any input nuclear EOS. New insights gained from this novel analysis provide EOS-model independent constraints on properties (e.g., density profiles of the sound speed squared $s^2=\d P/\d\varepsilon$ and trace anomaly $\Delta=1/3-\phi$) of cold supradense matter in NS cores. Using the gravity-matter duality in theories describing NSs, we investigate the impact of gravity on supradense matter EOS in NSs. In particular, we show that the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$, radius $R$ and its compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ scale with certain combinations of its central pressure and energy density (encapsulating its central EOS). Thus, observational data on these properties of NSs can straightforwardly constrain NS central EOSs without relying on any specific nuclear EOS-model.</description>

      <title>Mixed Warm Dark Matter Constraints using Milky Way Satellite Galaxy Counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Warm dark matter has been strongly constrained in recent years as the sole component of dark matter. However, a less-explored alternative is that dark matter consists of a mixture of warm and cold dark matter (MWDM). In this work, we use observations of Milky Way satellite galaxies to constrain MWDM scenarios where the formation of small-scale structure is suppressed either by generic thermal relic warm dark matter or a sterile neutrino produced through the Shi-Fuller mechanism. To achieve this, we model satellite galaxies by combining numerical simulations with semi-analytical models for the subhalo population, and use a galaxy--halo connection model to match galaxies onto dark matter subhalos. By comparing the number of satellites predicted by MWDM models to the observed satellite population from the Dark Energy Survey and Pan-STARRS1, we constrain the fraction of warm dark matter, $f_{\rm WDM}$, as a function of its mass, $m_{\rm WDM}$. We exclude dark matter being composed entirely of thermal relic warm dark matter with $m_{\rm WDM} \leq 6.6 $ keV at a posterior ratio of 10:1, consistent with previous works. However, we find that warm dark matter with smaller mass is allowed when mixed with cold dark matter, and that the $f_{\rm WDM}$ constraints strengthen with decreasing $m_{\rm WDM}$ until they plateau at $f_{\rm WDM} \lesssim 0.45 $ for $m_{\rm WDM} \lesssim 1.5$ keV. Likewise, in the case of a sterile neutrino with mass of 7 keV produced through the Shi-Fuller mechanism, we exclude a fraction of $f_{\nu_s} \lesssim 0.45$, independent of mixing angle. Our results extend constraints on MWDM to a region of parameter space that has been relatively unconstrained with previous analysis.</description>

      <title>On the origin of star-formation quenching in massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$ in the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03083v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG, we perform a comprehensive analysis of quiescent, massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$. The goal is to understand what suppresses their star formation so early in cosmic time, and how other similar mass galaxies remain highly star-forming. As a first-order result, the simulations are able to produce massive, quiescent galaxies in this high-redshift regime. We find that active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback is the primary cause of halting star formation in early, massive galaxies. Not only do the central, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) of the quenched galaxies have earlier seed times, but they also grow faster than in star-forming galaxies. As a result, the quenched galaxies are exposed to AGN feedback for longer, and experience the kinetic, jet-mode of the AGN feedback earlier than the star-forming galaxies. The release of kinetic energy reduces inflows of gas while likely maintaining outflows, which keeps a low cold gas fraction and decreases the star formation of the galaxies down to a state of quiescence. In addition to AGN feedback, we also investigate the influence of the large-scale environment. While mergers do not play a significant role in the quenching process, the quenched galaxies tend to reside in more massive halos and denser regions during their evolution. As this provides a greater initial amount of infalling gas to the galaxies, the large-scale environment can mildly affect the fate of the central SMBH growth and, via AGN feedback, contribute to star formation quenching.</description>

      <title>Comparing the interstellar and circumgalactic origin of gas in the tails of jellyfish galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulations and observations find long tails in jellyfish galaxies, which are commonly thought to originate from ram-pressure stripped gas of the interstellar medium (ISM) in the immediate galactic wake. While at larger distances from the galaxy, they have been claimed to form in situ owing to thermal instability and fast radiative cooling of mixed ISM and intracluster medium (ICM). In this paper, we use magneto-hydrodynamical windtunnel simulations of a galaxy with the arepo code to study the origin of gas in the tails of jellyfish galaxies. To this end, we model the galaxy orbit in a cluster by accounting for a time-varying galaxy velocity, ICM density and turbulent magnetic field. Tracking gas flows between the ISM, the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and the ICM, we find contrary to popular opinion that the majority of gas in the tail originated in the CGM. Prior to the central passage of the jellyfish galaxy in the cluster, the CGM is directly transported to the clumpy jellyfish tail that has been shattered into small cloudlets. After the central cluster passage, gas in the tail originates both from the initial ISM and the CGM, but that from the latter was accreted to the galactic ISM before being ram-pressure stripped to form filamentary tentacles in the tail. Our simulation shows a declining gas metallicity in the tail as a function of downstream distance from the galaxy. We conclude that the CGM plays an important role in shaping the tails of jellyfish galaxies.</description>

      <title>Time Delay Anomalies of Fuzzy Gravitational Lenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter is a promising alternative to the standard cold dark matter. It has quite recently been noticed, that they can not only successfully explain the large-scale structure in the Universe, but can also solve problems of position and flux anomalies in galaxy strong lensing systems. In this paper we focus on the perturbation of time delays in strong lensing systems caused by fuzzy dark matter, thus making an important extension of previous works. We select a specific system HS 0810+2554 for the study of time delay anomalies. Then, based on the nature of the fuzzy dark matter fluctuations, we obtain theoretical relationship between the magnitude of the perturbation caused by fuzzy dark matter, its content in the galaxy, and its de Broglie wavelength $\lambda _{\mathrm{dB}}$. It turns out that, the perturbation of strong lensing time delays due to fuzzy dark matter quantified as standard deviation is $\sigma_{\Delta t} \propto \lambda _{\mathrm{dB}}^{1.5}$. We also verify our results through simulations. Relatively strong fuzzy dark matter fluctuations in a lensing galaxy make it possible to to destroy the topological structure of the lens system and change the arrival order between the saddle point and the minimum point in the time delays surface. Finally, we stress the unique opportunity for studying properties of fuzzy dark matter created by possible precise time delay measurements from strongly lensed transients like fast radio bursts, supernovae or gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>Transferring spectroscopic stellar labels to 217 million Gaia DR3 XP stars with SHBoost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06963v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using machine learning regression as a method of extracting basic stellar parameters and line-of-sight extinctions from spectro-photometric data. We built a stable gradient-boosted random-forest regressor (xgboost), trained on spectroscopic data, capable of producing output parameters with reliable uncertainties from Gaia DR3 data (most notably the low-resolution XP spectra), without ground-based spectroscopic observations. Using Shapley additive explanations, we interpret how the predictions for each star are influenced by each data feature. For the training and testing of the network, we used high-quality parameters obtained from the StarHorse code for a sample of around eight million stars observed by major spectroscopic stellar surveys, complemented by curated samples of hot stars, very metal-poor stars, white dwarfs, and hot sub-dwarfs. The training data cover the whole sky, all Galactic components, and almost the full magnitude range of the Gaia DR3 XP sample of more than 217 million objects that also have reported parallaxes. We have achieved median uncertainties of 0.20 mag in V-band extinction, 0.01 dex in logarithmic effective temperature, 0.20 dex in surface gravity, 0.18 dex in metallicity, and $12\%$ in mass (over the full Gaia DR3 XP sample, with considerable variations in precision as a function of magnitude and stellar type). We succeeded in predicting competitive results based on Gaia DR3 XP spectra compared to classical isochrone or spectral-energy distribution fitting methods we employed in earlier works, especially for parameters $A_V$ and $T_{\rm eff}$, along with the metallicity values. Finally, we showcase some potential applications of this new catalogue, including extinction maps, metallicity trends in the Milky Way, and extended maps of young massive stars, metal-poor stars, and metal-rich stars).

      <title>Chemistry in the GG Tau A Disk: Constraints from H2D+, N2H+, and DCO+ High Angular Resolution ALMA Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resolved molecular line observations are essential for gaining insight into the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary disks, particularly in cold, dense regions where planets form and acquire their chemical compositions. However, tracing these regions is challenging because most molecules freeze onto grain surfaces and are not observable in the gas phase. We investigated cold molecular chemistry in the triple stellar T Tauri disk GG Tau A, which harbours a massive gas and dust ring and an outer disk, using ALMA Band 7 observations. We present high angular resolution maps of N2H+ and DCO+ emission, with upper limits reported for H2D+, 13CS, and SO2. The radial intensity profile of N2H+ shows most emission near the ring outer edge, while DCO+ exhibits double peaks, one near the ring inner edge and the other in the outer disk. With complementary observations of lower-lying transitions, we constrained the molecular surface densities and rotation temperatures. We compared the derived quantities with model predictions across different cosmic ray ionization (CRI) rates, carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratios, and stellar UV fluxes. Cold molecular chemistry, affecting N2H+, DCO+, and H2D+ abundances, is most sensitive to CRI rates, while stellar UV flux and C/O ratios have minimal impact on these three ions. Our best model requires a low cosmic ray ionization rate of 1e-18 s-1. However, it fails to match the low temperatures derived from N2H+ and DCO+, 12 to 16 K, which are much lower than the CO freezing temperature.</description>

      <title>Extracting Astrophysical Information of Highly-Eccentric Binaries in the Millihertz Gravitational Wave Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wide, highly eccentric ($e&gt;0.9$) compact binaries can naturally arise as progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) mergers. These systems are expected to have a significant population in the mHz band, with their GW signals characterized by ``repeated bursts" emitted upon each pericenter passage. In this study, we show that the detection of mHz GW signals from highly eccentric stellar mass binaries in the local universe can strongly constrain their orbital parameters. Specifically, it can achieve a relative measurement error of $\sim 10^{-6}$ for orbital frequency and $\sim 1\%$ for eccentricity (as $1-e$) in most of the detectable cases. On the other hand, the binary's mass ratio, distance, and intrinsic orbital inclination may be less precisely determined due to degeneracies in the GW waveform. We also perform mock LISA data analysis to evaluate the realistic detectability of highly eccentric compact binaries. Our results show that highly eccentric systems could be efficiently identified when multiple GW sources and stationary Gaussian instrumental noise are present in the detector output. This work highlights the potential of extracting the signal of ``bursting'' LISA sources to provide valuable insights into their orbital evolution, surrounding environment, and formation channels.</description>
