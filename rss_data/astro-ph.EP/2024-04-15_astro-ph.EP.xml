      <title>Atmospheric Mass Loss from TOI-1259 A b, a Gas Giant Planet With a White Dwarf Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of close-in Neptune-mass exoplanets evident in transit surveys has largely been attributed either to photoevaporative mass loss or high-eccentricity migration. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we investigate the origins of TOI-1259 A b, a Saturn-mass (0.4 M$_J$, 1.0 R$_J$) exoplanet lying along the upper edge of the Neptune desert. TOI-1259 A b's close-in ($P$ = 3.48 days) orbit and low bulk density make the planet particularly vulnerable to photoevaporation. Using transits observed in the 1083 nm metastable helium line, we probe the upper atmosphere of TOI-1259 A b with the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory and the Near-Infrared Spectrograph on Keck II. We report an excess absorption of $0.395\pm{0.072}\%$ with Palomar and a blueshifted absorption of $2.4\pm0.52\%$ with Keck, consistent with an extended escaping atmosphere. Fitting this signal with a Parker wind model, we determine a corresponding atmospheric mass loss rate of log($\dot{M}$) = $10.33\pm 0.13$ g/s for a thermosphere temperature of $8400^{+1200}_{-1000}$ K based on the Palomar absorption and log($\dot{M}$) = $10.0\pm 0.1$ g/s for a thermosphere temperature of $8200^{+1000}_{-900}$ K based on the Keck absorption. This relatively low rate suggests that this planet would not have been significantly altered by mass loss even if it formed in-situ. However, the presence of a white dwarf companion, TOI-1259 B, hints that this planet may not have formed close-in, but rather migrated inward relatively late. Given the estimated parameters of the proto-white dwarf companion, we find that high-eccentricity migration is possible for the system.</description>

      <title>Astrometric detection of a Neptune-mass candidate planet in the nearest M-dwarf binary system GJ65 with VLTI/GRAVITY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of low-mass planets orbiting the nearest stars is a central stake of exoplanetary science, as they can be directly characterized much more easily than their distant counterparts. Here, we present the results of our long-term astrometric observations of the nearest binary M-dwarf Gliese 65 AB (GJ65), located at a distance of only 2.67 pc. We monitored the relative astrometry of the two components from 2016 to 2023 with the VLTI/GRAVITY interferometric instrument. We derived highly accurate orbital parameters for the stellar system, along with the dynamical masses of the two red dwarfs. The GRAVITY measurements exhibit a mean accuracy per epoch of 50-60 microarcseconds in 1.5h of observing time using the 1.8m Auxiliary Telescopes. The residuals of the two-body orbital fit enable us to search for the presence of companions orbiting one of the two stars (S-type orbit) through the reflex motion they imprint on the differential A-B astrometry. We detected a Neptune-mass candidate companion with an orbital period of p = 156 +/- 1 d and a mass of m = 36 +/- 7 Mearth. The best-fit orbit is within the dynamical stability region of the stellar pair. It has a low eccentricity, e = 0.1 - 0.3, and the planetary orbit plane has a moderate-to-high inclination of i &gt; 30{\deg} with respect to the stellar pair, with further observations required to confirm these values. These observations demonstrate the capability of interferometric astrometry to reach microarcsecond accuracy in the narrow-angle regime for planet detection by reflex motion from the ground. This capability offers new perspectives and potential synergies with Gaia in the pursuit of low-mass exoplanets in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Models of Microphysical Clouds on Hot Jupiters I: Cloud Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new two-dimensional, bin-scheme microphysical model of cloud formation in the atmospheres of hot Jupiters that includes the effects of longitudinal gas and cloud transport. We predict cloud particle size distributions as a function of planetary longitude and atmospheric height for a grid of hot Jupiters with equilibrium temperatures ranging from 1000-2100 K. The predicted 2D cloud distributions vary significantly from models that do not consider horizontal cloud transport and we discuss the microphysical and transport timescales that give rise to the differences in 2D versus 1D models. We find that the horizontal advection of cloud particles increases the cloud formation efficiency for nearly all cloud species and homogenizes cloud distributions across the planets in our model grid. In 2D models, certain cloud species are able to be transported and survive on the daysides of hot Jupiters in cases where 1D models would not predict the existence of clouds. We demonstrate that the depletion of condensible gas species varies as a function of longitude and atmospheric height across the planet, which impacts the resultant gas-phase chemistry. Finally, we discuss various model sensitivities including the sensitivity of cloud properties to microphysical parameters, which we find to be substantially less than the sensitivity to the atmospheric thermal structure and horizontal and vertical transport of condensible material.</description>

      <title>Microscale Hydrogen, Carbon, and Nitrogen Isotopic Diversity of Organic Matter in Asteroid Ryugu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the H, C, and N isotopic compositions of microscale (0.2 to 2$\mu$m) organic matter in samples of asteroid Ryugu and the Orgueil CI carbonaceous chondrite. Three regolith particles of asteroid Ryugu, returned by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft, and several fragments of Orgueil were analyzed by NanoSIMS isotopic imaging. The isotopic distributions of the Ryugu samples from two different collection spots are closely similar to each other and to the Orgueil samples, strengthening the proposed Ryugu-CI chondrite connection. Most individual sub-$\mu$m organic grains have isotopic compositions within error of bulk values, but 2-8% of them are outliers exhibiting large isotopic enrichments or depletions in D, $^{15}$N, and/or $^{13}$C. The H, C and N isotopic compositions of the outliers are not correlated with each other: while some C-rich grains are both D- and $^{15}$N-enriched, many are enriched or depleted in one or the other system. This most likely points to a diversity in isotopic fractionation pathways and thus diversity in the local formation environments for the individual outlier grains. The observation of a relatively small population of isotopic outlier grains can be explained either by escape from nebular and/or parent body homogenization of carbonaceous precursor material or addition of later isotopic outlier grains. The strong chemical similarity of isotopically typical and isotopically outlying grains, as reflected by synchrotron x-ray absorption spectra, suggests a genetic connection and thus favors the former, homogenization scenario. However, the fact that even the least altered meteorites show the same pattern of a small population of outliers on top of a larger population of homogenized grains indicates that some or most of the homogenization occurred prior to accretion of the macromolecular organic grains into asteroidal parent bodies.</description>

      <title>Measurements of Titan's Stratospheric Winds during the 2009 Equinox with the eSMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saturn's moon Titan possesses stratospheric zonal winds that places it among a sparse class of planetary bodies known to have superrotation in their atmospheres. Few measurements have been made of these speeds in the upper stratosphere, leaving their seasonal variations still not well understood. We examined observations made with the extended Submillimeter Array (eSMA) in 2009 March (L\textsubscript{s}=355\textdegree{}) and 2010 February (L\textsubscript{s}=5\textdegree{}), shortly before and after Titan's northern spring equinox. Cassini observations and atmospheric models find equinoctial periods to be especially dynamic. Zonal wind calculations, derived from the Doppler frequency shift of CH\textsubscript{3}CN near 349.4 GHz, yielded speeds of 128 $\pm$ 27 m s\textsuperscript{-1} in 2009 and 209 $\pm$ 48 m s\textsuperscript{-1} in 2010. We estimated the measured emission to originate from vertical altitudes of $336^{+112}_{-88}$ kilometers, equivalent to pressures of $3.8^{+19.2}_{-3.4}$ Pa, commensurate with Titan's upper stratosphere/lower mesosphere. This suggests a possible increase in zonal speeds during this period. The results are then compared to those from previous Cassini-inferred and direct-interferometric observations of winds, as well as general circulation model simulations, to form a more complete picture of the seasonal cycle of stratospheric zonal winds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exoplanet detection is the most exciting and challenging field of astronomy. The discovery of many exoplanets has revolutionized our understanding of the formation and evolution of planetary systems and has showed new ways to search for extra terrestrial life. In recent years, some primary methods of exoplanet detection like transit, radial velocity, gravitational microlensing, direct imaging and astrometry have played a important role for the discovery of exoplanets. In this paper we explored detection methodologies with all the implications and analytics of comparison between them. Here we also discussed on different machine learning algorithms for exoplanet detection and visualization. Finally, concluded with the significant discoveries made by some missions and their implications on our understanding for the properties, environmental conditions and importance of exoplanets in the universe.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based identification of Gaia astrometric exoplanet orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third Gaia data release (DR3) contains $\sim$170 000 astrometric orbit solutions of two-body systems located within $\sim$500 pc of the Sun. Determining component masses in these systems, in particular of stars hosting exoplanets, usually hinges on incorporating complementary observations in addition to the astrometry, e.g. spectroscopy and radial velocities. Several DR3 two-body systems with exoplanet, brown-dwarf, stellar, and black-hole components have been confirmed in this way. We developed an alternative machine learning approach that uses only the DR3 orbital solutions with the aim of identifying the best candidates for exoplanets and brown-dwarf companions. Based on confirmed substellar companions in the literature, we use semi-supervised anomaly detection methods in combination with extreme gradient boosting and random forest classifiers to determine likely low-mass outliers in the population of non-single sources. We employ and study feature importance to investigate the method's plausibility and produced a list of 22 best candidates of which four are exoplanet candidates and another five are either very-massive brown dwarfs or very-low mass stars. Three candidates, including one initial exoplanet candidate, correspond to false-positive solutions where longer-period binary star motion was fitted with a biased shorter-period orbit. We highlight nine candidates with brown-dwarf companions for preferential follow-up. One candidate companion around the Sun-like star G 15-6 could be confirmed as a genuine brown dwarf using external radial-velocity data. This new approach is a powerful complement to the traditional identification methods for substellar companions among Gaia astrometric orbits. It is particularly relevant in the context of Gaia DR4 and its expected exoplanet discovery yield.</description>

      <title>The evolutionary divergence of Mars, Venus and Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mars, Venus and Earth are expected to have started in a hot molten state. Here, we discuss how these three terrestrial planets diverged in their evolution and what mechanisms could be the cause. We discuss that early-on after magma ocean crystallization the mantle/surface redox state and water inventory may already differ considerably, depending on planetary mass and orbital distance from the Sun. During the subsequent internal evolution, the three planets also diverged in terms of their tectonic regime, affecting the long-term planetary evolution via heat flux and outgassing rate, and possibly the physical state of their respective core and the onset and end of a planetary dynamo. We discuss how, throughout the evolution of these rocky planets, the dominant process for atmospheric loss would shift from hydrodynamic escape and impact erosion to non-thermal escape, where small terrestrial planets like Mars are here more vulnerable to volatile loss.</description>

      <title>Hot Jupiter Diversity and the Onset of TiO/VO Revealed by a Large Grid of Non-Grey Global Circulation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The population of hot Jupiters is extremely diverse, with large variations in their irradiation, period, gravity and chemical composition. To understand the intrinsic planet diversity through the observed population level trends, we explore the a-priori scatter in the population created by the different responses of atmospheric circulation to planetary parameters. We use the SPARC/MITgcm 3D global circulation model to simulate 345 planets spanning a wide range of instellation, metallicity, gravity and rotation periods typical for hot Jupiters, while differentiating between models with and without TiO/VO in their atmosphere. We show that the combined effect of the planetary parameters leads to a large diversity in the ability of atmospheres to transport heat from day-side to night-side at a given equilibrium temperature. We further show that the hot-spot offset is a non-monotonic function of planetary rotation period and explain our findings by a competition between the rotational and divergent parts of the circulation. As a consequence, hot-spot offset and phase curve amplitude are not necessarily correlated. Finally, we compare the observables from our grid to the population of Spitzer and Hubble observations of hot Jupiters. We find that the sudden jump in brightness temperature observed in the Spitzer secondary eclipse measurements can be naturally explained by the cold-trapping of TiO/VO at approximately 1800K. The grid of modelled spectra, phase curves and thermal structures are made available to the community, together with a python code for visualization of the grid properties, at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10785321 and http://sim3d.oca.eu/.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the barometric equation and the extent of a planetary atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard barometric equation predicts the molecular concentration $n(z)=n_0\exp(-z/L)$ where $L=k_BT/mg$. Because the mean free path $l=1/n\sigma$ increases exponentially, we show that at high altitudes $z$, the equation is no longer within the domain of applicability of the standard kinetic theory $l\ll L$. Here, we predict the dependence $n(z)\propto z^{-2}$ for the case $l\gg L$ in uniform gravity. It corresponds to a non-stationary planetary atmosphere with hydrogen accretion. The predicted accretion is accompanied by a release of gravitational potential energy that leads to heating of the atmosphere. In that context, we suggest gravitational energy could be the elusive source that drives the formation of stellar coronas. Other consequences of accretion are: slowly decaying tails of planetary atmospheres, the existence of gas giants, and periodical hydrogen explosions of white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Mixing is easy: new insights for cosmochemical evolution from pre-stellar core collapse</title>

Abstract: Signposts of early planet formation are ubiquitous in sub-structured young discs. Dense, hot and high-pressure regions formed during gravitational collapse process, integral to star formation, facilitate dynamical mixing of dust within the protostellar disc. This provides an incentive to constrain the role of gas-dust interaction and resolve zones of dust concentration during star-disc formation. We explore if thermal and dynamical conditions developed during disc formation can generate gas flows that efficiently mix and transport well-coupled gas and dust components. We simulate the collapse of dusty molecular cloud cores with the hydrodynamics code PLUTO augmented with radiation transport and self-gravity. We use a 2D axisymmetric geometry and follow the azimuthal component of velocity. Dust is treated as Lagrangian particles that are subject to drag from the gas, whose motion is computed on a Eulerian grid. We consider 1, 10 and 100 micron-sized neutral spherical dust. Importantly, the equation of state accurately includes molecular hydrogen dissociation. We focus on molecular cloud core masses of 1 and 3 Msun and explore effects of initial rotation rates and cloud core sizes. Our study underlines mechanisms for early transport of dust from inner hot disc regions via the occurrence of meridional flows and outflow. The vortical flow fosters dynamical mixing and retention of dust, while thermal pressure driven outflow replenishes dust in the outer disc. Young dynamical precursors to planet-forming discs exhibit regions with complex hydrodynamical gas features and high-temperature structures. These can play a crucial role in concentrating dust for subsequent growth into protoplanets. Dust transport, especially, from sub-au scales surrounding the protostar to outer relatively cooler parts, offers an efficient pathway for thermal reprocessing during pre-stellar core collapse.

      <title>Mercury's chaotic secular evolution as a subdiffusive process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mercury's orbit can destabilize, generally resulting in a collision with either Venus or the Sun. Chaotic evolution can cause g1 to decrease to the approximately constant value of g5 and create a resonance. Previous work has approximated the variation in g1 as stochastic diffusion, which leads to a phenomological model that can reproduce the Mercury instability statistics of secular and N-body models on timescales longer than 10 Gyr. Here we show that the diffusive model underpredicts the Mercury instability probability by a factor of 3-10,000 on timescales less than 5 Gyr, the remaining lifespan of the Solar System. This is because g1 exhibits larger variations on short timescales than the diffusive model would suggest. To better model the variations on short timescales, we build a new subdiffusive phenomological model for g1. Subdiffusion is similar to diffusion but exhibits larger displacements on short timescales and smaller displacements on long timescales. We choose model parameters based on the behavior of the g1 trajectories in the N-body simulations, leading to a tuned model that can reproduce Mercury instability statistics from 1-40 Gyr. This work motivates fundamental questions in Solar System dynamics: Why does subdiffusion better approximate the variation in g1 than standard diffusion? Why is there an upper bound on g1, but not a lower bound that would prevent it from reaching g5?</description>

      <title>A Perfect Tidal Storm: HD 104067 Planetary Architecture Creating an Incandescent World</title>

Abstract: The discovery of planetary systems beyond the solar system has revealed a diversity of architectures, most of which differ significantly from our system. The initial detection of an exoplanet is often followed by subsequent discoveries within the same system as observations continue, measurement precision is improved, or additional techniques are employed. The HD 104067 system is known to consist of a bright K dwarf host star and a giant planet in a $\sim$55 day period eccentric orbit. Here we report the discovery of an additional planet within the HD 104067 system, detected through the combined analysis of radial velocity data from the HIRES and HARPS instruments. The new planet has a mass similar to Uranus and is in an eccentric $\sim$14 day orbit. Our injection-recovery analysis of the radial velocity data exclude Saturn-mass and Jupiter-mass planets out to 3 AU and 8 AU, respectively. We further present TESS observations that reveal a terrestrial planet candidate ($R_p = 1.30\pm0.12$ $R_\oplus$) in a $\sim$2.2~day period orbit. Our dynamical analysis of the three planet model shows that the two outer planets produce significant eccentricity excitation of the inner planet, resulting in tidally induced surface temperatures as high as $\sim$2600 K for an emissivity of unity. The terrestrial planet candidate may therefore be caught in a tidal storm, potentially resulting in its surface radiating at optical wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Interior solution of azimuthally symmetric case of Laplace equation in orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Curvilinear coordinate systems distinct from the rectangular Cartesian coordinate system are particularly valuable in the field calculations as they facilitate the expression of boundary conditions of differential equations in a reasonably simple way when the coordinate surfaces fit the physical boundaries of the problem. The recently finalized orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal (SOS) coordinate system can be particularly useful for a physical processes description inside or in the vicinity of the bodies with the geometry of an oblate spheroid. Such shape is aproximating well objects investigated within astrophysics. The solution of the azimuthally symmetric case of the Laplace equation was found for the interior space in the orthogonal SOS coordinates. In the frame of the derivation of the harmonic functions, the Laplace equation was separated by a special separation procedure. A generalized Legendre equation was introduced as the equation for the angular part of the separated Laplace equation. The harmonic functions were determined as relations involving generalized Legendre functions of the first and of the second kind. Several lower-degree functions are reported. Recursion formula facilitating determination of the higher-degree harmonic functions was found. The general solution of the azimuthally symmetric Laplace equation for the interior space in the SOS coordinates is reported.</description>
