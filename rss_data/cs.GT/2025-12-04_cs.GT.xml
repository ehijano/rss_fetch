      <title>Sponsored Questions and How to Auction Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online platforms connect users with relevant products and services using ads. A key challenge is that a user's search query often leaves their true intent ambiguous. Typically, platforms passively predict relevance based on available signals and in some cases offer query refinements. The shift from traditional search to conversational AI provides a new approach. When a user's query is ambiguous, a Large Language Model (LLM) can proactively offer several clarifying follow-up prompts. In this paper we consider the following: what if some of these follow-up prompts can be ``sponsored,'' i.e., selected for their advertising potential. How should these ``suggestion slots'' be allocated? And, how does this new mechanism interact with the traditional ad auction that might follow?
  This paper introduces a formal model for designing and analyzing these interactive platforms. We use this model to investigate a critical engineering choice: whether it is better to build an end-to-end pipeline that jointly optimizes the user interaction and the final ad auction, or to decouple them into separate mechanisms for the suggestion slots and another for the subsequent ad slot. We show that the VCG mechanism can be adopted to jointly optimize the sponsored suggestion and the ads that follow; while this mechanism is more complex, it achieves outcomes that are efficient and truthful. On the other hand, we prove that the simple-to-implement modular approach suffers from strategic inefficiency: its Price of Anarchy is unbounded.</description>

      <title>Game-Theoretic Learning-Based Mitigation of Insider Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An insider is defined as a team member who covertly deviates from the team's optimal collaborative control strategy in pursuit of a private objective, while maintaining an outward appearance of cooperation. Such insider threats can severely undermine cooperative systems: subtle deviations may degrade collective performance, jeopardize mission success, and compromise operational safety. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for identifying and mitigating insider threats in cooperative control settings. We introduce an insider-aware, game-theoretic formulation in which the insider's hidden intention is parameterized, allowing the threat identification task to be reformulated as a parameter estimation problem. To address this challenge, we employ an online indirect dual adaptive control approach that simultaneously infers the insider's control strategy and counteracts its negative influence. By injecting properly designed probing signals, the resulting mitigation policy asymptotically recovers the nominal optimal control law - one that would be achieved under full knowledge of the insider's objective. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed identification-mitigation framework and illustrate its capability to preserve team performance even in the presence of covert adversarial behavior.</description>

      <title>Computing Equilibrium Points of Electrostatic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the computation of equilibrium points of electrostatic potentials: locations in space where the electrostatic force arising from a collection of charged particles vanishes. This is a novel scenario of optimization in which solutions are guaranteed to exist due to a nonconstructive argument, but gradient descent is unreliable due to the presence of singularities.
  We present an algorithm based on piecewise approximation of the potential function by Taylor series. The main insight is to divide the domain into a grid with variable coarseness, where grid cells are exponentially smaller in regions where the function changes rapidly compared to regions where it changes slowly. Our algorithm finds approximate equilibrium points in time poly-logarithmic in the approximation parameter, but these points are not guaranteed to be close to exact solutions. Nevertheless, we show that such points can be computed efficiently under a mild assumption that we call "strong non-degeneracy". We complement these algorithmic results by studying a generalization of this problem and showing that it is CLS-hard and in PPAD, leaving its precise classification as an intriguing open problem.</description>

      <title>A choice-based axiomatization of Nash equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An axiomatic characterization of Nash equilibrium is provided for games in normal form. The Nash equilibrium correspondence is shown to be fully characterized by four simple and intuitive axioms, two of which are inspired by contraction and expansion consistency properties from the literature on abstract choice theory. The axiomatization applies to Nash equilibria in pure and mixed strategies alike, to games with strategy sets of any cardinality, and it does not require that players' preferences have a utility or expected utility representation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Selection Using Algorithmic Rankings with Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by online platforms such as job markets, we study an agent choosing from a list of candidates, each with a hidden quality that determines match value. The agent observes only a noisy ranking of the candidates plus a binary signal that indicates whether each candidate is "free" or "busy." Being busy is positively correlated with higher quality, but can also reduce value due to decreased availability. We study the agent's optimal selection problem in the presence of ranking noise and free-busy signals and ask how the accuracy of the ranking tool impacts outcomes. In a setting with one high-valued candidate and an arbitrary number of low-valued candidates, we show that increased accuracy of the ranking tool can result in reduced social welfare. This can occur for two reasons: agents may be more likely to make offers to busy candidates, and (paradoxically) may be more likely to select lower-ranked candidates when rankings are more indicative of quality. We further discuss conditions under which these results extend to more general settings.</description>

      <title>A New Solution for Cooperative Game with Public Externalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel solution concept--the w-value--for cooperative games with public externalities. The w-value is axiomatically founded on three principles: Pareto Optimality (PO), Market Equilibrium (ME), and Fiscal Balance (FB), which together ensure a fair and economically sound distribution of gains. We establish its existence, uniqueness, and an accompanying implementation mechanism. A key theoretical advantage is its strong stability: the w-value lies within the core, specifically the {\gamma}-core making it resistant to coalitional deviations. Moreover, its computational efficiency facilitates practical application to complex real-world problems, offering a clear advantage over more cumbersome alternatives. These properties make the w-value a superior framework for analyzing cooperation under public externalities. A numerical illustration demonstrates the step-by-step calculation process. Finally, we apply the concept to international climate negotiations, showing how it provides a theoretical rationale for the shift from rigid mandatory emission reduction systems toward the flexible structure of Nationally Determined Contributions.</description>
