      <title>The distribution amplitude of the $\eta_c$-meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this proceeding we determine the distribution amplitude of the $\eta_c$-meson from first principles. This quantity appears as a consequence of factorization theorems, and it is necessary to compute the amplitude of multiple exclusive processes. Since it is defined along a light-cone, its calculation via lattice QCD was impossible until recently, when a generalization to Euclidean metric was proposed, and a connection to the physical limit was established. We briefly explain the method of short distance factorization, which allows us to compute the distribution amplitude, and our lattice setup. After summarizing the steps for the continuum and chiral extrapolation, we present our results and compare them to two alternative determinations, one using non-relativistic QCD and another solving the Dyson-Schwinger equations; we find a large discrepancy with the former.</description>

      <title>Exponential Error Reduction for Glueball Calculations Using a Two-Level Algorithm in Pure Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the application of a two-level algorithm to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of glueball calculations in four-dimensional $\mathrm{SU(3)}$ pure gauge theory. Our findings demonstrate that the statistical errors exhibit an exponential reduction, enabling reliable extraction of effective masses at distances where current standard methods would demand exponentially more samples. However, at shorter distances, standard methods prove more efficient due to a saturation of the variance reduction using the multi-level method. We discuss the physical distance at which the multi-level sampling is expected to outperform the standard algorithm, supported by numerical evidence across different lattice spacings and glueball channels. Additionally, we construct a variational basis comprising 35 Wilson loops up to length 12 and 5 smearing sizes each, presenting results for the first state in the spectrum for the scalar, pseudoscalar, and tensor channels.</description>

      <title>Gauging C on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss general aspects of charge conjugation symmetry in Euclidean lattice field theories, including its dynamical gauging. Our main focus is $O(2) = U(1)\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2 $ gauge theory, which we construct using a non-abelian generalization of the Villain formulation via gauging the charge conjugation symmetry of pure $U(1)$ gauge theory. We describe how to construct gauge-invariant non-local operators in a theory with gauged charge conjugation symmetry, and use it to define Wilson and 't Hooft lines as well as non-invertible symmetry operators. Our lattice discretization preserves the higher-group and non-invertible symmetries of $O(2)$ gauge theory, which we explore in detail. In particular, these symmetries give rise to selection rules for extended operators and their junctions, and constrain the properties of the worldvolume degrees of freedom on twist vortices (also known as Alice or Cheshire strings). We propose a phase diagram of the theory coupled to dynamical magnetic monopoles and twist vortices, where the various generalized symmetries are typically only emergent.</description>

      <title>Using operator covariance to disentangle scaling dimensions in lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In critical lattice models, distance ($r$) dependent correlation functions contain power laws $r^{-2\Delta}$ governed by scaling dimensions $\Delta$ of an underlying continuum field theory. In Monte Carlo simulations and other numerical approaches, the leading dimensions can be extracted by data fitting, which can be difficult when two or more powers contribute significantly. Here a method utilizing covariance between multiple lattice operators is developed where the $r$ dependent eigenvalues of the covariance matrix represent scaling dimensions of individual field operators. The scheme is tested on symmetric operators in the two-dimensional tricritical Blume-Capel model, where the two relevant dimensions, as well as some irrelevant ones, are isolated along with their corresponding eigenvectors. The method will be broadly useful in studies of classical and quantum models at multicritical points and for targeting irrelevant operators at simple critical (or multicritical) points.</description>

      <title>The $g$-function and Defect Changing Operators from Wavefunction Overlap on a Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defects are common in physical systems with boundaries, impurities or extensive measurements. The interaction between bulk and defect can lead to rich physical phenomena. Defects in gapless phases of matter with conformal symmetry usually flow to a defect conformal field theory (dCFT). Understanding the universal properties of dCFTs is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a computational strategy applicable to a line defect in arbitrary dimensions. Our main assumption is that the defect has a UV description in terms of a local modification of the Hamiltonian so that we can compute the overlap between low-energy eigenstates of a system with or without the defect insertion. We argue that these overlaps contain a wealth of conformal data, including the $g$-function, which is an RG monotonic quantity that distinguishes different dCFTs, the scaling dimensions of defect creation operators $\Delta^{+0}_\alpha$ and changing operators $\Delta^{+-}_\alpha$ that live on the intersection of different types of line defects, and various OPE coefficients. We apply this method to the fuzzy sphere regularization of 3D CFTs and study the magnetic line defect of the 3D Ising CFT. Using exact diagonalization and DMRG, we report the non-perturbative results $g=0.602(2),\Delta^{+0}_0=0.108(5)$ and $\Delta^{+-}_0=0.84(5)$ for the first time. We also obtain other OPE coefficients and scaling dimensions. Our results have significant physical implications. For example, they constrain the possible occurrence of spontaneous symmetry breaking at line defects of the 3D Ising CFT. Our method can be potentially applied to various other dCFTs, such as plane defects and Wilson lines in gauge theories.</description>
