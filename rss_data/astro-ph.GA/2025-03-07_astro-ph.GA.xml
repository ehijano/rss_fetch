      <title>Metallicity Gradients in Modern Cosmological Simulations I: Tension Between Smooth Stellar Feedback Models and Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metallicity of galaxies, and its variation with galactocentric radius, provides key insights into the formation histories of galaxies and the physical processes driving their evolution. In this work, we analyze the radial metallicity gradients of star forming galaxies in the EAGLE, Illustris, IllustrisTNG, and SIMBA cosmological simulations across a broad mass ($10^{8.0}M_\odot\leq M_\star \lesssim10^{12.0}M_\odot$) and redshift ($0\leq z\leq8$) range. We find that all simulations predict strong negative (i.e., radially decreasing) metallicity gradients at early cosmic times, likely due to their similar treatments of relatively smooth stellar feedback allowing for sustained inside-out growth. The strongest redshift evolution occurs in galaxies with stellar masses of $10^{10.0}-10^{11.0}M_\odot$, while galaxies with stellar masses $&lt; 10^{10}M_\odot$ and $&gt;10^{11}M_\odot$ exhibit weaker redshift evolution. Our results of negative gradients at high-redshift contrast with the many positive and flat gradients in the $1&lt;z&lt;4$ observational literature. At $z&gt;6$, the negative gradients observed with JWST and ALMA are flatter than those in simulations, albeit with closer agreement than at lower redshift. Overall, we suggest that these smooth stellar feedback galaxy simulations may not sufficiently mix their metal content, and that either stronger stellar feedback or additional subgrid turbulent metal diffusion models may be required to better reproduce observed metallicity gradients.</description>

      <title>The THESAN-ZOOM project: Population III star formation continues until the end of reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population III (Pop III) stars are the first stars in the Universe, forming from pristine, metal-free gas and marking the end of the cosmic dark ages. Their formation rate is expected to sharply decline after redshift $z \approx 15$ due to metal enrichment from previous generations of stars. In this paper, we analyze 14 zoom-in simulations from the THESAN-ZOOM project, which evolves different haloes from the THESAN-1 cosmological box down to redshift $z=3$. The high mass resolution of up to $142 M_\odot$ per cell in the gas phase combined with a multiphase model of the interstellar medium (ISM), radiative transfer including Lyman-Werner radiation, dust physics, and a non-equilibrium chemistry network that tracks molecular hydrogen, allows for a realistic but still approximate description of Pop III star formation in pristine gas. Our results show that Pop III stars continue to form in low-mass haloes ranging from $10^6 M_\odot$ to $10^9 M_\odot$ until the end of reionization at around $z=5$. At this stage, photoevaporation suppresses further star formation in these minihaloes, which subsequently merge into larger central haloes. Hence, the remnants of Pop III stars primarily reside in the satellite galaxies of larger haloes at lower redshifts. While direct detection of Pop III stars remains elusive, these results hint that lingering primordial star formation could leave observable imprints or indirectly affect the properties of high-redshift galaxies. Explicit Pop III feedback and specialized initial mass function modelling within the THESAN-ZOOM framework would further help interpreting emerging constraints from the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Great Balls of FIRE IV. The contribution of massive star clusters to the astrophysical population of merging binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of over a hundred gravitational wave signals from double compacts objects have confirmed the existence of such binaries with tight orbits. Two main formation channels are generally considered to explain the formation of these merging binary black holes (BBHs): the isolated evolution of stellar binaries, and the dynamical assembly in dense environments, namely star clusters. Although their relative contributions remain unclear, several analyses indicate that the detected BBH mergers probably originate from a mixture of these two distinct scenarios. We study the formation of massive star clusters across time and at a cosmological scale to estimate the contribution of these dense stellar structures to the overall population of BBH mergers. To this end, we propose three different models of massive star cluster formation based on results obtained with zoom-in simulations of individual galaxies. We apply these models to a large sample of realistic galaxies identified in the $(22.1\ \mathrm{Mpc})^3$ cosmological volume simulation \firebox. Each galaxy in this simulation has a unique star formation rate, with its own history of halo mergers and metallicity evolution. Combined with predictions obtained with the Cluster Monte Carlo code for stellar dynamics, we are able to estimate populations of dynamically formed BBHs in a collection of realistic galaxies. Across our three models, we infer a local merger rate of BBHs formed in massive star clusters consistently in the range $1-10\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Compared with the local BBH merger rate inferred by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (in the range $17.9-44\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at $z=0.2$), this could potentially represent up to half of all BBH mergers in the nearby Universe. This shows the importance of this formation channel in the astrophysical production of merging BBHs.</description>

      <title>Trial by FIRE: Probing the dark matter density profile of dwarf galaxies with GraphNPE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Matter (DM) distribution in dwarf galaxies provides crucial insights into both structure formation and the particle nature of DM. GraphNPE (Graph Neural Posterior Estimator), first introduced in Nguyen et al. (2023), is a novel simulation-based inference framework that combines graph neural networks and normalizing flows to infer the DM density profile from line-of-sight stellar velocities. Here, we apply GraphNPE to satellite dwarf galaxies in the FIRE-2 Latte simulation suite of Milky Way-mass halos, testing it against both Cold and Self-Interacting DM scenarios. Our method demonstrates superior precision compared to conventional Jeans-based approaches, recovering DM density profiles to within the 95% confidence level even in systems with as few as 30 tracers. Moreover, we present the first evaluation of mass modeling methods in constraining two key parameters from realistic simulations: the peak circular velocity, $V_\mathrm{max}$, and the peak virial mass, $M_\mathrm{200m}^\mathrm{peak}$. Using only line-of-sight velocities, GraphNPE can reliably recover both $V_\mathrm{max}$ and $M_\mathrm{200m}^\mathrm{peak}$ within our quoted uncertainties, including those experiencing tidal effects ($\gtrsim$ 63% of systems are recovered with our 68% confidence intervals and $\gtrsim$ 92% within our 95% confidence intervals). The method achieves 10-20% accuracy in $V_\mathrm{max}$ recovery, while $M_\mathrm{200m}^\mathrm{peak}$ is recovered to 0.1-0.4 dex accuracy. This work establishes GraphNPE as a robust tool for inferring DM density profiles in dwarf galaxies, offering promising avenues for constraining DM models. The framework's potential extends beyond this study, as it can be adapted to non-spherical and disequilibrium models, showcasing the broader utility of simulation-based inference and graph-based learning in astrophysics.</description>

      <title>EDGE: The emergence of dwarf galaxy scaling relations from cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new suite of EDGE (`Engineering Dwarfs at Galaxy formation's Edge') cosmological zoom simulations. The suite includes 15 radiation-hydrodynamical dwarf galaxies covering the ultra-faint to the dwarf irregular regime ($10^4 \leq M_{\star}(z=0) \leq 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$) to enable comparisons with observed scaling relations. Each object in the suite is evolved at high resolution ($\approx 3 \, \text{pc}$) and includes stellar radiation, winds and supernova feedback channels. We compare with previous EDGE simulations without radiation, finding that radiative feedback results in significantly weaker galactic outflows. This generalises our previous findings to a wide mass range, and reveals that the effect is most significant at low $M_{\star}$. Despite this difference, stellar masses stay within a factor of two of each other, and key scaling relations of dwarf galaxies (size-mass, neutral gas-stellar mass, gas-phase mass-metallicity) emerge correctly in both simulation suites. Only the stellar mass -- stellar metallicity relation is strongly sensitive to the change in feedback. This highlights how obtaining statistical samples of dwarf galaxy stellar abundances with next-generation spectrographs will be key to probing and constraining the baryon cycle of dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>The optical and infrared are connected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies are often modelled as composites of separable components with distinct spectral signatures, implying that different wavelength ranges are only weakly correlated. They are not. We present a data-driven model which exploits subtle correlations between physical processes to accurately predict infrared (IR) WISE photometry from a neural summary of optical SDSS spectra. The model achieves accuracies of $\chi^2_N \approx 1$ for all photometric bands in WISE, as well as good colors. We are also able to tightly constrain typically IR-derived properties, e.g. the bolometric luminosities of AGN and dust parameters such as $\mathrm{q_{PAH}}$. We find that current SED-fitting methods are incapable of making comparable predictions, and that model misspecification often leads to correlated biases in star-formation rates and AGN luminosities. To help improve SED models, we determine what features of the optical spectrum are responsible for our improved predictions, and identify several lines (CaII, SrII, FeI, [OII] and H$\alpha$), which point to the complex chronology of star formation and chemical enrichment being incorrectly modelled.</description>

      <title>HI within and around observed and simulated galaxy discs -- Comparing MeerKAT observations with mock data from TNG50 and FIRE-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic hydrogen (HI) is an ideal tracer of gas flows in and around galaxies, and it is uniquely observable in the nearby Universe. Here we make use of wide-field (~1 square degree), spatially resolved (down to 22"), high-sensitivity (~$10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$) HI observations of 5 nearby galaxies with stellar mass of $5\times10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, taken with the MeerKAT radio telescope. Four of these were observed as part of the MHONGOOSE survey. We characterise their main HI properties and compare these with synthetic HI data from a sample of 25 similarly massive star-forming galaxies from the TNG50 (20) and FIRE-2 (5) suites of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. Globally, the simulated systems have HI and molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) masses in good agreement with the observations, but only when the H$_2$ recipe of Blitz &amp; Rosolowsky (2006) is employed. The other recipes that we tested overestimate the H$_2$-to-HI mass fraction by up to an order of magnitude. On a local scale, we find two main discrepancies between observed and simulated data. First, the simulated galaxies show a more irregular HI morphology than the observed ones due to the presence of HI with column density $&lt;10^{20}$ cm$^{-2}$ up to ~100 kpc from the galaxy centre, in spite of the fact that they inhabit more isolated environments than the observed targets. Second, the simulated galaxies and in particular those from the FIRE-2 suite, feature more complex and overall broader HI line profiles than the observed ones. We interpret this as being due to the combined effect of stellar feedback and gas accretion, which lead to a large-scale gas circulation that is more vigorous than in the observed galaxies. Our results indicate that, with respect to the simulations, gentler processes of gas inflows and outflows are at work in the nearby Universe, leading to more regular and less turbulent HI discs.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the galactic and intergalactic components in 313 observed Lyman-alpha line profiles between redshift 0 and 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyman-Alpha (Lya) photons emitted in star-forming regions inside galaxies experience a complex radiative transfer process until they reach the observer. The Lya line profile that we measured on Earth is, thus, the convolution of the gas properties in the interstellar (ISM), circumgalactic (CGM), and intergalactic medium (IGM). We make use of the open source package zELDA (redshift Estimator for Line profiles of Distant Lyman-Alpha emitters) to disentangle the galactic and IGM components of the Lya profiles to study both the evolution of the intrinsic galactic emission and the IGM transmission across cosmic time. zELDA includes different artificial neural networks that reconstruct IGM attenuated Lya line profiles. These models are trained using mock Lya line profiles. A Monte Carlo radiative transfer code computes the galactic component for the so-called thin shell model. Moreover, the IGM component is included through the IGM transmission curves generated from the IllustrisTNG100 cosmological galaxy formation simulation. We recover their intrinsic galactic spectra by applying the zELDA to 313 Lya line profiles observed with HST/COS and MUSE. Sources at z &lt; 0.5 show weak IGM attenuation, while at z &gt; 3, ZELDA reveals significant IGM suppression of the blue peak in several sources. After separating the IGM effects, the stacked intrinsic galactic Lya profiles show a minimal evolution from z = 0 to 6. The mean IGM transmission for z &lt; 0.5 in HST/COS data exceeds 90%, while the MUSE data show an evolution from 0.85 at z = 3.0 to 0.55 at z = 5.0.</description>

      <title>Medium-band Astrophysics with the Grism of NIRCam In Frontier fields (MAGNIF): Spectroscopic Census of H$\alpha$ Luminosity Functions and Cosmic Star Formation at $z\sim 4.5$ and 6.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure H$\alpha$ luminosity functions (LFs) at redshifts $z \sim 4.5$ and 6.3 using the JWST MAGNIF (Medium-band Astrophysics with the Grism of NIRCam In Frontier fields) survey. MAGNIF obtained NIRCam grism spectra with the F360M and F480M filters in four Frontier Fields. We identify 248 H$\alpha$ emitters based on the grism spectra and photometric redshifts from combined HST and JWST imaging data. The numbers of the H$\alpha$ emitters show a large field-to-field variation, highlighting the necessity of multiple fields to mitigate cosmic variance. We calculate both observed and dust-corrected H$\alpha$ LFs in the two redshift bins. Thanks to the gravitational lensing, the measured H$\alpha$ LFs span three orders of magnitude in luminosity, and the faint-end luminosity reaches $L_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} \sim 10^{40.3} \mathrm{erg} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at $z \sim 4.5$ and $10^{41.5} \mathrm{erg} \mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at $z \sim 6.3$, corresponding to star-formation rates (SFRs) of $\sim$ 0.1 and 1.7 $\mathrm{M}_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. We conclude no or weak redshift evolution of the faint-end slope of H$\alpha$ LF across $z\simeq0.4-6.3$, and the comparison with the faint-end slopes of UV LF indicates stochastic star formation history among low-mass H$\alpha$ emitters. The derived cosmic SFR densities are $0.058^{+0.008}_{-0.006}\ \ M_\odot\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z \sim 4.5$ and $0.025^{+0.009}_{-0.007}\ \ M_\odot\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}\ \mathrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z \sim 6.3$. These are approximately 2.2 times higher than previous estimates based on dust-corrected UV LFs, but consistent with recent measurements from infrared surveys. We discuss uncertainties in the H$\alpha$ LF measurements, including those propagate from the lens models, cosmic variance, and AGN contribution.</description>

      <title>CAPOS: The bulge Cluster APOgee Survey V. Elemental abundances of the bulge globular cluster HP 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed a detailed abundance analysis of 10 red giant members of the heavily obscured bulge globular cluster HP~1 using high-resolution, high S/N near-infrared spectra collected with the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment II survey (APOGEE-2), obtained as part of the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey (CAPOS). We investigate chemical abundances for a variety of species including the light (C,N), odd-Z (Al), $\alpha$ (O,Mg,Si,S,Ca and Ti), Fe-peak (Ni,Fe), and neutron-capture (Ce) elements. The derived mean cluster metallicity is [Fe/H]$=-1.15\pm0.03$, with no evidence for an intrinsic metallicity spread. HP~1 exhibits a typical $\alpha$-enrichment that follows the trend for similar metallicity Galactic GCs, such as NGC~288 and NGC~5904, although our [Si/Fe] abundances are relatively high. We find a significant nitrogen spread ($\sim 1$ dex), and a large fraction of nitrogen-enhanced ([N/Fe]$&gt;+0.7$) stars that populate the cluster. We also detect intrinsic star-to-star spreads in [C/Fe], [O/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Ca/Fe], which are (anti)correlated with several chemical species, indicating the prevalence of the multiple-population phenomenon in HP 1. We have uncovered for the first time a possible correlation between Ca and Al, although the sample is small. The mean $\langle$[Mg/Fe]$\rangle = +0.29$ and $\langle$[Al/Fe]$\rangle = +0.46$ place HP~1 into the region dominated by \textit{in-situ} GCs, supporting the \textit{in-situ} nature of this cluster.</description>

      <title>The Convergence of Heavy and Light Seeds to Overmassive Black Holes at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at redshifts of $z\gtrsim 4-7$, many of which host accreting massive black holes (BHs) with BH-to-galaxy mass ($M_{\rm BH}/M_{\star}$) ratios exceeding the local values by more than an order of magnitude. The origin of these overmassive BHs remains unclear but requires potential contributions from heavy seeds and/or episodes of super-Eddington accretion. We present a growth model coupled with dark matter halo assembly to explore the evolution of the $M_{\rm BH}/M_{\star}$ ratio under different seeding and feedback scenarios. Given the gas inflow rates in protogalaxies, BHs grow episodically at moderate super-Eddington rates and the mass ratio increases early on, despite significant mass loss through feedback. Regardless of seeding mechanisms, the mass ratio converges to a universal value $\sim 0.1-0.3$, set by the balance between gas feeding and star formation efficiency in the nucleus. This behavior defines an attractor in the $M_{\rm BH}-M_{\star}$ diagram, where overmassive BHs grow more slowly than their hosts, while undermassive seeds experience rapid growth before aligning with the attractor. We derive an analytical expression for the universal mass ratio, linking it to feedback strength and halo growth. The convergence of evolutionary tracks erases seeding information from the mass ratio by $z\sim 4-6$. Detecting BHs with $\sim 10^{5-6}~M_\odot$ at higher redshifts that deviate from convergence trend would provide key diagnostics of their birth conditions.</description>

      <title>Polarization flare of 3C 454.3 in millimeter wavelengths seen from decadal polarimetric observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates polarimetric characteristics of the blazar 3C~454.3 at 22-129~GHz using decadal~(2011-2022) data sets. In addition, we also delve into the origin of the polarization flare observed in 2019. The data sets were obtained from the single-dish mode observations of the Korean VLBI Network~(KVN) and the 43-GHz Very Long Baseline Array~(VLBA). We compared the consistency of the measurements between milli-arcsecond and arcsecond scales. The Faraday rotation measure values were obtained via two approaches, model fitting to a linear function in all frequency ranges, and calculation from adjacent frequency pairs. We found that the linear polarization angle is preferred to be $\sim100^{\circ}$ when the source is highly polarized. At 43~GHz, we found that the polarized emission at scales of mas and arcsecond is consistent when we compare its flux density and polarization angle. The ratio of quasi-simultaneously measured polarized flux density is $1.02\pm0.07$, and the polarization angles display similar rotation. These suggest that the extended jet beyond the scale of VLBA 43~GHz has a negligible convolution effect on the polarization angle from the KVN. We found an interesting, notable flaring event in the KVN single-dish data from the polarized emission in 2019 in the frequency range of 22-129~GHz. During the flare, the observed polarization angles~($\chi_{\rm obs}$) rotate from $\sim150^{\circ}$ to $\sim100^{\circ}$ at all frequencies with a chromatic polarization degree~($m_{\rm p}$). Based on the observed $m_{\rm p}$ and $\chi_{\rm obs}$, and also the Faraday rotation measure, we suggest that the polarization flare in 2019 is attributed to the shock-shock interaction in the stationary jet region. The change in the viewing angle of the jet alone is insufficient to describe the increase in brightness temperature, indicating the presence of source intrinsic processes.</description>

      <title>Circumgalactic Enrichment by a Multi-Galaxy Merger at Redshift 6.7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have uncovered high-redshift galaxies characterized by multiple star-forming clumps, many of which appear to be undergoing mergers. Such mergers are powerful drivers of galaxy evolution, triggering intense star formation that accelerates the formation of massive quiescent galaxies. Mergers can also expel and redistribute the metal-enriched gas from galaxies into their circum-galactic medium (CGM), regulating the chemical component of their environments and creating channels of ionized gas through which ionizing radiation escapes. Here, we report a merger of at least five galaxies, dubbed JWST's Quintet (JQ), at redshift 6.7, discovered in the JWST GOODS-South field. This system resides in a small area $\sim4.5''\times4.5''$ ($24.6\times24.6$ pkpc$^2$), containing over 17 galaxy-size clumps with a total stellar mass of $10^{10}\ M_\odot$. The JQ system has a total star formation rate of 240-270 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, placing it $\sim1$ dex above the median star formation rate-mass main sequence at this epoch. The high mass and star formation rate of the JQ galaxies are sufficient to produce massive, inactive galaxies identified at later times, by redshift 4, suggesting this may be a progenitor event for such systems. We detect a large \foiii+H$\beta$ emitting gaseous halo surrounding and connecting four galaxies in the JQ, consistent with the interaction between them. This indicates that the CGM of JQ is already enriched by the heavy elements generated from the galaxies through merger-induced tidal stripping or galactic outflows. Our findings offer a plausible evolutionary pathway for the formation of massive quiescent galaxies observed at lower redshifts and provide direct evidence for the metal enrichment of their environments through galaxy mergers, just 800 Myr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>A Detection of Circumgalactic Dust at Megaparsec Scales with Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the more surprising astrophysical discoveries of the last decade has been the presence of enormous quantities of dust at megaparsec distances from galaxies, which has important implications for galaxy evolution, the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium, and observational cosmology. In this work, we present a novel method for studying these vast halos of circumgalactic dust: a maximum-likelihood estimator for dust-induced extinction of background galaxies. This estimator can accommodate a broad range of archival photometric data and can incorporate different dust reddening prescriptions, making it applicable to diverse galaxy types and redshifts. We apply the estimator to the redMaGiC catalog of luminous red galaxies, selected for their tight dispersion in color and well-constrained photometric redshifts, and measure the resulting extinction as a function of projected distance from WISExSuperCOSMOS and redMaGiC foreground galaxies. We detect significant dust-induced extinction profiles extending to at least 1 megaparsec from galactic disks, with noticeable differences between star-forming and quiescent galaxies: star-forming galaxies exhibit a pronounced rise in extinction within the inner 50 kiloparsecs and a steep decline beyond 1 megaparsec, while the quiescent galaxies host little dust in the inner halo but have detectable extinction out to 30 megaparsecs. We test the robustness of our results using star catalogs and inverted foreground and background samples and find no evidence for significant systematic error. Our approach provides a powerful tool for studying the interplay between circumgalactic dust, galaxy evolution, and large-scale structure, with potential applications in a number of astrophysical subfields.</description>

      <title>The critical role of dark matter halos in driving star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the physical mechanisms that drive star formation is crucial for advancing our knowledge of galaxy evolution. We explore the interrelationships between key galaxy properties associated with star formation, with a particular focus on the impact of dark matter halos. Given the sensitivity of atomic hydrogen (HI) to external processes, we concentrate exclusively on central spiral galaxies. We find that the molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratio ($M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\rm HI}$) strongly depends on stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR). In the star formation efficiency (SFE)-sSFR plane, most galaxies fall below the H$_2$ fundamental formation relation (FFR), with SFE$_{\rm HI}$ being consistently lower than SFE$_{\rm H_2}$. Using the improved halo masses derived by Zhao et al. (2025), for star-forming galaxies, both SFE$_{\rm HI}$ and $M_{\rm H_2}/M_{\rm HI}$ increase rapidly and monotonically with halo mass, indicating a higher efficiency in converting HI to H$_2$ in more massive halos. This trend ultimately leads to the unsustainable state where SFE$_{\rm HI}$ exceeds SFE$_{\rm H_2}$ at halo mass around $10^{12} \hbox{$M_{\odot}$}$. For halos with masses exceeding $10^{12} \hbox{$M_{\odot}$}$, galaxies predominantly experience quenching. We propose a plausible evolutionary scenario in which the growth of halo mass regulates the conversion of HI to H$_2$, star formation, and the eventual quenching of galaxies. The disk size, primarily regulated by the mass, spin and concentration of the dark matter halo, also significantly influences HI to H$_2$ conversion and star formation. These findings underscore the critical role of dark matter halos as a global regulator of galaxy-wide star formation, a key factor that has been largely underappreciated in previous studies.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE: exploring the relationship between spectral index, redshift and radio luminosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known for many years that there is an apparent trend for the spectral index ({\alpha}) of radio sources to steepen with redshift z, which has led to attempts to select high-redshift objects by searching for radio sources with steep spectra. In this study we use data from the MeerKAT, LOFAR, GMRT, and uGMRT telescopes, particularly using the MIGHTEE and superMIGHTEE surveys, to select compact sources over a wide range of redshifts and luminosities. We investigate the relationship between spectral index, luminosity and redshift and compare our results to those of previous studies. Although there is a correlation between {\alpha} and z in our sample for some combinations of frequency where good data are available, there is a clear offset between the {\alpha}-z relations in our sample and those derived previously from samples of more luminous objects; in other words, the {\alpha}-z relation is different for low and high luminosity sources. The relationships between {\alpha} and luminosity are also weak in our sample but in general the most luminous sources are steeper-spectrum and this trend is extended by samples from previous studies. In detail, we argue that both a {\alpha}-luminosity relation and an {\alpha}-z relation can be found in the data, but it is the former that drives the apparent {\alpha}-z relation observed in earlier work, which only appears because of the strong redshift-luminosity relation in bright, flux density-limited samples. Steep-spectrum selection should be applied with caution in searching for high-z sources in future deep surveys.</description>

      <title>SN 2024abfo: a partially stripped SN II from a white supergiant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic data of the type IIb supernova (SN) 2024abfo in NGC 1493 (at 11 Mpc). The ATLAS survey discovered the object just a few hours after the explosion, and observed a fast rise on the first day. Signs of the sharp shock break-out peak and the subsequent cooling phase are observed in the ultraviolet and the bluest optical bands in the first couple of days, while no peak is visible in the reddest filters. Subsequently, in analogy with normal SNe IIb, the light curve of SN 2024abfo rises again in all bands to the broad peak, with the maximum light reached around one month after the explosion. Its absolute magnitude at peak is $M_r=-16.5\pm0.1$ mag, making it a faint SN IIb. The early spectra are dominated by Balmer lines with broad P-Cygni profiles indicating ejecta velocity of 22,500 \kms. One month after the explosion, the spectra display a transition towards being He-dominated, though the H lines do not completely disappear, supporting the classification of SN 2024abfo as a relatively H-rich SN IIb. We identify the progenitor of SN 2024abfo in archival images of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Dark Energy Survey, and the XMM-Newton space telescope, in multiple optical filters. From its spectral energy distribution, the progenitor is consistent with being a white supergiant, Deneb-like star, with a photospheric temperature of 8110 K, a radius of 176 \Rsun, a luminosity of $\log(L/L_{\odot})=5.08$, having an initial mass of 15-16 \Msun. This detection supports an emerging trend of SN IIb progenitors being more luminous and hotter than SN II ones, and being primaries of massive binaries. Within the SN IIb class, fainter events such as SN 2024abfo tend to have cooler and more expanded progenitors than luminous SNe IIb.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to explain the large amplitude of the nano-Hertz stochastic gravitational wave background observed in pulsar timing arrays (PTA), primordial sources must be particularly energetic. This is correlated to the generation of large density fluctuations, later collapsing into ultra-compact mini-halo (UCMHs). We demonstrate that if dark matter is made of WIMPs, then photon and neutrino fluxes from UCMHs produced by curvature peaks, first-order phase transition and domain wall interpretations of the PTA signal, exceed current bounds.</description>

Abstract: Mapping out the first billion years using the 21-cm line with the Square Kilometer Array (SKA) will revolutionize our understanding of the cosmic dawn, reionization and the galaxies that drove these milestones. However, synergies with other telescopes in the form of cross correlations will be fundamental in making and confirming initial, low signal-to-noise claims of a detection. Participants of the 2023 European Southern Observatory (ESO) - SKA Observatory workshop discussed such synergies for Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Cosmic Dawn (CD) science. Here we highlight some of the most promising candidates for cross-correlating SKA EoR/CD observations with ESO instruments such as the Multi-Object Optical and Near-infrared Spectrograph (MOONS), the MOSAIC multi-object spectrograph, and the ArmazoNes high Dispersion Echelle Spectrograph (ANDES).</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Photon Tridents Through Primordial Black Hole Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gamma-ray signals from primordial black holes (PBHs) could provide compelling evidence for their role as a dark matter candidate, particularly through the observation of their Hawking radiation. Future gamma-ray observatories, such as e-ASTROGAM, and the next-generation telescopes, are poised to explore this possibility by measuring both Standard Model (SM) and beyond-the-SM particle emissions. A particularly promising avenue involves production of dark photons by PBHs, which is a hypothetical particle that decays into photons. In this work, we investigate the trident decay of dark photons focusing on their primary emission from PBHs. We assume that the dark photons produced via Hawking radiation decay into photons well before reaching Earth, thereby enhancing the detectable gamma-ray flux. The energy spectrum of the photons decaying from the dark photons is distinct from that of direct Hawking-radiated photons due to higher degree of freedom, leading to observable modifications in the gamma-ray signal. Using the asteroid-mass PBHs as a case study, we demonstrate that future gamma-ray missions could detect dark-photon signatures and distinguish them from conventional Hawking radiation. This approach enables the exploration of previously inaccessible parameter spaces in dark photon mass $m_{A^{\prime}}$ and their coupling to photons, offering a novel pathway to uncover the properties of dark sectors and the nature of PBHs.</description>

      <title>HERACLES++: a multi-dimensional Eulerian code for exascale computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of multidimensional astrophysical fluids present considerable challenges. However, the development of exascale computing has significantly enhanced computational capabilities, motivating the development of new codes that can take full advantage of these resources. In this article, we introduce HERACLES++, a new hydrodynamics code with high portability, optimized for exascale machines with different architectures and running efficiently both on CPUs and GPUs. The code is Eulerian and employs a Godunov finite-volume method to solve the hydrodynamics equations, which ensures accuracy in capturing shocks and discontinuities. It includes different Riemann solvers, equations of state, and gravity solvers. It works in Cartesian and spherical coordinates, either in 1-D, 2-D, or 3-D, and uses passive scalars to handle gases with several species. The code accepts a user-supplied heating or cooling term to treat a variety of astrophysical contexts. In addition to the usual series of benchmarking tests, we use HERACLES++ to simulate the propagation of a supernova shock in a red-supergiant star envelope, from minutes after core collapse until shock emergence. In 1-D, the results from HERACLES++ are in agreement with those of V1D for the same configuration. In 3-D, the Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops and modifies the 1-D picture by introducing density and composition fluctuations as well as turbulence. The focus on a wedge, rather than the full solid angle, and the ability of running HERACLES++ with a large number of GPUs allow for long-term simulations of 3-D supernova ejecta with a sub-degree resolution. Future development is to extend HERACLES++ to a radiation-hydrodynamics code.</description>

      <title>HD 163296 and its Giant Planets: Creation of Exo-comets, Interstellar Objects and Transport of Volatile Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The birth of giant planets in protoplanetary disks is known to alter the structure and evolution of the disk environment, but most of our knowledge focuses on its effects on the observable gas and dust. The impact on the evolution of the invisible planetesimal population is still limitedly studied, yet mounting evidence from the Solar System shows how the appearance of its giant planets played a key role in shaping the habitability of the terrestrial planets. We investigate the dynamical and collisional transport processes of volatile elements by planetesimals in protoplanetary disks that host young giant planets using the HD163296 system as our case study. HD163296 is one of the best characterised protoplanetary disks that has been proposed to host at least four giant planets on wide orbits as well as a massive planetesimal disk. The formation of giant planets in the HD163296 system creates a large population of dynamically excited planetesimals, the majority of which originate from beyond the CO snowline. The excited planetesimals are both transported to the inner disk regions and scattered outward beyond the protoplanetary disk and into interstellar space. Existing solid planets can be enriched in volatile elements to levels comparable or larger than those of the Earth, while giant planets can be enriched to the levels of Jupiter and Saturn. The formation of giant planets on wide orbits impacts the compositional evolution of protoplanetary disks and young planetary bodies on a global scale. The collisional enrichment of the atmospheres of giant planets can alter or mask the signatures of their formation environments, but can provide independent constraints on the disk mass. Protoplanetary disks with giant planets on wide orbits prove efficient factories of interstellar objects.</description>

      <title>Finding White Dwarfs' Hidden Companions using an Unsupervised Machine Learning Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs (WD) with main-sequence (MS) companions are crucial probes of stellar evolution. However, due to the significant difference in their luminosities, the WD is often outshined by the MS star. The aim of this work is to find hidden companions in Gaia's sample of single WD candidates. Our methodology involves applying an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction and clustering, known as Self-Organizing Map (SOM), to Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra. This strategy allows us to naturally separate WDMS binaries from single WDs from the detection of subtle red flux excesses in the XP spectra that are indicative of low-mass MS companions. We validate our approach using confirmed WDMS binary pairs from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, achieving a precision of $\sim 90\%$. Applying our SOM to 90,667 sources, we identify 993 WDMS candidates, 801 of which have not been previously reported in the literature. If confirmed, our sample will increase the known WDMS binaries by $20\%$, making it a valuable source for stellar evolution studies. Additionally, we use the Virtual Observatory Spectral Energy Distribution Analyzer (VOSA) tool to further refine and parameterize a "golden sample" of 136 WDMS candidates through multi-wavelength photometry and a two-body Spectral Energy Distribution fitting. These high-confidence WDMS binaries are composed by low-mass WDs ($\sim 0.41 M_{\odot}$), with cool MS companions ($\sim 2800$ K). Finally, 13 systems exhibit periodic variability consistent with eclipsing binaries, making them prime targets for further follow-up observations.</description>

      <title>An active repeating fast radio burst in a magnetized eruption environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts with unidentified extra-galactic origin. Some FRBs exhibit mild magneto-ionic environmental variations, possibly attributed to plasma turbulence or geometric configuration variation in a binary system. Here we report an abrupt magneto-ionic environment variation of FRB 20220529, a repeating FRB from a disk galaxy at redshift 0.1839. Initially, its Faraday rotation measure (RM) was $21 \pm 96~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$ over 17 months. In December 2023, it jumped to $1976.9~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$, exceeding twenty times of the standard deviation of the previous RM variation, and returned to the typical values within two weeks. Such a drastic RM variation suggests a dense magnetized clump moving across the line of sight, possibly due to coronal mass ejection associated with a stellar flare. It indicates that the FRB likely has a companion star that produced the stellar flare.</description>

      <title>Taking control of compressible modes: bulk viscosity and the turbulent dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many polyatomic astrophysical plasmas are compressible and out of chemical and thermal equilibrium, and yet, a means to carefully control the decay of compressible modes in these systems has largely been neglected. This is especially important for small-scale, turbulent dynamo processes, which are known to be sensitive to the effects of compression. To control the viscous properties of the compressible modes, we perform supersonic, visco-resistive dynamo simulations with additional bulk viscosity $\nu_{\rm bulk}$, deriving a new $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ Reynolds number $\rm{Re}_{\rm bulk}$, and viscous Prandtl number $\rm{P}\nu \equiv \rm{Re}_{\rm bulk} / \rm{Re}_{\rm shear}$, where $\rm{Re}_{\rm shear}$ is the shear viscosity Reynolds number. For $10^{-3} \leq \rm{P}\nu \leq \infty$, we explore a broad range of statistics critical to the dynamo problem. We derive a general framework for decomposing $E_{\rm mag}$ growth rates into incompressible and compressible terms via orthogonal tensor decompositions of $\nabla\otimes\mathbf{v}$, where $\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity. We find that compressible modes play a dual role, growing and decaying $E_{\rm mag}$, and that field-line stretching is the main driver of growth, even in supersonic dynamos. In the absence of $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ ($\rm{P}\nu \to \infty$), compressible modes pile up on small-scales, creating a spectral bottleneck, which disappears for $\rm{P}\nu \approx 1$. As $\rm{P}\nu$ decreases, compressible modes are dissipated at increasingly larger scales, in turn suppressing incompressible modes through a coupling between viscosity operators. We emphasise the importance of further understanding the role of $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ in compressible astrophysical plasmas and direct numerical simulations that include compressibility.</description>

      <title>RUBIES: JWST/NIRSpec Confirmation of an Infrared-luminous, Broad-line Little Red Dot with an Ionized Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02304v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The JWST discovery of ``little red dots'' (LRDs) is reshaping our picture of the early Universe, yet the physical mechanisms driving their compact size and UV-optical colors remain elusive. Here we report an unusually bright LRD ($z=3.1$) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM $\sim4000$km/s), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break and a red continuum sampled out to rest 4 $\mu$m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and AGN model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a $M_*\sim 10^9M_\odot$ galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires $A_{\rm v}\gtrsim3$, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is re-radiated as dust emission. Yet despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy -- seemingly inconsistent with the high EW broad lines (H$\alpha$ EW $\sim800$\AA). The widths and luminosities of Pa$\beta$, Pa$\delta$, Pa$\gamma$, and H$\alpha$ imply a modest black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^8M_\odot$. Additionally, we identify a narrow blue-shifted HeI absorption in G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to $\sim1$\% the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1 combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations provide a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Outcomes of Stellar Evolution in the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are expected to be populated by numerous stars, either formed in the outer regions of the disk via gravitational instability, or captured from the nearby nuclear star cluster. Regardless of their formation mechanism, these stars experience altered evolutionary paths, mostly shaped by the accretion of dense disk material. In this study, through the comparison of different timescales, we chart the evolutionary outcomes of these AGN stars as a function of disk radius and across a range of supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, spanning from $10^6$ to $10^9 \rm M_\odot$, for two popular AGN disk models. We find that, in the outer regions of the disk, stars evolve similarly to those in the interstellar medium, but in the inner and denser regions accretion quickly turns low-mass stars into massive stars, and their fate depends on just how quickly they accrete. If accretion occurs at a faster rate than nuclear burning, they can reach a quasi-steady `immortal' state. If stars accrete faster than they can thermally adjust, runaway accretion occurs, potentially preventing a quasi-steady state and altering the disk structure. During the AGN lifetime, in the regions of the disk that produce massive stars, supernovae (SNe) and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) may occur within the disk over a wide range of optical depths and ambient densities. Subsequently, in the final phase of the AGN, as the disk becomes depleted, formerly immortal stars will be unable to replenish their fuel, leading to additional SNe and GRBs.</description>

      <title>Galactic Distribution of Supernovae and OB Associations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We update and extend a previous model by Higdon and Lingenfelter for the longitudinal profile of the N\,II intensity in the Galactic plane. The model is based on four logarithmic spiral arms, to which features like the Local Arm and local sources are added. Connecting then the N\,II to the H\,II emission, we use this model to determine the average spatial distribution of OBassociations in the Milky Way. Combined with a stellar mass and cluster distribution function, the model predicts the average spatial and temporal distribution of core-collapse supernovae in the Milky Way. In addition to this average population, we account for supernovae from observed OB associations, providing thereby a more accurate description of the nearby Galaxy. The complete model is made publicly available in the python code SNOB.</description>

      <title>The eventful life of a luminous galaxy at z = 14: metal enrichment, feedback, and low gas fraction?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JADES-GS-z14-0 is the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy yet, at $z&gt;14$. With a UV magnitude of -20.81, it is one of the most luminous galaxies at cosmic dawn and its half-light radius of 260 pc means that stars dominate the observed UV emission. We report ALMA detection of [OIII]88$\mu$m line emission with a significance of 6.67$\sigma$ and at a frequency of 223.524~GHz, corresponding to a redshift of $14.1796\pm0.0007$, which is consistent with the candidate CIII] line detected in the NIRSpec spectrum. At this spectroscopic redshift, the Lyman-$\alpha$ break identified with NIRSpec requires a damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorber with a column density of $\log(N_{\rm HI}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2})=21.96$. The total [O\,{\sc iii}]88$\mu$m luminosity (log$(L_{\rm [OIII]}/L_\odot) = 8.3\pm 0.1$) is fully consistent with the local $L_{\rm [OIII]}-SFR$ relation and indicating a gas-phase metallicity $&gt;0.1~{\rm Z_{\rm \odot}}$. Using \texttt{prospector} SED modeling and combining the ALMA data with JWST observations, we find $Z=0.17~{\rm Z_{\rm \odot}}$ and a non-zero escape fraction of ionizing photons ($\sim11\%$), which is necessary by the code to reproduce the UV spectrum. We measure an ${\rm [O III]}5007$\r{A}/[O III]88$\mu$m line flux ratio between 1 and 20, resulting in an upper limit to the electron density of roughly 700 cm$^{-3}$ assuming a single-cloud photoionization model. The [OIIII]88$\mu$m emission line is spectrally resolved, with a FWHM of 100 km/s, resulting in a dynamical mass of log($M_{\rm dyn}/M_\odot$) = 9.0$\pm0.2$. When compared to the stellar mass, this value represents a conservative upper limit on the gas mass fraction, which ranges from 50\% to 80\%, depending on the assumed star formation history. Past radiation-driven outflows may have cleared the galaxy from the gas, reducing the gas fraction and thus increasing the escape fraction of ionizing photons.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Velocity Fluctuations in Galaxy Mergers: A Probe of the Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields and turbulence are fundamental to the evolution of galaxies, yet their precise measurement and analysis present significant challenges. The recently developed Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT), which capitalizes on the anisotropy inherent in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, represents a new method for mapping magnetic fields in galaxies using spectroscopic observations. Most validations of VGT thus far, however, have relied upon idealized MHD turbulence simulations, which lack the more complex dynamics found in galaxies and galaxy mergers. In this study, we scrutinize VGT using an AREPO-based cosmological galaxy merger simulation, testing its effectiveness across pre-merger, merging, and post-merger stages. We examine the underlying assumptions of VGT and probe the statistics of gas density, velocity, and magnetic fields over time. We find that velocity fluctuations are indeed anisotropic at each stage, being larger in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field, as required by VGT. We find, additionally, that galaxy mergers substantially intensify velocity and density fluctuations and amplify magnetic fields at all scales. The observed scaling of the velocity fluctuations shows a steeper trend than $r^{1/2}$ between 0.6 and 3~kpc and a shallower trend at larger scales. The scaling of the magnetic field and density fluctuations at scales $\lesssim$ 1.0 kpc also predominantly aligns with $r^{1/2}$. Finally, we compare results from VGT to those derived from polarization-like mock magnetic field measurements, finding consistent and statistically significant global agreement in all cases.</description>

      <title>Citizen Science Identification of Isolated Blue Stellar Systems in the Virgo cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a catalog of 34 new candidate (13 high confidence) isolated, young stellar systems within the Virgo galaxy cluster identified through a citizen science search of public optical and ultraviolet imaging. "Blue blobs" are a class of blue, faint, isolated, extremely low stellar mass, and metal-rich star-forming clouds embedded in the hot intracluster medium of the Virgo cluster. Only six blue blobs were known previously and here we confirm an additional six of our candidates through velocity and metallicity measurements from follow-up optical spectroscopy on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). Our 13 high confidence candidates (including the six confirmed) have properties consistent with prior known blue blobs and are inconsistent with being low-mass galaxies. Most candidates are concentrated in relatively dense regions, roughly following filamentary structures within the cluster, but avoiding its center. Three of our candidates are likely the stellar counterparts of known 'optically dark' clouds of neutral hydrogen in the cluster, while a further four are widely separated extensions to previously known blue blobs. The properties of our new candidates are consistent with previous conclusions that blue blobs likely originated from ram pressure stripping events, however, their locations in velocity--projected cluster-centric radius phase-space imply that their parent galaxies are not on their first infall into the cluster. Through our ongoing follow-up program with HET we aim to confirm additional candidates, however, detailed understanding of the stellar populations and star formation histories of blue blobs will require JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the Extremely Diffuse Stellar Distribution of the Nube Galaxy through Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations have uncovered a remarkably flat and extremely diffuse stellar distribution within the almost dark dwarf galaxy Nube, posing a challenge to the standard cold dark matter scenario. In this study, we employ numerical simulations to explore the possibility that this anomalous stellar distribution can be attributed to the dynamical heating effect of fuzzy dark matter (FDM). The relatively isolated location and low baryon fraction of Nube make it an ideal system for investigating this effect. Our findings indicate that by adopting a halo profile consistent with the dynamical mass estimation of Nube and an FDM particle mass on the order of $10^{-23}$ eV, the final 2D stellar distribution derived from simulation closely matches observational data. These results suggest that FDM could provide an explanation for the extremely diffuse stellar distribution of Nube.</description>

      <title>Hypervelocity Stars Trace a Supermassive Black Hole in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are produced by the Hills mechanism when a stellar binary is disrupted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). The HVS Survey detected 21 unbound B-type main-sequence stars in the Milky Way's outer halo that are consistent with ejection via the Hills mechanism. We revisit the trajectories of these stars in light of proper motions from {\it Gaia} DR3 and modern constraints on the Milky Way -- Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) orbit. We find that half of the unbound HVSs discovered by the HVS Survey trace back not the Galactic Center, but to the LMC. Motivated by this finding, we construct a forward-model for HVSs ejected from an SMBH in the LMC and observed through the selection function of the HVS Survey. The predicted spatial and kinematic distributions of simulated HVSs are remarkably similar to the observed distributions. In particular, we reproduce the conspicuous angular clustering of HVSs around the constellation Leo. This clustering occurs because HVSs from the LMC are boosted by $\sim300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ by the orbital motion of the LMC, and stars launched parallel to this motion are preferentially selected as HVS candidates. We find that the birth rate and clustering of LMC HVSs cannot be explained by supernova runaways or dynamical ejection scenarios not involving a SMBH. From the ejection velocities and relative number of Magellanic vs. Galactic HVSs, we constrain the mass of the LMC SMBH to be $10^{5.8^{+0.2}_{-0.4}} M_{\odot}$ ($\simeq 6\times10^5 M_{\odot}$).</description>

Abstract: We report the discovery of a kpc-scale lacy filamentary structure in low surface-brightness H$\alpha$ and [OIII]$\lambda5007$ emission around the low-redshift, extremely metal-poor, and compact reionisation-era analogue SDSS J1044+0535. We identify seven elliptical arcs in H$\alpha$ emission at $\mathrm{SB}_\mathrm{H\alpha} \sim 1 - 2 \times 10^{-18}$erg\,s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$arcsec$^{-2}$. These arcs extent 6-9 kpc outwards from the star-forming complexes. We interpret these features as limb-brightened giant-shells that bound egg-shaped kpc-scale bubbles. These shells are five to eight times larger than the known giant-shells around nearby star-forming dwarfs. Kinematic maps reveal a gradient perpendicular to the major-axis and line broadening in the outskirts. The latter, when interpreted due to line-splitting of the expanding shells, provides an estimate of the kinetic energy of the bubbles that can be well reconciled with them being blown by the mass dominating 15-20 Myr old stellar population.</description>

      <title>The size of the continuum emission region and its scaling relations with active galactic nucleus luminosity and the broad-line region size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a continuum lag analysis for a sample of 37 relatively high-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project (SAMP), utilizing the light curve data in $B$ and $V$ bands from SAMP and in $g,r,i$ bands from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We find that the inter-band lags ($\tau$) increase with wavelength (i.e., $\tau \propto \lambda^{\sim 4/3}$) as prescribed by the standard disk model (SSD), suggesting consistency with the "lamp-post" reprocessing model. We report that the size of the continuum emitting region (CER) normalized at 2500 {\AA} ($R_{2500}$) is a factor of $\sim$5 (i.e, $0.69\pm0.04$ dex) larger than predicted by SSD. By combining our new measurements with the re-measurements of the literature sample, we report a correlation between $R_{2500}$ and AGN continuum luminosity as $R_{2500} \, \propto \, L_{5100}^{0.58\pm0.03}$, which suggests that the observed continuum could be composed of both the disk emission and the diffuse emission from the broad line region (BLR). The size of CER shows a tight relation with the size of H$\beta$ BLR with a sublinear slope (i.e., $R_{\text{BLR}} \, \propto \, R_{\text{2500}}^{0.87\pm0.07}$) and a scatter of 0.29 dex. This empirical relation offers a promising method for estimating single-epoch black hole masses, once established over a large dynamic range of AGN luminosity.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the Cepheid-based distance ladder: implications for the Hubble constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$) is a key parameter in cosmology, yet its precise value remains contentious due to discrepancies between early- and late-universe measurement methods, a problem known as the "Hubble tension." In this study, we revisit the Cepheid-based distance ladder calibration, focusing on two potential sources of bias in the period-luminosity relation (PLR): (1) the assumed prior for the residual parallax offset of the Milky Way (MW) Cepheids and (2) systematic differences between Cepheid periods in anchor galaxies versus supernova host galaxies. To address the latter, we adopt two different strategies alongside a renewed MW Cepheid calibration. The first strategy involves resampling anchor and host Cepheids from a common distribution of periods. This approach provides a conservative estimate of $H_0 = (72.18 \pm 1.76) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, including the renewed MW analysis. The increased uncertainty reflects the reduced sample size -- about 700 Cepheids per resampling compared to 3200 in the original dataset. This method reduces the Hubble tension from $5.4 \, \sigma$ (as reported by the SH0ES collaboration with $H_0 = (73.17 \pm 0.86) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$) to $2.4 \, \sigma$. The second strategy allows the PLR slope to vary with the period, yielding $H_0 = (72.35 \pm 0.91) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, including the renewed MW analysis, and the tension reduced to $4.4 \, \sigma$. A statistical comparison of the model with the single-linear PLR shows a significant preference for the broken PLR (p-value $&lt; 0.001$). Both strategies consistently indicate a downward shift of approximately $-1 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ in $H_0$. Our findings underscore the importance of careful consideration of Cepheid population characteristics for precise $H_0$ calibrations.</description>

      <title>Construction of fuzzy dark matter halos with arbitrary initial velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations of fuzzy dark matter (FDM) are computationally expensive, and the resulting halos lack flexibility in parameter adjustments, such as virial mass, density profile, and global velocity. Previous studies have introduced a method for constructing FDM halos with predefined density profiles. In this study, we investigate the initial global velocity of these constructed halos and find that it is nonzero. We provide the theoretical formula for this velocity and illustrate that it arises from the interference between states of odd and even parity. Our calculated results closely match simulation outcomes. Additionally, we showcase how to counteract this velocity and create a halo with a customizable initial global velocity. Our study presents a practical method for adjusting the initial global velocity of halos in controlled FDM simulations, facilitating investigations into tidal effects, galaxy collisions, and other scenarios.</description>

      <title>The distribution of misalignment angles in multipolar planetary nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We measure the projected angle on the plane of the sky between adjacent symmetry axes of tens of multipolar planetary nebulae and find that the distribution of these misalignment angles implies a random three-dimensional angle distribution limited to &lt;60 degrees. We identify a symmetry axis as a line connecting two opposite lobes (bubbles) or clumps. We build a cumulative distribution function of the projected angles alpha and find that an entirely random distribution of the three-dimensional angles delta between adjacent symmetry axes, namely, uncorrelated directions, does not fit the observed one. A good fit to the observed distribution is a limited random distribution of the three-dimensional angle between adjacent symmetry axes, i.e., random distribution in the range of 20&lt;delta&lt;60 degrees. We assume that a pair of jets along the angular momentum axis of an accretion disk around the companion shape each symmetry axis. The limited random distribution might result from two sources of angular momentum to the accretion disks with comparable magnitude: one with a fixed direction and one with a stochastic direction variation. We discuss a scenario where the fixed-axis angular momentum source is the binary orbital angular momentum, while the stochastic source of angular momentum is due to the vigorous envelope convection of the mass-losing giant progenitor.</description>

      <title>Deep Optical Images of the Ejecta Nebula Around the Wolf-Rayet Star WR 8 (HD 62910)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the results of deep H$\alpha$ and [O III] images of the bright WN6/WC4 Wolf-Rayet star WR~8 (HD~62910). These data show considerably more surrounding nebulosity than seen in prior imaging. The brighter portions of the nebula span $\simeq6'$ in diameter and exhibit considerable fine-scale structure including numerous emission clumps and bright head-tail like features presumably due to the effects of the WR star's stellar winds. Due to the overlap of a relatively bright band of unrelated foreground diffuse interstellar H$\alpha$ emission, WR~8's nebula is best viewed via its [O III] emission. A faint $9' \times 13'$ diffuse outer nebulosity is detected surrounding the nebula's main ring of emission. Comparison of the nebula's optical structure with that seen in WISE 22 $\mu$m data shows a similarly clumpy structure but in a better defined emission shell of thermal continuum from dust. The infrared shell is coincident with the nebula's southern [O III] emissions but is mainly seen in the fainter outer portions of the northern [O III] emission clumps. It is this greater radial distance of dust emission in the nebula's northern areas that leads to a striking off-center position of the WR star in the IR shell.</description>

      <title>Lost in the FoG: Pitfalls of Models for Large-Scale Hydrogen Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale HI surveys and their cross-correlations with galaxy distributions have immense potential as cosmological probes. Interpreting these measurements requires theoretical models that must incorporate redshift-space distortions (RSDs), such as the Kaiser and fingers-of-God (FoG) effect, and differences in the tracer and matter distributions via the tracer bias. These effects are commonly approximated with assumptions that should be tested on simulated distributions. In this work, we use the hydrodynamical simulation suite IllustrisTNG to assess the performance of models of $z \leq 1$ HI auto and HI-galaxy cross-power spectra, finding that the models employed by recent observations introduce errors comparable to or exceeding their measurement uncertainties. In particular, neglecting FoG causes $\gtrsim 10\%$ deviations between the modeled and simulated power spectra at $k \gtrsim 0.1$ $h$ / Mpc, larger than assuming a constant bias which reaches the same error threshold at slightly smaller scales. However, even without these assumptions, models can still err by $\sim 10\%$ on relevant scales. These remaining errors arise from multiple RSD damping sources on HI clustering, which are not sufficiently described with a single FoG term. Overall, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of RSDs to harness the capabilities of future measurements of HI distributions.</description>
