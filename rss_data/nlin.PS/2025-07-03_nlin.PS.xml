      <title>Spot solutions to a neural field equation on oblate spheroids</title>

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of excitation patterns in neural fields is an important topic in neuroscience. Neural field equations are mathematical models that describe the excitation dynamics of interacting neurons to perform the theoretical analysis. Although many analyses of neural field equations focus on the effect of neuronal interactions on the flat surface, the geometric constraint of the dynamics is also an attractive topic when modeling organs such as the brain. This paper reports pattern dynamics in a neural field equation defined on spheroids as model curved surfaces. We treat spot solutions as localized patterns and discuss how the geometric properties of the curved surface change their properties. To analyze spot patterns on spheroids with small flattening, we first construct exact stationary spot solutions on the spherical surface and reveal their stability. We then extend the analysis to show the existence and stability of stationary spot solutions in the spheroidal case. One of our theoretical results is the derivation of a stability criterion for stationary spot solutions localized at poles on oblate spheroids. The criterion determines whether a spot solution remains at a pole or moves away. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to discuss the dynamics of spot solutions with the insight of our theoretical predictions. Our results show that the dynamics of spot solutions depend on the curved surface and the coordination of neural interactions.</description>

      <title>Parallelization of Network Dynamics Computations in Heterogeneous Distributed Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of parallelizing computations to study non-linear dynamics in large networks of non-locally coupled oscillators using heterogeneous computing resources. The proposed approach can be applied to a variety of non-linear dynamics models with runtime specification of parameters and network topologies. Parallelizing the solution of equations for different network elements is performed transparently and, in contrast to available tools, does not require parallel programming from end-users. The runtime scheduler takes into account the performance of computing and communication resources to reduce downtime and to achieve a quasi-optimal parallelizing speed-up. The proposed approach was implemented, and its efficiency is proven by numerous applications for simulating large dynamical networks with 10^3-10^8 elements described by Hodgkin-Huxley, FitzHugh-Nagumo, and Kuramoto models, for investigating pathological synchronization during Parkinson's disease, analyzing multi-stability, for studying chimera and solitary states in 3D networks, etc. All the above computations may be performed using symmetrical multiprocessors, graphic processing units, and a network of workstations within the same run and it was demonstrated that near-linear speed-up can be achieved for large networks. The proposed approach is promising for extension to new hardware like edge-computing devices.</description>
