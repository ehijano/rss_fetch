      <title>Minimal surfaces and alternating multiple zetas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show for every sufficiently large integer $g$ the existence of a complete family of closed and embedded constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces deforming the Lawson surfaces $\xi_{1,g}$ parametrized by their conformal type. When specializing to the minimal case, we discover a pattern resulting in the coefficients of the involved expansions being alternating multiple zeta values (MZVs), which generalizes the notion of Riemann's zeta values to multiple integer variables. This allows us to extend a new existence proof of the Lawson surfaces $\xi_{1,g}$ for all to all $g\geq 3$ using complex analytic methods and to give closed form expressions of their area expansion up to order $7$. For example, the third order coefficient is $\tfrac{9}{4}\zeta(3)$ (the first and second order term were shown to be $\log(2)$ and $0$ respectively in \cite{HHT}). As a corollary, we obtain that the area of $\xi_{1,g}$ is monotonically increasing in their genus $g$ for all $g\geq 0.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a two-dimensional Lorentzian problem on the anti-de Sitter plane. Using methods of geometric control theory and differential geometry, it was possible to construct an orthonormal frame, calculate extremal trajectories, describe the reachable set, construct an optimal synthesis, and describe the Lorentzian distance.</description>

      <title>Complete 3-manifolds of positive scalar curvature with quadratic decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if an orientable 3-manifold $M$ admits a complete Riemannian metric whose scalar curvature is positive and has a subquadratic decay at infinity, then it decomposes as a (possibly infinite) connected sum of spherical manifolds and $\mathbb{S}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^1$ summands. This generalises a theorem of Gromov and Wang by using a different, more topological, approach. As a result, the manifold $M$ carries a complete Riemannian metric of uniformly positive scalar curvature, which partially answers a conjecture of Gromov. More generally, the topological decomposition holds without any scalar curvature assumption under a weaker condition on the filling discs of closed curves in the universal cover based on the notion of fill radius. Moreover, the decay rate of the scalar curvature is optimal in this decomposition theorem. Indeed, the manifold $\mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{S}^1$ supports a complete metric of positive scalar curvature with exactly quadratic decay, but does not admit a decomposition as a connected sum.</description>

      <title>Geometric inequalities for CR-submanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two kinds of curvature invariants of Riemannian manifold equipped with a distribution (for example, a CR-submanifold of an almost Hermitian manifold) related to sets of pairwise orthogonal subspaces of the distribution: one is similar to Chen's $\delta$-invariants and another kind of invariants is based on the mutual curvature of the subspaces. We compare Chen-type invariants with the mutual curvature invariants and prove geometric inequalities with intermediate mean curvature squared for CR-submanifolds in almost Hermitian spaces. In the case of a set of complex planes, we study curvature invariants based on the concept of holomorphic bisectional curvature. As applications, we give consequences of the absence of some $D$-minimal CR-submanifolds in almost Hermitian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Compact plane waves with parallel Weyl curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an exposition of recent results -- obtained in joint work with Andrzej Derdzinski -- on essentially conformally symmetric (ECS) manifolds, that is, those pseudo-Riemannian manifolds with parallel Weyl curvature which are not locally symmetric or conformally flat. In the 1970s, Roter proved that while Riemannian ECS manifolds do not exist, pseudo-Riemannian ones do exist in all dimensions $n\geq 4$, and realize all indefinite metric signatures. The local structure of ECS manifolds is known, and every ECS manifold carries a distinguished null parallel distribution $\mathcal{D}$, whose rank is always equal to $1$ or $2$. We review basic facts about ECS manifolds, briefly discuss the construction of compact examples, and outline the proof of a topological structure result: outside of the locally homogeneous case and up to a double covering, every compact rank-one ECS manifold is a bundle over $\mathbb{S}^1$ whose fibers are the leaves of $\mathcal{D}^\perp$. Finally, we mention some classification results for compact rank-one ECS manifolds.</description>

      <title>On the Berwald-Weyl Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Berwald-Weyl curvature which is defined for a spray/Finsler metric with a volume form. We obtain some expressions for the Berwald-Weyl curvature. This quantity is a projective invariant with respect to a fixed volume form. We prove that for any spray of scalar curvature on a manifold of dimension $n\geq 3$, the Berwald-Weyl curvature vanishes with respect to any volume form. We also show that for any Finsler metric of constant Ricci curvature and constant S-curvature, the Berwald-Weyl curvature vanishes with respect to the Busemann-Hausdorff volume form. This study leads to a new notion of BWeyl-flat sprays/Finsler metrics.</description>

      <title>On polynomial convergence to tangent cones for singular K\"ahler-Einstein metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(Z,p)$ be a pointed Gromov-Hausdorff limit of non-collapsing K\"ahler-Einstein metrics with uniformly bounded Ricci curvature. We show that the singular K\"ahler-Einstein metric on $Z$ is conical at $p$ if and only if $\mathcal C=W$ in Donaldson-Sun's two-step degeneration theory, assuming curvature grows at most quadratically near $p$.
  Let $(X,p)$ be a germ of an isolated log terminal algebraic singularity. Following Hein-Sun's approach, we show that if $\mathcal C=W$ in the two-step stable degeneration of $(X,p)$ and $\mathcal C$ has a smooth link, then every singular K\"ahler-Einstein metric on $X$ with non-positive Ricci curvature and bounded potential is conical at $p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the topic of envelopes created by pseudo-circle families in the Minkowski plane, which exhibit some different properties when compared with the Euclidean case. We provide solutions to all four basic problems associated with these envelopes, namely the existence problem, representation problem, problem on the number of envelopes, and problem on the relationships of definitions.</description>

      <title>Geometry and dynamics of Hitchin grafting representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hitchin component of the character variety of representations of a surface group $\pi_1(S)$ into $\mathrm{PSL}_d(\mathbb R)$ for some $d\geq 3$ can be equipped with a pressure metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus equals the Weil-Petersson metric up to a constant factor. We show that if the genus of $S$ is at least $3$, then the Fuchsian locus contains quasi-convex subsets of infinite diameter for the Weil--Petersson metric whose diameter for the path metric of the pressure metric is finite. This is established through showing that biinfinite paths of bending deformations have controlled bounded length. To this end we give a geometric interpretation of Fock--Goncharov positivity and show that bending deformations of Fuchsian representations stabilize a uniform Finsler quasi-convex disk in the symmetric space $\mathrm{PSL}_d(\mathbb R)/\mathrm{PSO}(d)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend calculus from smooth manifolds to topological manifolds making use of a theory of generalized functions developed for this aim. Actually such extension fits into a boarder context: the universal construction of a site containing all continuous maps between topological spaces and whose arrows are smooth in the generalized sense. As an application we prove the existence of non singular generalized tangent vector fields on spheres of any dimension, showing how this result is coherent with the non existence of smooth vector fields on spheres of even dimension. Many other applications are outlined or suggested, some of which are under development by the author.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we introduce and characterize a pseudo generalized Ricci-recurrent spacetimes and produce an example to verify the existence of such a spacetime. Then we demonstrate that a conformally flat generalized Ricci-recurrent spacetime with certain condition is a pseudo quasi-Einstein spacetime. Besides, it is proved that a pseudo generalized Ricci-recurrent generalized Robertson-Walker spacetime represents a perfect fluid spacetime. Lastly, we study the impact of this spacetime under $f(\mathcal{R},T^2)$ and $f\left(\mathcal{R}^{\ast}\right)$ gravity scenario and deduce several energy conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M, \Omega)$ be a holomorphically symplectic manifold equipped with a holomorphic Lagrangian fibration $\pi: M \to B$, and $\eta$ a closed $(1,1)$-form on $B$. Then $\Omega+ \pi^* \eta$ is a holomorphically symplectic form on a complex manifold which is called the degenerate twistor deformation of $M$. We prove that degenerate twistor deformations of compact holomorphically symplectic K\"ahler manifolds are also K\"ahler. First, we prove that degenerate twistor deformations are Hermitian symplectic, that is, tamed by a symplectic form; this is shown using positive currents and an argument based on the Hahn--Banach theorem, originally due to Sullivan. Then we apply a version of Huybrechts's theorem showing that two non-separated points in the Teichm\"uller space of holomorphically symplectic manifolds correspond to bimeromorphic manifolds if they are Hermitian symplectic.</description>

Abstract: Let $M$ be a holomorphically symplectic manifold, equipped with a Lagrangian fibration $\pi:\; M \to X$. A degenerate twistor deformation (sometimes also called "a Tate-Shafarevich twist") is a family of holomorphically symplectic structures on $M$ parametrized by $H^{1,1}(X)$. All members of this family are equipped with a holomorphic Lagrangian projection to $X$, and their fibers are isomorphic to the fibers of $\pi$. Assume that $M$ is a compact hyperkahler manifold of maximal holonomy, and the Lagrangian projection $\pi$ has no multiple fibers in codimension 1. We prove that $M$ has a degenerate twistor deformation $M'$ such that the Lagrangian projection $\pi:\; M' \to X$ admits a meromorphic section.</description>

      <title>On the Dirichlet problem at infinity on three-manifolds of negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that in a three-manifold with finitely many expansive ends, such that each end has a neighborhood where the curvature is bounded above by a negative constant, the Dirichlet problem at infinity is solvable, and hence that such manifolds posses a wealth of bounded non constant harmonic functions (and thus, Liouville's theorem does not hold). In the case of infinitely many expansive ends, we show that if each end has a neighborhood where the curvature is bounded above by a negative constant, then the Dirichlet problem at infinity is solvable for continuous boundary data at infinity which is uniformly bounded. Our method is based on a result that does not require explicit curvature assumptions, and hence it can be applied to other situations: we present an example of a metric on an end with curvature of indefinite sign (no matter how long we go along the end) for which the Dirichlet Problem at Infinity is solvable with respect to that end. We also present a related result in the case of surfaces with a pole which generalises a celebrated criteria of Milnor.</description>

      <title>Boundary rigidity, and non-rigidity, of projective structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02266v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the property of boundary rigidity for the projective structures associated to torsion-free affine connections on connected analytic manifolds with boundary. We show that these structures are generically boundary rigid, meaning that any automorphism of a generic projective structure that restricts to the identity on the boundary must itself be the identity. However, and in contrast with what happens for example for conformal structures, we show that there exist projective structures which are not boundary rigid. We characterise these non-rigid structures by the vanishing of a certain local projective invariant of the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study complex solvmanifolds $\Gamma\backslash G$ with holomorphically trivial canonical bundle. We show that the trivializing section of this bundle can be either invariant or non-invariant by the action of $G$. First we characterize the existence of invariant trivializing sections in terms of the Koszul 1-form $\psi$ canonically associated to $(\mathfrak{g},J)$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is the Lie algebra of $G$, and we use this characterization to produce new examples of complex solvmanifolds with trivial canonical bundle. Moreover, we provide an algebraic obstruction, also in terms of $\psi$, for a complex solvmanifold to have trivial (or more generally holomorphically torsion) canonical bundle. Finally, we exhibit a compact hypercomplex solvmanifold $(M^{4n},\{J_1,J_2,J_3\})$ such that the canonical bundle of $(M,J_{\alpha})$ is trivial only for $\alpha=1$, so that $M$ is not an $\operatorname{SL}(n,\mathbb{H})$-manifold.</description>

      <title>Formal manifolds: foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first paper in a series that studies smooth relative Lie algebra homologies and cohomologies based on the theory of formal manifolds and formal Lie groups. In this paper, we lay the foundations for this study by introducing the notion of formal manifolds in the context of differential geometry, inspired by the notion of formal schemes in algebraic geometry. We develop the basic theory for formal manifolds, and establish a fully faithful contravariant functor from the category of formal manifolds to the category of topological $\mathbb{C}$-algebras. We also prove the existence of finite products in the category of formal manifolds by studying vector-valued formal functions.</description>

      <title>Existence and non-existence of cohomogeneity one Einstein metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper derives sufficient conditions for the existence and non-existence of cohomogeneity one Einstein metrics on double disk bundles of two summands type. These conditions are inequalities that only involve geometric data from the principal orbits. The existence theorem yields five infinite families and ten other sporadic examples of new inhomogeneous Einstein metrics. The non-existence theorem yields five examples whose principal orbits admit invariant Einstein metrics.</description>

      <title>Gauss curvature flow to the $L_p$-Gaussian chord Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Huang and Qin \cite{HY01} introduced the Gaussian chord measure and $L_p$-Gaussian chord measure by variational methods. Meanwhile, they posed Gaussian chord Minkowski problem for $p=1$ and used variational methods to obtain an origin-symmetric normalized measure solution for the Gaussian chord Minkowski problem. The smooth solution, up to now, to the $L_p$-Gaussian chord Minkowski problem is still open.
  Motivated by the forgoing works by Huang and Qin in \cite{HY01}, we propose in the present paper the $L_p(p&gt;0)$-Gaussian chord Minkowski problem and log-Gaussian chord Minkowski problem, and obtain the smooth even solutions to these two types of problems by the method of a Gauss curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Analysis in Space Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a workhorse of modern data science. While PCA assumes the data conforms to Euclidean geometry, for specific data types, such as hierarchical and cyclic data structures, other spaces are more appropriate. We study PCA in space forms; that is, those with constant curvatures. At a point on a Riemannian manifold, we can define a Riemannian affine subspace based on a set of tangent vectors. Finding the optimal low-dimensional affine subspace for given points in a space form amounts to dimensionality reduction. Our Space Form PCA (SFPCA) seeks the affine subspace that best represents a set of manifold-valued points with the minimum projection cost. We propose proper cost functions that enjoy two properties: (1) their optimal affine subspace is the solution to an eigenequation, and (2) optimal affine subspaces of different dimensions form a nested set. These properties provide advances over existing methods, which are mostly iterative algorithms with slow convergence and weaker theoretical guarantees. We evaluate the proposed SFPCA on real and simulated data in spherical and hyperbolic spaces. We show that it outperforms alternative methods in estimating true subspaces (in simulated data) with respect to convergence speed or accuracy, often both.</description>

      <title>$N=(2,2)$ superfields and geometry revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take a fresh look at the relation between generalised K\"ahler geometry and $N=(2,2)$ supersymmetric sigma models in two dimensions formulated in terms of $(2,2)$ superfields. Dual formulations in terms of different kinds of superfield are combined to give a formulation with a doubled target space and both the original superfield and the dual superfield. For K\"ahler geometry, we show that this doubled geometry is Donaldson's deformation of the holomorphic cotangent bundle of the original K\"ahler manifold. This doubled formulation gives an elegant geometric reformulation of the equations of motion. We interpret the equations of motion as the intersection of two Lagrangian submanifolds (or of a Lagrangian submanifold with an isotropic one) in the infinite dimensional symplectic supermanifold which is the analogue of phase space. We then consider further extensions of this formalism, including one in which the geometry is quadrupled, and discuss their geometry.</description>

      <title>Lattices, Gates, and Curves: GKP codes as a Rosetta stone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes are a promising candidate for implementing fault tolerant quantum computation in quantum harmonic oscillator systems such as superconducting resonators, optical photons and trapped ions, and in recent years theoretical and experimental evidence for their utility has steadily grown. It is known that logical Clifford operations on GKP codes can be implemented fault tolerantly using only Gaussian operations, and several theoretical investigations have illuminated their general structure. In this work, we explain how GKP Clifford gates arise as symplectic automorphisms of the corresponding GKP lattice and show how they are identified with the mapping class group of suitable genus $n$ surfaces. This correspondence introduces a topological interpretation of fault tolerance for GKP codes and motivates the connection between GKP codes (lattices), their Clifford gates, and algebraic curves, which we explore in depth. For a single-mode GKP code, we identify the space of all GKP codes with the moduli space of elliptic curves, given by the three sphere with a trefoil knot removed, and explain how logical degrees of freedom arise from the choice of a level structure on the corresponding curves. We discuss how the implementation of Clifford gates corresponds to homotopically nontrivial loops on the space of all GKP codes and show that the modular Rademacher function describes a topological invariant for certain Clifford gates implemented by such loops. Finally, we construct a universal family of GKP codes and show how it gives rise to an explicit construction of fiber bundle fault tolerance as proposed by Gottesman and Zhang for the GKP code. On our path towards understanding this correspondence, we introduce a general algebraic geometric perspective on GKP codes and their moduli spaces, which uncovers a map towards many possible routes of future research.</description>
