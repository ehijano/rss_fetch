      <title>A species of Coprococcus is related to BMI in patients who underwent malabsorptive bariatric surgery and its abundance is modified by magnesium and thiamin intake</title>

Abstract: Background: Morbid obesity is associated with metabolic alterations and the onset of type 2 diabetes. Patients who undergo a malabsorptive bariatric surgery show an important improvement in several clinical variables and a modification in the gut microbiota balance. In this study, we aimed to identify bacteria related to changes in the body mass index of patients who underwent a bariatric surgery and their relationship with nutrients intake. Results: There were differences in bacterial diversity in the gut microbiota of patients that underwent a bariatric surgery. The Shannon and Simpson indexes decrease after the surgery (p &lt; 0.001) and the beta diversity indexes (Bray-Curtis, Weighted and Unweighted UniFrac) showed differences when comparing pre- and post-surgery (p = 0.001). The abundance of a species in the genus Coprococcus correlated positively with the intake of magnesium and thiamin in post-surgery individuals (rho = 0.816, pFDR = 0.029 and rho = 0.812, pFDR = 0.029, respectively) and was related to BMI in both groups (p = 0.043 pre-surgery and p = 0.036 post-surgery). The abundances of several bacteria belonging to the order Clostridiales, as well as an enrichment of vitamin B1 (thiamin) biosynthesis, sugar degradation, acetate production and some amino acids biosynthesis were higher before the surgery. Conclusions: The abundance of a species of the genus Coprococcus that showed inverse relationships with BMI in pre-surgery and post-surgery patients correlates with the intake of magnesium and thiamin in individuals that underwent a malabsorptive bariatric surgery. It indicates that the well-established beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on BMI may be amplified by modulating the intake of micronutrients and its effect on the gut bacterial.</description>

      <title>Exploring zero-shot structure-based protein fitness prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to make zero-shot predictions about the fitness consequences of protein sequence changes with pre-trained machine learning models enables many practical applications. Such models can be applied for downstream tasks like genetic variant interpretation and protein engineering without additional labeled data. The advent of capable protein structure prediction tools has led to the availability of orders of magnitude more precomputed predicted structures, giving rise to powerful structure-based fitness prediction models. Through our experiments, we assess several modeling choices for structure-based models and their effects on downstream fitness prediction. Zero-shot fitness prediction models can struggle to assess the fitness landscape within disordered regions of proteins, those that lack a fixed 3D structure. We confirm the importance of matching protein structures to fitness assays and find that predicted structures for disordered regions can be misleading and affect predictive performance. Lastly, we evaluate an additional structure-based model on the ProteinGym substitution benchmark and show that simple multi-modal ensembles are strong baselines.</description>

      <title>Unified Molecule Generation and Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the joint distribution of the data samples and their properties allows to construct a single model for both data generation and property prediction, with synergistic capabilities reaching beyond purely generative or predictive models. However, training joint models presents daunting architectural and optimization challenges. Here, we propose Hyformer, a transformer-based joint model that successfully blends the generative and predictive functionalities, using an alternating attention mask together with a unified pre-training scheme. We show that Hyformer rivals other joint models, as well as state-of-the-art molecule generation and property prediction models. Additionally, we show the benefits of joint modeling in downstream tasks of molecular representation learning, hit identification and antimicrobial peptide design.</description>

      <title>Simulating biochemical reactions: The Linear Noise Approximation can capture non-linear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a plethora of highly stochastic non-linear dynamical systems in fields such as molecular biology, chemistry, epidemiology, and ecology. Yet, none of the currently available stochastic models are both accurate and computationally efficient for long-term predictions of large systems. The Linear Noise Approximation (LNA) model for biochemical reaction networks is analytically tractable, which makes it computationally efficient for simulation, analysis, and inference. However, it is only accurate for linear systems and short-time transitions. Other methods can achieve greater accuracy across a wider range of systems, including non-linear ones, but lack analytical tractability. This paper seeks to challenge the prevailing view by demonstrating that the Linear Noise Approximation can indeed capture non-linear dynamics after certain modifications. We introduce a new framework that utilises centre manifold theory allowing us to identify simple interventions to the LNA that do not significantly compromise its computational efficiency. We develop specific algorithms for systems that exhibit oscillations or bi-stability and demonstrate their accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple examples.</description>

      <title>Population dynamics of multiple ecDNA types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA) can drive oncogene amplification, gene expression and intratumor heterogeneity, representing a major force in cancer initiation and progression. The phenomenon becomes even more intricate as distinct types of ecDNA present within a single cancer cell. While exciting as a new and significant observation across various cancer types, there is a lack of a general framework capturing the dynamics of multiple ecDNA types theoretically. Here, we present novel mathematical models investigating the proliferation and expansion of multiple ecDNA types in a growing cell population. By switching on and off a single parameter, we model different scenarios including ecDNA species with different oncogenes, genotypes with same oncogenes but different point mutations and phenotypes with identical genetic compositions but different functions. We analyse the fraction of ecDNA-positive and free cells as well as how the mean and variance of the copy number of cells carrying one or more ecDNA types change over time. Our results showed that switching does not play a role in the fraction and copy number distribution of total ecDNA-positive cells, if selection is identical among different ecDNA types. In addition, while cells with multiple ecDNA cannot be maintained in the scenario of ecDNA species without extra fitness advantages, they can persist and even dominate the ecDNA-positive population if switching is possible.</description>
