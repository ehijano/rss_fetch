      <title>Student-Powered Digital Scholarship CoLab Project in the HKUST Library: Develop a Chinese Named-Entity Recognition (NER) Tool within One Semester from the Ground Up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting in February 2024, the HKUST Library further extended the scope of AI literacy to AI utilization, which focuses on fostering student involvement in utilizing state-of-the-art technologies in the projects that initiated by the Library, named "Digital Scholarship (DS) CoLab". A key focus of the DS CoLab scheme has been on cultivating talents and enabling students to utilize advanced technologies in practical context. It aims to reinforce the library's role as a catalyst and hub for fostering multidisciplinary collaboration and cultivate the "can do spirit" among university members. The Library offers 1-2 projects per year for students to engage with advanced technologies in practical contexts while supporting the Library in tackling challenges and streamlining operational tasks. The tool that introduced in this paper was mainly developed by two of the authors, Sherry Yip Sau Lai and Berry Han Liuruo, as part-time student helpers under one of our DS CoLab scheme in the 2024 Spring Semester (February to May 2024). This paper details the complete journey from ideation to implementation of developing a Chinese Named-Entity Recognition (NER) Tool from the group up within one semester, from the initial research and planning stages to execution and come up a viable product. The collaborative spirit fostered by this project, with students playing a central role, exemplifies the power and potential of innovative educational models that prioritize hands-on learning with student involvement.</description>

      <title>Mapping the changing structure of science through diachronic periodical embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the changing structure of science over time is essential to elucidating how science evolves. We develop diachronic embeddings of scholarly periodicals to quantify "semantic changes" of periodicals across decades, allowing us to track the evolution of research topics and identify rapidly developing fields. By mapping periodicals within a physical-life-health triangle, we reveal an evolving interdisciplinary science landscape, finding an overall trend toward specialization for most periodicals but increasing interdisciplinarity for bioscience periodicals. Analyzing a periodical's trajectory within this triangle over time allows us to visualize how its research focus shifts. Furthermore, by monitoring the formation of local clusters of periodicals, we can identify emerging research topics such as AIDS research and nanotechnology in the 1980s. Our work offers novel quantification in the science of science and provides a quantitative lens to examine the evolution of science, which may facilitate future investigations into the emergence and development of research fields.</description>

      <title>Is Journal Citation Indicator a good metric for Art &amp; Humanities Journals currently?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probably Not. Journal Citation Indicator (JCI) was introduced to address the limitations of traditional metrics like the Journal Impact Factor (JIF), particularly its inability to normalize citation impact across different disciplines. This study reveals that JCI faces significant challenges in field normalization for Art &amp; Humanities journals, as evidenced by much lower correlations with a more granular, paper-level metric, CNCI-CT. A detailed analysis of Architecture journals highlights how journal-level misclassification and the interdisciplinary nature of content exacerbate these issues, leading to less reliable evaluations. We recommend improving journal classification systems or adopting paper-level normalization methods, potentially supported by advanced AI techniques, to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of JCI for Art &amp; Humanities disciplines.</description>

      <title>From Content Creation to Citation Inflation: A GenAI Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the presence and impact of questionable, AI-generated academic papers on widely used preprint repositories, with a focus on their role in citation manipulation. Motivated by suspicious patterns observed in publications related to our ongoing research on GenAI-enhanced cybersecurity, we identify clusters of questionable papers and profiles. These papers frequently exhibit minimal technical content, repetitive structure, unverifiable authorship, and mutually reinforcing citation patterns among a recurring set of authors. To assess the feasibility and implications of such practices, we conduct a controlled experiment: generating a fake paper using GenAI, embedding citations to suspected questionable publications, and uploading it to one such repository (ResearchGate). Our findings demonstrate that such papers can bypass platform checks, remain publicly accessible, and contribute to inflating citation metrics like the H-index and i10-index. We present a detailed analysis of the mechanisms involved, highlight systemic weaknesses in content moderation, and offer recommendations for improving platform accountability and preserving academic integrity in the age of GenAI.</description>
