      <title>Uncertainties in interfacial excess calculations from atom probe tomography data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom probe tomography can be used to measure the excess of solute chemical species at internal interfaces, but common protocols do not usually consider the compositional uncertainty of the (usually dilute) solute. Here, general models are derived for the composition profile of a solute segregated to the interface between two grains or phases. This model is fit to experimental data, with the cumulative compositional uncertainty included in the calculation of the interfacial excess. It is shown that the relative uncertainty in the interfacial excess can be large for dilute solutes, even when segregation is obvious in the concentration profile. Different methods for estimating the extent of the boundary provide different estimates for the interfacial excess and its uncertainty. Some strategies are provided for the minimisation of uncertainties in typical data, though ultimately, a typical calculation will be limited by compositional uncertainty arising from the relatively few solute counts in the region-of-interest.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure prediction of medium and high entropy alloys across composition space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose machine learning (ML) models to predict the electron density -- the fundamental unknown of a material's ground state -- across the composition space of concentrated alloys. From this, other physical properties can be inferred, enabling accelerated exploration. A significant challenge is that the number of sampled compositions and descriptors required to accurately predict fields like the electron density increases rapidly with species. To address this, we employ Bayesian Active Learning (AL), which minimizes training data requirements by leveraging uncertainty quantification capabilities of Bayesian Neural Networks. Compared to strategic tessellation of the composition space, Bayesian-AL reduces the number of training data points by a factor of 2.5 for ternary (SiGeSn) and 1.7 for quaternary (CrFeCoNi) systems. We also introduce easy-to-optimize, body-attached-frame descriptors, which respect physical symmetries and maintain approximately the same descriptor-vector size as alloy elements increase. Our ML models demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability in predicting both electron density and energy across composition space.</description>

      <title>Neutron absorption correction and mean path length calculations for multiple samples with arbitrary shapes -- applications to highly absorbing samples on the Multi-Axis Crystal Spectrometer at NIST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite volume algorithm for absorption correction developed by Wunch and Prewitt is examined. This algorithm is based on the numerical integration of the transmission function where three-dimensional quadratic surfaces define the sample boundaries. The algorithm can also calculate the mean path length required for second-extinction calculations. We apply this method to the neutron inelastic scattering measurements of CeRhIn$_{5}$ using the Multi-Axis Crystal Spectrometer (MACS) at NIST. The algorithm has been expanded to correct the absorption of multiple coaligned samples. We show that this procedure can account for the angular-dependent absorption, and the technique can be used to correct data and plan experiments.</description>

      <title>Influencing Optical and Charge Transport Properties by Controlling the Molecular Interactions of Merocyanine Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In organic semiconductors charge transport typically takes place via slow hopping processes. Molecular aggregation can lead to enhanced exciton and charge transport through coupling of the transition dipole moments. In this work, we investigate the optical, morphological, and electronic properties of thin films of a merocyanine dye, that aggregates due to its high ground-state dipole moment. The degree of aggregation of spin-coated thin films can be easily tuned by thermal annealing. We demonstrate the relationship between charge carrier mobility and the degree of aggregation. The mobility is increased by approximately three orders of magnitude due to aggregation. We combine variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry and polarization-resolved absorption spectroscopy with density functional theory to demonstrate that the aggregated molecules are oriented in an upright, standing configuration relative to the substrate surface. This arrangement involves a co-facial orientation of the molecular pi-systems which is advantageous for lateral charge transport. By utilizing highly oriented pyrolytic graphite as an ordered substrate, we are able to template the growth of the merocyanine layer in vapor phase deposition, and to improve the in-plane morphological order drastically. By correlating atomic force microscopy and photoluminescence microspectroscopy we observe oriented domains of 100s of {\mu}m^2 in size, emitting linearly polarized light, whereby maintaining the edge-on molecular arrangement. This promises a further significant enhancement of lateral charge carrier mobility.</description>

      <title>A continuum, computational study of morphogenesis in lithium intermetallic interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of solid state batteries with lithium anodes is attracting attention for the prospect of high capacity and improved safety over liquid electrolyte systems. The nature of transport with lithium as the current carrier has as a consequence the accretion or stripping away of the anode with every charge-discharge cycle. While this poses challenges from the growth of protrusions (dendrites) to loss of contact, there lurks an opportunity: Morphogenesis at the anode-electrolyte interface layer can be studied, and may ultimately be controlled as a factor in solid state battery design. The accessible interface morphologies, the dynamic paths to them, and mechanisms to control them expand considerably if lithium alloys are introduced in the anode. The thermodynamics and kinetics of lithium intermetallics present principled approaches for morphogenic interface design. In this communication we adopt a computational approach to such an exploration. With phase field models that are parameterized by a combination of first principles atomistic calculations and experiments, we present phenomenological studies of two lithium intermetallics: Li-Mg and Li-Zn. An array of parametric investigations follows on the influence of kinetics, charge-discharge rate, cycling, transport mechanisms and grain structure. The emphasis across these computations is on the dynamic morphogenesis of the intermetallic interface. Specifically, the plating, segregation and smooth distribution of Li, Mg and Zn, the growth and disappearance of voids, evolution of solid electrolyte-anode contact area, and grain boundary structure are investigated. The computational platform is a framework for future studies of morphogenic electrolyte-anode interfaces with more extensive inputs from first principles atomistics and experiments.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the electronic properties of TiO$_2$ monolayers for solar driven catalysis through transition metal doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Substitutional doping with transition metals is carried out in the Lepidocrocite phase - the stable monolayer geometry of TiO$_2$, using density functional theory (DFT) methods. The doping is carried out at the differently coordinated O atom cites, producing Janus monolayer geometries. Our results indicate that key fundamental properties for photocatalysis can be tuned via doping. Monolayers doped with Ag, Au, Pd and Pt are thermodynamically stable, amongst all considered doping possibilities, as evident from phonon band structure calculations. Electronic structure of the Janus monolayers alters significantly, compared to pristine TiO$_2$, owing to the emergence of mid-gap states. Reduced band gap arises from upward shift of the valence band, suggesting enhanced visible-light response. Dopant atoms also introduce excess electrons in TiO$_2$ monolayers, which are found to localize at a single Ti site. This induces ferromagnetism in the doped monolayers. Furthermore, charge separation between TiO$_2$ and noble metal dopants is observed which is a key parameter in influencing the selectivity and activity of photocatalytic materials. Compared to the pristine TiO$_2$ monolayer, the Janus structure can promote water adsorption, and the Janus monolayers exhibit significantly improved activity in the hydrogen evolution reaction. These findings suggest that engineering a novel Janus TiO$_2$-based monolayer with a noble metal layer on the other surface can offer a potential approach to improve photocatalytic performance over pristine TiO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Formation of Micrometer-Sized Textured Hexagonal Silicon Crystals via Nanoindentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study on the formation of micrometer-sized, textured hexagonal diamond silicon (hd-Si) crystals via nanoindentation followed by annealing. Utilizing advanced characterization techniques such as polarized Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, we demonstrate the successful transformation of silicon into high-quality hd-Si. The experimental results are further supported by first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. Notably, the hd-Si phase consists of nanometer-sized grains with slight misorientations, organized into large micrometer-scale textured domains. These findings underscore the potential of nanoindentation as a precise and versatile tool for inducing pressure-driven phase transformations, particularly for the stabilization of hexagonal silicon. The textured nature of hd-Si also presents a unique opportunity to tailor its optical properties, opening new avenues for its application in semiconductor and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Networks for High-Entropy Alloys Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A wide range of deep learning-based machine learning techniques are extensively applied to the design of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), yielding numerous valuable insights. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) is a recently developed architecture that aims to improve both the accuracy and interpretability of input features. In this work, we explore three different datasets for HEA design and demonstrate the application of KAN for both classification and regression models. In the first example, we use a KAN classification model to predict the probability of single-phase formation in high-entropy carbide ceramics based on various properties such as mixing enthalpy and valence electron concentration. In the second example, we employ a KAN regression model to predict the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of HEAs based on their chemical composition and process conditions including annealing time, cold rolling percentage, and homogenization temperature. The third example involves a KAN classification model to determine whether a certain composition is an HEA or non-HEA, followed by a KAN regressor model to predict the bulk modulus of the identified HEA, aiming to identify HEAs with high bulk modulus. In all three examples, KAN either outperform or match the performance in terms of accuracy such as F1 score for classification and Mean Square Error (MSE), and coefficient of determination (R2) for regression of the multilayer perceptron (MLP) by demonstrating the efficacy of KAN in handling both classification and regression tasks. We provide a promising direction for future research to explore advanced machine learning techniques, which lead to more accurate predictions and better interpretability of complex materials, ultimately accelerating the discovery and optimization of HEAs with desirable properties.</description>

      <title>Heat transfer enhancement of N-Ga-Al semiconductors heterogeneous interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transfer enhancement of N-Ga-Al semiconductor heterostructure interfaces is critical for the heat dissipation in GaN-based electronic devices, while the effect of the AlxGa(1-x)N transition layer component concentration and thickness on the heat transfer mechanism at the GaN-AlN interface is unclear. In this paper, using molecular dynamics simulations based on machine learning potentials, the interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) between GaN-AlxGa(1-x)N, AlN-AlxGa(1-x)N and GaN-AlxGa(1-x)N-AlN heterostructure interfaces are calculated for different transition layer thicknesses with different concentrations of Al fractions, and the reasons for the change of ITC and its heat transfer mechanism were explained by the phonon density of states and the spectral heat current. GaN-AlN heterostructure ITC at 300 K is calculated to be 557 MW/(m2K), and the ITCs of GaN-Al0.5Ga0.5N and AlN-Al0.5Ga0.5N are improved by 128% and 229% compared to GaN-AlN, whereas the ITCs of GaN-Al0.7Ga0.3N-AlN containing a 0.5 nm transition layer improved by 27.6%. This is because elemental doping enhances phonon scattering near the interface thereby promoting phonon energy redistribution, but the bulk thermal resistance of the AlxGa(1-x)N layer also increases rapidly with increasing doping ratio, and ITC is affected by a combination of these two factors. This work aims to understand the mechanism of transition layer component concentration and thickness on the heat transfer at the GaN-AlN contact interface, which provides a useful guide for better thermal design of the GaN-AlN heterostructure interface.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure at the Perovskite Rubrene Interface: The Effect of Surface Termination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite films have rapidly emerged as leading active materials in optoelectronic devices due to their strong optical absorption, high carrier mobility and ease of fabrication. Whilst proving to be promising materials for solar cells and light-emitting diodes, another application of perovskites which makes effective use of their unique properties is sensitisation for photon upconversion. Consisting of a bulk perovskite sensitiser alongside an adjacent organic semiconductor film, the upconverting system can absorb multiple low-energy photons to emit high-energy photons. In this work, density functional theory, in conjunction with GW theory, is utilised to investigate the electronic structure at the MAPbI$_3$/rubrene interface for different surface terminations of MAPbI$_3$. From this investigation, we reveal that the surface termination of the perovskite layer greatly affects the charge density at the interface and within the rubrene layer driven by the formation of interfacial dipole layers. The formation of a strong interfacial dipole for the lead-iodide terminated perovskite alters the band alignment of the heterojunction and is expected to facilitate more efficient hole transfer. For the perovskite surface terminated with the methylammonium iodide layer, the highest occupied molecular orbital of the adjacent rubrene layer lies deep within the perovskite band gap. This termination type is further characterized by a lower density of states near the band edges thereby acting as a spacer which is anticipated to decrease the probability of charge transfer across the interface. Thus based on our results, PbI$_2$-terminated perovskite surfaces are predicted to be favourable for applications where hole transfer to a rubrene layer is ideal, highlighting the significance of surface termination for all systems where the electronic environment at the interface is crucial to performance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Constraint Integration for Simultaneously Optimizing Crystal Structures with Multiple Targeted Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In materials science, finding crystal structures that have targeted properties is crucial. While recent methodologies such as Bayesian optimization and deep generative models have made some advances on this issue, these methods often face difficulties in adaptively incorporating various constraints, such as electrical neutrality and targeted properties optimization, while keeping the desired specific crystal structure. To address these challenges, we have developed the Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive Crystal Synthesizer (SMOACS), which utilizes state-of-the-art property prediction models and their gradients to directly optimize input crystal structures for targeted properties simultaneously. SMOACS enables the integration of adaptive constraints into the optimization process without necessitating model retraining. Thanks to this feature, SMOACS has succeeded in simultaneously optimizing targeted properties while maintaining perovskite structures, even with models trained on diverse crystal types. We have demonstrated the band gap optimization while meeting a challenging constraint, that is, maintaining electrical neutrality in large atomic configurations up to 135 atom sites, where the verification of the electrical neutrality is challenging. The properties of the most promising materials have been confirmed by density functional theory calculations.</description>

      <title>Thermochromic Properties of 3C-, 6H- and 4H-SiC Polytypes up to 500$^\circ$C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermochromic properties (color change with temperature) of n type doped SiC wafers of different polytypes (3C, 4H and 6H) have been investigated up to 500$^\circ$C under air. It was found that 3C-SiC color passes from bright yellow at room temperature to deep orangeat 500$^\circ$C leading to a color contrast ($\Delta$E) as high as 64. The hexagonal polytypes undergo also a color change upon heating but far less pronounced, with $\Delta$E values &lt;20. All these semiconductors undergo band gap shrinkage upon heating which effect largely participated to the observed color change. This effect is very sensitive for 3C polytypesince its bandgap is already in the visible energy range at room temperature. The thermochromicity of 3C-SiC was found to be reversible thanks to its thermal stability and its resistance towards oxidation.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic and Quantum Effects on the Vibrational and Superconducting Properties of Fm-3m and I43d NbH3 Under High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-principles calculations are employed to explore the influence of quantum ionic fluctuations and lattice anharmonicity on the crystal structure and superconductivity of Fm-3m and I43d NbH3 under pressures ranging from 100 to 300 GPa for the Fm-3m-NbH3 and 187 GPa for the I43d-NbH3, employing the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. The study predicts corrections to the crystal lattice parameters, phonon spectra, superconductivity and the phase transition order under high pressure. Our calculations, based on the self-consistent harmonic approximation method that extends beyond perturbation theory to include anharmonicity, indicate that the Fm-3m phase remains dynamically stable up to at least 145 GPa, which is approximately 145 GPa lower than the pressures predicted by the harmonic approximation. Furthermore, the structure with the I43d space group is found to be dynamically unstable with our anharmonic treatment. The electron-phonon coupling constants ({\lambda}) for Fm3 m NbH3 are suppressed by pressure from 2.14 at 167 GPa to 1.65 at 227 GPa. Notably, this reduction in {\lambda} does not lead to a rapid decrease in the critical temperature (Tc). The anharmonic Tc values obtained from the McMillan equation for Fm-3m NbH3 are in good agreement with experimental findings. These results underscore the pivotal role of quantum anharmonic effects in stabilizing the Fm-3m phase and determining the phase transition order in NbH3.</description>

      <title>Relation between rare-earth magnetism and the magnetocaloric effect in multiferroic hexagonal manganites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetocaloric effect enables magnetic refrigeration and plays an important role for cooling at cryogenic temperatures, which is essential for emergent technologies such as hydrogen liquefaction and quantum computing. Here, we study the magnetocaloric effect in multiferroic hexagonal manganites by conducting direct adiabatic temperature measurements in pulsed magnetic fields exceeding 20 T. Data gained on polycrystalline HoMnO3, ErMnO3, TmMnO3, and YMnO3 demonstrate a direct correlation between the magnetic 4f-moments and the measured adiabatic temperature change. In HoMnO3, i.e., the system with the largest magnetic 4f-moments, significant temperature changes, {\Delta}Tad, of up to 20.1 K are observed, whereas the effect is largely suppressed in YMnO3. Our systematic investigations show the importance of the rare-earth magnetism for the magnetocaloric effect in multiferroic hexagonal manganites at cryogenic temperatures, reaching about 64% of the adiabatic temperature changes reported for gadolinium at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Oxygen vacancies in BaTiO3 based ferroelectrics: electron doping, history dependence of Tc and domain wall pinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the complex Young's modulus of BaTiO3-d, BaxSr1-xTi3-d (BST) and Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3-d (BCTZ) during heating and cooling runs at various O deficiencies and aging times. The elastic energy loss has peaks due to the jumps of isolated O vacancies (VO) and reorientations of pairs of VO in the paraelectric phase, from which the respective rates and activation energies are measured. These rates control the mechanisms of domain clamping, pinning, fatigue, and anything related to the VO mobility. In the ferroelectric (FE) phase, the drop of the losses due to the domain wall motion upon introduction of VO monitors the degree of pinning. In addition, large shifts of Tc are observed at the same value of d upon varying the permanence time in the FE state, up to DTc = 21K in BST, while no aging effect is found in BCTZ.
  The phenomenology is explained by considering that Tc is depressed mainly by the mobile electrons doped by VO. Each isolated VO dopes two electrons as itinerant Ti^3+ ions, but, when it forms a stable linear VO-Ti^2+-VO pair, the two electrons of the Ti^2+ are subtracted from the mobile ones, halving doping. The rise of Tc during the initial aging is then explained in terms of the progressive aggregation of the VO. Prolonging aging for years leads to a decrease of Tc, explained assuming that the most stable position of a VO is at 90^o domain walls, whose geometry is incompatible with the pairs. Then, after enough time the initially aggregated VO within the domains dissociate to decorate the 90^o walls, increasing doping and lowering Tc.
  The absence of such effects in BCTZ is due to larger activation energy for pair reorientation and pair binding energy. Then, at room temperature practically all VO are paired and static over a time scale of hundreds of years, explaining the superior resistance of BCTZ to fatigue.</description>

      <title>A unified quantum framework for electrons and ions: The self-consistent harmonic approximation on a neural network curved manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical solution of the many-body problem of interacting electrons and ions beyond the adiabatic approximation is a key challenge in condensed matter physics, chemistry, and materials science. Traditional methods to solve the multi-component quantum Hamiltonian tend to be specialized electrons or ions and can suffer from a methodological gap when applied to both electrons and ions simultaneously. In addition, ionic techniques often limited as $T\to$ 0K, whereas electronic methods are designed for 0K. Thus, efficient strategies that simultaneously address the thermal fluctuations of ions at ambient temperature without struggling to describe the electronic quantum state from first principles are missing.
  This work extends the self-consistent harmonic approximation for the ions to include also the electrons. The approach minimizes the total free energy by optimizing an \emph{ansatz} density matrix, solving a fermionic self-consistent harmonic Hamiltonian on a curved manifold, which is parametrized through a neural network. We demonstrate that this approach, designed initially for a flat Cartesian space to treat quantum nuclei at finite temperatures, can efficiently tackle both the ground and excited state properties of electronic systems, thus paving the way to a unified quantum description for electrons and atomic nuclei. Importantly, this approach preserves an analytical expression for entropy, enabling the direct computation of free energies and phase diagrams of materials.
  We benchmark the numerical implementation in several prototypical cases, proving that it captures quantum tunneling, electron-ion cusps, and static electronic correlations in the dissociation of H$_2$, where other mean-field approaches fail.</description>

      <title>How Semilocal Are Semilocal Density Functional Approximations? -Tackling Self-Interaction Error in One-Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-interaction error (SIE), arising from the imperfect cancellation of the spurious classical Coulomb interaction between an electron and itself, is a persistent challenge in modern density functional approximations. This issue is illustrated using the prototypical one-electron system $H_2^+$. While significant efforts have been made to eliminate SIE through the development of computationally expensive nonlocal density functionals, it is equally important to explore whether SIE can be mitigated within the framework of more efficient semilocal density functionals. In this study, we present a non-empirical meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) that incorporates the Laplacian of the electron density. Our results demonstrate that the meta-GGA significantly reduces SIE, yielding a binding energy curve for $H_2^+$ that matches the exact solution at equilibrium and improves across a broad range of bond lengths over those of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) and strongly-constrained and appropriately-normed (SCAN) semilocal density functionals. This advancement paves the way for further development within the realm of semilocal approximations.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning framework for accelerating spin-lattice relaxation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular and lattice vibrations are able to couple to the spin of electrons and lead to their relaxation and decoherence. Ab initio simulations have played a fundamental role in shaping our understanding of this process but further progress is hindered by their high computational cost. Here we present an accelerated computational framework based on machine-learning models for the prediction of molecular vibrations and spin-phonon coupling coefficients. We apply this method to three open-shell coordination compounds exhibiting long relaxation times and show that this approach achieves semi-to-full quantitative agreement with ab initio methods reducing the computational cost by about 80%. Moreover, we show that this framework naturally extends to molecular dynamics simulations, paving the way to the study of spin relaxation in condensed matter beyond simple equilibrium harmonic thermal baths.</description>

      <title>Spontaneously formed phonon frequency combs in van der Waals solid CrXTe$_3$ (X=Ge,Si)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical phonon engineering through nonlinear effects has been utilized in ultrafast control of material properties. However, nonlinear optical phonons typically exhibit rapid decay due to strong mode-mode couplings, limiting their effectiveness in temperature or frequency sensitive applications. In this study, we report the observation of long-lived nonlinear optical phonons through the spontaneous formation of phonon frequency combs in the van der Waals material CrXTe$_3$ (X=Ge, Si) using high-resolution Raman scattering. Unlike conventional optical phonons, the highest $A_g$ mode in CrGeTe$_3$ splits into equidistant, sharp peaks forming a frequency comb that persists for hundreds of oscillations and survives up to 100K before decaying. These modes correspond to localized oscillations of Ge$_2$Te$_6$ clusters, isolated from Cr hexagons, behaving as independent quantum oscillators. Introducing a cubic nonlinear term to the harmonic oscillator model, we simulate the phonon time evolution and successfully replicate the observed comb structure. Similar frequency comb behavior is observed in CrSiTe$_3$, demonstrating the generalizability of this phenomenon. Our findings reveal that Raman scattering effectively probes high-frequency nonlinear phonon modes, providing new insight into generating long-lived, tunable phonon frequency combs with applications in ultrafast material control and phonon-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulation of 2D Transducers Based on Suspended Graphene-Based Heterostructures in Nanoelectromechanical Pressure Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene-based 2D heterostructures exhibit excellent mechanical and electrical properties, which are expected to exhibit better performances than graphene for nanoelectromechanical pressure sensors. Here, we built the pressure sensor models based on suspended heterostructures of graphene/h-BN, graphene/MoS2, and graphene/MoSe2 by using COMSOL Multiphysics finite element software. We found that suspended circular 2D membranes show the best sensitivity to pressures compared to rectangular and square ones. We simulated the deflections, strains, resonant frequencies, and Young's moduli of suspended graphene-based heterostructures under the conditions of different applied pressures and geometrical sizes, built-in tensions, and the number of atomic layers of 2D membranes. The Young's moduli of 2D heterostructures of graphene, graphene/h-BN, graphene/MoS2, and graphene/MoSe2 were estimated to be 1.001TPa, 921.08 GPa, 551.11 GPa, and 475.68 GPa, respectively. We also discuss the effect of highly asymmetric cavities on device performance. These results would contribute to the understanding of the mechanical properties of graphene-based heterostructures and would be helpful for the design and manufacture of high-performance NEMS pressure sensors.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Complex Relationships in Thermoreflectance Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermoreflectance techniques, such as time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR), frequency-domain thermoreflectance (FDTR), and the square-pulsed source (SPS) method, are essential for characterizing the thermal properties of bulk and thin-film materials. However, interpreting the signals of these techniques is often complicated by the intricate interdependencies of experimental variables. In this study, we introduce a novel framework based on singular value decomposition (SVD) to systematically unravel these complex relationships. By applying SVD to the sensitivity matrix, we identify critical combined parameters that define the maximum number of reliably extractable variables in thermoreflectance experiments. We validate our approach through measurements on a GaN/Si heterostructure, comparing the performance of TDTR, FDTR, and SPS in extracting key thermal properties. Our results demonstrate that the SPS method offers superior decoupling of parameters, allowing for more accurate simultaneous determination of thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and interfacial thermal conductance. This work provides a deeper understanding of heat transfer in multilayer systems and offers a robust methodology for improving the precision of thermal property measurements across a wide range of materials, paving the way for advancements in both fundamental research and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Band Topology in Twisted Bilayer Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topologically protected corner states serve as a key indicator for two-dimensional higher-order topological insulators, yet they have not been experimentally identified in realistic materials. Here, by utilizing the effective tight-binding model and symmetry arguments, we establish a connection between higher-order topological insulators and twisted bilayer kagome lattices. We find that the topologically nontrivial bulk band gap arises in the twisted bilayer kagome lattice system due to twist-induced intervalley scattering, leading to the emergence of higher-order topological insulators with a range of commensurate twist angles, and the higher-order band topology is verified by the second Stiefel-Whitney number and fractionally quantized corner charges. Moreover, we investigate the influence of disorder and charge density wave order on the stability of higher-order topological insulator phases. The results show that the corner states of twisted bilayer kagome lattice systems are robust with respect to disorder and charge density wave. Our work not only provides a feasible approach to realize the readily controllable higher-order topological insulator phases by employing a simple twist technique, but also demonstrates that the twisted bilayer kagome lattice systems exhibit the robustness of higher-order band topology, making it feasible to check above prediction in experiments.</description>

      <title>Universality Class Transition Across the Helimagnetic Ordering in Te-doped Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ is a multiferroic insulating chiral magnet which exhibits various magnetic orderings at different conditions. The positions of these magnetic phase transitions are known to be sensitive to chemical substitution. Here, we present a universality class analysis of the Cu$_2$OSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$O$_3$ with $(0\leq x \leq 0.1)$. Tellurium is a non-magnetic ion which, upon substitution into the selenium positions of the structure, applies a positive chemical pressure and expands the crystal lattice. Our SANS and magnetometry data indicate that Te inclusion lowers the paramagnetic to helical ordering temperature and the critical field required for the conical to field polarised phase transition. By using the Heat-map Modified Iteration Method that evaluates critical behaviour on both sides of the transition, we show that the Heisenberg to Ising universality class transition of the initial ordering is robust to internal chemical pressure. Additionally, we attribute the decreases with doping in both critical temperature and critical field to be due to decreases in the strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Symmetric Exchange Interactions.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Discovery of Kagome Materials in Transition Metal Oxide Monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome materials have been found to exhibit exotic physical properties such as spin frustration, charge density waves, and unconventional superconductivity. However, the number of materials with kagome lattice-related properties discovered so far is relatively small, limiting the exploration of the physical phenomena associated with kagome materials. Due to the weaker interlayer coupling in two-dimensional kagome materials, they are more likely to exhibit kagome lattice-related physical properties. Therefore, the search for potential two-dimensional kagome materials is crucial for understanding the underlying physics of kagome lattices. In this work, we performed high-throughput workflow to discover thermodynamically stable kagome transition metal oxide monolayers based on "1+3" strategy. Starting from a pool of 349 candidate materials, we identified 12 globally stable kagome monolayers, including both magnetic and non-magnetic structures. These monolayers were classified into four categories based on their electronic structures, lattice types, symmetry, band gaps, and magnetic properties. A detailed analysis was performed on kagome structures exhibiting band features near the Fermi level. This study demonstrates the feasibility of the "1+3" strategy in constructing kagome lattices, providing a pathway for further theoretical and experimental exploration of kagome materials and their potential quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Snap and Jump: How Elastic Shells Pop Out</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grip, walk, crawl, and jump. Soft robots are integrated functional structures composed of compliant mechanisms, whose activity spans various industrial applications such as surgery, healthcare, surveillance, and even planetary exploration. One of their promising mobility mechanism is snap-buckling; the instability mode of flexible structures passing from one equilibrium state to another can instantaneously generate large power for its motion. Predicting their performance with even simple geometry requires disentangling material, geometric nonlinearity, and contact, thereby still being a challenging problem to date. Here, we study the jumping dynamics of hemispherical elastic shells driven by snap-buckling, as a model system of soft jumping mechanisms, combining experiments, simulations, and analytical theory. We find that the contact transition dynamics trigger the jumping phenomenon upon snap-buckling by constructing the analytical predictions with shell elasticity in excellent agreement with both experiments and simulations. Despite the simple geometry of the shell, its dynamical performance primarily relies on a complex interplay between elasticity, geometry, and contact friction. By elucidating the dynamics of the building blocks of soft robots that undergo large deformations, we can build their predictive experimental and numerical framework. Our research paves the way for designing soft robots suitable for the required loading conditions or structural requirements without empirical methods.</description>

      <title>Superconducting memory and trapped magnetic flux in ternary lanthanum polyhydrides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting memory is a promising technology for data storage because of its speed, high energy efficiency, non-volatility, and compatibility with quantum computing devices. However, the need for cryogenic temperatures makes superconducting memory an extremely expensive and specialized device. Ternary lanthanum polyhydrides, due to their high critical temperatures of 240-250 K, represent a convenient platform for studying effects associated with superconductivity in disordered granular systems. In this work, we investigate a trapped magnetic flux and memory effects in recently discovered lanthanum-neodymium (La,Nd)H$_{10}$ and lanthanum-scandium (La,Sc)H$_{12}$ superhydrides at a pressure of 175-196 GPa. We use a steady magnetic field of a few Tesla (T) and strong pulsed fields up to 68 T to create the trapped flux state in the compressed superhydrides. A study of the current-voltage characteristics and voltage-temperature curves of the samples with frozen magnetic flux indicates a significant memory effect in La-Sc polyhydrides already at 225-230 K.</description>

Abstract: Thanks to their record high refractive index and giant optical anisotropy, van der Waals (vdW) materials have accelerated the development of nanophotonics. However, traditional high refractive index materials, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), still dominate in the most important visible range. This is due to the current lack of transparent vdW materials across the entire visible spectrum. In this context, we propose that germanium disulfide (GeS2) could offer a significant breakthrough. With its high refractive index, negligible losses, and biaxial optical anisotropy across the whole visible range, GeS2 has the potential to complement TiO2 and close the application gap of vdW materials in the visible spectrum. The addition of GeS2 could have a profound impact on the design of van der Waals nanophotonic circuits for any operation wavelength from ultraviolet to infrared, emphasizing the significance of the potential impact of GeS2 on the field of nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Constrained Generation of Diverse Low-Bandgap Molecules with Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>

Abstract: Organic optoelectronic materials are a promising avenue for next-generation electronic devices due to their solution processability, mechanical flexibility, and tunable electronic properties. In particular, near-infrared (NIR) sensitive molecules have unique applications in night-vision equipment and biomedical imaging. Molecular engineering has played a crucial role in developing non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) such as the Y-series molecules, which have significantly improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells and enhanced spectral coverage in the NIR region. However, systematically designing molecules with targeted optoelectronic properties while ensuring synthetic accessibility remains a challenge. To address this, we leverage structural priors from domain-focused, patent-mined datasets of organic electronic molecules using a symmetry-aware fragment decomposition algorithm and a fragment-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) generator. Our approach generates candidates that retain symmetry constraints from the patent dataset, while also exhibiting red-shifted absorption, as validated by TD-DFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the potential of BCN-Biphenylene monolayer as a high-performance anode material for alkali metal ion batteries: A first-principles study</title>

Abstract: Inspired by a freshly synthesized two-dimensional biphenylene carbon network, which features a captivating combination of hexagonal, square, and octagonal rings, we explored a similar biphenylene network composed of boron, carbon, and nitrogen (bpn-BCN) using first-principles calculations. There are six possible phases of borocarbonitrides, which are isoelectronic to biphenylene carbon networks with a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1:1 for boron (B), carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) atoms. All possible isoelectronic structures of the BCN combination of biphenylene networks are found to be stable, according to first-principles calculations. Furthermore, we employed first-principles calculations to investigate the electrochemical properties of the most stable geometry of BCN biphenylene as a potential anode material for alkali metal (AM) ion batteries. The electronic properties of the stable phase of bpn-BCN reveal its narrow bandgap semiconductor nature. The ion diffusion calculations show a low activation barrier for Li, Na, and K of 0.65 eV, 0.26 eV, and 0.23 eV, respectively, indicating a fast charge/discharge rate. Furthermore, the theoretical capacities of the BCN biphenylene monolayer for Li (1057.33 mAh/g), Na (647.27 mAh/g), and K (465.98 mAh/g) are found to be greater than those of commercial graphite. The average open-circuit voltage for AM decreases with increasing metal ion concentrations. It falls within a reasonable range of 0.34 to 1.89 V. Our results show that the BCN biphenylene monolayer could be a promising anode material in alkali metal ion rechargeable batteries.</description>

      <title>Polarization Pinning at Antiphase Boundaries in Multiferroic YbFeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The switching characteristics of ferroelectrics and multiferroics are influenced by the interaction of topological defects with domain-walls. We report on the pinning of polarization due to antiphase boundaries in thin films of the multiferroic hexagonal YbFeO$_3$. We have directly resolved the atomic structure of a sharp antiphase boundary (APB) in YbFeO$_3$ thin films using a combination of aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and total energy calculations based on density-functional theory (DFT). We find the presence of a layer of FeO$_6$ octahedra at the APB that bridge the adjacent domains. STEM imaging shows a reversal in the direction of polarization on moving across the APB, which DFT calculations confirm is structural in nature as the polarization reversal reduces the distortion of the FeO$_6$ octahedral layer at the APB. Such APBs in hexagonal perovskites are expected to serve as domain-wall pinning sites and hinder ferroelectric switching of the domains.</description>

      <title>Domain wall reactions in multiple-order parameter ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of domain walls is crucial for ferroelectric switching. Conventionally, the switching dynamics is believed to be determined by the motion of one or a few low-energy domain wall types of dominant population. Here, we challenge this conventional idea in multiple-order-parameter ferroelectrics. Using hafnia as example, we show that multiple-order-parameter nature not only provides various mobile domain walls and defect-like immobile domain walls, but also enables the domain wall reactions. In analogy with chemical reactions where substances react to form new substances, domain walls could also react to form other domain walls during switching. We identify several elementary domain wall reaction types including synthesis, decomposition, and exchange reactions. Domain walls are continually changed by these reactions during switching so that the switching behavior reflects the statistical average of many domain wall types with distinct mobility and stability. These reactions also lead to phenomenon like remanent nuclei and defect site nucleation that facilitate switching and lower coercive field. Finally, the concept of domain wall reaction is not limited to hafnia but can be generalized to any multiple-order-parameter ferroelectric. This work conceptualizes domain wall reaction, expands theory of ferroelectric switching, and suggests a practical way for defect engineering to control switching behavior.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity-Driven Metallicity and Magnetic Skyrmions in van der Waals Cr2Ge2Te6/Hf2Ge2Te6 Multiferroic Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) multiferroic heterostructures present a promising platform for advanced spin devices by leveraging the coexisting ferromagnetic (FM) and ferroelectric (FE) orders. Through first-principles calculations and micromagnetic simulations, we reveal non-volatile control of metallicity and topological spin textures in the Cr2Ge2Te6/Hf2Ge2Te6(CGT/HGT) heterostructure. Notably, manipulating ferroelectric polarization in HGT significantly modulates the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) of CGT/HGT, reversing the easy magnetization axis from in-plane to out-of-plane. By analyzing the atomic-resolved SOC energy (\Delta Esoc), it is found that the cause of the change comes from the Fert-Levy mechanism. Additionally, this polarization control enables the creation and annihilation of bimerons and skyrmions, with interlayer sliding further altering magnetic ordering. Our findings offer valuable insights into magnetoelectric coupling and spin texture manipulation in 2D magnets, highlighting their potential for next-generation spintronic and memory devices.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Face-Dependent Ice Growth Kinetics: Insights from Molecular Dynamics on the Basal and Prism Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ice nucleation and growth are critical in many fields, including atmospheric science, cryobiology, and aviation. However, understanding the detailed mechanisms of ice crystal growth remains challenging. In this work, crystallization at the ice/quasi-liquid layer (QLL) interface of the basal and primary prism (prism1) surfaces of hexagonal ice (Ih) was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations across a wide range of temperatures for the TIP4P/Ice model, with comparisons to the mW coarse-grained model. Together with elucidating the temperature-dependent mechanisms of crystallization, face-specific growth rates were systematically estimated. While the prism surface generally exhibits faster growth rates than the basal surface, a temperature-dependent crossover in growth rates between the basal and prism surfaces is observed in TIP4P/Ice simulations, which correlates with a crossover in QLL thickness and with the well-known column to platelets transition in ice-crystal habits at low vapour pressure. This observation helps decode the complex dependence between crystal morphology and temperature in ice crystals.</description>

      <title>Si/AlN p-n heterojunction interfaced with ultrathin SiO2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) materials hold immense potential for high-power RF electronics and deep ultraviolet photonics. Among these, AlGaN emerges as a promising candidate, offering a tunable bandgap from 3.4 eV (GaN) to 6.1 eV (AlN) and remarkable material characteristics. However, achieving efficient p-type doping in high aluminum composition AlGaN remains a formidable challenge. This study presents an alternative approach to address this issue by fabricating a p+ Si/n-AlN/n+ AlGaN heterojunction structure by following the semiconductor grafting technique. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis revealed that the AlN and the nanomembrane surface exhibited a smooth topography with a roughness of 1.96 nm and 0.545 nm, respectively. High-angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) confirmed a sharp and well-defined Si/AlN interface, with minimal defects and strong chemical bonding, crucial for efficient carrier transport. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements demonstrated a type-I heterojunction with a valence band offset of 2.73 eV-2.84 eV and a conduction band offset of 2.22 eV -2.11 eV. The pn diode devices exhibited a linear current-voltage (I-V) characteristic, an ideality factor of 1.92, and a rectification ratio of 3.3E4, with a turn-on voltage of indicating effective p-n heterojunction. Temperature-dependent I-V measurements showed stable operation up to 90 C. The heterojunction's high-quality interface and electrical performance showcase its potential for advanced AlGaN-based optoelectronic and electronic devices.</description>

      <title>In-situ monitoring the magnetotransport signature of topological transitions in the chiral magnet Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging magnetic fields related to the presence of topologically protected spin textures such as skyrmions are expected to give rise to additional, topology-related contributions to the Hall effect. In order to doubtlessly identify this so-called topological Hall effect, it is crucial to disentangle such contributions from the anomalous Hall effect. This necessitates a direct correlation of the transversal Hall voltage with the underlying magnetic textures. We utilize a novel measurement platform that allows to acquire high-resolution Lorentz transmission electron microscopy images of magnetic textures as a function of an external magnetic field and to concurrently measure the (anomalous) Hall voltage in-situ in the microscope on one and the same specimen. We use this approach to investigate the transport signatures of the chiral soliton lattice and antiskyrmions in Mn$_{1.4}$PtSn. Notably, the observed textures allow to fully understand the measured Hall voltage without the need of any additional contributions due to a topological Hall effect, and the field-controlled formation and annihilation of anstiskyrmions are found to have no effect on the measurend Hall voltage.</description>

      <title>Slow Equilibrium Relaxation in a Chiral Magnet Mediated by Topological Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed a pump-probe experiment on the chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ to study the relaxation dynamics of its non-collinear magnetic orders, employing a millisecond magnetic field pulse as the pump and resonant elastic x-ray scattering as the probe. Our findings reveal that the system requires $\sim$0.2 s to stabilize after the perturbation applied to both the conical and skyrmion lattice phase; significantly slower than the typical nanosecond timescale observed in micromagnetics. This prolonged relaxation is attributed to the formation and slow dissipation of local topological defects, such as emergent monopoles. By unveiling the experimental lifetime of these emergent singularities in a non-collinear magnetic system, our study highlights a universal relaxation mechanism in solitonic textures within the slow dynamics regime, offering new insights into topological physics and advanced information storage solutions.</description>
