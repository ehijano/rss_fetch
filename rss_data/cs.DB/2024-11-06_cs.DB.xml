      <title>The Unreasonable Effectiveness of LLMs for Query Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work in database query optimization has used complex machine learning strategies, such as customized reinforcement learning schemes. Surprisingly, we show that LLM embeddings of query text contain useful semantic information for query optimization. Specifically, we show that a simple binary classifier deciding between alternative query plans, trained only on a small number of labeled embedded query vectors, can outperform existing heuristic systems. Although we only present some preliminary results, an LLM-powered query optimizer could provide significant benefits, both in terms of performance and simplicity.</description>

      <title>P-MOSS: Learned Scheduling For Indexes Over NUMA Servers Using Low-Level Hardware Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ever since the Dennard scaling broke down in the early 2000s and the frequency of the CPU stalled, vendors have started to increase the core count in each CPU chip at the expense of introducing heterogeneity, thus ushering the era of NUMA processors. Since then, the heterogeneity in the design space of hardware has only increased to the point that DBMS performance may vary significantly up to an order of magnitude in modern servers. An important factor that affects performance includes the location of the logical cores where the DBMS queries are scheduled, and the locations of the data that the queries access. This paper introduces P-MOSS, a learned spatial scheduling framework that schedules query execution to certain logical cores, and places data accordingly to certain integrated memory controllers (IMC), to integrate hardware consciousness into the system. In the spirit of hardware-software synergy, P-MOSS solely guides its scheduling decision based on low-level hardware statistics collected by performance monitoring counters with the aid of a Decision Transformer. Experimental evaluation is performed in the context of the B-tree and R-tree indexes. Performance results demonstrate that P-MOSS has up to 6x improvement over traditional schedules in terms of query throughput.</description>

      <title>Grounding Natural Language to SQL Translation with Data-Based Self-Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural Language Interfaces for Databases empower non-technical users to interact with data using natural language (NL). Advanced approaches, utilizing either neural sequence-to-sequence or more recent sophisticated large-scale language models, typically implement NL to SQL (NL2SQL) translation in an end-to-end fashion. However, like humans, these end-to-end translation models may not always generate the best SQL output on their first try. In this paper, we propose CycleSQL, an iterative framework designed for end-to-end translation models to autonomously generate the best output through self-evaluation. The main idea of CycleSQL is to introduce data-grounded NL explanations of query results as self-provided feedback, and use the feedback to validate the correctness of the translation iteratively, hence improving the overall translation accuracy. Extensive experiments, including quantitative and qualitative evaluations, are conducted to study CycleSQL by applying it to seven existing translation models on five widely used benchmarks. The results show that 1) the feedback loop introduced in CycleSQL can consistently improve the performance of existing models, and in particular, by applying CycleSQL to RESDSQL, obtains a translation accuracy of 82.0% (+2.6%) on the validation set, and 81.6% (+3.2%) on the test set of Spider benchmark; 2) the generated NL explanations can also provide insightful information for users, aiding in the comprehension of translation results and consequently enhancing the interpretability of NL2SQL translation.</description>

      <title>Data Quality Awareness: A Journey from Traditional Data Management to Data Science Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed various fields, significantly impacting our daily lives. A major factor in AI success is high-quality data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the evolution of data quality (DQ) awareness from traditional data management systems to modern data-driven AI systems, which are integral to data science. We synthesize the existing literature, highlighting the quality challenges and techniques that have evolved from traditional data management to data science including big data and ML fields. As data science systems support a wide range of activities, our focus in this paper lies specifically in the analytics aspect driven by machine learning. We use the cause-effect connection between the quality challenges of ML and those of big data to allow a more thorough understanding of emerging DQ challenges and the related quality awareness techniques in data science systems. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to provide a review of DQ awareness spanning traditional and emergent data science systems. We hope that readers will find this journey through the evolution of data quality awareness insightful and valuable.</description>

      <title>ZipCache: A DRAM/SSD Cache with Built-in Transparent Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a core component in modern data centers, key-value cache provides high-throughput and low-latency services for high-speed data processing. The effectiveness of a key-value cache relies on its ability of accommodating the needed data. However, expanding the cache capacity is often more difficult than commonly expected because of many practical constraints, such as server costs, cooling issues, rack space, and even human resource expenses. A potential solution is compression, which virtually extends the cache capacity by condensing data in cache. In practice, this seemingly simple idea has not gained much traction in key-value cache system design, due to several critical issues: the compression-unfriendly index structure, severe read/write amplification, wasteful decompression operations, and heavy computing cost. This paper presents a hybrid DRAM-SSD cache design to realize a systematic integration of data compression in key-value cache. By treating compression as an essential component, we have redesigned the indexing structure, data management, and leveraged the emerging computational SSD hardware for collaborative optimizations. We have developed a prototype, called ZipCache. Our experimental results show that ZipCache can achieve up to 72.4% higher throughput and 42.4% lower latency, while reducing the write amplification by up to 26.2 times.</description>

      <title>Social Support Detection from Social Media Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social support, conveyed through a multitude of interactions and platforms such as social media, plays a pivotal role in fostering a sense of belonging, aiding resilience in the face of challenges, and enhancing overall well-being. This paper introduces Social Support Detection (SSD) as a Natural language processing (NLP) task aimed at identifying supportive interactions within online communities. The study presents the task of Social Support Detection (SSD) in three subtasks: two binary classification tasks and one multiclass task, with labels detailed in the dataset section. We conducted experiments on a dataset comprising 10,000 YouTube comments. Traditional machine learning models were employed, utilizing various feature combinations that encompass linguistic, psycholinguistic, emotional, and sentiment information. Additionally, we experimented with neural network-based models using various word embeddings to enhance the performance of our models across these subtasks.The results reveal a prevalence of group-oriented support in online dialogues, reflecting broader societal patterns. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating psycholinguistic, emotional, and sentiment features with n-grams in detecting social support and distinguishing whether it is directed toward an individual or a group. The best results for different subtasks across all experiments range from 0.72 to 0.82.</description>

      <title>Taming the Beast of User-Programmed Transactions on Blockchains: A Declarative Transaction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blockchains are being positioned as the "technology of trust" that can be used to mediate transactions between non-trusting parties without the need for a central authority. They support transaction types that are native to the blockchain platform or user-defined via user programs called smart contracts. Despite the significant flexibility in transaction programmability that smart contracts offer, they pose several usability, robustness, and performance challenges.
  This paper proposes an alternative transaction framework that incorporates more primitives into the native set of transaction types (reducing the likelihood of requiring user-defined transaction programs often). The framework is based on the concept of declarative blockchain transactions whose strength lies in the fact that it addresses several of the limitations of smart contracts simultaneously. A formal and implementation framework is presented, and a subset of commonly occurring transaction behaviors are modeled and implemented as use cases, using an open-source blockchain database, BigchchainDB, as the implementation context. A performance study comparing the declarative transaction approach to equivalent smart contract transaction models reveals several advantages of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal Matrix Sketching over Sliding Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix sketching, aimed at approximating a matrix $\boldsymbol{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times d}$ consisting of vector streams of length $N$ with a smaller sketching matrix $\boldsymbol{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{\ell\times d}, \ell \ll N$, has garnered increasing attention in fields such as large-scale data analytics and machine learning. A well-known deterministic matrix sketching method is the Frequent Directions algorithm, which achieves the optimal $O\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)$ space bound and provides a covariance error guarantee of $\varepsilon = \lVert \boldsymbol{A}^\top \boldsymbol{A} - \boldsymbol{B}^\top \boldsymbol{B} \rVert_2/\lVert \boldsymbol{A} \rVert_F^2$. The matrix sketching problem becomes particularly interesting in the context of sliding windows, where the goal is to approximate the matrix $\boldsymbol{A}_W$, formed by input vectors over the most recent $N$ time units. However, despite recent efforts, whether achieving the optimal $O\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)$ space bound on sliding windows is possible has remained an open question.
  In this paper, we introduce the DS-FD algorithm, which achieves the optimal $O\left(\frac{d}{\varepsilon}\right)$ space bound for matrix sketching over row-normalized, sequence-based sliding windows. We also present matching upper and lower space bounds for time-based and unnormalized sliding windows, demonstrating the generality and optimality of \dsfd across various sliding window models. This conclusively answers the open question regarding the optimal space bound for matrix sketching over sliding windows. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments with both synthetic and real-world datasets, validating our theoretical claims and thus confirming the correctness and effectiveness of our algorithm, both theoretically and empirically.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Decomposition in Data Sketches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15366v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the turnstile streaming model, a dynamic vector $\mathbf{x}=(\mathbf{x}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{x}_n)\in \mathbb{Z}^n$ is updated by a stream of entry-wise increments/decrements. Let $f\colon\mathbb{Z}\to \mathbb{R}_+$ be a symmetric function with $f(0)=0$. The \emph{$f$-moment} of $\mathbf{x}$ is defined to be $f(\mathbf{x}) := \sum_{v\in[n]}f(\mathbf{x}_v)$. We revisit the problem of constructing a \emph{universal sketch} that can estimate many different $f$-moments. Previous constructions of universal sketches rely on the technique of sampling with respect to the $L_0$-mass (uniform samples) or $L_2$-mass ($L_2$-heavy-hitters), whose universality comes from being able to evaluate the function $f$ over the samples. In this work we take a new approach to constructing a universal sketch that does not use \emph{any} explicit samples but relies on the \emph{harmonic structure} of the target function $f$. The new sketch ($\textsf{SymmetricPoissonTower}$) \emph{embraces} hash collisions instead of avoiding them, which saves multiple $\log n$ factors in space, e.g., when estimating all $L_p$-moments ($f(z) = |z|^p,p\in[0,2]$). For many nearly periodic functions, the new sketch is \emph{exponentially} more efficient than sampling-based methods. We conjecture that the $\textsf{SymmetricPoissonTower}$ sketch is \emph{the} universal sketch that can estimate every tractable function $f$.</description>

      <title>Synthetic SQL Column Descriptions and Their Impact on Text-to-SQL Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04691v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relational databases often suffer from uninformative descriptors of table contents, such as ambiguous columns and hard-to-interpret values, impacting both human users and text-to-SQL models. In this paper, we explore the use of large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate detailed natural language descriptions for SQL database columns, aiming to improve text-to-SQL performance and automate metadata creation. We create a dataset of gold column descriptions based on the BIRD-Bench benchmark, manually refining its column descriptions and creating a taxonomy for categorizing column difficulty. We then evaluate several different LLMs in generating column descriptions across the columns and different difficulties in the dataset, finding that models unsurprisingly struggle with columns that exhibit inherent ambiguity, highlighting the need for manual expert input. We also find that incorporating such generated column descriptions consistently enhances text-to-SQL model performance, particularly for larger models like GPT-4o, Qwen2 72B and Mixtral 22Bx8. Notably, Qwen2-generated descriptions, containing by annotators deemed superfluous information, outperform manually curated gold descriptions, suggesting that models benefit from more detailed metadata than humans expect. Future work will investigate the specific features of these high-performing descriptions and explore other types of metadata, such as numerical reasoning and synonyms, to further improve text-to-SQL systems. The dataset, annotations and code will all be made available.</description>
