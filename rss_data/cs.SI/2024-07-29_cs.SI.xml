      <title>Adaptive Differentially Private Structural Entropy Minimization for Unsupervised Social Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social event detection refers to extracting relevant message clusters from social media data streams to represent specific events in the real world. Social event detection is important in numerous areas, such as opinion analysis, social safety, and decision-making. Most current methods are supervised and require access to large amounts of data. These methods need prior knowledge of the events and carry a high risk of leaking sensitive information in the messages, making them less applicable in open-world settings. Therefore, conducting unsupervised detection while fully utilizing the rich information in the messages and protecting data privacy remains a significant challenge. To this end, we propose a novel social event detection framework, ADP-SEMEvent, an unsupervised social event detection method that prioritizes privacy. Specifically, ADP-SEMEvent is divided into two stages, i.e., the construction stage of the private message graph and the clustering stage of the private message graph. In the first stage, an adaptive differential privacy approach is used to construct a private message graph. In this process, our method can adaptively apply differential privacy based on the events occurring each day in an open environment to maximize the use of the privacy budget. In the second stage, to address the reduction in data utility caused by noise, a novel 2-dimensional structural entropy minimization algorithm based on optimal subgraphs is used to detect events in the message graph. The highlight of this process is unsupervised and does not compromise differential privacy. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that ADP-SEMEvent can achieve detection performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining reasonable privacy budget parameters.</description>

      <title>Online Social Network Data-Driven Early Detection on Short-Form Video Addiction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-form video (SFV) has become a globally popular form of entertainment in recent years, appearing on major social media platforms. However, current research indicate that short video addiction can lead to numerous negative effects on both physical and psychological health, such as decreased attention span and reduced motivation to learn. Additionally, Short-form Video Addiction (SFVA) has been linked to other issues such as a lack of psychological support in real life, family or academic pressure, and social anxiety. Currently, the detection of SFVA typically occurs only after users experience negative consequences. Therefore, we aim to construct a short video addiction dataset based on social network behavior and design an early detection framework for SFVA. Previous mental health detection research on online social media has mostly focused on detecting depression and suicidal tendency. In this study, we propose the first early detection framework for SFVA EarlySD. We first introduce large language models (LLMs) to address the common issues of sparsity and missing data in graph datasets. Meanwhile, we categorize social network behavior data into different modalities and design a heterogeneous social network structure as the primary basis for detecting SFVA. We conduct a series of quantitative analysis on short video addicts using our self-constructed dataset, and perform extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method EarlySD, using social data and heterogeneous social graphs in the detection of short video addiction.</description>

      <title>Talking Wikidata: Communication patterns and their impact on community engagement in collaborative knowledge graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study collaboration patterns of Wikidata, one of the world's largest collaborative knowledge graph communities. Wikidata lacks long-term engagement with a small group of priceless members, 0.8%, to be responsible for 80% of contributions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate their behavioural patterns and find ways to enhance their contributions and participation. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of discussions among contributors in understanding these patterns. To investigate this, we analyzed all the discussions on Wikidata and used a mixed methods approach, including statistical tests, network analysis, and text and graph embedding representations. Our research showed that the interactions between Wikidata editors form a small world network where the content of a post influences the continuity of conversations. We also found that the account age of Wikidata members and their conversations are significant factors in their long-term engagement with the project. Our findings can benefit the Wikidata community by helping them improve their practices to increase contributions and enhance long-term participation.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analysis of the Properties of Geometric Network with Node Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The movement changes the underlying spatial representation of the participated mobile objects or nodes. In real world scenario, such mobile nodes can be part of any biological network, transportation network, social network, human interaction, etc. The change in the geometry leads to the change in various desirable properties of real-world networks especially in human interaction networks. In real life, human movement is concerned for better lifestyle where they form their new connections due to the geographical changes. Therefore, in this paper, we design a model for geometric networks with mobile nodes (GNMN) and conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of their properties. We analyze the effect of node mobility by evaluating key network metrics such as connectivity, node degree distribution, second hop neighbors, and centrality measures. Through extensive simulations, we observe significant variations in the behavior of geometric networks with mobile nodes.</description>

      <title>MNTD: An Efficient Dynamic Community Detector Based on Nonnegative Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic community detection is crucial for elucidating the temporal evolution of social structures, information dissemination, and interactive behaviors within complex networks. Nonnegative matrix factorization provides an efficient framework for identifying communities in static networks but fall short in depicting temporal variations in community affiliations. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Modularity maximization-incorporated Nonnegative Tensor RESCAL Decomposition (MNTD) model for dynamic community detection. This method serves two primary functions: a) Nonnegative tensor RESCAL decomposition extracts latent community structures in different time slots, highlighting the persistence and transformation of communities; and b) Incorporating an initial community structure into the modularity maximization algorithm, facilitating more precise community segmentations. Comparative analysis of real-world datasets shows that the MNTD is superior to state-of-the-art dynamic community detection methods in the accuracy of community detection.</description>

      <title>How Polarized are Online Conversations about Childhood?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2020 through 2023 were unusually tumultuous years for children in the United States, and children's welfare was prominent in political debate. Theories in moral psychology suggest that political parties would treat concerns for children using different moral frames, and that moral conflict might drive substantial polarization in discussions about children. However, such partisan frames may still differ very little if there is limited underlying disagreement about moral issues and everyday concerns in childhood when not explicitly referencing politics. We evaluate claims of universality and division in moral language using tweets from 2019-2023 linked to U.S. voter records, focusing on expressed morality. Our results show that mentions of children by Republicans and Democrats are usually similar, differing no more than mentions by women and men, and tend to contain no large differences in accompanying moral words. To the extent that mentions of children did differ across parties, these differences were constrained to topics polarized well before the pandemic -- and slightly heightened when co-mentioned with `kids' or `children'. These topics reflected a small fraction of conversations about children. Overall, polarization of online discussion around childhood appears to reflect escalated polarization on lines of existing partisan conflicts rather than concerns originating from new concerns about the welfare of children during and after the pandemic.</description>

      <title>Exploring Bengali Religious Dialect Biases in Large Language Models with Evaluation Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLM) have created a massive technological impact in the past decade, allowing for human-enabled applications, they can produce output that contains stereotypes and biases, especially when using low-resource languages. This can be of great ethical concern when dealing with sensitive topics such as religion. As a means toward making LLMS more fair, we explore bias from a religious perspective in Bengali, focusing specifically on two main religious dialects: Hindu and Muslim-majority dialects. Here, we perform different experiments and audit showing the comparative analysis of different sentences using three commonly used LLMs: ChatGPT, Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot, pertaining to the Hindu and Muslim dialects of specific words and showcasing which ones catch the social biases and which do not. Furthermore, we analyze our findings and relate them to potential reasons and evaluation perspectives, considering their global impact with over 300 million speakers worldwide. With this work, we hope to establish the rigor for creating more fairness in LLMs, as these are widely used as creative writing agents.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Privacy Vulnerabilities: Investigating the Role of Structure in Graph Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The public sharing of user information opens the door for adversaries to infer private data, leading to privacy breaches and facilitating malicious activities. While numerous studies have concentrated on privacy leakage via public user attributes, the threats associated with the exposure of user relationships, particularly through network structure, are often neglected. This study aims to fill this critical gap by advancing the understanding and protection against privacy risks emanating from network structure, moving beyond direct connections with neighbors to include the broader implications of indirect network structural patterns. To achieve this, we first investigate the problem of Graph Privacy Leakage via Structure (GPS), and introduce a novel measure, the Generalized Homophily Ratio, to quantify the various mechanisms contributing to privacy breach risks in GPS. Based on this insight, we develop a novel graph private attribute inference attack, which acts as a pivotal tool for evaluating the potential for privacy leakage through network structures under worst-case scenarios. To protect users' private data from such vulnerabilities, we propose a graph data publishing method incorporating a learnable graph sampling technique, effectively transforming the original graph into a privacy-preserving version. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our attack model poses a significant threat to user privacy, and our graph data publishing method successfully achieves the optimal privacy-utility trade-off compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Learning production functions for supply chains with graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global economy relies on the flow of goods over supply chain networks, with nodes as firms and edges as transactions between firms. While we may observe these external transactions, they are governed by unseen production functions, which determine how firms internally transform the input products they receive into output products that they sell. In this setting, it can be extremely valuable to infer these production functions, to better understand and improve supply chains, and to forecast future transactions more accurately. However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) cannot capture these hidden relationships between nodes' inputs and outputs. Here, we introduce a new class of models for this setting, by combining temporal GNNs with a novel inventory module, which learns production functions via attention weights and a special loss function. We evaluate our models extensively on real supply chains data, along with data generated from our new open-source simulator, SupplySim. Our models successfully infer production functions, with a 6-50% improvement over baselines, and forecast future transactions on real and synthetic data, outperforming baselines by 11-62%.</description>

      <title>AMIR: Automated MisInformation Rebuttal -- A COVID-19 Vaccination Datasets based Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misinformation has emerged as a major societal threat in recent years in general; specifically in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has wrecked havoc, for instance, by fuelling vaccine hesitancy. Cost-effective, scalable solutions for combating misinformation are the need of the hour. This work explored how existing information obtained from social media and augmented with more curated fact checked data repositories can be harnessed to facilitate automated rebuttal of misinformation at scale. While the ideas herein can be generalized and reapplied in the broader context of misinformation mitigation using a multitude of information sources and catering to the spectrum of social media platforms, this work serves as a proof of concept, and as such, it is confined in its scope to only rebuttal of tweets, and in the specific context of misinformation regarding COVID-19. It leverages two publicly available datasets, viz. FaCov (fact-checked articles) and misleading (social media Twitter) data on COVID-19 Vaccination.</description>
