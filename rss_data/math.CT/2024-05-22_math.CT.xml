      <title>Commutative codensity monads and probability bimeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several well-studied probability monads have been expressed as codensity monads over small categories of stochastic maps, giving a limit description of spaces of probability measures. In this paper we show how properties of probability monads such as commutativity and affineness can arise from their codensity presentation. First we show that their codensity presentation is closely related to another characterisation of probability monads as terminal endofunctors admitting certain maps into the Giry monad, which allows us to generalise a result by Van Breugel on the Kantorovich monad. We then provide sufficient conditions for a codensity monad to lift to $\bf{MonCat}$, and give a characterisation of exactly pointwise monoidal codensity monads; codensity monads that satisfy a strengthening of these conditions. We show that the Radon monad is exactly pointwise monoidal, and hence give a description of the tensor product of free algebras of the Radon monad in terms of Day convolution. Finally we show that the Giry monad is not exactly pointwise monoidal due to the existence of probability bimeasures that do not extend to measures, although its restriction to standard Borel spaces is. We introduce the notion of a $*$-monad and its Kleisli monoidal op-multicategory to describe the categorical structure that organises the spaces of probability polymeasures on measurable spaces.</description>

      <title>Directed Metric Structures arising in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models are transformer neural networks which are trained to produce a probability distribution on the possible next words to given texts in a corpus, in such a way that the most likely word predicted is the actual word in the training text. In this paper we find what is the mathematical structure defined by such conditional probability distributions of text extensions. Changing the view point from probabilities to -log probabilities we observe that the subtext order is completely encoded in a metric structure defined on the space of texts $\mathcal{L}$, by -log probabilities. We then construct a metric polyhedron $P(\mathcal{L})$ and an isometric embedding (called Yoneda embedding) of $\mathcal{L}$ into $P(\mathcal{L})$ such that texts map to generators of certain special extremal rays. We explain that $P(\mathcal{L})$ is a $(\min,+)$ (tropical) linear span of these extremal ray generators. The generators also satisfy a system of $(\min+)$ linear equations. We then show that $P(\mathcal{L})$ is compatible with adding more text and from this we derive an approximation of a text vector as a Boltzmann weighted linear combination of the vectors for words in that text. We then prove a duality theorem showing that texts extensions and text restrictions give isometric polyhedra (even though they look a priory very different). Moreover we prove that $P(\mathcal{L})$ is the lattice closure of (a version of) the so called, Isbell completion of $\mathcal{L}$ which turns out to be the $(\max,+)$ span of the text extremal ray generators. All constructions have interpretations in category theory but we don't use category theory explicitly. The categorical interpretations are briefly explained in an appendix. In the final appendix we describe how the syntax to semantics problem could fit in a general well known mathematical duality.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic vanishing of cohomology in triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graded-commutative ring acting centrally on a triangulated category, our main result shows that if cohomology of a pair of objects of the triangulated category is finitely generated over the ring acting centrally, then the asymptotic vanishing of the cohomology is well-behaved. In particular, enough consecutive asymptotic vanishing of cohomology implies all eventual vanishing. Several key applications are also given.</description>

      <title>Monoidal closure of Grothendieck constructions via $\Sigma$-tractable monoidal structures and Dialectica formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the categorical structure of the Grothendieck construction of an indexed category $\mathcal{L}:\mathcal{C}^{op}\to\mathbf{CAT}$ and characterise fibred limits, colimits, and monoidal structures. Next, we give sufficient conditions for the monoidal closure of the total category $\Sigma_\mathcal{C} \mathcal{L}$ of a Grothendieck construction of an indexed category $\mathcal{L}:\mathcal{C}^{op}\to\mathbf{CAT}$. Our analysis is a generalization of G\"odel's Dialectica interpretation, and it relies on a novel notion of $\Sigma$-tractable monoidal structure. As we will see, $\Sigma$-tractable coproducts simultaneously generalize cocartesian coclosed structures, biproducts and extensive coproducts. We analyse when the closed structure is fibred -- usually it is not.</description>
