      <title>Partial-wave decomposition of isospin-projected subleading three-nucleon contact interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the subleading three-nucleon contact interaction terms at N4LO in chiral effective field theory. We perform the isospin projection into $T=1/2$ and $T=3/2$ states, and find that only eleven of the thirteen operators contribute in the $T=1/2$ channel. By projection on the partial waves of the asymptotic configuration of $N-d$ scattering states in momentum space, we find contributions from ten combinations of LECs. These results provide a useful basis for including N4LO three-body forces in few-body calculations and for constraining them through numerical fits to data.</description>

      <title>Green's Function Formalism for Impurity-Induced Resonances in Sub-barrier Proton-Nucleus Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental refinements of stellar reaction rates, we establish a non-perturbative Green's function formalism based on the exact solution of the Dyson equation for sub-barrier proton-nucleus resonant scattering. By utilizing bare Green's functions to map the quantum tunneling problem onto a scattering formalism, we demonstrate that the summation of infinite quantum paths recovers the exact tunneling coefficients, enabling an analytical solution of the Dyson equation where the strong nuclear force is modeled as a surface delta-shell impurity embedded within the Coulomb field. Applying this framework to the astrophysically relevant $p + {}^{7}\text{Li}$, $p + {}^{14}\text{N}$, and $p + {}^{23}\text{Na}$ systems, we achieve precise agreement with experimental resonance energies while revealing a fundamental physical distinction in resonance formation. The heavier ${}^{23}\text{Na}$ system is identified as a saturated state, residing on a geometric plateau where the resonance energy becomes insensitive to the interaction strength; our calculated value of $2.11$~MeV aligns remarkably well with the experimental level of $2.08$~MeV. In contrast, the lighter ${}^7\text{Li}$ and ${}^{14}\text{N}$ systems emerge as threshold states in a weak-coupling window, where the resonance energy is highly sensitive to the potential parameters and is sustained near the continuum edge. In this regime, our model yields energies of $0.489$~MeV and $1.067$~MeV, closely reproducing the experimental benchmarks of $0.441$~MeV and $1.058$~MeV, respectively. We demonstrate that these threshold states are characterized by a significant enhancement of the resonant cross-section, driven by the inverse relationship between the tunneling width and the spectral density peak.</description>

      <title>Short-distance production of three particles with large scattering length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The short-distance production of multi-particle states in high-energy nuclear reactions provides a unique way to study the low-energy properties of few-body systems. In particular, the production amplitude of multi-neutron systems is strongly constrained by an approximate conformal symmetry of the underlying theory. We calculate the full amplitude for the short-distance production of three particles with large scattering length in leading order pionless EFT, focusing on the cases of three neutrons and three spinless bosons. We investigate the signature of low-energy resonances and other correlations in the relative energy distributions. For the case of neutrons, we compare to the predictions from approximate conformal symmetry close to the unitary limit and calculate the range corrections up to next-to-next-to leading order.</description>

      <title>Extracting Nucleon Resonance Transition GPDs from $e^- N\to e^-\gamma N\pi$ Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the process in which Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS) excites a baryon resonance. In particular, we assess, in DVCS leading to the Roper resonance, the relative importance of a "background'' process in which a pion is first emitted by the nucleon, which then undergoes a DVCS event. Our numerical results, using realistic DVCS kinematics, indicate that there can be measurable interference effects. They suggest that this process could substantially modify the experimentally observed cross sections at CLAS12-like kinematics, motivating their inclusion in precision analyses of DVCS experiments. We further find that in spite of this background, the transition to a Roper-like state through DVCS does contribute significantly to the $e^- N\to e^-\gamma N\pi$ cross section in some kinematic regions. This suggests that the creation of nucleon resonances via DVCS is a useful method for extracting information about the nucleon transition GPDs and the internal structure of the excited states.</description>

      <title>The quasi-normal modes of relativistic Fokker-Planck kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the well-known unitary equivalence between Fokker-Planck operators and Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians, we compute the quasi-normal-mode spectrum of ultrarelativistic kinetic theories with momentum-space diffusion. We show that the collision operator reduces to a Dirac-delta Schr\"odinger problem in one spatial dimension, and to a Coulomb Schr\"odinger operator with hydrogenic spectrum in three dimensions. Finite spatial wavenumber appears as a perturbation of the associated quantum potential. The hydrodynamic mode is found to obey exact Fick-type diffusion at all real wavenumbers, whereas relativistic kinematics generically produces a continuous ballistic band in the non-hydrodynamic sector, a feature absent in the Newtonian regime.</description>

      <title>How transverse momentum conservation breaks azimuthal correlation factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breakdown of azimuthal two-particle correlation factorization, quantified by the ratios $r_2$ and $r_3$, serves as a sensitive probe of transverse-momentum-dependent flow fluctuations. While hydrodynamic models predict $r_3 \leq 1$, experimental data from CMS in p-Pb collisions exhibit $r_3 &gt; 1$, presenting a clear puzzle. We show that transverse momentum conservation (TMC) is the key mechanism dictating this factorization breakdown in small systems. We systematically calculate the effect of TMC as a function of the momentum difference between particles across various multiplicity and momentum ranges. Our results are in quantitative agreement with CMS p-Pb data for both $r_2$ and $r_3$. A central finding is a sign rule: under TMC, the deviation $r_n - 1$ follows $\left ( - 1 \right )^{n+1} $, being negative for even and positive for odd harmonic orders $n$. This work establishes an analytical framework to quantify transverse-momentum-dependent flow fluctuations and provides new insights into the origin of collectivity in small colliding systems.</description>

      <title>Radial Oscillations and Stability of Neutron Stars with Antikaon Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19545v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial oscillations provide a direct probe of the stability and compressibility of neutron stars and are highly sensitive to the equation of state of dense matter. In this work, we investigate the impact of antikaon condensates on the radial oscillation properties of neutron stars. We model neutron star matter using equations of state with a wide range of stiffness. For this purpose, both non-linear and density-dependent relativistic mean-field frameworks are employed to develop equations of state that are consistent with current astrophysical constraints. We further consider the emergence of antikaon condensates ($K^-$ and $\bar{K}^0$) in the stellar core, which modifies the pressure--energy density relation of dense matter. We find that the nature of the transition from nuclear matter to the condensed phase is sensitive to the antikaon optical potential depth and underlying equation of state. We compute the fundamental and higher-order radial oscillation modes for neutron stars containing antikaon condensates over a range of antikaon optical potential depths. Our results demonstrate that the antikaon optical potential depth plays a decisive role in governing the systematic shifts observed in the radial oscillation frequencies, while also significantly reducing the stability limits and maximum masses of neutron stars. These imprints of antikaon condensation on radial oscillation spectra provide a promising avenue for future multi-messenger observations and high-frequency gravitational-wave searches to directly probe and constrain the internal composition and equation of state of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Octet baryon electroweak form factors in dense nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the necessity of developing theoretical models for studying the electroweak structure of baryons in a nuclear medium, we apply a covariant quark model to study interactions of baryons with nuclear matter. The electromagnetic and axial form factors of the octet baryons are determined by combining a covariant quark model that takes into account the meson cloud dressing of the baryon cores, developed for free space, with the quark-meson coupling model in the extension to the nuclear medium. We discuss the medium modifications on the electroweak form factors of octet baryons for the range of densities from $\rho=0$ up to $\rho=2 \rho_0$, where $\rho_0= 0.15$ fm$^{-3}$ is the normal nuclear matter density. We also study how the shape of the form factors is modified in finite nuclei due to the profile of the nuclear density distributions compared with calculations using the average density of the nucleus</description>

      <title>A self-consistent calculation of non-spherical Bose-Einstein correlation functions with Coulomb final-state interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle correlations and femtoscopy are a rich subfield of high-energy physics. As the experimental data become more precise, there is an increasing need for the theoretical calculations to provide better and more general descriptions of the measurements. One of the important new directions is the investigation of the precise shape of the Bose-Einstein correlation functions utilizing L\'evy-stable distributions. This work is a direct follow-up to our previous study, in which we developed a novel method for calculating Bose-Einstein correlation functions including the Coulomb final-state interaction. In this paper, we present a self-consistent generalization of the previous approach to non-spherical source functions and investigate the validity of the previously applied approximations assuming spherical symmetry. We present a software package that includes the calculation of a fully three-dimensional correlation function including the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Equation of State of Highly Asymmetric Neutron-Star Matter from Liquid Drop Model and Meson Polytropes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified description of dense matter and neutron-star structure based on simple but physically motivated models. Starting from the thermodynamics of degenerate Fermi gases, we construct an equation of state for cold, catalyzed matter by combining relativistic fermion statistics with the liquid drop model of nuclear binding. The internal stratification of matter in the outer crust is described by $\beta$-equilibrium, neutron drip and a gradual transition to supranuclear matter. Short-range repulsive interactions inspired by Quantum Hadrodynamics are incorporated at high densities in order to ensure stability and causality. The resulting equation of state is used as input to the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, yielding self-consistent neutron-star models. We compute macroscopic stellar properties including the mass-radius relation, compactness and surface redshift that can be compared with recent observational data. Despite the simplicity of the underlying microphysics, the model produces neutron-star masses and radii compatible with current observational constraints from X-ray timing and gravitational-wave measurements. This work demonstrates that physically transparent models can already capture the essential features of neutron-star structure and provide valuable insight into the connection between dense-matter physics and astrophysical observables while they can also be used as easy to handle models to test the impact of more complicated phenomena and variations in neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified analysis based on the cranking model is presented, demonstrating that both the Bohr and Variable Moment of Inertia (VMI) models arise as limiting cases of this framework. This result resolves the apparent contradiction between the two models by showing that they correspond to different physical limits of the same formalism. In addition, this analysis explicitly reveals the contribution of Coriolis effects to the rotational energy and moment of inertia.</description>

      <title>Gravitational $ D$-Form Factor: The $\sigma$-Meson as a Dilaton confronted with Lattice Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18537v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nucleon and pion gravitational $D$-form factors, by fitting a $\sigma/f_0(500)$-meson pole, together with a background term, to lattice data at $m_\pi \approx 170\text{MeV}$. We find that the fitted residues are compatible with predictions from dilaton effective theory. In this framework, the $\sigma$-meson takes on the role of the dilaton, the Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken scale symmetry. These results support the idea that QCD may be governed by an infrared fixed point and offer a physical interpretation of the $D$-form factor (or $D$-term) in the soft limit.</description>

      <title>Next-to-next-to-leading power corrections to unpolarized Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS) is a key tool for exploring the three-dimensional structure of the nucleon through Transverse Momentum Dependent parton distributions and fragmentation functions. While leading-power contributions to the SIDIS cross-section are well established, next-to-leading (NLP) of order $1/Q$ and next-to-next-to-leading power (NNLP) corrections of order $1/Q^2$ to the hadronic tensor have only recently begun to be systematically investigated. These corrections are essential for the reliable phenomenology and interpretation of modern high-precision data. In recent papers by one of the authors, NNLP corrections to Drell-Yan process were derived using rapidity factorization formalism. In the present work we extend this approach to SIDIS and obtain analytic expressions for the unpolarized structure functions. We derive NNLP corrections that include convolutions of unpolarized distributions, $f_1$, with unpolarized fragmentation functions, $D_1$, and Boer-Mulders functions, $h_1^\perp$, with Collins fragmentation functions, $H_1^\perp$. We compare our results with previous formulations, provide numerical studies, confront our predictions with HERMES and COMPASS measurements, and present predictions for future experiments at Jefferson Lab and the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Origin of the nucleon gravitational form factor $B_N(t)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent lattice QCD simulations and phenomenological models indicate that the nucleon's gravitational form factor $B_N(t)$ remains remarkably small at finite momentum transfer $t$. While $B_N(0) = 0$ is a known consequence of the equivalence principle, the physical origin of its suppression at finite $t$ has not been fully elucidated. In this work, we demonstrate that the smallness of $B_N(t)$ arises from a fundamental cancellation within the nucleon's wave functions. Using light-front holographic QCD, we show that $B_N(t)$ is governed by an antisymmetric factor in the longitudinal dynamics that leads to an exact vanishing in the symmetric limit and significant suppression for realistic nucleon structures. Our results suggest that the smallness of $B_N(t)$ is a signature of the nucleon's dominant S-wave character, providing a formal justification for its frequent omission in practical applications like near-threshold $J/\psi$ production.</description>

Abstract: We study the processes $\nu_\tau n \to \Lambda_c \tau^- (\pi^- \nu_\tau)$ and $\bar\nu_\tau p \to \Lambda \tau^+ (\pi^+ \bar\nu_\tau)$, with particular emphasis on the pion energy and angular distributions, as a possible signal for lepton flavor universality violation, and in general of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), as well as a sensitive probe of the $\tau$ polarization vector. We work within an effective low-energy extension of the SM with all dimension-six four-fermion operators. In this framework, complex Wilson coefficients which encode new physics can generate CP-violating contributions. We propose an observable that provides a genuine CP-odd signal due to its sensitivity to particular transverse components of the $\tau$ polarization vector. Namely, we show that the asymmetry in the azimuthal-angle distribution of the pion in the decay $\tau^\pm\to \pi^\pm \nu_\tau$ constitutes a smoking-gun prediction of such a beyond the SM scenario. We estimate the strength of this effect extrapolating nucleon-hyperon form factors recently obtained from lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>The diffusion equation is compatible with special relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to its parabolic character, the diffusion equation exhibits instantaneous spatial spreading, and becomes unstable when Lorentz-boosted. According to the conventional interpretation, these features reflect a fundamental incompatibility with special relativity. In this Letter, we show that this interpretation is incorrect by demonstrating that any smooth and sufficiently localized solution of the diffusion equation is the particle density of an exact solution of the relativistic Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. This establishes the existence of a causal, stable, and thermodynamically consistent relativistic kinetic theory whose hydrodynamic sector is governed exactly by diffusion at all wavelengths. We further demonstrate that the standard arguments for instability arise from considering solutions that admit no counterpart in kinetic theory, and that apparent violations of causality disappear once signals are defined in terms of the underlying microscopic data.</description>

      <title>The leading Lyapunov exponent in the glasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that small perturbations in the boost-invariant color fields of the glasma exhibit an exponential growth with the square root of time. We interpret this growth rate as a Lyapunov exponent, related to entropy production and the thermalization timescale in the earliest stage of heavy-ion collisions. Working in a regime that is linear in this perturbation, we extract the time dependence of this mode as $\sim \exp(0.4\sqrt{g^2\mu\tau})$ for SU($2$), where $g^2\mu$ is proportional to the saturation scale and the square-root dependence is caused by the boost-invariant expansion of the system. We show that the growth rate of this mode is, unlike its amplitude, remarkably insensitive to the details of how the perturbations are initialized. In particular, we show that the unstable mode couples to all momentum scales present in the initial perturbation.</description>

      <title>Identifying $\alpha$-cluster configurations in $^{20}$Ne via ultracentral Ne+Ne Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial-state geometry in relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides a novel probe to nuclear cluster structure. For $^{20}$Ne, a novel approach is proposed to distinguish between the cluster configurations (5$\alpha$ versus $\alpha + ^{16}$O) in order to gain insight into nuclear structure transitions governed by many-body quantum correlations. Through analytical calculations with the microscopic Brink model and event-by-event simulations using the hydrodynamic framework, we establish the normalized symmetric cumulant NSC (3, 2) and the Pearson coefficient $\rho_2 (v_{2}^{2},\ \delta [p_{\mathrm{T}}])$ as quantitative discriminators to reveal enhanced cluster degrees of freedom in the ground state of $^{20}$Ne. The ultracentral Ne+Ne collisions at the LHC can experimentally identify these two competing configurations via these flow correlation observables, opening a new paradigm for probing clustering in light nuclei.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulation of Rotating Nuclei using Quantum Variational Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum variational algorithms (QVAs) are increasingly potent tools for simulating quantum many-body systems on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This work examines the application of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to four progressively complex models based on the cranked Nilsson-Strutinsky (CNS) framework. By incorporating single-particle spacings, pairing correlations, and rotational cranking terms, we evaluate VQE performance against exact diagonalization (ED) benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that while simpler models achieve high precision (errors $&lt;0.005$), the transition to 8-spin-orbital Hamiltonians reveals significant scaling and optimization challenges. Notably, we show that Model IV, which employs a more expressive RealAmplitudes ansatz, successfully captures the qualitative physics of rotational alignment and reduces energy deviations compared to intermediate benchmarks. These results establish a systematic methodological baseline, identifying the breaking points of hardware-efficient ansatz while validating the potential of QVAs to model the complex competition between pairing and rotation in deformed nuclei.</description>

      <title>Relaxation time approximation revisited and non-analytical structure in retarded correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a rigorous mathematical justification for the relaxation time approximation (RTA) model. We find that only the RTA with an energy-independent relaxation time can be justified in the case of hard interactions. Accordingly, we propose an alternative approach to restore the collision invariance lacking in traditional RTA. Besides, we provide a general statement on the non-analytical structures in the retarded correlators within the kinetic description. For hard interactions, hydrodynamic poles are the long-lived modes. Whereas for soft interactions, commonly encountered in relativistic kinetic theory, the gapless eigenvalue spectrum of linearized collision operator leads to gapless branch-cuts. We note that particle mass and inhomogeneous perturbations would complicate the above-mentioned non-analytical structures.</description>

      <title>Existence of nuclear modifications on longitudinal-transverse structure-function ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been assumed that nuclear modification does not exist in the longitudinal-transverse structure-function ratio $R_N=F_L^N/(2xF_1^N)$ in lepton deep inelastic scattering. This assumption is widely used in obtaining structure functions of the "nucleon" from nuclear data such as the deuteron ones. However, nuclear modifications do exist theoretically at least in medium- and large-$x$ regions because nucleons in a nucleus move in any direction, which is not necessarily the longitudinal direction of the virtual-photon or weak-boson momentum in lepton scattering. Because of this transverse motion, the nucleon's transverse and longitudinal structure functions should mix with each other in nuclei with the mixture probability proportional to the nucleon's transverse momentum squared $\vec p_T^{\,\, 2}/Q^2$. In this work, numerical results are explicitly shown regarding such nuclear modifications in the deuteron. These nuclear modifications are important for determining precise structure functions of the nucleon. Furthermore, modifications of $R_N$ should be investigated also at small $x$ by the future electron-ion collider to find interesting gluon dynamics in nuclei. Hopefully, this nuclear effect of $R_N$ could be found by future experimental measurements at lepton accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>Stellar properties indicating the presence of hyperons in neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe distinctive stellar features indicating the presence of hyperons in neutron stars as compared to purely nucleonic systems. A strongly negative curvature of the mass-radius relation $R(M)$ is characteristic of hyperons, which can be determined from measurements of neutron stars with three different masses. Similarly, a reduced second derivative of the tidal deformability as function of mass \lambda(M) points to hyperonic degrees of freedom in NS matter. The slopes of such curves R(M) and \lambda(M) can distinguish a hyperonic equation of state from purely nucleonic models if they appear increased (decreased for \lambda(M)) relative to the maximum mass of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The $1/N_c$ Operator Analysis of the Combined Octet and Decuplet Baryons Contact Interactions in SU(3) Chiral Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct the non-derivative four-point interactions for Octet and Decuplet baryons in the SU(3) Chiral Effective Field Theory (ChEFT) framework, and there are 104 coupling constant terms. The non-relativistic expansion of the baryon fields has been considered up to the Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) of the three-momentum expansion. We find 28 and 106 Low-Energy Constants (LECs) for Leading Order (LO) and NLO, respectively. Using the Hartree Hamiltonian of the $1/N_c$ expansion of the operator product up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO), we can reduce the free parameters (LECs) of the ChEFT from 134 down to 24 up to NLO of the three-momentum expansion. Moreover, we will discuss the implications of the $1/N_c$ sum rules in $\Omega\Omega$ and $\Omega N$ scatterings, where the future results from lattice QCD can be used to test our sum rules.</description>

      <title>Investigating Roles of Triple Excitations for High-precision Determination of Clock Properties of Alkaline Earth Metal Singly Charged Ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-accuracy calculations of electric dipole polarizabilities and quadrupole moments ($\Theta$) of the clock states of the singly charged calcium (Ca$^+$), strontium (Sr$^+$) and barium (Ba$^+$) alkaline-earth ions are estimated by employing relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. It demonstrates importance of the triple excitations in the RCC method for precise determination of the above quantities. We also observe a different trend of correlations in the $\Theta$ values than an earlier study with respect to orbitals from higher angular momenta. Reliability of the results is verified by comparing the calculated energies, magnetic dipole hyperfine structure constants, and lifetimes of the atomic states with the experimental values of the $^{43}$Ca$^+$, $^{87}$Sr$^+$ and $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ions. Nuclear quadrupole moments of these isotopes are also estimated by combining calculations with the measured electric quadrupole hyperfine structure constants, showing large deviations from the literature values.</description>
