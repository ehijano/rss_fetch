      <title>Fermion-Vortex Interactions in Axion Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relativistic action for scalar condensate-fermion mixture is considered where both the scalar boson and the fermion fields are coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The dynamics of the gauge field is governed by a linear combination of the Maxwell term and the Lorentz invariant $\mathbf{E\cdot B}$ term with a constant coefficient $\theta$. We obtain an effective action describing an emergent fermion-fermion interaction and fermion-vortex tube interaction by using the particle-string duality, and find that the $\theta$ term can significantly affect the interaction of fermions and vortices. We also perform a dimensional reduction to show a $\theta$ dependent flux attachment to the itinerant fermions.</description>

      <title>Braiding Induced by Finite-Size Effect in One-Dimensional Topological Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of Majorana zero mode (MZM) and Majorana Kramers pair (MKP) in one-dimensional topological superconductors, respectively. An effective model is established for braiding of MZMs and MKPs. We employ the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-wave topological superconductors to embody the effective model for braiding of MKPs by utilizing finite-size effects and locally tunable coupling parameters. We show how to construct the state initialization and readout via gate control. We also use this method for braiding MZMs in s-wave topological superconductors. Our proposal presents a promising avenue for experimentally verifying the non-Abelian statistical properties of MZMs and MKPs, with implications for topological quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Observation of in-gap states in a two-dimensional CrI2/NbSe2 heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-dimensional magnetic structures coupled with superconductors are promising platforms for realizing Majorana zero modes, which have potential applications in topological quantum computing. Here, we report a two-dimensional (2D) magnetic-superconducting heterostructure consisting of single-layer chromium diiodide (CrI2) on a niobium diselenide (NbSe2) superconductor. Single-layer CrI2 nanosheets, which hold antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground states by our first-principles calculations, were epitaxially grown on the layered NbSe2 substrate. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we observed robust in-gap states spatially located at the edge of the nanosheets and defect-induced zero-energy peaks inside the CrI2 nanosheets. Magnetic-flux vortices induced by an external field exhibit broken threefold rotational symmetry of pristine NbSe2 superconductor, implying the efficient modulation of the interfacial superconducting states by the epitaxial CrI2 layer. A phenomenological model suggests the existence of chiral edge states in a 2D AFM-superconducting hybrid system with an even Chern number, providing a qualitatively plausible understanding for our experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Majorana corner modes in unconventional monolayers of the 1T-PtSe2 family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12055v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose that Majorana zero modes can be realized at the corners of the two-dimensional unconventional insulator. We demonstrate that 1T-PtSe2 is a symmetry indicator-free (SI-free) unconventional insulator, originating from orbital hybridization between Pt $d$ and Se $p_{x,y}$ states. The kind of SI-free unconventionality has no symmetry eigenvalue indication. Instead, it is diagnosed directly by the Wannier charge centers by using the one-dimensional Wilson loop method. The obstructed edge states exhibit strong anisotropy and large Rashba splitting. By introducing superconducting proximity and an external magnetic field, the Majorana corner modes can be obtained in the 1T-PtSe2 monolayer. In the end, we construct a two-Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model with anisotropy to capture the Majorana physics.</description>

      <title>Electronic instability, layer selectivity and Fermi arcs in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using advanced dynamical mean-field theory on a realistic level we study the normal-state correlated electronic structure of the high-pressure superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and compare the features of the conventional bilayer (2222) Ruddelsden-Popper crystal structure with those of a newly-identified monolayer-trilayer (1313) alternation. Both structural cases display Ni-$d_{z^2}$ flat-band character at low-energy, which drives an electronic instability with a wave vector ${\bf q_{\rm I}}=(0.25,0.25,q_z)$ at ambient pressure, in line with recent experimental findings. The 1313 electronic structure exhibits significant layer selectivity, rendering especially the monolayer part to be Mott-critical. At high pressure, this layer selectivity weakens and the 1313 fermiology displays arcs reminiscent to those of high-$T_c$ cuprates. In contrast to dominant inter-site self-energy effects in the latter systems, here the Fermi arcs are the result of the multiorbital and multilayer interplay within a correlated flat-band scenario.</description>

      <title>Microwave Signatures of Topological Superconductivity in Planar Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16535v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions provide a platform to host topological superconductivity which, through manipulating Majorana bound states (MBS), could enable fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, what constitutes experimental signatures of topological superconductivity and how MBS can be detected remains strongly debated. In addition to spurious effects that mimic MBS, there is a challenge to discern the inherent topological signals in realistic systems with many topologically-trivial Andreev bound states, determining the transport properties of Josephson junctions. Guided by the advances in microwave spectroscopy, we theoretically study Al/InAs-based planar Josephson junction embedded into a radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference device to identify microwave signatures of topological superconductivity. Remarkably, by exploring the closing and reopening of a topological gap, we show that even in a wide planar Josephson junction with many Andreev bound states, such a topological signature is distinguishable in the resonance frequency shift of a microwave drive and the ``half-slope'' feature of the microwave absorption spectrum. Our findings provide an important step towards experimental detection of non-Abelian statistics and implementing scalable topological quantum computing.</description>
