      <title>Error-Free Demodulation of Pixelated Interferograms: Updated review and circumstantial evidence of plagiarism by 4D Technology Corporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the historical development that led to error-free phase demodulation of pixelated spatial-carrier interferograms between 2004 and 2010. It also evaluates evidence suggesting that 4D Technology Corporation (4DTC), in their SPIE 7790 publication [18], may have adopted key concepts from a manuscript submitted by Servin and collaborators, which at that time was still under peer review [17]. We analyze 4DTC algorithms based on 2x2 and 3x3 spatial convolution phase shifting methods (SC-PSA), developed from 2004 to 2009 [9-15], and show that they were fundamentally limited to narrow bandwidth fringe demodulation. Notably, only one 4DTC paper [13] acknowledged major phase errors when these methods were applied to wideband pixelated fringes, but the problem remained unsolved. In 2010, the team at Centro de Investigaciones en Optica (CIO), led by Servin, entered the field [16,17]. At that point, CIO and 4DTC were the only two known groups pursuing error free demodulation of wideband pixelated interferograms. In June 2010, Servin et al submitted to Optics Express [17] the error free solution introducing a new method: the complex fringe-carrier product followed by step-edge low-pass Fourier filtering. This approach fully superseded the 2x2 and 3x3 SC-PSAs used by 4DTC [9-15], reaching the theoretical slope limit for pixelated sensors. Given that 4DTC paper [18] was presented just seven weeks after Servin submission [17], and only these two groups were working on this problem, it is plausible that 4DTC or an affiliate had early access to the submission. The circumstantial evidence suggests that core ideas from [17] were incorporated into 4DTC August presentation [18]. This paper retraces that scientific path and examines the ethical implications of uncredited appropriation in optical research.</description>

      <title>From ultra-noisy to ultra-stable: optimization of the optoelectronic laser lock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate thermal-noise-limited direct locking of a semiconductor distributed feedback (DFB) laser to a sub-1 mL volume, ultrastable optical cavity, enabling extremely compact and simple ultrastable laser systems. Using the optoelectronic laser locking method, we realize over 140 dB suppression of the DFB free-running laser noise at 10 Hz offset, a level we estimate to be ~ 70 dB greater than Pound-Drever-Hall locking can provide, and reach a phase noise level of -120 dBc/Hz at 200 kHz offset. We also demonstrate a new feedforward noise correction method that improves the quality of the heterodyne beat with an optical frequency comb by providing another 60 dB of laser noise rejection - a level that is 15 dB greater than predicted by current models. With feedforward, we transfer the cavity thermal noise limit across the comb spectrum despite the fact that the cavity-locked laser itself is noisy. These results establish a simple, low noise, compact approach to ultrastable laser locking that is compatible with integrated photonics, with applications in low phase noise microwave generation, sensing, and satellite ranging.</description>

      <title>Full spectral response of grating-induced loss in photonic crystal microrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic crystal microrings (PhCRs) have emerged as powerful and versatile platforms for integrated nonlinear photonics, offering precise control over frequency and phase matching while maintaining high optical quality factors. Through grating-mediated mode coupling, PhCRs enable advanced dispersion engineering, which is critical for wideband nonlinear processes such as optical parametric oscillation, Kerr frequency comb generation, and dual-pump spontaneous and Bragg scattering four-wave mixing. Beyond dispersion control, PhCRs also facilitate the manipulation of orbital angular momentum (OAM) emission, a key functionality for encoding high-dimensional quantum states in emerging quantum photonic platforms. Despite these advances, the broadband spectral behavior of grating-induced losses in PhCRs remains largely unexplored, with most studies focusing on grating periods near the modal wavelength or its half. Such losses can significantly impact broadband nonlinear processes, where excess loss at unintended wavelengths can degrade device performance. In this work, we experimentally characterize grating-induced losses in PhCRs and reveal their full spectral response as a function of the ratio between modal wavelength and grating period. We identify distinct loss channels arising from either radiation or mode conversion, including a broad excess-loss region attributed to vertical out-coupling into OAM-carrying states. These observations are supported by three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain simulations and further analyzed through OAM radiation angle and phase-mismatch analysis. The resulting broadband loss spectrum highlights critical design trade-offs and provides practical guidelines for optimizing PhCR-based devices for nonlinear photonic applications involving widely separated frequencies.</description>

      <title>Pure-quartic domain-wall solitons as topological bits for data transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain walls (DWs) are topological defects produced by symmetry-breaking phase transitions. Although DWs have been the subject of much work due to their fundamental physical properties, they have not been explored in optical systems with higher-order dispersion. Recent experimental and theoretical works have demonstrated that pure-quartic (PQ) solitons, with their specific energy-width scaling, arise from the interplay of the quartic group-velocity dispersion (GVD) and Kerr nonlinearity. Here, we report solutions for PQ-DW solitons for the model of optical media with the PQ GVD. The analysis demonstrates that they are stable modes. Further investigation reveals their potential as data carriers for optical telecommunications. These results broaden the variety of optical solitons maintained by diverse nonlinear media.</description>

      <title>Photonic chip-based high-efficiency soliton microcombs via electroopitc-Kerr synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal soliton mode-locking in coherently pumped microcavities provides a promising platform for miniaturized frequency comb systems. While significant progress has been made, achieving high conversion efficiency in such microcombs remains a critical challenge. Soliton generation through pulse pumping has emerged as an effective strategy to improve conversion efficiency. However, the on-chip integration of pulse generation with dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) formation within the photonic chip has not yet been realized. In this work, we demonstrate a photonic chip-based soliton microcomb with high conversion efficiency, achieved by integrating on-chip pulse generation and DKS generation. The pulsed laser, fabricated on a lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) platform, delivers a 35.5GHz repetition rate with broadly tunable center frequencies. By coupling these on-chip pulses to a silicon nitride microresonator, we achieve stable DKS generation with a pump-to-soliton conversion efficiency of 43.9% under steady-state conditions. This integrated architecture establishes a viable pathway toward chip-scale soliton microcombs with unprecedented efficiency, opening up new possibilities for optical communications, precision spectroscopy, and photonic sensing.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Tunable Photon Pair Generation from Nonlinear Metasurface with Guided-Mode Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to generate quantum entangled photon pairs through spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) is playing a pivotal role in many applications in quantum technologies, including quantum communications, quantum computation, and quantum imaging. Metasurfaces, two-dimensional arrays of nanostructures with subwavelength thickness, have recently shown extraordinary capability in manipulating classical and quantum states of light and realizing miniaturized SPDC sources. Whereas previous studies have primarily focused on periodic metasurfaces, we uncover the potential of spatially modulated nanopatterns for further SPDC enhancement and state engineering. Specifically, we propose a nonlinear metasurface featuring a lateral guided-mode cavity formed by two distributed Bragg reflectors. With the quasi-normal mode theory, we predict an SPDC rate up to 157 Hz/mW, which represents about 30 times rate enhancement when compared to the metasurface without a cavity. Furthermore, the cavity supports a continuous set of high-Q resonances across a broad bandwidth, allowing the all-optical tuning of the photon-pair emission directions transverse to the cavity by controlling the pump wavelength, which can find applications in quantum imaging.</description>

      <title>Meron Spin Textures in Momentum Space Spawning from Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological spin textures, such as merons and skyrmions, have shown significance in both fundamental science and practical applications across diverse physical systems. The optical skyrmionic textures in real space have been extensively explored, but which in momentum space are still rarely studied. Here, we report the experimental generation of momentum-space meron spin textures via bound states in the continuum (BICs) in photonic crystal slabs. We show that under circularly polarized illumination, the momentum-space vortex topology of BICs can transform light with meron spin textures in momentum space. These merons exhibit polarity-switchable configurations controlled by incident light polarization. We theoretically and experimentally verify the generation of momentum-space merons and demonstrate their operational flexibility across a broad spectral range. Our results establish a connection between different momentum-space topologies and provide a robust and compact platform for generating topological spin textures.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of wide-mode-area slow light modes in valley photonic crystal heterostructure waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally realized wide-mode-area slow-light modes in valley photonic crystals (VPhCs) heterostructure waveguides. The waveguides are fabricated on a silicon slab by inserting gapless photonic graphene layers with varying widths and modifying the unit cell spacing near the domain walls. By reducing the spacing between unit cells at the domain boundaries, slow-light guided modes are achieved in VPhCs heterostructure waveguides. The presence of wide-mode-area modes is verified by observing the radiation in light propagation of leaky guided modes above the light line. To characterize guided modes below the light line, we introduce air-slot terminations to induce out-of-plane scattering and measure intensity profiles. The results show that the mode widths are tunable for both fast-light and slow-light modes in VPhCs heterostructure waveguides by adjusting the number of photonic graphene layers. The ability to support wide-mode-area slow-light modes in VPhC heterostructures offers promising opportunities for the development of high-power, on-chip photonic integrated devices.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Integrated Speckle Spectrometer with Ultrahigh Bandwidth-to-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miniaturized spectrometers employing chip solutions are essential for a wide range of applications, such as wearable health monitoring, biochemical sensing, and portable optical coherence tomography. However, the development of integrated spectrometers is hampered by the inherent trade-off between bandwidth-to-resolution, footprint, sampling channels, and operation speed. Here, we demonstrate that an ultrahigh bandwidth-to-resolution reconstructive spectrometer can be easily implemented through a single image capture of the speckle pattern diffracted from a passive silicon photonic chip. By leveraging the high pixel count of an image sensor, we can instantly acquire a significant number of distinct spatial sampling channels. Those sampling channels are spatially decorrelated by using our passive optical network on chip including cascaded unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometers, random diffraction by an antenna array, and mutual interference in free space before being captured. Hence, each speckle pattern contains wavelength-specific information across its spatial distribution to enhance the effectiveness of the global sampling strategy. Experimentally, we achieve a spectral resolution of 10 pm and an operational bandwidth of 200 nm, with sampling channels up to 2730. Multiple unknown narrowband and broadband spectra can also be precisely obtained.</description>

      <title>Silicon photonics LMA amplifiers: High power, high gain, low noise and tunable polarization sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-power amplifiers are of great importance in many optical systems deployed in optical sensing, ranging, medical surgery, material processing and more. Likewise, high-gain, low-noise amplifiers with low polarization dependence are critical components of long-range optical communication systems. Integrated photonic solutions show great potential in challenging application fields thanks to their drastic reduction in size, weight and cost, but this comes at the expense of low optical power due to reduced energy storage capacity in small devices. Recently, the large mode area (LMA) technology, which is well known for dramatically increasing the output power of fiber amplifiers by orders of magnitude, has been brought to the chip-level. With a large optical mode in the gain medium, the energy storage capacity and saturation power are increased significantly, allowing for high-power amplification with watt-level output power directly from the chip. In this work we demonstrate that a single integrated LMA amplifier is capable of both high-power amplification up to 800 mW with output saturation powers &gt; 115 mW as well as high small-signal net gain up to 30 dB and low-noise amplification with noise figures &lt; 4 dB. The LMA design further allows for a tuning of the polarization dependent gain (PDG) by adjusting the pump power and pump polarization, making it possible to completely nullify the polarization-sensitivity for any given signal power from the {\mu}W to mW-level. The power and noise performance achieved surpasses the performance level of many integrated amplifiers and fiber-based amplifiers. We believe that the tunability of the PDG combined with high gain and low noise figure can play a disruptive role for next-generation integrated amplifiers in telecommunication networks.</description>

      <title>Interference Fringe Mitigation in Short-Delay Self-Heterodyne Laser Phase Noise Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-heterodyne techniques are widely used for laser phase noise characterization due to their simple experimental setup and the removed need for a reference laser. However, when investigating low-noise lasers, optical delay paths shorter than the laser coherence length become necessary. This introduces interference patterns that distort the measured phase noise spectrum. To compensate for this distortion, we introduce a robust data-driven digital signal processing routine that integrates a kernel-based regression model into a phase noise power spectral density (PN-PSD) equalization framework. Unlike conventional compensation methods that rely on simplified phase noise models, our approach automatically adapts to arbitrary laser lineshapes by using Kernel Ridge Regression with automatic hyperparameter optimization. This approach effectively removes the interference artifacts and provides accurate PN-PSD estimates. We demonstrate the method's accuracy and effectiveness through simulations and via experimental measurements of two distinct low-noise lasers. The method's applicability to a broad range of lasers, minimal hardware requirements, and improved accuracy make this approach ideal for improving routine phase noise characterizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow-linewidth, compact and robust laser systems are of high interest, especially with prospects for portable quantum metrological applications. We realized an external cavity DFB-laser incorporating an intra-cavity EOM in a fully fiber-coupled manner. Additional active feedback on the EOM, by referencing a high finesse cavity, enabled us to reach low kHz-linewidths. We analyzed the laser spectrum by means of delayed self-heterodyne measurements to reconstruct the power spectral density. This is achieved by utilizing a data-driven power spectrum equalization approach. The presented laser setup is successfully used to create an ultracold gas by laser cooling on a narrow atomic transition of ${}^{40}$Ca at 1978 nm.</description>

      <title>Energy transfer between localized emitters in photonic cavities from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative and nonradiative resonant couplings between defects are ubiquitous phenomena in photonic devices used in classical and quantum information technology applications. In this work we present a first principles approach to enable quantitative predictions of the energy transfer between defects in photonic cavities, beyond the dipole-dipole approximation and including the many-body nature of the electronic states. As an example, we discuss the energy transfer from a dipole like emitter to an F center in MgO in a spherical cavity. We show that the cavity can be used to controllably enhance or suppress specific spin flip and spin conserving transitions. Specifically, we predict that a ~10 to 100 enhancement in the non-radiative resonant energy transfer rate can be gained in the case of the F center in MgO by a rather moderate cavity with Q~400, and equal suppression in the rate can be achieved by incorporating a significant energy mismatch between the electronic excitation and the cavity mode. Our framework is general and readily applicable to a wide range of devices where localized emitters are embedded in micro-spheres, core-shell nanoparticles, and dielectric Mie resonators. Hence, our approach paves the way to predict how to control energy transfer in quantum memories and in ultra-high density optical memories, and in a variety of quantum information platforms.</description>

      <title>Phase-space approach to cavity field dynamics in a squeezed thermal reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems, such as a single-mode cavity field coupled to a thermal bath, typically experience destructive effects due to interactions with their noisy environment. When the bath combines both thermal fluctuations and a nonclassical feature like quadrature squeezing, forming a squeezed thermal reservoir, the system's behaviour can change substantially. In this work, we study the evolution of the cavity field in this generalized environment using an alternative phase-space approach based on the Glauber-Sudarshan $P$-function. We derive a compact analytical expression for the time-dependent $P$-function for arbitrary initial cavity field states and demonstrate its utility through specific examples. Additionally, we obtain analytical expressions, as a function of time, for some statistical properties of the cavity field, as well as for the nonclassical depth, $\tau_m$, a nonclassicality measure calculated directly from the $P$-function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of two-photon cooperative emission in systems of two-level atoms. Two physically distinct regimes are analyzed. First, we investigate the case of a small number of atoms. We study the evolution of two-photon super- and sub-radiant states and associated two-photon spectra. Second, we investigate the problem of a constant density of atoms confined to a spherical volume. We analyze separately the cases in which the radius is small or large in comparison to the resonant wavelength.</description>

      <title>Robust and compact single-lens crossed-beam optical dipole trap for Bose-Einstein condensation in microgravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel concept for a compact and robust crossed-beam optical dipole trap (cODT) based on a single lens, designed for the efficient generation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) under dynamic conditions. The system employs two independent two-dimensional acousto-optical deflectors (AODs) in combination with a single high-numerical-aperture lens to provide three-dimensional control over the trap geometry, minimizing potential misalignments and ensuring long-term operational stability. By leveraging time-averaged potentials, rapid and efficient evaporative cooling sequences toward BECs are enabled. The functionality of the cODT under microgravity conditions has been successfully demonstrated in the Einstein-Elevator in Hannover, Germany, where the beam intersection was shown to remain stable throughout the microgravity phase of the flight. In addition, the system has been implemented in the sensor head of the INTENTAS project to verify BEC generation. Additional realization of one- and two-dimensional control of arrays of condensates through dynamic trap shaping was achieved. This versatile approach allows for advanced quantum sensing applications in mobile and space-based environments based on all- optical BECs.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed holographic molecular binding assays with internal calibration standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic molecular binding assays detect macromolecules binding to colloidal probe beads by monitoring nanometer-scale changes in the beads' diameters with holographic microscopy. Measured changes are interpreted with Maxwell Garnett effective-medium theory to infer the surface coverage of analyte molecules and therefore to measure the analyte concentration in solution. The precision and accuracy of those measurements can be degraded by run-to-run instrumental variations, which introduce systematic errors in the holographic characterization measurements. We detect and mitigate these errors by introducing a class of inert reference beads whose polymer brush coating resists macromolecular binding. The holographically measured diameter and refractive index of those beads serve as internal standards for THC measurements. To characterize the reference beads, we introduce a general all-optical method to measure the grafting density of the polymer brush that combines holographic characterization of the bead diameter with a refractometry measurement of the polymer's specific volume. The latter technique shows the specific volume of poly(ethylene oxide) to be 1.308(4) cubic nanometers per kilodalton. We use this suite of techniques to demonstrate a multiplexed immunoassay for immunoglobulin G (IgG) whose success validates the effective-medium analysis of holographic characterization measurements. Internal negative controls provided by the reference beads are validated by negative control measurements on alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which has a similar molecular weight to IgG but does not bind to the probe beads' binding sites.</description>

      <title>Plasma-state metasurfaces for ultra-intensive field manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-power lasers offer ultrahigh intensities for plasma interactions, but they lack advanced techniques to control the properties of the fields, because no optical elements could withstand their high intensities. The vibrant field of metasurfaces has transformed modern optics by enabling unprecedented control over light at subwavelength through deliberate design. However, metasurfaces have traditionally been limited to solid-state materials and low light intensities. Extending the sophisticated capabilities of metasurfaces from solids into the plasma realm would open new horizons for high-field science. Here, we experimentally demonstrate plasma-state metasurfaces (PSMs) through the photonic spin Hall effect and stable-propagating vortex beam generation irradiated by intense light. Time-resolved pump-probe measurements reveal that the functionality of PSMs can persist for several picoseconds, making them suitable for controlling ultra-intense femtosecond lasers, even in state-of-the-art multi-petawatt systems. Harnessing the powerful toolkit of metasurfaces, this approach holds the promise to revolutionize our ability to manipulate the amplitude, phase, polarization, and wavefront of high-power lasers during their pulse duration. It also opens new possibilities for innovative applications in laser-plasma interactions such as compact particle acceleration and novel radiation sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies phase retrieval for wave fields, aiming to recover the phase of an incoming wave from multi-plane intensity measurements behind different types of linear and nonlinear media. We show that unique phase retrieval can be achieved by utilizing intensity data produced by multiple media. This uniqueness does not require prescribed boundary conditions for the phase in the incidence plane, in contrast to existing phase retrieval methods based on the transport of intensity equation. Moreover, the uniqueness proofs lead to explicit phase reconstruction algorithms. Numerical simulations are presented to validate the theory.</description>

Abstract: Laser intensity noise is a main limitation of measurement and sensing mission represented by gravitational wave detection. We develop a noise decomposition model and design the core elements of the feedback loop independently based on the analysis results. We construct a fiber amplifier system with ultra-low intensity noise in the 0.1 mHz-1 Hz frequency band by the employment of an optoelectronic feedback loop that is specially designed. The study provides experimental basis and technologies for precise measurement and sensing system at ultra-low frequency.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide local field enhancement to be used as efficiency-boosting tools in fluorescence-based applications. For photostable quantum dots (QDs) to have enhanced emission, their size and exact location in the proximity of plasmonic nanostructure become key parameters while constructing light emitting devices. However, plasmonic nanostructures mostly suffer from non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which hinders the ultimate performance of fluorophores. In this work, we provided critical interparticle distances through finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations, where the radiative decay rate is equalized to the non-radiative counterpart for light emitting QD-based technologies. To show the promises of the QD placement at a critical distance, we demonstrate an optical switch for the fluorescence efficiency of a CdSe/ZnS core-shell QD (CSQD) by optically exciting the silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance. While the provided single particle spectroscopy allows for the observation of heterogeneity in CSQD-AgNP coupling that is often masked in ensemble measurements, our benchmark study serves as a base reference for the development of QD-based light emitting technologies by resolving the optically switchable active tuning of radiative decay rates.</description>

      <title>Quantum emitters in silicon: Purcell-enhanced lifetime modulation as a probe of local refractive index changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum emitters embedded in silicon photonic cavities offer a powerful and scalable platform for label-free refractive index sensing at the nanoscale. We propose and theoretically analyze a novel sensing mechanism based on Purcell-enhanced modulation of the emitter's spontaneous emission lifetime, enabling detection of refractive index changes via time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). In contrast to traditional resonance-shift sensors, our approach exploits the lifetime sensitivity to variations in the local density of optical states (LDOS), providing an intensity-independent, spectrally unresolvable, and CMOS-compatible sensing modality. We derive analytical expressions linking refractive index perturbations to relative lifetime shifts and identify an optimal off-resonance operation regime, where the lifetime response becomes linear and maximally sensitive to small perturbations. Parametric evaluation of the analytical expressions shows that, for moderate-quality photonic cavities (Q = 10^5 to 10^7), this method enables refractive index detection limits as low as 10^{-9} RIU, competitive with or even outperforming state-of-the-art plasmonic and microresonator sensors, yet requiring significantly simpler instrumentation. Furthermore, we show that long-lived emitters such as T-centers in silicon provide a unique advantage, allowing sub-nanosecond lifetime shifts to be resolved with standard TCSPC systems. Although room-temperature operation of quantum emitters in silicon has yet to be demonstrated, our results lay the theoretical foundation for scalable, room-temperature, quantum-enabled sensing of refractive index changes, eliminating the need for spectral resolution and cryogenic infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16630v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways, which can be used to isolate purely bright state contributions. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to model a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast All-Optical Measurement of Squeezed Vacuum in a Lithium Niobate Nanophotonic Circuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Squeezed vacuum, a fundamental resource for continuous-variable quantum information processing, has been used to demonstrate quantum advantages in sensing, communication, and computation. While most experiments use homodyne detection to characterize squeezing and are therefore limited to electronic bandwidths, recent experiments have shown optical parametric amplification (OPA) to be a viable measurement strategy. Here, we realize OPA-based quantum state tomography in integrated photonics and demonstrate the generation and all-optical Wigner tomography of squeezed vacuum in a nanophotonic circuit. We employ dispersion-engineering to enable the distortion-free propagation of femtosecond pulses and achieve ultrabroad operation bandwidths, effectively lifting the speed restrictions imposed by traditional electronics on quantum measurements with a theoretical maximum clock speed of 6.5 THz. We implement our circuit on thin-film lithium niobate, a platform compatible with a wide variety of active and passive photonic components. Our results chart a course for realizing all-optical ultrafast quantum information processing in an integrated room-temperature platform.</description>

Abstract: Microplastics pose a growing threat to reef-building corals. Yet, understanding of their uptake and long-term incorporation into coral skeletons remains limited due to the invasive nature of existing methods for monitoring and localizing microplastic. Here, we repurpose optical resonances in polymer spheres to transform microplastics into microscopic lasers. These laser particles emit distinctive spectral signatures that enable in vivo tracking of microplastics and simultaneous local sensing, shedding light on internalization and transport of individual microplastic particles in live corals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of dispersive waves governed by linear wave equations, where a finite duration source is applied. The resulting wave may be viewed as the superposition of modes before the source is turned on and after it is turned off. We consider the problem of relating the modes after the source term is turned off to the modes before the source term was turned on. We obtain explicit formulas in both the wavenumber and position representations. A number of special cases are considered. Using the methods presented, we obtain a generalization of the d'Alembert solution which applies to linear wave equations with constant coefficients.</description>
