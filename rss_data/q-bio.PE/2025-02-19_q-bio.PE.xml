      <title>Bayesian inference from time series of allele frequency data using exact simulation techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central statistical problem in population genetics is to infer evolutionary and biological parameters such as the strength of natural selection and allele age from DNA samples extracted from a contemporary population. That all samples come only from the present-day has long been known to limit statistical inference; there is potentially more information available if one also has access to ancient DNA so that inference is based on a time-series of historical changes in allele frequencies. We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for Bayesian inference from allele frequency time-series data based on an underlying Wright--Fisher diffusion model of evolution, through which one can infer the parameters of essentially any selection model including those with frequency-dependent effects. The chief novelty is that we show this method to be exact in the sense that it is possible to augment the state space explored by MCMC with the unobserved diffusion trajectory, even though the transition function of this diffusion is intractable. Through careful design of a proposal distribution, we describe an efficient method in which updates to the trajectory and accept/reject decisions are calculated without error. We illustrate the method on data capturing changes in coat colour over the past 20,000 years, and find evidence to support previous findings that the mutant alleles ASIP and MC1R responsible for changes in coat color have experienced very strong, possibly overdominant, selection and further provide estimates for the ages of these genes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a household-scale model for the invasion of Wolbachia into a resident mosquito population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In areas infested with Aedes aegypti mosquitoes it may be possible to control dengue, and some other vector-borne diseases, by introducing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes into the wildtype population. Thus far, empirical and theoretical studies of Wolbachia release have tended to focus on the dynamics at the community scale. However, Ae. aegypti mosquitoes typically dwell in and around the same houses as the people they bite and it can be insightful to explore what happens at the household scale where small population sizes lead to inherently stochastic dynamics. Here we use a continuous-time Markov framework to develop a stochastic household model for small populations of wildtype and Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. We investigate the transient and long term dynamics of the system, in particular examining the impact of stochasticity on the Wolbachia invasion threshold and bistability between the wildtype-only and Wolbachia-only steady states previously observed in deterministic models. We focus on the influence of key parameters which determine the fitness cost of Wolbachia infection and the probability of Wolbachia vertical transmission. Using Markov and matrix population theory, we derive salient characteristics of the system including the probability of successful Wolbachia invasion, the expected time until invasion and the probability that a Wolbachia-infected population reverts to a wildtype population. These attributes can inform strategies for the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. In addition, we find that releasing the minimum number of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes required to displace a resident wildtype population according to the deterministic model, only results in that outcome about 20% of the time in the stochastic model; a significantly larger release is required to reach a steady state composed entirely of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes 90% of the time.</description>

      <title>The GFB Tree and Tree Imbalance Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree balance plays an important role in various research areas in phylogenetics and computer science. Typically, it is measured with the help of a balance index or imbalance index. There are more than 25 such indices available, recently surveyed in a book by Fischer et al. They are used to rank rooted binary trees on a scale from the most balanced to the stringiest. We show that a wide range of subtree-sized based measures satisfying concavity and monotonicity conditions are minimized by the complete or greedy-from-the-bottom (GFB) tree and maximized by the caterpillar tree, yielding an infinitely large family of distinct new imbalance indices. Answering an open question from the literature, we show that one such established measure, the $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic, has the GFB tree as its unique minimizer. We also provide an alternative characterization of GFB trees, showing that they are equivalent to complete trees, which arise in different contexts. We give asymptotic bounds on the expected $\widehat{s}$-shape statistic under the uniform and Yule-Harding distributions of trees, and answer questions for the related $Q$-shape statistic as well.</description>

      <title>Decoding the spatial spread of cyanobacterial blooms in an epilimnion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyanobacterial blooms (CBs) pose significant global challenges due to their harmful toxins and socio-economic impacts, with nutrient availability playing a key role in their growth, as described by ecological stoichiometry (ES). However, real-world ecosystems exhibit spatial heterogeneity, limiting the applicability of simpler, spatially uniform models. To address this, we develop a spatially explicit partial differential equation model based on ES to study cyanobacteria in the epilimnion of freshwater systems. We establish the well-posedness of the model and perform a stability analysis, showing that it admits two linearly stable steady states, leading to either extinction or saturation. We use the finite elements method to numerically solve our system on a real lake domain derived from Geographic Information System (GIS) data and realistic wind conditions extrapolated from ERA5-Land. Our numerical results highlight the importance of lake shape and size in CB monitoring, while global sensitivity analysis using Sobol Indices identifies light attenuation and intensity as primary drivers of bloom variation, with water movement influencing early bloom stages and nutrient input becoming critical over time. This model supports continuous water-quality monitoring, informing agricultural, recreational, economic, and public health strategies for mitigating CBs.</description>

      <title>The gene's eye-view of quantitative genetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling the evolution of a continuous trait in a biological population is one of the oldest problems in evolutionary biology, which led to the birth of quantitative genetics. With the recent development of GWAS methods, it has become essential to link the evolution of the trait distribution to the underlying evolution of allelic frequencies at many loci, co-contributing to the trait value. The way most articles go about this is to make assumptions on the trait distribution, and use Wright's formula to model how the evolution of the trait translates on each individual locus. Here, we take a gene's eye-view of the system, starting from an explicit finite-loci model with selection, drift, recombination and mutation, in which the trait value is a direct product of the genome. We let the number of loci go to infinity under the assumption of strong recombination, and characterize the limit behavior of a given locus with a McKean-Vlasov SDE and the corresponding Fokker-Planck IPDE. In words, the selection on a typical locus depends on the mean behaviour of the other loci which can be approximated with the law of the focal locus. Results include the independence of two loci and explicit stationary distribution for allelic frequencies at a given locus (under some hypotheses on the fitness function). We recover Wright's formula and the breeder's equation as special cases.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Interaction of Cultural Evolution Mechanisms in Experimental Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how cognitive and social mechanisms shape the evolution of complex artifacts such as songs is central to cultural evolution research. Social network topology (what artifacts are available?), selection (which are chosen?), and reproduction (how are they copied?) have all been proposed as key influencing factors. However, prior research has rarely studied them together due to methodological challenges. We address this gap through a controlled naturalistic paradigm whereby participants (N=2,404) are placed in networks and are asked to iteratively choose and sing back melodies from their neighbors. We show that this setting yields melodies that are more complex and more pleasant than those found in the more-studied linear transmission setting, and exhibits robust differences across topologies. Crucially, these differences are diminished when selection or reproduction bias are eliminated, suggesting an interaction between mechanisms. These findings shed light on the interplay of mechanisms underlying the evolution of cultural artifacts.</description>

      <title>Evolution of cooperation in a bimodal mixture of conditional cooperators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensive behavioral experiments reveal that conditional cooperation is a prevalent phenomenon. Previous game-theoretical studies have predominantly relied on hard-manner models, where cooperation is triggered only upon reaching a specific threshold. However, this approach contrasts with the observed flexibility of human behaviors, where individuals adapt their strategies dynamically based on their surroundings. To capture this adaptability, we introduce a soft form of conditional cooperation by integrating the Q-learning algorithm from reinforcement learning. In this form, players not only reciprocate mutual cooperation but may also defect in highly cooperative environments or cooperate in less cooperative settings to maximize rewards. To explore the effects of hard and soft conditional cooperators, we examine their interactions in two scenarios: structural mixture (SM) and probabilistic mixture (PM), where the two behavioral modes are fixed and probabilistically adopted, respectively. In SM, hard conditional cooperators enhance cooperation when the threshold is low but hinder it otherwise. Surprisingly, in PM, the cooperation prevalence exhibits two first-order phase transitions as the probability is varied, leading to high, low, and vanishing levels of cooperation. Analysis of Q-tables offers insights into the "psychological shifts" of soft conditional cooperators and the overall evolutionary dynamics. Model extensions confirm the robustness of our findings. These results highlight the novel complexities arising from the diversity of conditional cooperators.</description>
