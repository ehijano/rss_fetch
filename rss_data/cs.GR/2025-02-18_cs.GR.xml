      <title>Corotational Hinge-based Thin Plates/Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10872v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present six thin plate/shell models, derived from three distinct types of curvature operators formulated within the corotational frame, for simulating both rest-flat and rest-curved triangular meshes. Each curvature operator derives a curvature expression corresponding to both a plate model and a shell model. The corotational edge-based hinge model uses an edge-based stencil to compute directional curvature, while the corotational FVM hinge model utilizes a triangle-centered stencil, applying the finite volume method (FVM) to superposition directional curvatures across edges, yielding a generalized curvature. The corotational smoothed hinge model also employs a triangle-centered stencil but transforms directional curvatures into a generalized curvature based on a quadratic surface fit. All models assume small strain and small curvature, leading to constant bending energy Hessians, which benefit implicit integrators. Through quantitative benchmarks and qualitative elastodynamic simulations with large time steps, we demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and stability of these models. Our contributions enhance the thin plate/shell library for use in both computer graphics and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>FlexControl: Computation-Aware ControlNet with Differentiable Router for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ControlNet offers a powerful way to guide diffusion-based generative models, yet most implementations rely on ad-hoc heuristics to choose which network blocks to control-an approach that varies unpredictably with different tasks. To address this gap, we propose FlexControl, a novel framework that copies all diffusion blocks during training and employs a trainable gating mechanism to dynamically select which blocks to activate at each denoising step. With introducing a computation-aware loss, we can encourage control blocks only to activate when it benefit the generation quality. By eliminating manual block selection, FlexControl enhances adaptability across diverse tasks and streamlines the design pipeline, with computation-aware training loss in an end-to-end training manner. Through comprehensive experiments on both UNet (e.g., SD1.5) and DiT (e.g., SD3.0), we show that our method outperforms existing ControlNet variants in certain key aspects of interest. As evidenced by both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, FlexControl preserves or enhances image fidelity while also reducing computational overhead by selectively activating the most relevant blocks. These results underscore the potential of a flexible, data-driven approach for controlled diffusion and open new avenues for efficient generative model design.</description>

      <title>NPSim: Nighttime Photorealistic Simulation From Daytime Images With Monocular Inverse Rendering and Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation is an important task for autonomous driving. A powerful autonomous driving system should be capable of handling images under all conditions, including nighttime. Generating accurate and diverse nighttime semantic segmentation datasets is crucial for enhancing the performance of computer vision algorithms in low-light conditions. In this thesis, we introduce a novel approach named NPSim, which enables the simulation of realistic nighttime images from real daytime counterparts with monocular inverse rendering and ray tracing. NPSim comprises two key components: mesh reconstruction and relighting. The mesh reconstruction component generates an accurate representation of the scene structure by combining geometric information extracted from the input RGB image and semantic information from its corresponding semantic labels. The relighting component integrates real-world nighttime light sources and material characteristics to simulate the complex interplay of light and object surfaces under low-light conditions. The scope of this thesis mainly focuses on the implementation and evaluation of the mesh reconstruction component. Through experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the mesh reconstruction component in producing high-quality scene meshes and their generality across different autonomous driving datasets. We also propose a detailed experiment plan for evaluating the entire pipeline, including both quantitative metrics in training state-of-the-art supervised and unsupervised semantic segmentation approaches and human perceptual studies, aiming to indicate the capability of our approach to generate realistic nighttime images and the value of our dataset in steering future progress in the field.</description>

      <title>E-3DGS: Event-Based Novel View Rendering of Large-Scale Scenes Using 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis techniques predominantly utilize RGB cameras, inheriting their limitations such as the need for sufficient lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and restricted dynamic range. In contrast, event cameras are significantly more resilient to these limitations but have been less explored in this domain, particularly in large-scale settings. Current methodologies primarily focus on front-facing or object-oriented (360-degree view) scenarios. For the first time, we introduce 3D Gaussians for event-based novel view synthesis. Our method reconstructs large and unbounded scenes with high visual quality. We contribute the first real and synthetic event datasets tailored for this setting. Our method demonstrates superior novel view synthesis and consistently outperforms the baseline EventNeRF by a margin of 11-25% in PSNR (dB) while being orders of magnitude faster in reconstruction and rendering.</description>

      <title>Real-time Neural Rendering of LiDAR Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static LiDAR scanners produce accurate, dense, colored point clouds, but often contain obtrusive artifacts which makes them ill-suited for direct display. We propose an efficient method to render photorealistic images of such scans without any expensive preprocessing or training of a scene-specific model. A naive projection of the point cloud to the output view using 1x1 pixels is fast and retains the available detail, but also results in unintelligible renderings as background points leak in between the foreground pixels. The key insight is that these projections can be transformed into a realistic result using a deep convolutional model in the form of a U-Net, and a depth-based heuristic that prefilters the data. The U-Net also handles LiDAR-specific problems such as missing parts due to occlusion, color inconsistencies and varying point densities. We also describe a method to generate synthetic training data to deal with imperfectly-aligned ground truth images. Our method achieves real-time rendering rates using an off-the-shelf GPU and outperforms the state-of-the-art in both speed and quality.</description>

      <title>MagicArticulate: Make Your 3D Models Articulation-Ready</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12135v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the explosive growth of 3D content creation, there is an increasing demand for automatically converting static 3D models into articulation-ready versions that support realistic animation. Traditional approaches rely heavily on manual annotation, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, the lack of large-scale benchmarks has hindered the development of learning-based solutions. In this work, we present MagicArticulate, an effective framework that automatically transforms static 3D models into articulation-ready assets. Our key contributions are threefold. First, we introduce Articulation-XL, a large-scale benchmark containing over 33k 3D models with high-quality articulation annotations, carefully curated from Objaverse-XL. Second, we propose a novel skeleton generation method that formulates the task as a sequence modeling problem, leveraging an auto-regressive transformer to naturally handle varying numbers of bones or joints within skeletons and their inherent dependencies across different 3D models. Third, we predict skinning weights using a functional diffusion process that incorporates volumetric geodesic distance priors between vertices and joints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicArticulate significantly outperforms existing methods across diverse object categories, achieving high-quality articulation that enables realistic animation.

      <title>Rest Shape Optimization for Sag-Free Discrete Elastic Rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new rest shape optimization framework to achieve sag-free simulations of discrete elastic rods. To optimize rest shape parameters, we formulate a minimization problem based on the kinetic energy with a regularizer while imposing box constraints on these parameters to ensure the system's stability. Our method solves the resulting constrained minimization problem via the Gauss-Newton algorithm augmented with penalty methods. We demonstrate that the optimized rest shape parameters enable discrete elastic rods to achieve static equilibrium for a wide range of strand geometries and material parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models offer unprecedented image generation power given just a text prompt. While emerging approaches for controlling diffusion models have enabled users to specify the desired spatial layouts of the generated content, they cannot predict or control where viewers will pay more attention due to the complexity of human vision. Recognizing the significance of attention-controllable image generation in practical applications, we present a saliency-guided framework to incorporate the data priors of human visual attention mechanisms into the generation process. Given a user-specified viewer attention distribution, our control module conditions a diffusion model to generate images that attract viewers' attention toward the desired regions. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we performed an eye-tracked user study and a large-scale model-based saliency analysis. The results evidence that both the cross-user eye gaze distributions and the saliency models' predictions align with the desired attention distributions. Lastly, we outline several applications, including interactive design of saliency guidance, attention suppression in unwanted regions, and adaptive generation for varied display/viewing conditions.</description>

      <title>FlexCAD: Unified and Versatile Controllable CAD Generation with Fine-tuned Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there is a growing interest in creating computer-aided design (CAD) models based on user intent, known as controllable CAD generation. Existing work offers limited controllability and needs separate models for different types of control, reducing efficiency and practicality. To achieve controllable generation across all CAD construction hierarchies, such as sketch-extrusion, extrusion, sketch, face, loop and curve, we propose FlexCAD, a unified model by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). First, to enhance comprehension by LLMs, we represent a CAD model as a structured text by abstracting each hierarchy as a sequence of text tokens. Second, to address various controllable generation tasks in a unified model, we introduce a hierarchy-aware masking strategy. Specifically, during training, we mask a hierarchy-aware field in the CAD text with a mask token. This field, composed of a sequence of tokens, can be set flexibly to represent various hierarchies. Subsequently, we ask LLMs to predict this masked field. During inference, the user intent is converted into a CAD text with a mask token replacing the part the user wants to modify, which is then fed into FlexCAD to generate new CAD models. Comprehensive experiments on public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of FlexCAD in both generation quality and controllability. Code will be available at https://github.com/microsoft/FlexCAD.</description>

      <title>GaussianSpa: An "Optimizing-Sparsifying" Simplification Framework for Compact and High-Quality 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a mainstream for novel view synthesis, leveraging continuous aggregations of Gaussian functions to model scene geometry. However, 3DGS suffers from substantial memory requirements to store the multitude of Gaussians, hindering its practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce GaussianSpa, an optimization-based simplification framework for compact and high-quality 3DGS. Specifically, we formulate the simplification as an optimization problem associated with the 3DGS training. Correspondingly, we propose an efficient "optimizing-sparsifying" solution that alternately solves two independent sub-problems, gradually imposing strong sparsity onto the Gaussians in the training process. Our comprehensive evaluations on various datasets show the superiority of GaussianSpa over existing state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, GaussianSpa achieves an average PSNR improvement of 0.9 dB on the real-world Deep Blending dataset with 10$\times$ fewer Gaussians compared to the vanilla 3DGS. Our project page is available at https://noodle-lab.github.io/gaussianspa/.</description>
