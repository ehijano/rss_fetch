      <title>A Mel Spectrogram Enhancement Paradigm Based on CWT in Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic features play an important role in improving the quality of the synthesised speech. Currently, the Mel spectrogram is a widely employed acoustic feature in most acoustic models. However, due to the fine-grained loss caused by its Fourier transform process, the clarity of speech synthesised by Mel spectrogram is compromised in mutant signals. In order to obtain a more detailed Mel spectrogram, we propose a Mel spectrogram enhancement paradigm based on the continuous wavelet transform (CWT). This paradigm introduces an additional task: a more detailed wavelet spectrogram, which like the post-processing network takes as input the Mel spectrogram output by the decoder. We choose Tacotron2 and Fastspeech2 for experimental validation in order to test autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) speech systems, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate that the speech synthesised using the model with the Mel spectrogram enhancement paradigm exhibits higher MOS, with an improvement of 0.14 and 0.09 compared to the baseline model, respectively. These findings provide some validation for the universality of the enhancement paradigm, as they demonstrate the success of the paradigm in different architectures.</description>

      <title>Interface Design for Self-Supervised Speech Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised speech (SSL) models have recently become widely adopted for many downstream speech processing tasks. The general usage pattern is to employ SSL models as feature extractors, and then train a downstream prediction head to solve a specific task. However, different layers of SSL models have been shown to capture different types of information, and the methods of combining them are not well studied. To this end, we extend the general framework for SSL model utilization by proposing the interface that connects the upstream and downstream. Under this view, the dominant technique of combining features via a layerwise weighted sum can be regarded as a specific interface. We propose several alternative interface designs and demonstrate that the weighted sum interface is suboptimal for many tasks. In particular, we show that a convolutional interface whose depth scales logarithmically with the depth of the upstream model consistently outperforms many other interface designs.</description>

      <title>JEN-1 DreamStyler: Customized Musical Concept Learning via Pivotal Parameters Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large models for text-to-music generation have achieved significant progress, facilitating the creation of high-quality and varied musical compositions from provided text prompts. However, input text prompts may not precisely capture user requirements, particularly when the objective is to generate music that embodies a specific concept derived from a designated reference collection. In this paper, we propose a novel method for customized text-to-music generation, which can capture the concept from a two-minute reference music and generate a new piece of music conforming to the concept. We achieve this by fine-tuning a pretrained text-to-music model using the reference music. However, directly fine-tuning all parameters leads to overfitting issues. To address this problem, we propose a Pivotal Parameters Tuning method that enables the model to assimilate the new concept while preserving its original generative capabilities. Additionally, we identify a potential concept conflict when introducing multiple concepts into the pretrained model. We present a concept enhancement strategy to distinguish multiple concepts, enabling the fine-tuned model to generate music incorporating either individual or multiple concepts simultaneously. Since we are the first to work on the customized music generation task, we also introduce a new dataset and evaluation protocol for the new task. Our proposed Jen1-DreamStyler outperforms several baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Demos will be available at https://www.jenmusic.ai/research#DreamStyler.</description>

      <title>Towards Audio Codec-based Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent improvements in neural audio codec (NAC) models have generated interest in adopting pre-trained codecs for a variety of speech processing applications to take advantage of the efficiencies gained from high compression, but these have yet been applied to the speech separation (SS) task. SS can benefit from high compression because the compute required for traditional SS models makes them impractical for many edge computing use cases. However, SS is a waveform-masking task where compression tends to introduce distortions that severely impact performance. Here we propose a novel task of Audio Codec-based SS, where SS is performed within the embedding space of a NAC, and propose a new model, Codecformer, to address this task. At inference, Codecformer achieves a 52x reduction in MAC while producing separation performance comparable to a cloud deployment of Sepformer. This method charts a new direction for performing efficient SS in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Rapid Language Adaptation for Multilingual E2E Speech Recognition Using Encoder Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end multilingual speech recognition models handle multiple languages through a single model, often incorporating language identification to automatically detect the language of incoming speech. Since the common scenario is where the language is already known, these models can perform as language-specific by using language information as prompts, which is particularly beneficial for attention-based encoder-decoder architectures. However, the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) approach, which enhances recognition via joint decoding and multi-task training, does not normally incorporate language prompts due to its conditionally independent output tokens. To overcome this, we introduce an encoder prompting technique within the self-conditioned CTC framework, enabling language-specific adaptation of the CTC model in a zero-shot manner. Our method has shown to significantly reduce errors by 28% on average and by 41% on low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap: Integrating Pre-trained Speech Enhancement and Recognition Models for Robust Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise robustness is critical when applying automatic speech recognition (ASR) in real-world scenarios. One solution involves the used of speech enhancement (SE) models as the front end of ASR. However, neural network-based (NN-based) SE often introduces artifacts into the enhanced signals and harms ASR performance, particularly when SE and ASR are independently trained. Therefore, this study introduces a simple yet effective SE post-processing technique to address the gap between various pre-trained SE and ASR models. A bridge module, which is a lightweight NN, is proposed to evaluate the signal-level information of the speech signal. Subsequently, using the signal-level information, the observation addition technique is applied to effectively reduce the shortcomings of SE. The experimental results demonstrate the success of our method in integrating diverse pre-trained SE and ASR models, considerably boosting the ASR robustness. Crucially, no prior knowledge of the ASR or speech contents is required during the training or inference stages. Moreover, the effectiveness of this approach extends to different datasets without necessitating the fine-tuning of the bridge module, ensuring efficiency and improved generalization.</description>

      <title>ED-sKWS: Early-Decision Spiking Neural Networks for Rapid,and Energy-Efficient Keyword Spotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keyword Spotting (KWS) is essential in edge computing requiring rapid and energy-efficient responses. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are well-suited for KWS for their efficiency and temporal capacity for speech. To further reduce the latency and energy consumption, this study introduces ED-sKWS, an SNN-based KWS model with an early-decision mechanism that can stop speech processing and output the result before the end of speech utterance. Furthermore, we introduce a Cumulative Temporal (CT) loss that can enhance prediction accuracy at both the intermediate and final timesteps. To evaluate early-decision performance, we present the SC-100 dataset including 100 speech commands with beginning and end timestamp annotation. Experiments on the Google Speech Commands v2 and our SC-100 datasets show that ED-sKWS maintains competitive accuracy with 61% timesteps and 52% energy consumption compared to SNN models without early-decision mechanism, ensuring rapid response and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>A dual task learning approach to fine-tune a multilingual semantic speech encoder for Spoken Language Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning is vastly used to efficiently represent speech for Spoken Language Understanding, gradually replacing conventional approaches. Meanwhile, textual SSL models are proposed to encode language-agnostic semantics. SAMU-XLSR framework employed this semantic information to enrich multilingual speech representations. A recent study investigated SAMU-XLSR in-domain semantic enrichment by specializing it on downstream transcriptions, leading to state-of-the-art results on a challenging SLU task. This study's interest lies in the loss of multilingual performances and lack of specific-semantics training induced by such specialization in close languages without any SLU implication. We also consider SAMU-XLSR's loss of initial cross-lingual abilities due to a separate SLU fine-tuning. Therefore, this paper proposes a dual task learning approach to improve SAMU-XLSR semantic enrichment while considering distant languages for multilingual and language portability experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose UNIVERSE++, a universal speech enhancement method based on score-based diffusion and adversarial training. Specifically, we improve the existing UNIVERSE model that decouples clean speech feature extraction and diffusion. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we make several modifications to the network architecture, improving training stability and final performance. Second, we introduce an adversarial loss to promote learning high quality speech features. Third, we propose a low-rank adaptation scheme with a phoneme fidelity loss to improve content preservation in the enhanced speech. In the experiments, we train a universal enhancement model on a large scale dataset of speech degraded by noise, reverberation, and various distortions. The results on multiple public benchmark datasets demonstrate that UNIVERSE++ compares favorably to both discriminative and generative baselines for a wide range of qualitative and intelligibility metrics.</description>

      <title>Binaural Selective Attention Model for Target Speaker Extraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable ability of humans to selectively focus on a target speaker in cocktail party scenarios is facilitated by binaural audio processing. In this paper, we present a binaural time-domain Target Speaker Extraction model based on the Filter-and-Sum Network (FaSNet). Inspired by human selective hearing, our proposed model introduces target speaker embedding into separators using a multi-head attention-based selective attention block. We also compared two binaural interaction approaches -- the cosine similarity of time-domain signals and inter-channel correlation in learned spectral representations. Our experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms monaural configurations and state-of-the-art multi-channel target speaker extraction models, achieving best-in-class performance with 18.52 dB SI-SDR, 19.12 dB SDR, and 3.05 PESQ scores under anechoic two-speaker test configurations.</description>

      <title>Performant ASR Models for Medical Entities in Accented Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent strides in automatic speech recognition (ASR) have accelerated their application in the medical domain where their performance on accented medical named entities (NE) such as drug names, diagnoses, and lab results, is largely unknown. We rigorously evaluate multiple ASR models on a clinical English dataset of 93 African accents. Our analysis reveals that despite some models achieving low overall word error rates (WER), errors in clinical entities are higher, potentially posing substantial risks to patient safety. To empirically demonstrate this, we extract clinical entities from transcripts, develop a novel algorithm to align ASR predictions with these entities, and compute medical NE Recall, medical WER, and character error rate. Our results show that fine-tuning on accented clinical speech improves medical WER by a wide margin (25-34 % relative), improving their practical applicability in healthcare environments.</description>

      <title>PSLM: Parallel Generation of Text and Speech with LLMs for Low-Latency Spoken Dialogue Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal language models that process both text and speech have a potential for applications in spoken dialogue systems. However, current models face two major challenges in response generation latency: (1) generating a spoken response requires the prior generation of a written response, and (2) speech sequences are significantly longer than text sequences. This study addresses these issues by extending the input and output sequences of the language model to support the parallel generation of text and speech. Our experiments on spoken question answering tasks demonstrate that our approach improves latency while maintaining the quality of response content. Additionally, we show that latency can be further reduced by generating speech in multiple sequences. Demo samples are available at https://rinnakk.github.io/research/publications/PSLM.</description>

      <title>Integrating Representational Gestures into Automatically Generated Embodied Explanations and its Effects on Understanding and Interaction Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In human interaction, gestures serve various functions such as marking speech rhythm, highlighting key elements, and supplementing information. These gestures are also observed in explanatory contexts. However, the impact of gestures on explanations provided by virtual agents remains underexplored. A user study was carried out to investigate how different types of gestures influence perceived interaction quality and listener understanding. This study addresses the effect of gestures in explanation by developing an embodied virtual explainer integrating both beat gestures and iconic gestures to enhance its automatically generated verbal explanations. Our model combines beat gestures generated by a learned speech-driven synthesis module with manually captured iconic gestures, supporting the agent's verbal expressions about the board game Quarto! as an explanation scenario. Findings indicate that neither the use of iconic gestures alone nor their combination with beat gestures outperforms the baseline or beat-only conditions in terms of understanding. Nonetheless, compared to prior research, the embodied agent significantly enhances understanding.</description>

      <title>Talk With Human-like Agents: Empathetic Dialogue Through Perceptible Acoustic Reception and Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced agents become increasingly prevalent in Human-AI communication, offering vast potential from entertainment to professional domains. However, current multi-modal dialogue systems overlook the acoustic information present in speech, which is crucial for understanding human communication nuances. This oversight can lead to misinterpretations of speakers' intentions, resulting in inconsistent or even contradictory responses within dialogues. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose PerceptiveAgent, an empathetic multi-modal dialogue system designed to discern deeper or more subtle meanings beyond the literal interpretations of words through the integration of speech modality perception. Employing LLMs as a cognitive core, PerceptiveAgent perceives acoustic information from input speech and generates empathetic responses based on speaking styles described in natural language. Experimental results indicate that PerceptiveAgent excels in contextual understanding by accurately discerning the speakers' true intentions in scenarios where the linguistic meaning is either contrary to or inconsistent with the speaker's true feelings, producing more nuanced and expressive spoken dialogues. Code is publicly available at: \url{https://github.com/Haoqiu-Yan/PerceptiveAgent}.</description>

      <title>Sound event detection based on auxiliary decoder and maximum probability aggregation for DCASE Challenge 2024 Task 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report, we propose three novel methods for developing a sound event detection (SED) model for the DCASE 2024 Challenge Task 4. First, we propose an auxiliary decoder attached to the final convolutional block to improve feature extraction capabilities while reducing dependency on embeddings from pre-trained large models. The proposed auxiliary decoder operates independently from the main decoder, enhancing performance of the convolutional block during the initial training stages by assigning a different weight strategy between main and auxiliary decoder losses. Next, to address the time interval issue between the DESED and MAESTRO datasets, we propose maximum probability aggregation (MPA) during the training step. The proposed MPA method enables the model's output to be aligned with soft labels of 1 s in the MAESTRO dataset. Finally, we propose a multi-channel input feature that employs various versions of logmel and MFCC features to generate time-frequency pattern. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of these proposed methods in a view of improving SED performance by achieving a balanced enhancement across different datasets and label types. Ultimately, this approach presents a significant step forward in developing more robust and flexible SED models</description>

      <title>DINO-VITS: Data-Efficient Zero-Shot TTS with Self-Supervised Speaker Verification Loss for Noise Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address zero-shot TTS systems' noise-robustness problem by proposing a dual-objective training for the speaker encoder using self-supervised DINO loss. This approach enhances the speaker encoder with the speech synthesis objective, capturing a wider range of speech characteristics beneficial for voice cloning. At the same time, the DINO objective improves speaker representation learning, ensuring robustness to noise and speaker discriminability. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in subjective metrics under both clean and noisy conditions, outperforming traditional speaker-encoderbased TTS systems. Additionally, we explore training zeroshot TTS on noisy, unlabeled data. Our two-stage training strategy, leveraging self-supervised speech models to distinguish between noisy and clean speech, shows notable advances in similarity and naturalness, especially with noisy training datasets, compared to the ASR-transcription-based approach.</description>

      <title>RawBMamba: End-to-End Bidirectional State Space Model for Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fake artefacts for discriminating between bonafide and fake audio can exist in both short- and long-range segments. Therefore, combining local and global feature information can effectively discriminate between bonafide and fake audio. This paper proposes an end-to-end bidirectional state space model, named RawBMamba, to capture both short- and long-range discriminative information for audio deepfake detection. Specifically, we use sinc Layer and multiple convolutional layers to capture short-range features, and then design a bidirectional Mamba to address Mamba's unidirectional modelling problem and further capture long-range feature information. Moreover, we develop a bidirectional fusion module to integrate embeddings, enhancing audio context representation and combining short- and long-range information. The results show that our proposed RawBMamba achieves a 34.1\% improvement over Rawformer on ASVspoof2021 LA dataset, and demonstrates competitive performance on other datasets.</description>

      <title>Privacy in Speech Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech technology for communication, accessing information and services has rapidly improved in quality. It is convenient and appealing because speech is the primary mode of communication for humans. Such technology however also presents proven threats to privacy. Speech is a tool for communication and it will thus inherently contain private information. Importantly, it however also contains a wealth of side information, such as information related to health, emotions, affiliations, and relationships, all of which are private. Exposing such private information can lead to serious threats such as price gouging, harassment, extortion, and stalking. This paper is a tutorial on privacy issues related to speech technology, modeling their threats, approaches for protecting users' privacy, measuring the performance of privacy-protecting methods, perception of privacy as well as societal and legal consequences. In addition to a tutorial overview, it also presents lines for further development where improvements are most urgently needed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents CrossVoice, a novel cascade-based Speech-to-Speech Translation (S2ST) system employing advanced ASR, MT, and TTS technologies with cross-lingual prosody preservation through transfer learning. We conducted comprehensive experiments comparing CrossVoice with direct-S2ST systems, showing improved BLEU scores on tasks such as Fisher Es-En, VoxPopuli Fr-En and prosody preservation on benchmark datasets CVSS-T and IndicTTS. With an average mean opinion score of 3.75 out of 4, speech synthesized by CrossVoice closely rivals human speech on the benchmark, highlighting the efficacy of cascade-based systems and transfer learning in multilingual S2ST with prosody transfer.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Prosody Transfer: Comparing Supervised &amp; Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of prosody transfer in speech synthesis systems is rapidly advancing. This research is focused on evaluating learning methods for adapting pre-trained monolingual text-to-speech (TTS) models to multilingual conditions, i.e., Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Transfer Learning (TL). This comparison utilizes three distinct metrics: Mean Opinion Score (MOS), Recognition Accuracy (RA), and Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD). Results demonstrate that, in comparison to SFT, TL leads to significantly enhanced performance, with an average MOS higher by 1.53 points, a 37.5% increase in RA, and approximately a 7.8-point improvement in MCD. These findings are instrumental in helping build TTS models for low-resource languages.</description>

      <title>CtrSVDD: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline Analysis for Controlled Singing Voice Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent singing voice synthesis and conversion advancements necessitate robust singing voice deepfake detection (SVDD) models. Current SVDD datasets face challenges due to limited controllability, diversity in deepfake methods, and licensing restrictions. Addressing these gaps, we introduce CtrSVDD, a large-scale, diverse collection of bonafide and deepfake singing vocals. These vocals are synthesized using state-of-the-art methods from publicly accessible singing voice datasets. CtrSVDD includes 47.64 hours of bonafide and 260.34 hours of deepfake singing vocals, spanning 14 deepfake methods and involving 164 singer identities. We also present a baseline system with flexible front-end features, evaluated against a structured train/dev/eval split. The experiments show the importance of feature selection and highlight a need for generalization towards deepfake methods that deviate further from training distribution. The CtrSVDD dataset and baselines are publicly accessible.</description>

      <title>Towards Lightweight Speaker Verification via Adaptive Neural Network Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern speaker verification (SV) systems typically demand expensive storage and computing resources, thereby hindering their deployment on mobile devices. In this paper, we explore adaptive neural network quantization for lightweight speaker verification. Firstly, we propose a novel adaptive uniform precision quantization method which enables the dynamic generation of quantization centroids customized for each network layer based on k-means clustering. By applying it to the pre-trained SV systems, we obtain a series of quantized variants with different bit widths. To enhance the performance of low-bit quantized models, a mixed precision quantization algorithm along with a multi-stage fine-tuning (MSFT) strategy is further introduced. Unlike uniform precision quantization, mixed precision approach allows for the assignment of varying bit widths to different network layers. When bit combination is determined, MSFT is employed to progressively quantize and fine-tune network in a specific order. Finally, we design two distinct binary quantization schemes to mitigate performance degradation of 1-bit quantized models: the static and adaptive quantizers. Experiments on VoxCeleb demonstrate that lossless 4-bit uniform precision quantization is achieved on both ResNets and DF-ResNets, yielding a promising compression ratio of around 8. Moreover, compared to uniform precision approach, mixed precision quantization not only obtains additional performance improvements with a similar model size but also offers the flexibility to generate bit combination for any desirable model size. In addition, our suggested 1-bit quantization schemes remarkably boost the performance of binarized models. Finally, a thorough comparison with existing lightweight SV systems reveals that our proposed models outperform all previous methods by a large margin across various model size ranges.</description>

      <title>Connected Speech-Based Cognitive Assessment in Chinese and English</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel benchmark dataset and prediction tasks for investigating approaches to assess cognitive function through analysis of connected speech. The dataset consists of speech samples and clinical information for speakers of Mandarin Chinese and English with different levels of cognitive impairment as well as individuals with normal cognition. These data have been carefully matched by age and sex by propensity score analysis to ensure balance and representativity in model training. The prediction tasks encompass mild cognitive impairment diagnosis and cognitive test score prediction. This framework was designed to encourage the development of approaches to speech-based cognitive assessment which generalise across languages. We illustrate it by presenting baseline prediction models that employ language-agnostic and comparable features for diagnosis and cognitive test score prediction. The models achieved unweighted average recall was 59.2% in diagnosis, and root mean squared error of 2.89 in score prediction.</description>
