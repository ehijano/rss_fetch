      <title>An example of path integral reduction for a simple symmetric mechanical system on a product manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A path integral reduction procedure in Wiener-type path integrals, based on the approach developed in arXiv:1912.13124, is applied to a simple invariant mechanical system defined on a product manifold with a given free, proper and isometric action of the group SO(2). The Jacobian of the path integral reduction and the integral relation between the path integrals representing the fundamental solutions of the parabolic equations on initial and reduced manifolds are obtained.</description>

      <title>Spectral Torsion for Nonminimal de-Rham Hodge Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate some new spectral torsion which is the extension of spectral torsion for Dirac operators, and compute the spectral torsion associated with nonminimal de Rham-Hodge operators on manifolds with (or without) boundary. The novelty of this paper lies in the calculation related to the noncommutative residue for the inverse of the Laplacion with non-scalar principle symbols.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and Low Energy Excitations in an Attractive Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an attractive Hubbard model on bipartite lattices. In the grand canonical formalism,we prove the existence of superconducting long-range order in the ground state with the chemical potential corresponding to half filling. We also study the low-energy excitations above several ground states for the translationally invariant Hamiltonian. We prove the following: (i) The pairing excitations are gapless above the ground states when the number of fermions deviates from that of the half filling by the order of the volume. (ii) A certain class of single-fermion excitations shows a non-vanishing spectral gap above the ground state with an even number of fermions in a strong coupling and low-density regime.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent conformally invariant integral transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an extension of the Hilbert transform, which characterizes the spacetime conformally invariant integral transform, we show that, based on the Bhabha theory, a spin-dependent conformally invariant integral transform can be written as a product of the spin-independent integral transform and the Casimir operator of the corresponding conformal group. In contrast to an ordinary context, where spacetime translation symmetry is assumed, we introduce an intrinsic momentum operator, by which the Casimir operator turns out to be spacetime dependent (spin-orbit coupling, Pauli-Lubanski pseudo vector, and the like). We also show that the physical state annihilated by the intrinsic momentum operator represents a spin-s state.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation for Jump-Diffusion Stochastic Master Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates parameter estimation for open quantum systems under continuous observation, whose conditional dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion stochastic master equations (SMEs) associated with quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements. Estimation of model parameters such as coupling strengths or measurement efficiencies is essential, yet in practice these parameters are often uncertain. We first establish the existence and well-posedness of a reduced quantum filter: for an N-level system, the conditional evolution can be represented in an O(N)-dimensional real state space rather than the full O(N^2) density-matrix state space. Building on this, we extend the stability theory of quantum filters, showing that exponential convergence persists not only under mismatched initial states but also in the presence of parameter mismatch. Finally, we develop an estimation framework for continuous parameter domains and prove almost sure consistency of the estimator in the long-time limit. These results yield a rigorous treatment of parameter estimation for jump-diffusion SMEs, combining structural reduction with stability and identifiability analysis, and thereby extend the mathematical theory of parameter estimation for open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>St\"ackel and Eisenhart lifts, Haantjes geometry and Gravitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of St\"ackel lift as a novel geometric setting for the construction of large classes of integrable Hamiltonian systems. The St\"ackel lift extends the geometric framework underlying both the Riemannian and the Lorentzian-type classical Eisenhart lifts and is intimately related with Haantjes geometry. In particular, we establish that Hamiltonian systems constructed through St\"ackel lifts are naturally endowed with a symplectic-Haantjes structure.
  We also show that explicitly momentum-dependent lifting matrices produce systems interpretable as gravitational waves, or momentum-dependent metrics of Hamilton and Finsler geometries, with potential applications in modified gravity theories.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study the global well-posedness of a classical polaron dynamics and its derivation from the quantum dynamics of the Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian from the viewpoint of Wigner measures. We make a crucial use of the Gross transform, allowing us to extract a diverging constant. Finally, we discuss the difficulty of defining the classical dynamics when removing the cutoff in our setting.</description>

Abstract: We provide a rigorous derivation of the Landau-Pekar equations from the Fr\"ohlich Hamiltonian in the mean-field limit using Wigner measure techniques. On the classical side, we extend the global well-posedness results up to $L^2 \oplus L^2$. For obtaining the classical limit, we make a crucial use on the quantum side of the Gross transform, allowing us to study the system on the energy space, and with no ultraviolet cutoff.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a family of solvable multi-matrix models associated with an arbitrary embedded graph $\Gamma$ with a single vertex. The graph with $n$ edges is equipped with $2n$ corner matrices. The partition function of each member of the family depends on the set of eigenvalues of monodromies of corner matrices around the vertices of the dual graph $\Gamma^*$ and sets of parameters attached to each vertex of $\Gamma$. We select the cases where the partition function of a model is a tau function of KP, 2KP and BKP hiearachies. We compare integrals over ${U}(N)$ and over ${SU}(N)$ groups. In $U(N)$ case there is no restriction on the number of vertices of $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Turing instability and 2-D pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems derived from kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Turing instability and pattern formation in two-dimensional domains for two reaction-diffusion models, obtained as diffusive limits of kinetic equations for mixtures of monatomic and polyatomic gases. The first model is of Brusselator type, which, compared with the classical formulation, presents an additional parameter whose role in stability and pattern formation is discussed. In the second framework, the system exhibits standard nonlinear diffusion terms typical of predator-prey models, but differs in reactive terms. In both cases, the kinetic-based approach proves effective in relating macroscopic parameters, often set empirically, to microscopic interaction mechanisms, thereby rigorously identifying admissible parameter ranges for the physical description. Furthermore, weakly nonlinear analysis and numerical simulations extend previously known one-dimensional results and reveal a wider scenario of spatial structures, including spots, stripes, and hexagonal arrays, that better reflect the richness observed in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of Schr\"odinger operators with potentials that are measures supported on ${\Bbb N}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss spectral properties of the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator with a potential of the form $\sum V(n)\delta(x-n)$. Our main result says that the absolutely continuous spectum of such an operator covers an interval $[\alpha^2,\beta^2]$, if $V\in \ell^4$ and the Fourier series $\sum e^{2i kn}V(n)$ is a function of $k$ that is square integrable over $[\alpha,\beta]$. We prove that this result is sharp by constructing examples of potentials $V\notin\ell^2$ for which the spectrum of the Schr\"odinger operator is singular.</description>

      <title>Chern classes of the multilayer fractional quantum Hall bundle on Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called multilayer wave functions were introduced in the study of the fractional Quantum Hall effect by Halperin and others. They are defined with the help of a symmetric matrix $K$ in $M^k(\mathbb{N})$, which encodes the couplings between the $k$ layers where particles live. We study the multilayer quantum states in the case where each layer is a Riemann surface of genus $g$. These states form a vector bundle over the Jacobian variety of the Riemann surface, or the space of Aharonov-Bohm fluxes in physics terminology. Burban-Klevtsov have determined the rank and first Chern class of this bundle when $g=1$, and Klevtsov-Zvonkine computed the Chern character of this bundle in the single layer case for any genus. We generalize the latter approach to the multilayer case and compute the Chern character of the multilayer bundle for any genus, and any possible number of non-localized quasi-holes, under the assumption that the bilinear form associated to $K-I$ is non negative. The key tools are the Grothendieck-Riemann-Roch formula, Berezin integration and Wick's formula for exterior algebras. We show that when all quasi-holes are localized, the Chern character is compatible with the bundle being projectively flat. Furthermore, for those configurations, the conductance becomes independent of the genus and is equal to the sum of the coefficients of the inverse matrix $K^{-1}$, proving two conjectures by Keski-Vakkuri and Wen. We also find the relation linking $K$, the genus of the surface, the magnetic field and the number of non-localized quasi holes in each layer, which was studied under the name of ''shift formula''. Finally, we study conditions on the matrix $K$ under which states having only localized quasi-holes maximize the total particle number, as well as the asymptotics for large magnetic fields in this scenario.</description>

Abstract: In this series of papers, we investigate coupled systems arising in the study of two-component Bose--Einstein condensates, and we establish classification results for solutions of De Giorgi conjecture type. In the first paper of the series, we focus on the local problem of the form $\Delta u = u(u^2+v^2-1) + v(\alpha uv - \omega)$, $\Delta v = v(u^2+v^2-1) + u(\alpha uv - \omega)$, and prove that positive global solutions in $\mathbb{R}^3$ satisfying $\partial u/\partial x_3 &gt; 0 &gt; \partial v/\partial x_3$ must be one-dimensional.</description>

      <title>PySymmetry: A Sage/Python Framework for the Symmetry Reduction of Linear G-Equivariant Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the prevalence of symmetry in scientific linear systems, these structural properties are often underutilized by standard computational software. This paper introduces PySymmetry, an open-source Sage/Python framework that implements classical representation theory to simplify G-equivariant linear systems. PySymmetry uses projection operators to generate symmetry-adapted bases, transforming equivariant operators into a more efficient block-diagonal form. Its functionalities include defining and reducing representations, calculating multiplicities, and obtaining the explicit block structure.
  We demonstrate PySymmetry's versatility through three case studies: a chemistry application, a numerical benchmark on the non-Hermitian Schr\"odinger equation that achieved a performance increase of over 17x compared to standard methods, and a symbolic investigation that enabled the first complete analytical classification of a challenging problem in celestial mechanics. Designed for seamless integration with libraries like NumPy and SciPy, PySymmetry offers a powerful, user-friendly tool for exploring symmetries in theoretical and applied contexts. ```</description>

      <title>Probing Non-Markovian Quantum Channels via Hilbert-Schmidt Speed and Fidelity Enhanced Teleportation Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliable transmission of quantum information remains a central challenge in the presence of environmental noise. In particular, maintaining high teleportation fidelity in open quantum systems is hindered by decoherence, which disrupts quantum coherence and entanglement. Traditional noise mitigation techniques often neglect the rich temporal correlations present in realistic environments. This raises a key question: can non-Markovian memory effects be harnessed to improve the performance of quantum teleportation? In this work, we address this problem by analyzing how non-Markovian dynamics influence teleportation fidelity. We employ a statistical speed approach based on the Hilbert Schmidt norm to witness information backflow and monitor the system's instantaneous evolution rate. Our study focuses on two measurement-based strategies: weak measurement (WM) combined with quantum measurement reversal (QMR), and a hybrid protocol integrating environment-assisted measurement (EAM) with post selection and QMR. Through analytical expressions and detailed numerical simulations, we demonstrate that both strategies can enhance teleportation fidelity under non-Markovian noise. Notably, the EAM-based scheme exhibits superior robustness, achieving high fidelity even without fine-tuned parameters. Our results establish a concrete link between non-Markovian memory effects, statistical speed, and coherence preservation, offering practical insights for the design of resilient quantum communication protocols.</description>

      <title>Dyson Trace Flow and Dynamic Coupled Semicircle Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a universal framework for analyzing coupled random matrix models, centered around the newly defined Dyson Trace Flow and the Dynamic Coupled Semicircle Law. We derive stochastic differential equations for eigenvalues under asymmetric coupling, establish well-posedness, and prove a large deviation principle with explicit rate functions. The theory is extended to nonlinear and non-reciprocal interactions, revealing phenomena such as exceptional points, bistability, and novel scaling laws. A holographic correspondence with wormhole geometries is established, connecting to quantum chaos. These results generalize classical random matrix theory to interacting systems, with applications in neural networks and quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Orlov-Schulman symmetries of the Manakov-Santini hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct the Orlov-Schulman symmetries for the Manakov-Santini (MS) hierarchy. We give an explicit proof of compatibility of additional symmetries with the basic flows of the MS hierarchy, and consider several simple examples, including the Galilean transformation and scalings. We also present a picture of the Orlov-Schulman symmetries in terms of the dressing scheme based on the Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <title>Exact Solvability and Integrability Signatures in a Periodically Driven Infinite-Range Spin Chain: The Case of Floquet interval $\pi/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the signatures of quantum integrability (QI) in a spin chain model, having infinite-range Ising interaction and subjected to a periodic pulse of an external magnetic field. We analyze the unitary operator, its eigensystem, the single-qubit reduced density matrix, and the entanglement dynamics for arbitrary initial state for any $N$. The QI in our model can be identified through key signatures such as the periodicity of entanglement dynamics and the time-evolved unitary operator, and highly degenerated spectra or Poisson statistics. In our previous works, these signatures were observed in the model for parameters $\tau=\pi/4$ and $J=1,1/2$, where we provided exact analytical results up to $12$ qubits and numerically for large $N$ [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}; arXiv:2411.16670 (2024)}]. In this paper, we extend the analysis to $\tau=m\pi/2$, and arbitrary $J$ and $N$. We show that the signatures of QI persist for the rational $J$, whereas for irrational $J$, these signatures are absent for any $N$. Further, we perform spectral statistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with perturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson statistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\langle r \rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics. Additionally, we compute the ratio of eigenstate entanglement entropy to its maximum value ($\langle S \rangle /S_{Max}$) and find that it remains significantly below $1$ in the limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, which further confirms the QI. We discuss some potential experimental realizations of our model.</description>

      <title>Random close packing fraction of bidisperse discs: Theoretical derivation and exact bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing problem has been a theoretical prediction of the densest packing fraction of random packings, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of same-size discs in $d=2$ and spheres in $3$. However, to minimize order, experiments and numerical simulations often use two-size discs. For practical purposes, then, a predictive theory for the packing fraction, $\Phi_{RCP}$, of the densest such bidisperse packings is more useful. A disorder-guaranteeing theory is formulated here to fill this gap, using an approach that led to an exact solution for monodisperse discs in $d=2$ [1]. $\Phi_{RCP}$ depends on the sizes ratio, $D$, and concentrations, $p$, of the disc types and the developed theory enables derivation of exact and rigorous upper and lower bounds on $\Phi_{RCP}(p,D)$, as well as an explicit prediction of it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the ergodic theorem for infinite-dimensional quantum Markov semigroups, originally introduced by Frigerio and Verri in 1982, and its latest version developed by Carbone and Girotti in 2021. We provide a sufficient condition that ensures exponential convergence towards the positive recurrent subspace, a well-known result for irreducible quantum Markov semigroups in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Several illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the application of the ergodic theorem. Moreover, we show that the positive recurrent subspace plays a crucial role in the study of global asymptotic stability.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Algorithm For Computing Contextuality Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality is a limitation on deterministic hidden variable models, testable in measurement scenarios where outcomes differ under quantum or classical descriptions due to a common set of constraints. When considering measurements of $N$-qubit spin operators, constraints arise from commutation relations and classical bounds are determined by the $\textit{degree}$ of contextuality, an NP-hard quantity to compute in general, related to the larger class of optimisation problems known as $\texttt{MaxLin2}$. In this work we give a quantum algorithm based on Grover's search algorithm, computing the degree of contextuality in $O(\sqrt{n} \log\log{n})$ in $n$ states, a speedup over classical brute force method. We also study variations of Grover which encode the relevant information in the phases of the basis states, reducing circuit width and depth requirements with indicative complexity of $O(n^{\frac{1}{3}}(\log{n})^{2}\log\log{n})$. Testing on contemporary quantum backends with the IBM quantum experience gives inconclusive outputs due to noise-induced errors, an issue hopefully fixed by future hardware.</description>

Abstract: We study the long time evolution of internal waves in two dimensional subcritical channels with flat horizontal ends. We show the leading profiles of solutions are the outgoing solutions to the stationary equations. This is done by showing a limiting absorption principle and the differentiability of the spectral measure for a zeroth order operator.</description>

Abstract: We study the operad structure on the homology of moduli spaces of pointed rooted trees of $d$-dimensional projective spaces, introduced by Chen, Gibney and Krashen a couple of decades ago. We describe this operad by generators and relations, show that it is homotopy Koszul, exhibit a Givental-type action on representations of that operad, and prove that this operad represents the homotopy quotient of the operad of chains of $S^1$-framed little $2d$-disks by its natural circle action. Our approach also sheds new light on the $d=1$ case, revealing a new combinatorial way to write the original Givental formulas.</description>

      <title>The Ising Model Coupled to 2D Gravity: Genus Zero Partition Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the genus 0 free energy for the 2-matrix model with quartic interactions, which acts as a generating function for the Ising model's partition function on a random, 4-regular, planar graph. This is consistent with the predictions of Kazakov and Boulatov on this model, as well as subsequent confirmation of this formula using combinatorial methods. We also provide a new parametric formula for the free energy and give a characterization of the phase space. Our analysis is based on a steepest descent Riemann-Hilbert analysis of the associated biorthogonal polynomials and the corresponding isomonodromic $\tau$-function. A key ingredient in the analysis is a parametrization of the spectral curve. This analysis lays the groundwork for the subsequent study of the multicritical point, which we will study in a forthcoming work.</description>

      <title>The Casimir eigenvalues on $ad^{\otimes k}$ of SU(N) are linear on N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider eigenvalues of the Casimir operator on the naturally defined \textit{stable sequences} of representations of $su(N)$ algebra and prove that eigenvalues are linear over $N$ iff $\lambda_1+2\lambda_2+...+k\lambda_k=\lambda_{N-1}+2\lambda_{N-2}+...+k\lambda_{N-k}$, where $\lambda_i$ are Dynkin labels, and $\lambda_i=0$ for $k&lt;i&lt;N-k$, with fixed $k$. These representations are exactly those which appear in the decomposition of $ad(su(N))^{\otimes k}$, therefore this linearity admits the presentation of eigenvalues in the universal, in Vogel's sense, form, and supports the hypothesis of universal decomposition of $ad^{\otimes k}$ into Casimir eigenspaces.</description>

      <title>Fusion in the periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra: general definition of a bifunctor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The periodic Temperley-Lieb category consists of connectivity diagrams drawn on a ring with $N$ and $N'$ nodes on the outer and inner boundary, respectively. We consider families of modules, namely sequences of modules $\mathsf{M}(N)$ over the enlarged periodic Temperley-Lieb algebra for varying values of $N$, endowed with an action $\mathsf{M}(N') \to \mathsf{M}(N)$ of the diagrams. Examples of modules that can be organised into families are those arising in the RSOS model and in the XXZ spin-$\frac12$ chain, as well as several others constructed from link states.
  We construct a fusion product which outputs a family of modules from any pair of families. Its definition is inspired from connectivity diagrams drawn on a disc with two holes. It is thus defined in a way to describe intermediate states in lattice correlation functions. We prove that this fusion product is a bifunctor, and that it is distributive, commutative, and associative.</description>

      <title>On the inadequacy of nudging data assimilation algorithms for non-dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the applicability of the Azouani-Olson-Titi (AOT) nudging algorithm for continuous data assimilation to evolutionary dynamical systems that are not dissipative. Specifically, we apply the AOT algorithm to a partially dissipative variant of the Lorenz 1963 system, the Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) in 1D, and the 2D incompressible Euler equations. Our analysis reveals that both the Euler and KdV equations lack the finitely many determining modes property, leading to the construction of infinitely many solutions with exactly the same sparse observational data, which data assimilation methods cannot distinguish between. Simultaneously, we numerically verify that the AOT algorithm successfully recovers these counterexamples for the damped and driven KdV equation, which is dissipative. Additionally, to further support our argument, we present numerical evidence showing that the AOT algorithm is ineffective at accurately recovering solutions for a partially dissipative variant of the Lorenz 1963 system.</description>

      <title>Sasaki structures on general contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the concept of a Sasakian structure on a cooriented contact manifold, given by a compatibility between the contact form $\eta$ and a Riemannian metric $g_M$ on $M$, to the case of a general contact structure understood as a contact distribution. Traditionally, the compatibility can be expressed as the fact that the symplectic form $\omega=\mathrm{d}(s^2\eta)$ and the metric $g(x,s)=\mathrm{d} s\otimes\mathrm{d} s+s^2g_M(x)$ define on the cone $\mathcal{M}=M\times\mathbb{R}_+$ a K\"ahler structure. Since general contact structures can be realized as homogeneous symplectic structures $\omega$ on $\mathrm{GL}(1;\mathbb{R})$-principal bundles $P\to M$, it is natural to understand Sasakian structures in full generality as related to `homogeneous K\"ahler structures' on $P$. The difficulty is that, even locally, contact distributions do not provide any preferred contact form, so the standard approach cannot be directly applied. However, we succeeded in characterizing homogeneous K\"ahler structures on $(P,\omega)$ and discovering a canonical lift of Riemannian metrics from the contact manifold $M$ to $P$, which allowed us to define Sasakian structures for general contact manifolds. This approach is completely conceptual and avoids ad hoc choices. Moreover, it provides a natural concept of Sasakian manifold products which we develop in detail.</description>

      <title>Quantum dual extended Hamming code immune to collective coherent errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05249v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective coherent (CC) errors are inevitable, as every physical qubit undergoes free evolution under its kinetic Hamiltonian. These errors can be more damaging than stochastic Pauli errors because they affect all qubits coherently, resulting in high-weight errors that standard quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes struggle to correct. In quantum memories and communication systems, especially when storage durations are long, CC errors often dominate over stochastic noise. Trapped-ion platforms, for example, exhibit strong CC errors with minimal stochastic Pauli components. In this work, we address the regime where immunity to CC errors, high code rate (due to limited qubit availability), and moderate distance (sufficient for correcting low-weight errors) are all essential. We construct a new family of constant-excitation (CE) stabilizer codes with parameters $[[2^{r+1}, 2^r - (r+1), 4]]$. The smallest instance, the $[[8,1,4]]$ code, improves the code rate and error threshold of the best previously known CE code by factors of approximately two and four, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21690v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the special set-theoretic Yang-Baxter algebra and show that it is a Hopf algebra subject to certain conditions. The associated universal R-matrix is also obtained via an admissible Drinfel'd twist. The structure of braces emerges naturally in this context by requiring the special set-theoretic Yang-Baxter algebra to be a Hopf algebra and a quasi-triangular bialgebra after twisting. The fundamental representation of the universal R-matrix yields the familiar set-theoretic (combinatorial) solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We then apply the same Drinfel'd twist to the gl_n Yangian after introducing the augmented Yangian. We show that the augmented Yangian is also a Hopf algebra and we also obtain its twisted version.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Nucleation via Topological Surgery in Lorentzian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02210v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a model for the nucleation of a wormhole within a Lorentzian spacetime by employing techniques from topological surgery and Morse theory. In our framework, a 0-surgery process describes the neighborhood of the nucleation point inside a compact region of spacetime, yielding a singular Lorentzian cobordism that connects two spacelike regions with different topologies. To avoid the singularity at the critical point of the Morse function, we employ the Misner trick of taking a connected sum with a closed 4-manifold -- namely $\mathbb{CP}^{2}$ -- to obtain an everywhere nondegenerate Lorentzian metric. This connected sum replaces the naked singularity with a region containing closed timelike curves. The obtained spacetime is nonsingular, but violates all the standard energy conditions. Our construction, thus, shows that a wormhole can be "created" without singularities in classical general relativity.</description>

      <title>Error Exponents for Quantum Packing Problems via An Operator Layer Cake Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove a one-shot random coding bound for classical-quantum channel coding, a problem conjectured by Burnashev and Holevo in 1998. By choosing the optimal input distribution, the bound implies the optimal error exponent (i.e., the reliability function) of classical-quantum channels for rates above the critical rate, even in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Our result extends to various quantum packing-type problems, including classical communication over any fully quantum channel with or without entanglement-assistance, constant composition codes, and classical data compression with quantum side information via fixed-length or variable-length coding.
  Our technical ingredient is to establish an operator layer cake theorem - the directional derivative of an operator logarithm admits an integral representation of certain projections. This shows that a kind of pretty-good measurement is equivalent to a randomized Holevo-Helstrom measurement, which provides an operational explanation of why the pretty-good measurement is pretty good.</description>

      <title>Principle of Diminishing Potentialities in Large N Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A connection between the completion of quantum mechanics featuring events and the theory of emergent spacetime in quantum gravity where von Neumann algebra plays a vital role is established. In thermal equilibrium, we show that the Principle of Diminishing Potentialities (PDP) holds for the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills (SYM) theory with gauge group $SU(N)$ when the temperature is higher than Hawking-Page temperature. Below Hawking-Page transition and for the case of zero temperature, PDP does not hold. Since the centralizer of thermofield double state on the large $N$ algebra of $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory coincides with the center of the large $N$ algebra which is trivial, we extend the large $N$ algebra by performing crossed product by the maximal abelian subgroup $H $ of the compact symmetry group $G$ of the two-sided eternal black hole. In this case, the centralizer of an extension of thermofield double state is non-trivial and it is given by the action of the maximal abelian subgroup $H$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$. This centralizer is by itself commutative and it coincides with its own center. This implies that the first actual event that initiate the ``Events-Trees-Histories'' dynamical evolution in this framework is given by the spectral projectors associated to the action of the Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ associated to the group $G$ on the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{TFD} \otimes L^{2} (H)$.</description>

      <title>On the mean-field limit for the Vlasov-Poisson system in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic proof of the mean-field limit and propagation of chaos of a classical N-particle system in two dimensions with Coulomb interaction force of the form $f^N(q)=\pm\frac{q}{|q|^2}$ and $N$-dependent cut-off at $|q|&gt;N^{-2}$. In particular, for typical initial data, we show convergence of the Newtonian trajectories to the characteristics of the Vlasov-Poisson system. The proof is based on a Gronwall estimate for the maximal distance between the exact microscopic dynamics and the approximate mean-field dynamics. Thus our result leads to a derivation of the Vlasov-Poisson equation from the microscopic $N$-particle dynamics with force term arbitrary close to the physically relevant Coulomb force.</description>
