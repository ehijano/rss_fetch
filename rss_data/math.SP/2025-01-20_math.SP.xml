      <title>On Explicit Estimations for the Bloch Eigenvalues of the One-dimensional Schr\"odinger Operator and the Kronig-Penney Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the small and large eigenvalues of the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operator L(q) with a periodic, real and locally integrable potential q. First we explicitly write out the first and second terms of the asymptotic formulas for the large periodic and antiperiodic eigenvalues and illustrate these formulas for the Kronig-Penney model. Then we give estimates for the small periodic and antiperiodic eigenvalues and for the length of the first gaps in the case of the Kronig-Penney model. Moreover, we give error estimations and present a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Random eigenvalues of graphenes and the triangulation of plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the numbers of closed paths of length $k\in\mathbb{N}$ on two important regular lattices: the hexagonal lattice (also called $\textit{graphene}$ in chemistry) and its dual triangular lattice. These numbers form a moment sequence of specific random variables connected to the distance of a position of a planar random flight (in three steps) from the origin. Here, we refer to such a random variable as a $\textit{random eigenvalue}$ of the underlying lattice. Explicit formulas for the probability density and characteristic functions of these random eigenvalues are given for both the hexagonal and the triangular lattice. Furthermore, it is proven that both probability distributions can be approximated by a functional of the random variable uniformly distributed on increasing intervals $[0,b]$ as $b\to\infty$. This yields a straightforward method to simulate these random eigenvalues without generating graphene and triangular lattice graphs. To demonstrate this approximation, we first prove a key integral identity for a specific series containing the third powers of the modified Bessel functions $I_n$ of $n$th order, $n\in\mathbb{Z}$. Such series play a crucial role in various contexts, in particular, in analysis, combinatorics, and theoretical physics.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues of the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field on disks in the strong field limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian with constant magnetic field on domains of finite measure. First, in the case of a disk, we prove that the eigenvalue branches with respect to the field strength behave asymptotically linear with an exponentially small remainder term as the field strength goes to infinity. We compute the asymptotic expression for this remainder term. Second, we show that for sufficiently large magnetic field strengths, the spectral bound corresponding to the P\'olya conjecture for the non-magnetic Dirichlet Laplacian is violated up to a sharp excess factor which is independent of the domain.</description>

      <title>Distances between operators acting on different Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to define and compare several distances (or metrics) between operators acting on different (separable) Hilbert spaces. We consider here three main cases of how to measure the distance between two bounded operators: first by taking the distance between their unitary orbits, second by isometric embeddings (this generalises a concept of Weidmann) and third by quasi-unitary equivalence (using a concept of the first author of the present article).
  Our main result is that the unitary and isometric distances are equal provided the operators are both self-adjoint and have $0$ in their essential spectra. Moreover, the quasi-unitary distance is equivalent (up to a universal constant) with the isometric distance for any pair of bounded operators. The unitary distance gives an upper bound on the Hausdorff distance of their spectrum. If both operators have purely essential spectrum, then the unitary distance equals the Hausdorff distance of their spectra. Using a finer spectral distance respecting multiplicity of discrete eigenvalues, this spectral distance equals the unitary distance also for operators with essential and discrete spectrum. In particular, all operator distances mentioned above are equal to this spectral distance resp. controlled by it in the quasi-unitary case for self-adjoint operators with $0$ in the essential spectrum. We also show that our results are sharp by presenting various (counter-)examples. Finally, we discuss related convergence concepts complementing results from our first article arXiv:2202.03234</description>

      <title>Defect bound states in the continuum of bilayer electronic materials without symmetry protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a class of bound defect states in the continuum electronic spectrum of bilayer materials, which emerge independent of symmetry protection or additional degrees of freedom. Taking graphene as a prototypical example, our comparative analysis of AA- and AB-stacked bilayer graphene demonstrates that these states originate from the intrinsic algebraic structure of the tight-binding Hamiltonian when trigonal warping is neglected rather than any underlying symmetry. Inclusion of trigonal warping and higher-order hoppings broaden the bound states into long-lived resonances. This discovery provides a pathway to previously unexplored approaches in defect and band-structure engineering. We conclude with a proposed protocol for observing these states in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Dirac operator in strips submitted to strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the magnetic Dirac operator on a curved strip whose boundary carries the infinite mass boundary condition. When the magnetic field is large, we provide the reader with accurate estimates of the essential and discrete spectra. In particular, we give sufficient conditions ensuring that the discrete spectrum is non-empty.</description>
