      <title>The effect of moving heat source in DPL model on viscoelastic biological tissues during during thermal treatment applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study utilizes mathematical modeling to offer computational insights into biological heat transfer within elastic skin tissues. This heat transfer is driven by a moving heat source that relies on various relaxation times. Time delay parameters were incorporated based on these relaxation times, highlighting the importance of understanding heat transfer mechanisms and thermo-mechanical interactions to ensure the effectiveness of thermal treatment procedures. Given the significant impact of different variables on thermal relaxation times, their effects were analyzed on the distributions of displacement, thermal stress, and temperature in living tissues. By applying advanced mathematical techniques such as Laplace transforms, precise evaluations of these distributions were achieved. The results are presented graphically, with a focus on enhancing treatment outcomes by deepening our understanding of the behavior of living tissues in thermal environments.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Periorbital Segmentation Dataset for Ophthalmic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periorbital segmentation and distance prediction using deep learning allows for the objective quantification of disease state, treatment monitoring, and remote medicine. However, there are currently no reports of segmentation datasets for the purposes of training deep learning models with sub mm accuracy on the regions around the eyes. All images (n=2842) had the iris, sclera, lid, caruncle, and brow segmented by five trained annotators. Here, we validate this dataset through intra and intergrader reliability tests and show the utility of the data in training periorbital segmentation networks. All the annotations are publicly available for free download. Having access to segmentation datasets designed specifically for oculoplastic surgery will permit more rapid development of clinically useful segmentation networks which can be leveraged for periorbital distance prediction and disease classification. In addition to the annotations, we also provide an open-source toolkit for periorbital distance prediction from segmentation masks. The weights of all models have also been open-sourced and are publicly available for use by the community.</description>
