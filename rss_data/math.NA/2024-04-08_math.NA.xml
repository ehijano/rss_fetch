      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New families of composition methods with processing of order 4 and 6 are presented and analyzed. They are specifically designed to be used for the numerical integration of differential equations whose vector field is separated into three or more parts which are explicitly solvable. The new schemes are shown to be more efficient than previous state-of-the-art splitting methods.</description>

      <title>Meshfree finite difference solution of homogeneous Dirichlet problems of the fractional Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A so-called grid-overlay finite difference method (GoFD) was proposed recently for the numerical solution of homogeneous Dirichlet boundary value problems of the fractional Laplacian on arbitrary bounded domains. It was shown to have advantages of both finite difference and finite element methods, including its efficient implementation through the fast Fourier transform and ability to work for complex domains and with mesh adaptation. The purpose of this work is to study GoFD in a meshfree setting, a key to which is to construct the data transfer matrix from a given point cloud to a uniform grid. Two approaches are proposed, one based on the moving least squares fitting and the other based on the Delaunay triangulation and piecewise linear interpolation. Numerical results obtained for examples with convex and concave domains and various types of point clouds are presented. They show that both approaches lead to comparable results. Moreover, the resulting meshfree GoFD converges at a similar order as GoFD with unstructured meshes and finite element approximation as the number of points in the cloud increases. Furthermore, numerical results show that the method is robust to random perturbations in the location of the points.</description>

      <title>A moving mesh finite element method for Bernoulli free boundary problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A moving mesh finite element method is studied for the numerical solution of Bernoulli free boundary problems. The method is based on the pseudo-transient continuation with which a moving boundary problem is constructed and its steady-state solution is taken as the solution of the underlying Bernoulli free boundary problem. The moving boundary problem is solved in a split manner at each time step: the moving boundary is updated with the Euler scheme, the interior mesh points are moved using a moving mesh method, and the corresponding initial-boundary value problem is solved using the linear finite element method. The method can take full advantages of both the pseudo-transient continuation and the moving mesh method. Particularly, it is able to move the mesh, free of tangling, to fit the varying domain for a variety of geometries no matter if they are convex or concave. Moreover, it is convergent towards steady state for a broad class of free boundary problems and initial guesses of the free boundary. Numerical examples for Bernoulli free boundary problems with constant and non-constant Bernoulli conditions and for nonlinear free boundary problems are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the method and its ability to deal with various geometries and nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Irrational-window-filter projection method and application to quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger eigenproblems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, the irrational-window-filter projection method (IWFPM), for solving arbitrary dimensional global quasiperiodic systems. Based on the projection method, IWFPM further utilizes the concentrated distribution of Fourier coefficients to filter out relevant spectral points using an irrational window. Moreover, a corresponding index-shift transform is designed to make the Fast Fourier Transform available. The corresponding error analysis on the function approximation level is also given. We apply IWFPM to 1D, 2D, and 3D quasiperiodic Schr\"odinger eigenproblems to demonstrate its accuracy and efficiency. For both extended and localized quantum states, IWFPM exhibits a significant computational advantage over PM. Furthermore, the widespread existence of such spectral point distribution feature can endow IWFPM with significant potential for broader applications in quasiperiodic systems.</description>

      <title>A refined convergence estimate for a fourth order finite difference numerical scheme to the Cahn-Hilliard equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we present a refined convergence analysis for a second order accurate in time, fourth order finite difference numerical scheme for the 3-D Cahn-Hilliard equation, with an improved convergence constant. A modified backward differentiation formula temporal discretization is applied, and a Douglas-Dupont artificial regularization is included to ensure the energy stability. In fact, a standard application of discrete Gronwall inequality leads to a convergence constant dependent on the interface width parameter in an exponential singular form. We aim to obtain an improved estimate, with such a singular dependence only in a polynomial order. A uniform in time functional bounds of the numerical solution, including the higher order Sobolev norms, as well as the associated bounds for the first and second order temporal difference stencil, have to be carefully established. Certain recursive analysis has to be applied in the analysis for the BDF-style temporal stencil. As a result, we are able to apply a spectrum estimate for the linearized Cahn-Hilliard operator, and this technique leads to the refined error estimate. A three-dimensional numerical example of accuracy check is presented as well.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification analysis of bifurcations of the Allen--Cahn equation with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider the Allen--Cahn equation, a prototypical model problem in nonlinear dynamics that exhibits bifurcations corresponding to variations of a deterministic bifurcation parameter. Going beyond the state-of-the-art, we introduce a random coefficient function in the linear reaction part of the equation, thereby accounting for random, spatially-heterogeneous effects. Importantly, we assume a spatially constant, deterministic mean value of the random coefficient. We show that this mean value is in fact a bifurcation parameter in the Allen--Cahn equation with random coefficients. Moreover, we show that the bifurcation points and bifurcation curves become random objects. We consider two distinct modelling situations: (i) for a spatially homogeneous coefficient we derive analytical expressions for the distribution of the bifurcation points and show that the bifurcation curves are random shifts of a fixed reference curve; (ii) for a spatially heterogeneous coefficient we employ a generalized polynomial chaos expansion to approximate the statistical properties of the random bifurcation points and bifurcation curves. We present numerical examples in 1D physical space, where we combine the popular software package Continuation Core and Toolboxes (CoCo) for numerical continuation and the Sparse Grids Matlab Kit for the polynomial chaos expansion. Our exposition addresses both, dynamical systems and uncertainty quantification, highlighting how analytical and numerical tools from both areas can be combined efficiently for the challenging uncertainty quantification analysis of bifurcations in random differential equations.</description>

      <title>Superconvergence error estimates for the div least-squares finite element method on elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the error estimations for the div least-squares finite element method on elliptic problems. Compared with the previous work, we present a complete error analysis, which improves the current \emph{state-of-the-art} results. The error estimations for both the scalar and the flux variables are established by dual arguments, and in most cases, only an $H^{1+\varepsilon}$ regularity is used. Numerical experiments strongly confirm our analysis.</description>

      <title>An Energy Conserving, Implicit and Higher Order in Time Discretization of Maxwell's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a sequel to our earlier work in which we described an implicit leapfrog scheme in conjunction with a higher order mixed finite element discretization of a system of Maxwell's equations. In our earlier work, we focussed on providing the error analysis for both the semidiscretization of the Maxwell's equations using an implicit leapfrog scheme that we invented as well as providing the error analysis for the full discretization using this time domain scheme in conjunction with higher order mixed finite elements from finite element exterior calculus. In this work, we record our initial results with extending our implicit leapfrog scheme from being a discretization that is second order accurate in time to an arbitrary (even) order accurate in time method. Towards this end, we provide here the complete error analysis for the semidiscretization in time and full discretization of the Maxwell's equations for the fourth order scheme. We leave the completion of our efforts in providing all the necessary proofs for the general scheme to an immediate future update of this work.</description>

      <title>Generative downscaling of PDE solvers with physics-guided diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on fine spatio-temporal scales for high-fidelity solutions is critical for numerous scientific breakthroughs. Yet, this process can be prohibitively expensive, owing to the inherent complexities of the problems, including nonlinearity and multiscale phenomena. To speed up large-scale computations, a process known as downscaling is employed, which generates high-fidelity approximate solutions from their low-fidelity counterparts. In this paper, we propose a novel Physics-Guided Diffusion Model (PGDM) for downscaling. Our model, initially trained on a dataset comprising low-and-high-fidelity paired solutions across coarse and fine scales, generates new high-fidelity approximations from any new low-fidelity inputs. These outputs are subsequently refined through fine-tuning, aimed at minimizing the physical discrepancies as defined by the discretized PDEs at the finer scale. We evaluate and benchmark our model's performance against other downscaling baselines in three categories of nonlinear PDEs. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our model not only outperforms the baselines but also achieves a computational acceleration exceeding tenfold, while maintaining the same level of accuracy as the conventional fine-scale solvers.</description>

      <title>Boundary shape reconstruction with Robin condition: existence result, stability analysis, and inversion via multiple measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study revisits the problem of identifying the unknown interior Robin boundary of a connected domain using Cauchy data from the exterior region of a harmonic function. It investigates two shape optimization reformulations employing least-squares boundary-data-tracking cost functionals. Firstly, it rigorously addresses the existence of optimal shape solutions, thus filling a gap in the literature. The argumentation utilized in the proof strategy is contingent upon the specific formulation under consideration. Secondly, it demonstrates the ill-posed nature of the two shape optimization formulations by establishing the compactness of the Riesz operator associated with the quadratic shape Hessian corresponding to each cost functional. Lastly, the study employs multiple sets of Cauchy data to address the difficulty of detecting concavities in the unknown boundary. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions illustrate the numerical procedure relying on Sobolev gradients proposed herein.</description>

      <title>In-Flight Estimation of Instrument Spectral Response Functions Using Sparse Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimates of Instrument Spectral Response Functions (ISRFs) are crucial in order to have a good characterization of high resolution spectrometers. Spectrometers are composed of different optical elements that can induce errors in the measurements and therefore need to be modeled as accurately as possible. Parametric models are currently used to estimate these response functions. However, these models cannot always take into account the diversity of ISRF shapes that are encountered in practical applications. This paper studies a new ISRF estimation method based on a sparse representation of atoms belonging to a dictionary. This method is applied to different high-resolution spectrometers in order to assess its reproducibility for multiple remote sensing missions. The proposed method is shown to be very competitive when compared to the more commonly used parametric models, and yields normalized ISRF estimation errors less than 1%.</description>

      <title>On a port-Hamiltonian formulation and structure-preserving numerical approximations for thermodynamic compressible fluid flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high volatility of renewable energies calls for more energy efficiency. Thus, different physical systems need to be coupled efficiently although they run on various time scales. Here, the port-Hamiltonian (pH) modeling framework comes into play as it has several advantages, e.g., physical properties are encoded in the system structure and systems running on different time scales can be coupled easily. Additionally, pH systems coupled by energy-preserving conditions are still pH. Furthermore, in the energy transition hydrogen becomes an important player and unlike in natural gas, its temperature-dependence is of importance. Thus, we introduce an infinite dimensional pH formulation of the compressible non-isothermal Euler equations to model flow with temperature-dependence. We set up the underlying Stokes-Dirac structure and deduce the boundary port variables. We introduce coupling conditions into our pH formulation, such that the whole network system is pH itself. This is achieved by using energy-preserving coupling conditions, i.e., mass conservation and equality of total enthalpy, at the coupling nodes. Furthermore, to close the system a third coupling condition is needed. Here, equality of the outgoing entropy at coupling nodes is used and included into our systems in a structure-preserving way. Following that, we adapt the structure-preserving aproximation methods from the isothermal to the non-isothermal case. Academic numerical examples will support our analytical findings.</description>

      <title>On an optimal AFEM for elastoplasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, optimal convergence for an adaptive finite element algorithm for elastoplasticity is considered. To this end, the proposed adaptive algorithm is established within the abstract framework of the axioms of adaptivity [Comput. Math. Appl., 67(6) (2014), 1195-1253], which provides a specific proceeding to prove the optimal convergence of the scheme. The proceeding is based on verifying four axioms, which ensure the optimal convergence. The verification is done by using results from [Numer. Math., 132(1) (2016), 131-154], which presents an alternative approach to optimality without explicitly relying on the axioms.</description>

      <title>Provably Convergent and Robust Newton-Raphson Method: A New Dawn in Primitive Variable Recovery for Relativistic MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing and formidable challenge faced by all conservative schemes for relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) is the recovery of primitive variables from conservative ones. This process involves solving highly nonlinear equations subject to physical constraints. An ideal solver should be "robust, accurate, and fast -- it is at the heart of all conservative RMHD schemes," as emphasized in [S.C. Noble et al., ApJ, 641:626-637, 2006]. Despite over three decades of research, seeking efficient solvers that can provably guarantee stability and convergence remains an open problem.
  This paper presents the first theoretical analysis for designing a robust, physical-constraint-preserving (PCP), and provably (quadratically) convergent Newton-Raphson (NR) method for primitive variable recovery in RMHD. Our key innovation is a unified approach for the initial guess, devised based on sophisticated analysis. It ensures that the NR iteration consistently converges and adheres to physical constraints. Given the extreme nonlinearity and complexity of the iterative function, the theoretical analysis is highly nontrivial and technical. We discover a pivotal inequality for delineating the convexity and concavity of the iterative function and establish theories to guarantee the PCP property and convergence. We also develop theories to determine a computable initial guess within a theoretical "safe" interval. Intriguingly, we find that the unique positive root of a cubic polynomial always falls within this interval. Our PCP NR method is versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into any RMHD scheme that requires the recovery of primitive variables, potentially leading to a broad impact in this field. As an application, we incorporate it into a discontinuous Galerkin method, resulting in fully PCP schemes. Several numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the PCP NR method.</description>

      <title>Bathymetry reconstruction from experimental data using PDE-constrained optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge of the bottom topography, also called bathymetry, of rivers, seas or the ocean is important for many areas of maritime science and civil engineering. While direct measurements are possible, they are time consuming and expensive. Therefore, many approaches have been proposed how to infer the bathymetry from measurements of surface waves. Mathematically, this is an inverse problem where an unknown system state needs to be reconstructed from observations with a suitable model for the flow as constraint. In many cases, the shallow water equations can be used to describe the flow. While theoretical studies of the efficacy of such a PDE-constrained optimisation approach for bathymetry reconstruction exist, there seem to be few publications that study its application to data obtained from real-world measurements. This paper shows that the approach can, at least qualitatively, reconstruct a Gaussian-shaped bathymetry in a wave flume from measurements of the water height at up to three points. Achieved normalized root mean square errors (NRMSE) are in line with other approaches.</description>

      <title>Tensor neural networks for high-dimensional Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve high-dimensional steady-state Fokker-Planck equations on the whole space by applying tensor neural networks. The tensor networks are a tensor product of one-dimensional feedforward networks or a linear combination of several selected radial basis functions. The use of tensor feedforward networks allows us to efficiently exploit auto-differentiation in major Python packages while using radial basis functions can fully avoid auto-differentiation, which is rather expensive in high dimensions. We then use the physics-informed neural networks and stochastic gradient descent methods to learn the tensor networks. One essential step is to determine a proper truncated bounded domain or numerical support for the Fokker-Planck equation. To better train the tensor radial basis function networks, we impose some constraints on parameters, which lead to relatively high accuracy. We demonstrate numerically that the tensor neural networks in physics-informed machine learning are efficient for steady-state Fokker-Planck equations from two to ten dimensions.</description>

      <title>Convergence rates for the finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we provide convergence rates for the finite volume scheme of the stochastic heat equation with multiplicative Lipschitz noise and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions (SHE). More precisely, we give an error estimate for the $L^2$-norm of the space-time discretization of SHE by a semi-implicit Euler scheme with respect to time and a TPFA scheme with respect to space and the variational solution of SHE. The only regularity assumptions additionally needed is spatial regularity of the initial datum and smoothness of the diffusive term.</description>

      <title>Spectral GNN via Two-dimensional (2-D) Graph Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in graph learning. As an essential part of spectral GNNs, spectral graph convolution extracts crucial frequency information in graph data, leading to superior performance of spectral GNNs in downstream tasks. However, in this paper, we show that existing spectral GNNs remain critical drawbacks in performing the spectral graph convolution. Specifically, considering the spectral graph convolution as a construction operation towards target output, we prove that existing popular convolution paradigms cannot construct the target output with mild conditions on input graph signals, causing spectral GNNs to fall into suboptimal solutions. To address the issues, we rethink the spectral graph convolution from a more general two-dimensional (2-D) signal convolution perspective and propose a new convolution paradigm, named 2-D graph convolution. We prove that 2-D graph convolution unifies existing graph convolution paradigms, and is capable to construct arbitrary target output. Based on the proposed 2-D graph convolution, we further propose ChebNet2D, an efficient and effective GNN implementation of 2-D graph convolution through applying Chebyshev interpolation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate both effectiveness and efficiency of the ChebNet2D.</description>

      <title>The convergence of the EM scheme in empirical approximation of invariant probability measure for McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the assumption of the existence and uniqueness of the invariant measure for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (MV-SDEs), a self-interacting process that depends only on the current and historical information of the solution is constructed for MV-SDEs. The convergence rate of the weighted empirical measure of the self-interacting process and the invariant measure of MV-SDEs is obtained in the W2-Wasserstein metric. Furthermore, under the condition of linear growth, an EM scheme whose uniformly 1/2-order convergence rate with respect to time is obtained is constructed for the self-interacting process. Then, the convergence rate between the weighted empirical measure of the EM numerical solution of the self-interacting process and the invariant measure of MV-SDEs is derived. Moreover, the convergence rate between the averaged weighted empirical measure of the EM numerical solution of the corresponding multi-particle system and the invariant measure of MV-SDEs in the W2-Wasserstein metric is also given. In addition, the computational cost of the two approximation methods is compared, which shows that the averaged weighted empirical approximation of the particle system has a lower cost. Finally, the theoretical results are validated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Exact and Approximate Solutions for Magnetohydrodynamic Flow Control in Hele-Shaw Cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the motion of a thin layer of electrically conducting fluid, between two closely spaced parallel plates, in a classical Hele-Shaw geometry. Furthermore, let the system be immersed in a uniform external magnetic field (normal to the plates) and let electrical current be driven between conducting probes immersed in the fluid layer. In the present paper, we analyse the ensuing fluid flow at low Hartmann numbers. We first elucidate the mechanism of flow generation both physically and mathematically. We proceed by presenting mathematical solutions for a class of canonical multiply-connected geometries, in terms of the prime function developed by Crowdy (2020). Notably, those solutions can be written explicitly as series, and are thus exact, in doubly-connected geometries. Note that in higher connectivities, the prime function must be evaluated numerically. We then demonstrate how recently developed fast numerical methods may be applied to accurately determine the flow-field in arbitrary geometries when exact solutions are inaccessible.</description>

      <title>Wall-modeled large-eddy simulation based on spectral-element discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article analyses the simulation methodology for wall-modeled large-eddy simulations using solvers based on the spectral-element method (SEM). To that end, algebraic wall modeling is implemented in the popular SEM solver Nek5000. It is combined with explicit subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling, which is shown to perform better than the high-frequency filtering traditionally used with the SEM. In particular, the Vreman model exhibits a good balance in terms stabilizing the simulations, yet retaining good resolution of the turbulent scales. Some difficulties associated with SEM simulations on relatively coarse grids are also revealed: jumps in derivatives across element boundaries, lack of convergence for weakly formulated boundary conditions, and the necessity for the SGS model as a damper for high-frequency modes. In spite of these, state-of-the-art accuracy is achieved for turbulent channel flow and flat-plate turbulent boundary layer flow cases, proving the SEM to be a an excellent numerical framework for massively-parallel high-order WMLES.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Importance Sampling for Rare Events Associated With the McKean--Vlasov Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03225v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work combines multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) with importance sampling to estimate rare-event quantities that can be expressed as the expectation of a Lipschitz observable of the solution to a broad class of McKean--Vlasov stochastic differential equations. We extend the double loop Monte Carlo (DLMC) estimator introduced in this context in (Ben Rached et al., 2023) to the multilevel setting. We formulate a novel multilevel DLMC estimator and perform a comprehensive cost-error analysis yielding new and improved complexity results. Crucially, we devise an antithetic sampler to estimate level differences guaranteeing reduced computational complexity for the multilevel DLMC estimator compared with the single-level DLMC estimator. To address rare events, we apply the importance sampling scheme, obtained via stochastic optimal control in (Ben Rached et al., 2023), over all levels of the multilevel DLMC estimator. Combining importance sampling and multilevel DLMC reduces computational complexity by one order and drastically reduces the associated constant compared to the single-level DLMC estimator without importance sampling. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed multilevel DLMC estimator on the Kuramoto model from statistical physics with Lipschitz observables, confirming the reduced complexity from $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TOL}_{\mathrm{r}}^{-4})$ for the single-level DLMC estimator to $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TOL}_{\mathrm{r}}^{-3})$ while providing a feasible estimate of rare-event quantities up to prescribed relative error tolerance $\mathrm{TOL}_{\mathrm{r}}$.</description>

      <title>Some New Results on the Maximum Growth Factor in Gaussian Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04892v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper combines modern numerical computation with theoretical results to improve our understanding of the growth factor problem for Gaussian elimination. On the computational side we obtain lower bounds for the maximum growth for complete pivoting for $n=1:75$ and $n=100$ using the Julia JuMP optimization package. At $n=100$ we obtain a growth factor bigger than $3n$. The numerical evidence suggests that the maximum growth factor is bigger than $n$ if and only if $n \ge 11$. We also present a number of theoretical results. We show that the maximum growth factor over matrices with entries restricted to a subset of the reals is nearly equal to the maximum growth factor over all real matrices. We also show that the growth factors under floating point arithmetic and exact arithmetic are nearly identical. Finally, through numerical search, and stability and extrapolation results, we provide improved lower bounds for the maximum growth factor. Specifically, we find that the largest growth factor is bigger than $1.0045n$ for $n&gt;10$, and the lim sup of the ratio with $n$ is greater than or equal to $3.317$. In contrast to the old conjecture that growth might never be bigger than $n$, it seems likely that the maximum growth divided by $n$ goes to infinity as $n \rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>Discrete weak duality of hybrid high-order methods for convex minimization problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper derives a discrete dual problem for a prototypical hybrid high-order method for convex minimization problems. The discrete primal and dual problem satisfy a weak convex duality that leads to a priori error estimates with convergence rates under additional smoothness assumptions. This duality holds for general polyhedral meshes and arbitrary polynomial degrees of the discretization. A novel postprocessing is proposed and allows for a~posteriori error estimates on regular triangulations into simplices using primal-dual techniques. This motivates an adaptive mesh-refining algorithm, which performs superiorly compared to uniform mesh refinements.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Diffusion Stencils: From Simple Derivations over Stability Estimates to ResNet Implementations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05575v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic diffusion processes with a diffusion tensor are important in image analysis, physics, and engineering. However, their numerical approximation has a strong impact on dissipative artefacts and deviations from rotation invariance. In this work, we study a large family of finite difference discretisations on a 3 x 3 stencil. We derive it by splitting 2-D anisotropic diffusion into four 1-D diffusions. The resulting stencil class involves one free parameter and covers a wide range of existing discretisations. It comprises the full stencil family of Weickert et al. (2013) and shows that their two parameters contain redundancy. Furthermore, we establish a bound on the spectral norm of the matrix corresponding to the stencil. This gives time step size limits that guarantee stability of an explicit scheme in the Euclidean norm. Our directional splitting also allows a very natural translation of the explicit scheme into ResNet blocks. Employing neural network libraries enables simple and highly efficient parallel implementations on GPUs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel numerical scheme for simulating deformable and extensible capsules suspended in a Stokesian fluid. The main feature of our scheme is a partition-of-unity (POU) based representation of the surface that enables asymptotically faster computations compared to spherical-harmonics based representations. We use a boundary integral equation formulation to represent and discretize hydrodynamic interactions. The boundary integrals are weakly singular. We use the quadrature scheme based on the regularized Stokes kernels. We also use partition-of unity based finite differences that are required for the computational of interfacial forces. Given an N-point surface discretization, our numerical scheme has fourth-order accuracy and O(N) asymptotic complexity, which is an improvement over the O(N^2 log(N)) complexity of a spherical harmonics based spectral scheme that uses product-rule quadratures. We use GPU acceleration and demonstrate the ability of our code to simulate the complex shapes with high resolution. We study capsules that resist shear and tension and their dynamics in shear and Poiseuille flows. We demonstrate the convergence of the scheme and compare with the state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying the asymptotic behaviour of solutions to generalized non-commensurate fractional systems. To this end, we first consider fractional systems with rational orders and introduce a criterion that is necessary and sufficient to ensure the stability of such systems. Next, from the fractional-order pseudospectrum definition proposed by \v{S}anca et al., we formulate the concept of a rational approximation for the fractional spectrum of a noncommensurate fractional systems with general, not necessarily rational, orders. Our first important new contribution is to show the equivalence between the fractional spectrum of a noncommensurate linear system and its rational approximation. With this result in hand, we use ideas developed in our earlier work to demonstrate the stability of an equilibrium point to nonlinear systems in arbitrary finite-dimensional spaces. A second novel aspect of our work is the fact that the approach is constructive. Finally, we give numerical simulations to illustrate the merit of the proposed theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To strike a balance between modeling accuracy and computational efficiency for simulations of ultrasound waves in soft tissues, we derive a pseudodifferential factorization of the wave operator with fractional attenuation. This factorization allows us to approximately solve the Helmholtz equation via one-way (transmission) or two-way (transmission and reflection) sweeping schemes tailored to high-frequency wave fields. We provide explicitly the three highest order terms of the pseudodifferential expansion to incorporate the well-known square-root first order symbol for wave propagation, the zeroth order symbol for amplitude modulation due to changes in wave speed and damping, and the next symbol to model fractional attenuation. We also propose wide-angle Pade approximations for the pseudodifferential operators corresponding to these three highest order symbols. Our analysis provides insights regarding the role played by the frequency and the Pade approximations in the estimation of error bounds. We also provide a proof-of-concept numerical implementation of the proposed method and test the error estimates numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a fast, direct solver for elliptic partial differential equations on a two-dimensional hierarchy of adaptively refined, Cartesian meshes. Our solver, inspired by the Hierarchical Poincar\'e-Steklov (HPS) method introduced by Gillman and Martinsson (SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 2014) uses fast solvers on locally uniform Cartesian patches stored in the leaves of a quadtree and is the first such solver that works directly with the adaptive quadtree mesh managed using the grid management library \pforest (C. Burstedde, L. Wilcox, O. Ghattas, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 2011). Within each Cartesian patch, stored in leaves of the quadtree, we use a second order finite volume discretization on cell-centered meshes. Key contributions of our algorithm include 4-to-1 merge and split implementations for the HPS build stage and solve stage, respectively. We demonstrate our solver on Poisson and Helmholtz problems with a mesh adapted to the high local curvature of the right-hand side.</description>

      <title>On solution of tropical discrete best approximation problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a discrete best approximation problem formulated in the framework of tropical algebra, which deals with the theory and applications of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. Given a set of samples of input and output of an unknown function, the problem is to construct a generalized tropical Puiseux polynomial that best approximates the function in the sense of a tropical distance function. The construction of an approximate polynomial involves the evaluation of both unknown coefficient and exponent of each monomial in the polynomial. To solve the approximation problem, we first reduce the problem to an equation in unknown vector of coefficients, which is given by a matrix with entries parameterized by unknown exponents. We derive a best approximate solution of the equation, which yields both vector of coefficients and approximation error parameterized by the exponents. Optimal values of exponents are found by minimization of the approximation error, which is transformed into minimization of a function of exponents over all partitions of a finite set. We solve this minimization problem in terms of max-plus algebra by using a computational procedure based on the agglomerative clustering technique. This solution is extended to the minimization problem of finding optimal exponents in the polynomial in terms of max-algebra. The results obtained are applied to develop new solutions for conventional problems of discrete best Chebyshev approximation of real functions by piecewise linear functions and piecewise Puiseux polynomials. We discuss computational complexity of the proposed solution and estimate upper bounds on the computational time. We demonstrate examples of approximation problems solved in terms of max-plus and max-algebra, and give graphical illustrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the method to reconstruct dynamical systems from data without time labels. Data without time labels appear in many applications, such as molecular dynamics, single-cell RNA sequencing etc. Reconstruction of dynamical system from time sequence data has been studied extensively. However, these methods do not apply if time labels are unknown. Without time labels, sequence data becomes distribution data. Based on this observation, we propose to treat the data as samples from a probability distribution and try to reconstruct the underlying dynamical system by minimizing the distribution loss, sliced Wasserstein distance more specifically. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Maximum a posteriori testing in statistical inverse problems</title>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with a Bayesian approach to testing hypotheses in statistical inverse problems. Based on the posterior distribution $\Pi \left(\cdot |Y = y\right)$, we want to infer whether a feature $\langle\varphi, u^\dagger\rangle$ of the unknown quantity of interest $u^\dagger$ is positive. This can be done by the so-called maximum a posteriori test. We provide a frequentistic analysis of this test's properties such as level and power, and prove that it is a regularized test in the sense of Kretschmann et al. (2024). Furthermore we provide lower bounds for its power under classical spectral source conditions in case of Gaussian priors. Numerical simulations illustrate its superior performance both in moderately and severely ill-posed situations.</description>

      <title>MODNO: Multi Operator Learning With Distributed Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of operator learning involves the utilization of neural networks to approximate operators. Traditionally, the focus has been on single-operator learning (SOL). However, recent advances have rapidly expanded this to include the approximation of multiple operators using foundation models equipped with millions or billions of trainable parameters, leading to the research of multi-operator learning (MOL). In this paper, we present a novel distributed training approach aimed at enabling a single neural operator with significantly fewer parameters to effectively tackle multi-operator learning challenges, all without incurring additional average costs. Our method is applicable to various neural operators, such as Deep Operator Neural Networks (DON). The core idea is to independently learn the output basis functions for each operator using its dedicated data, while simultaneously centralizing the learning of the input function encoding shared by all operators using the entire dataset. Through a systematic study of five numerical examples, we compare the accuracy and cost of training a single neural operator for each operator independently versus training a MOL model using our proposed method. Our results demonstrate enhanced efficiency and satisfactory accuracy. Moreover, our approach illustrates that some operators with limited data can be more effectively constructed with the aid of data from analogous operators through MOL learning. This highlights another MOL's potential to bolster operator learning.</description>
