      <title>Thermodynamics of multiple Maxwell demons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many assembly line processes like metabolic and signaling networks in biological systems, the products of the first enzyme is the reactant for the next enzyme in the network. Working of multiple machines leads to efficient utilization of resources. Motivated by this, we investigate if multiple Maxwell demons lead to more efficient information processing. We study the phase space of multiple demons acting on an information tape based on the model of Mandal and Jarzynski [1, 2]. Their model is analytically solvable and the phase space of the device has three regions: engine, where work is delivered by writing information to the tape, erasure, where work is performed on the device to erase information on the tape, and dud, when work is performed and at the same time the information is written to the tape. For identical demons, we find that the erasure region increases at the expense of the dud region while the information engine region does not change appreciably. The efficiency of the multiple demon device increases with the number of demons in the device and saturates to the equilibrium (maximum) efficiency even at short cycle times for very large number of demons. By investigating a device with nonidentical demons acting on a tape, we identify the demon parameters that control the different regions of the phase space. Our model is well suited to study information processing in assembly line systems.</description>

      <title>Bio-inspired learning algorithm for time series using Loewner equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though the relationship between the theoretical statistical physics and machine learning techniques has been a well-discussed topic, the studies on the mechanism of learning inspired by the biological system are still developing. In this study, we investigate the application methods of Loewner equation to the learning algorithm particularly focusing on its statistical-mechanical aspects. We suggest two simple methods of learning of one-dimensional time series based on the unique encoding property of the discrete Loewner evolution. The first one is the Gaussian process (GP) regression using the normality of the distribution of Loewner driving force corresponding to the curve composed from the time series. The second one is the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) for the time series, which is derived from the Loewner theory, measuring the sensitivity of the nonlinear dynamics under the small perturbation. These methods were numerically tested dealing with the neuronal dynamics generated by the leaky integrate-and-fire model. In addition, we discuss the similarity between the mapping mechanism of the present method and the structure of biological information processing from a point of view of self-organization system theory.</description>

      <title>First-Passage Observables of $d$-dimensional Confined Jump Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-passage observables (FPO) are central to understanding stochastic processes in confined domains, with applications spanning chemical reaction kinetics, foraging behavior, and molecular transport. While extensive analytical results exist for continuous processes, discrete jump processes -- crucial for describing empirically observed dynamics -- remain largely unexplored in this context. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate FPO for $d$-dimensional confined isotropic jump processes, capturing both geometric and dynamical observables. Leveraging the connection between jump processes and their continuous counterparts, we address the limitations of continuous approximations in capturing discrete effects, particularly near absorbing boundaries. Our method unifies FPO calculations across edge and bulk regimes, providing explicit asymptotic expressions for key observables, such as splitting probabilities, harmonic measures, and first-passage time distributions in complex geometries. We illustrate our approach with paradigmatic examples, including eccentric splitting probabilities in two-dimensional disks and mean exit times for heavy-tailed processes. These results underscore the broad applicability of our framework to diverse physical systems, offering novel insights into the interplay between discrete dynamics and confining geometries.</description>

      <title>Statistical Description of Fermi System over a Surface in a Uniform External Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A statistical approach to the description of the thermodynamic properties of the Fermi particle system occupying a half-space over a plane of finite size in a uniform external field is proposed. The number of particles per unit area is assumed to be arbitrary, in particular, small. General formulas are obtained for entropy, energy, thermodynamic potential, heat capacities under various conditions and the distribution of the particle number density over the surface. In the continuum limit of a large surface area, the temperature dependences of heat capacities and density distribution are calculated. The cases of gravitational and electric fields are considered.</description>

      <title>First-passage and extreme value statistics for overdamped Brownian motion in a linear potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the first-passage properties and extreme-value statistics of an overdamped Brownian particle confined by an external linear potential $V(x)=\mu |x-x_0|$, where $\mu&gt;0$ is the strength of the potential and $x_0&gt;0$ is the position of the lowest point of the potential, which coincides with the starting position of the particle. The Brownian motion terminates whenever the particle passes through the origin at a random time $t_f$. Our study reveals that the mean first-passage time $\langle t_f \rangle$ exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior with respect to $\mu$, with a unique minimum occurring at an optimal value of $\mu \simeq 1.24468D/x_0$, where $D$ is the diffusion constant of the Brownian particle. Moreover, we examine the distribution $P(M|x_0)$ of the maximum displacement $M$ during the first-passage process, as well as the statistics of the time $t_m$ at which $M$ is reached. Intriguingly, there exists another optimal $\mu \simeq 1.24011 D/x_0$ that minimizes the mean time $\langle t_m \rangle$. All our analytical findings are corroborated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>From Brittle to Ductile and Back: Reentrant Fracture Transition in Disordered Two-Phase Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fracture processes in multi-phase solids are inherently complex due to multiple competing mechanisms. Here, we investigate the elastic and fracture behaviour of two-phase solids, comprising a fragile phase and a tough phase using a disordered spring network model. The macroscopic response is found to depend on the failure strain mismatch, the elastic modulus ratio, as well as the relative composition of the constituent phases. As the proportion of the tough phase increases, the system undergoes a reentrant phase transition in fracture behaviour: from brittle to ductile-like and back to brittle. These transitions are identified through both avalanche statistics and cluster size characteristics of broken springs. Notably, the avalanche exponent associated with the majority phase changes universality class during the brittle to ductile transition. Analysis of time evolution of cluster characteristics reveals distinct growth mechanisms in the two regimes. In the brittle regime, dominant clusters rapidly absorb other large clusters, keeping the total number of clusters nearly constant. In contrast, the ductile regime is characterised by more gradual coalescence, leading to a decrease in the total number of clusters over time while their average size increases. We provide a physical interpretation of the mechanisms underlying the observed switch in fracture behaviour.</description>

      <title>Universal Spreading of Nonstabilizerness and Quantum Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how transport properties of $U(1)$-conserving dynamics impact the growth of quantum resources characterizing the complexity of many-body states. We quantify wave-function delocalization using participation entropy (PE), a measure rooted in the coherence theory of pure states, and assess nonstabilizerness through stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE). Focusing on the XXZ spin chain initialized in domain-wall state, we demonstrate universal power-law growth of both PE and SRE, with scaling exponents explicitly reflecting the underlying transport regimes, ballistic, diffusive, or KPZ-type superdiffusive. Our results establish a solid connection between quantum resources and transport, providing insights into the dynamics of complexity within symmetry-constrained quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Effects Underlying Dynamic Heterogeneity in Miscible Blends of Poly(methyl methacrylate) with Poly(ethylene oxide)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of spatially variable local dynamics, or dynamic heterogeneity, is common in multicomponent polymer systems. Such heterogeneity is understood to arise from differences between the intrinsic dynamical fluctuations associated with one component versus another. However, the nature of the dynamic coupling between these components and how it depends on composition, temperature, and environmental fluctuations is not fully understood. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to characterize nanoscale dynamic heterogeneity in miscible blends of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a function of both temperature and blend composition. Probed over timescales of 100~ps, local PMMA segmental dynamics in blends align with neat PMMA when normalized by $T_\text{g}$, whereas PEO exhibits enhanced mobility caused by free-volume effects. The effects of dynamical coupling are found to be asymmetric between the extent of enhancement to PMMA and suppression of PEO dynamics based on analysis of local environment composition within blends. Asymmetric effects in the melt state are also identified over longer timescales according to a Rouse mode analysis over larger sub-chains for each species. These results provide fundamental insights into how dynamic heterogeneity manifests at the nanoscale, across conditions and compositions in miscible polymer blends. They establish a foundation for exploring whether such asymmetries are generalizable and how dynamic heterogeneity can be tuned through temperature, composition, and morphology.</description>

      <title>Dynamical non-Hermitian systems: Fingerprints and pure dephasing induced protection effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have shown promising potential for realizing quantum information tasks that lack counterparts in the Hermitian realm. Understanding the dynamical characteristics of non-Hermitian systems as reflected in information-theoretic quantities is essential for advancing their applications. Here we investigate dynamics of trace distance and concurrence, which quantify information flow and entanglement, respectively, in non-Hermitian qubit systems exhibiting either parity-time or anti-parity-time symmetry. We identify dynamical fingerprints from the system density matrix which provide a unified explanation to the common oscillation and relaxation dynamics shared by trace distance and concurrence observed in existing studies. We further investigate the fate of dynamical fingerprints under the impact of pure dephasing. Surprisingly, we find that pure dephasing can slow down the inherent relaxation of information flow and entanglement in non-Hermitian systems with unbroken anti-parity-time symmetry, suggesting a passive environment-assisted information protection in this class of non-Hermitian systems. Our findings enhance our understanding of dynamical non-Hermitian systems and have specific relevance to their information-oriented applications.</description>

      <title>Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility (the rate at which relaxation times grow with decreasing temperature) is central to unraveling the glass transition. Fragility is often linked to dynamic heterogeneity, and thus it is commonly assumed that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure--dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using three model systems: Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Weeks--Chandler--Andersen, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q, p) system, where potential softness is changed to vary fragility. We employ a structural order parameter derived from the mean--field caging potential and analyze energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic slope of the energy barrier, suitably defined, correlates with fragility, no consistent correlation is found for the microscopic energy barriers. Instead, the latter shows a strong correlation with an independently computed structure--dynamics measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble. Surprisingly, the two systems with the highest structure--dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8, 5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, bimodal displacement profiles, and high non-Gaussian parameters, all indicative of dynamic heterogeneity. However, their dynamic susceptibilities remain low, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation and temporal heterogeneity. Both systems lie in the enthalpy-dominated regime and are near the spinodal, suggesting mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. These findings challenge the conventional linkage among fragility, heterogeneity, and structure--dynamics correlation.</description>

Abstract: From a given Fokker-Planck equation, a multi-parameter deformed partner Fokker-Planck equation is constructed. This is done by first deleting a set of eigenstates of the original FPE by the multi-step Darboux-Crum transformation, and then reinstating the eigen-energy levels by the reverse Darboux-Crum transformation. Extension to fractional Fokker-Planck equation is briefly discussed. A recent study of the one-parameter isospectral FPE applied to black hole in the thermal potential approach is commented.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of coupled binary-fluid-surfactant systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a self-consistent hydrodynamic theory of coupled binary-fluid-surfactant systems from the underlying microscopic physics using Rayleigh's variational principle. At the microscopic level, surfactant molecules are modelled as dumbbells that exert forces and torques on the fluid and interface while undergoing Brownian motion. We obtain the overdamped stochastic dynamics of these particles from a Rayleighian dissipation functional, which we then coarse-grain to derive a set of continuum equations governing the surfactant concentration, orientation, and the fluid density and velocity. This approach introduces a polarization field, representing the average orientation of surfactants, and yields a mesoscopic free energy functional from which all governing equations are consistently derived. The resulting model accurately captures key surfactant phenomena, including surface tension reduction and droplet stabilization, as confirmed by both perturbation theory and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Flocking as a second-order phase transition in self-aligning active crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional crystal composed of active units governed by self-alignment. This mechanism induces a torque that aligns a particle's orientation with its velocity and leads to a phase transition from a disordered to a flocking crystal. Here, we provide the first microscopic theory that analytically maps the crystal dynamics onto a Landau-Ginzburg model, in which the velocity-dependent effective free energy undergoes a transition from a single-well shape to a Mexican-hat profile. As confirmed by simulations, our theory quantitatively predicts the transition point and characteristic spatial velocity correlations. The continuous change of the order parameter and the diverging behavior of the analytically predicted correlation length imply that flocking in self-aligning active crystals is a second-order phase transition. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for the flocking phenomenon observed experimentally in active granular particles and migrating cells.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hopfield models, originally developed to study memory retrieval in neural networks, have become versatile tools for modeling diverse biological systems in which function emerges from collective dynamics. In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to both classical and modern Hopfield networks from a biophysical perspective. After presenting the underlying mathematics, we build physical intuition through three complementary interpretations of Hopfield dynamics: as noise discrimination, as a geometric construction defining a natural coordinate system in pattern space, and as gradient-like descent on an energy landscape. We then survey recent applications of Hopfield networks a variety of biological setting including cellular differentiation and epigenetic memory, molecular self-assembly, and spatial neural representations.</description>

      <title>Density-Independent Glassy Behavior in the High-Density Phase of Motility-Induced Phase Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of active matter using a two-dimensional active Brownian particles model. In these systems, self-propelled particles undergo motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), spontaneously segregating into dense and dilute phases. We find that in the high-density phase, local particle mobility exhibits glassy behavior, with diffusivity remaining unchanged despite variations in the global system density. As global density increases further, the system undergoes a transition to a solid-like state through this glassy phase. These findings provide insights into nonequilibrium phase transitions in active matter, revealing a robust glassy phase en route to solidification, and may guide future studies in both synthetic and biological active systems.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Viscosity and Jamming Point in Dense Active non-Brownian Suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using numerical simulations, we study the rheological response of dense non-Brownian suspensions containing active particles. The active particles are modelled as run-and-tumble particles with three controlling parameters: the fraction of active particles in the system, an active force applied to the particles, and a persistence time after which the direction of the active force changes randomly. Our simulations reveal that the presence of activity can reduce the viscosity (by an order of magnitude) by decreasing the number of frictional contacts, which also shifts the jamming point to a higher volume fraction. Moreover, the microscopic structure of force chains in the presence of activity is qualitatively different from that in the passive system, showing reduced anisotropy. We also find that while the presence of activity drives the system away from jamming by preventing the formation of force chains, unjamming an already jammed state by breaking existing force chains requires a higher activity strength. Finally, we propose a new constitutive law to describe the rheology of dense active non-Brownian suspensions.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermalization mechanism and the emergence of symmetry-breaking phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis accounting for the emergence of symmetry-breaking phases. It consists of two conditions that any system with a degenerate spectrum must fulfill in order to thermalize. The failure of each of them generates a different non-thermalizing scenario. One is due to the absence of chaos and may indicate that extra constants of motion are required to describe equilibrium states. The other one implies the existence of initial conditions evolving towards symmetry-breaking equilibrium states. If it spreads across an entire spectral region, then this region gives rise to a symmetry-breaking phase. We explore the applicability of this formalism by means of numerical experiments on a three-site Bose-Hubbard model with two non-commuting discrete symmetries.</description>

      <title>Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping L\"uders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.</description>

      <title>On data and dimension in chemistry -- irreversibility, concealment and emergent conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09553v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical systems are interpreted through the species they contain and the reactions they may undergo, i.e., their chemical reaction network (CRN). In spite of their central importance to chemistry, the structure of CRNs continues to be challenging to deduce from data. Although there exist structural laws relating species, reactions, conserved quantities and cycles, there has been limited attention to their measurable consequences. One such is the dimension of the chemical data: the number of independent reactions or equivalently independent species, which corresponds to the number of measured variables minus the number of constraints. In this paper we attempt to relate the experimentally observed dimensional features to conservation laws and underlying CRN structure. Our approach extends to any Markov model as well as many nonlinear models in statistical physics and furnishes new analytical tools to find exact solutions.
  In particular, we investigate the effects of species that are concealed and reactions that are irreversible. For instance, irreversible reactions can have proportional rates. The resulting reduction in degrees of freedom can be captured by the co-production law relating co-production relationships to emergent non-integer conservation laws and broken cycles. This law resolves a recent conundrum posed by a machine-discovered candidate for a non-integer conservation law, and characterizes certain types of CRN behavior. We also obtain laws that allow us to relate data dimension to network structure in cases where some species cannot be discerned or distinguished by a given analytical technique, allowing to narrow down candidate CRNs from experimental data more effectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature of glassy dynamics and the glass transition are long-standing problems under active debate. In the presence of a structural disorder widely believed to be an essential characteristic of structural glass, identifying and understanding key dynamical behaviors are very challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that an energetic disorder, which usually results from a structural disorder, is instead a more essential feature of glass. Specifically, we develop a distinguishable-particle glassy crystal (DPGC) in which particles are ordered in a face-centered cubic lattice and follow particle-dependent random interactions, leading to an energetic disorder in the particle configuration space. Molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of vacancy-induced particle diffusion show typical glassy behaviors. A unique feature of this molecular model is the knowledge of the complete set of inherent structures with easily calculable free energies, implying a well-understood potential energy landscape.</description>

Abstract: We set up and study the hydrodynamic theory for inversion-symmetric active fluid and tethered membranes. For some choices of the activity parameter, such membranes are stable and described by linear hydrodynamic equations, which are exact in the asymptotic long wavelength limit, giving stable flat phases with translational quasi long range orders. For other choices of the activity parameter, the system is linearly unstable in the long wavelength limit, implying crumpling, or has intermediate wavevector instabilities, suggesting patterns. We argue that in such an active membrane thermal noises dominate over any active noises, and use those to calculate the correlation functions of membrane conformation fluctuations in the stable case, and the associated correlation functions of the embedding bulk flow velocities</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant diffusion, where the diffusion coefficient of a Brownian particle in a periodic potential with an external force is significantly enhanced by the external force, is a non-trivial non-equilibrium phenomenon. We propose a simple stochastic model of giant diffusion, which is based on a biased continuous-time random walk (CTRW) with flight time. By introducing a flight time representing traversal dynamics, we derive the diffusion coefficient using renewal theory and demonstrate its universal peak behavior under various periodic potentials, especially in low-temperature regimes. Giant diffusion is universally observed in the sense that there is a peak of the diffusion coefficient for any tilted periodic potentials and the degree of the diffusivity is greatly enhanced especially for low-temperature regimes. The biased CTRW models with flight times are applied to diffusion under three tilted periodic potentials. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the maximum diffusion coefficient and the external force that attains the maximum are presented for diffusion under a tilted sawtooth potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03006v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formation of a fluid drop, such as observed in dripping faucet, has been extensively studied for understanding singular dynamics widely observed in nature. The singular dynamics is often self-similar, i.e., the shape at different times are collapsed onto a master curve after rescaling. Here, we investigate the bubble breakup in an original setup, where a metal disk entrains air into viscous fluid with lubricating films on its surfaces in a confined cell, focusing on the dependence of the dynamics on the film thickness e. As a result, we find out the dynamics is self-similar as expected, but the shape of the master curve and the scaling exponents characterizing the self-similar dynamics are revealed to be sensitively dependent on e. We discuss analogy between the present study and critical phenomena in thermodynamic transitions, to suggest a promising future direction of the singular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Minimal thermodynamic cost of communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic cost of communication is a major factor in the thermodynamic cost of real-world computers, both biological and digital. Despite its importance, the fundamental principles underlying this cost remain poorly understood. This paper makes two major contributions to addressing this gap. First, we derive a universal relationship between information transmission rate and minimal entropy production (EP) by focusing on the mismatch cost (MMC) component of thermodynamic cost. The resulting relationship holds independently of the underlying physical dynamics, making it broadly applicable. We discuss the implications of the derived minimal communication cost for work extraction in measurement-and-feedback protocols, and through examples involving binary channels, we show that the relationship between transmission rate and minimal thermodynamic cost can exhibit diminishing returns in certain scenarios. Second, we extend this thermodynamic analysis to the computational front and back ends critical to communication-namely, encoding and decoding to reduce errors in noisy transmission. Using the framework of periodic machines, we establish strictly positive minimal costs for implementing linear error-correcting codes. We compare these costs with end-to-end error rates, highlighting trade-offs between thermodynamic cost and decoding accuracy.</description>

      <title>Long-time Freeness in the Kicked Top</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work highlighted the importance of higher-order correlations in quantum dynamics for a deeper understanding of quantum chaos and thermalization. The full Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, the framework encompassing correlations, can be formalized using the language of Free Probability theory. In this context, chaotic dynamics at long times are proposed to lead to free independence or "freeness" of observables. In this work, we investigate these issues in a paradigmatic semiclassical model - the kicked top - which exhibits a transition from integrability to chaos. Despite its simplicity, we identify several non-trivial features. By numerically studying 2n-point out-of-time-order correlators, we show that in the fully chaotic regime, long-time freeness is reached exponentially fast. These considerations lead us to introduce a large deviation theory for freeness that enables us to define and analyze the associated time scale. The numerical results confirm the existence of a hierarchy of different time scales, indicating a multifractal approach to freeness in this model. Our findings provide novel insights into the long-time behavior of chaotic dynamics and may have broader implications for the study of many-body quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>System-independent lower bounds on entropy production incurred by running a computer program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mismatch cost (MMC) is a universally applicable lower bound on both the entropy production (EP) of any fixed physical process across a given time interval. In this work we use MMC for the first time to lower-bound the amount of work dissipated by running a high-level or assembler-level computer program. To begin, we extend previous results concerning MMC to prove that it scales at least linearly with the total heat flow in the worst case over initial distributions. This establishes that - in contrast to results like the thermodynamic speed limit theorem or thermodynamic uncertainty relations - it is often a substantial fraction of the work dissipated on macroscopic scales. We also prove that the MMC lower bound over a given time interval never decreases if the time interval is subdivided into a sequence of sub-intervals, and that the bound often increases. Armed with these results, we then introduce a general framework for computing the minimal EP (i.e., the MMC) associated with running any computer program on any physical system that implements a modern digital computer. Crucially, this framework holds completely independently of the microscopic physical details of that system. Next we apply this general framework to compare lower bounds on the EP incurred by running two canonical sorting algorithms, bubble sort and Bucket sort. This enables us to investigate how thermodynamic cost depends on features like input size and structure (e.g., with or without repeated entries). Finally, we extend the framework to programs that call subroutines.</description>

Abstract: We adopt a stochastic approach to study the charge transport in transistors. In this approach, the hole and electron densities are ruled by diffusion-reaction stochastic partial differential equations satisfying local detailed balance condition. The electric field is supposed to be concentrated in very narrow regions around the two junctions and is also approximated to be static. In this way, not only the laws of electricity, thermodynamics, and microreversibility is consistent within this approach, but also the transistor can be easily modeled as a two-dimensional system. We perform the full counting statistics of the two coupled currents, and the fluctuation theorem is shown to hold. Moreover, we show that the geometric shape of the transistor exert great influence on the transport behavior. By modeling the transistor in two dimensions, the signal-amplification factor up to about $164$ can be achieved, which is comparable to the typical value of realistic transistors in industry.</description>

      <title>Impact of Fixing Spins in a Quantum Annealer with Energy Rescaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01008v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, various hardware restrictions significantly impede its efficient performance. Size-reduction methods provide an effective approach for addressing large-scale problems but often introduce additional challenges. A notable hardware restriction is the limited number of decision variables quantum annealing can handle compared to the size of the problem. Moreover, when employing size-reduction methods, the interactions and local magnetic fields in the Ising model--used to represent the combinatorial optimization problem--can become excessively large, making them difficult to implement on hardware. Although prior studies suggest that energy rescaling impacts the performance of quantum annealing, its interplay with size-reduction methods remains unexplored. This study examines the relationship between fixing spins, a promising size-reduction method, and the effects of energy rescaling. Numerical simulations and experiments conducted on a quantum annealer demonstrate that the fixing spins method enhances quantum annealing performance while preserving the spin-chain embedding for a homogeneous, fully connected ferromagnetic Ising model.</description>

      <title>Emergence of single-particle mobility edge (SPME) in a ladder network under a slowly varying quasiperiodic distortion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the localization transition in a two-leg ladder model incorporating a slowly varying quasiperiodic distortion as an inter-leg hopping in different parametric regions. In our model, we have introduced a distortion that is neither periodic (Bloch-type) nor random (Anderson-type) but instead has a slowly varying pseudorandom pattern described by $\Gamma_{n}= \lambda cos(2 \pi Q n^{\nu})$, where $0&lt;\nu &lt;1$. We have demonstrated that in the ladder model at $0&lt;\nu &lt;1$ limit, there is some point at which it is not possible to see a pure metal-insulator transition due to the presence of a single particle mobility edge (SPME) state. We have seen that, unlike the one-dimensional AA model, where the slowly varying potential has been introduced as an onsite potential term, the delocalized states are present beyond the $ \lambda=2t$ limit. Further analysis shows that a pure metal-to-insulator transition occurs for $\nu=1$ at $\lambda=2t.$ We also studied the scale-invariant nature of the mobility edge, which confirms its robustness. The wave packet dynamics also validates the presence of the mobility edge. We have seen that for the point $\nu &lt; 1$ the wave packet dynamics goes through the transition: ballistic (delocalized) through nearly-ballistic (nearly delocalized) to superdiffusive (fractal) phase. In contrast to $\nu &lt;1$, for $\nu=1$ the dynamics goes through the transition: ballistic (delocalized) through ordinary diffusive (critical) to localized phase.</description>

      <title>Quantum Level-Crossing Induced by Anisotropy in Spin-1 Heisenberg Dimers: Applications to Quantum Stirling Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the thermodynamic performance of a quantum Stirling heat engine implemented with an anisotropic spin-1 Heisenberg dimer as the working medium. Using the Hamiltonian of the system, we analyze the interplay of anisotropy, magnetic field, and exchange interactions and their influence on the energy spectrum and the quantum level crossing. Our results reveal that double-degenerate point (DDP) and a triple-degenerate point (TDP) play pivotal roles in shaping the operational regimes and efficiency of the quantum Stirling engine. At those points, the Carnot efficiency reaches higher work output and enhanced stability, making it a robust candidate for optimal thermodynamic performance. These findings highlight the potential of anisotropic spin systems as viable platforms for quantum heat engines and contribute to advancing the field of quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Relating thermodynamic quantities of convex-hard-body fluids to the body's shape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fluid of convex hard particles, characterized by a length scale $\sigma_\text{min}$ and an anisotropy parameter $\epsilon$, we develop a formalism allowing one to relate thermodynamic quantities to the body's shape. In a first step its thermodynamics is reduced to that of spherical particles. The latter have a hard core of diameter $\sigma_\text{min }$ and a soft shell with a thickness $\epsilon \sigma_\text{min}/2$. Besides their hard core repulsion at $\sigma_\text{min }$ they interact by effective entropic forces which will be calculated. Based on this mapping, a second step provides a perturbative method for the systematic calculation of thermodynamic quantities with the shape anisotropy $\epsilon$ as smallness parameter.
  In leading order in $\epsilon $, the equation of state is derived as a functional of the particle's shape. To illustrate these findings, they are applied to a one- and two-dimensional fluid of ellipses and compared with results from different analytical approaches, and our computer simulations. The mapping to spherical particles also implies that any phase transition of spherical particles, e.g., the liquid-hexatic transition, also exists for the nonspherical ones, and shifts linearly with $\epsilon $ for weak shape anisotropy. This is supported by our Monte-Carlo simulation.</description>

      <title>Approach to network failure due to intrinsic fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A networked system can fail when most of its components are unable to support flux through the nodes and edges. As studied earlier this scenario can be triggered by an external perturbation such as an intentional attack on nodes or for internal reasons such as due to malfunction of nodes. In either case, the asymptotic failure of the network is preceded by a cascade of nodal failures. In this work, we focus on the nodal failure arising from the intrinsic fluctuations in the flux passing through the nodes. By modeling these as extreme events, it is shown that three distinct nodal failure regimes can be identified before a complete network failure takes place. Further, the approach to network failure through the three regimes is shown to be qualitatively similar on a square lattice, all-to-all, scale free, and Erdos-Renyi networks. We obtain approximate analytical description of the approach to failure for an all-to-all network. This is also demonstrated numerically for real transportation network of flights.</description>

Abstract: The family of Boltzmann distributions is used in statistical mechanics to describe the distribution of states in systems with a given temperature. We give a novel characterization of this family as the unique one satisfying independence for uncoupled systems. The theorem boils down to a statement about endomorphisms of the convolution semigroup of finitely supported probability measures on the natural numbers, or, alternatively, about endomorphisms of the multiplicative semigroup of polynomials with non-negative coefficients.</description>

      <title>On the Conditions for a Quantum Violent Relaxation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14768v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general, classical fully-connected systems are known to undergo violent relaxation. This phenomenon refers to the relaxation of observables to stationary, non-thermal, values on a finite timescale, despite their long-time dynamics being dominated by mean-field effects in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we analyze the ``quantum" violent relaxation by studying the dynamics of generic many-body systems with two-body, all-to-all, interactions in the thermodynamic limit. We show that, in order for violent relaxation to occur very specific conditions on the spectrum of the mean-field effective Hamiltonian have to be met. These conditions are hardly met and ``quantum" violent relaxation is observed rarely with respect to its classical counterpart. Our predictions are validated by the study of a spin model which, depending on the value of the coupling, shows a transition between violent-relaxation and a generic prethermal phase. We also analyze a spin version of the quantum Hamiltonian-Mean-Field model, which is shown not to exhibit violent-relaxation. Finally, we discuss how the violent-relaxation picture emerges back in the classical limit. Our results demonstrate how, even in the mean-field regime, quantum effects have a rather dramatic impact on the dynamics, paving the way to a better understanding of light-matter coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transition in free bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The competition between quantum many-particle dynamics and continuous monitoring can lead to measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). So far, MIPTs have been extensively explored in fermionic or spin systems. To examine the possibility of an MIPT in bosonic systems, we study the entanglement structure in continuously monitored free bosons with long-range couplings. When the measurement is local, we find that no MIPTs occur because the substantial entanglement generated by the long-range coupling overcomes the entanglement destruction due to the measurement. In contrast, we show that the nonlocal measurement can efficiently suppress the entanglement generation, leading to an MIPT where the bipartite entanglement entropy exhibits the subvolume-to-area law phase transition as the measurement strength is increased. Our numerical results indicate that the critical point should be described by a certain conformal field theory, while the transition does not belong to a conventional universality class such as Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless class.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions Under Information Loss</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a quantum-many body system subject to measurements is naturally described by an ensemble of quantum trajectories, which can feature measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). This phenomenon cannot be revealed through ensemble-averaged observables, but it requires the ability to discriminate each trajectory separately, making its experimental observation extremely challenging. We explore the fate of MIPTs under an observer's reduced ability to discriminate each measurement outcome. This introduces uncertainty in the state of the system, causing observables to probe a restricted subset of trajectories rather than a single one. By introducing an exactly-solvable Liouvillian model, we examine how long-time spatial correlations are influenced by varying degrees of trajectory averaging. We compute exactly the correlation matrix, Liouvillian gap, and entanglement negativity to demonstrate that averaging over multiple realizations introduces an effective finite lengthscale, beyond which long-range correlations are suppressed. This suggests that partial averaging over trajectories conceals the critical features of individual realizations, thereby blurring away the signatures of distinct measurement-induced phases.</description>

      <title>Tracking the variation of entanglement R\'enyi negativity: a quantum Monte Carlo study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has been a powerful tool for analyzing phases and criticality in pure ground states via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). However, mixed-state entanglement, relevant to systems with dissipation, finite temperature, and disjoint regions, remains less explored due to the lack of efficient numerical methods. In this work, we present a practical and easy-to-implement QMC method within the reweight-annealing framework, enabling efficient computation of the entanglement R\'enyi negativity (RN) by tracking its variation along given parameter paths. This method is scalable, parallelizable, and well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale simulations. Applying it to diverse scenarios-including 1D and 2D systems, ground and thermal states, and bipartite and tripartite partitions, not only the information of the underlying conformal field theory is achieved, but the role of entanglement in quantum and thermal phase transitions is revealed.</description>

Abstract: The realization of synthetic gauge fields for charge neutral ultracold atoms and the simulation of quantum Hall physics has witnessed remarkable experimental progress. Here, we establish key signatures of fractional quantum Hall systems in their non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. We show that in the lowest Landau level the system generically relaxes subdiffusively.The slow relaxation is understood from emergent conservation laws of the total charge and the associated dipole moment that arise from the effective Hamiltonian projected onto the lowest Landau level, leading to subdiffusive fracton hydrodynamics. We discuss the prospect of rotating quantum gases as well as ultracold atoms in optical lattices for observing this unconventional relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a class of nonequilibrium phases of matter that exhibit robust subharmonic responses to periodic driving without requiring disorder. Prior realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of either spontaneous or induced finite polarization. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals (UPDTCs) that do not require finite polarization. By studying a spin model of periodically driven trapped ions, we show that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization for paramagnetic initial states, even when the staggered magnetization itself vanishes. The key insight is that quantum fluctuations alone are sufficient to reveal coherent DTC-like dynamics. We demonstrate that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, consistent with Floquet prethermalization. Our results expand the known phenomenology of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases. We propose an experimental protocol to observe UPDTCs in trapped-ion simulators.</description>

      <title>Metastability and Ostwald Step Rule in the Crystallisation of Diamond and Graphite from Molten Carbon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The crystallisation of carbon from the melt under extreme conditions is highly relevant to earth and planetary science, materials manufacturing, and nuclear fusion research. The thermodynamic conditions near the graphite-diamond-liquid (GDL) triple point are especially of interest for geological and technological applications, but high-pressure flash heating experiments aiming to resolve this region of the phase diagram of carbon exhibit large discrepancies. Experimental challenges are often related to the persistence of metastable crystalline or glassy phases, superheated crystals, or supercooled liquids. A deeper understanding of the crystallisation kinetics of diamond and graphite is crucial for effectively interpreting the outcomes of these experiments. Here, we reveal the microscopic mechanisms of diamond and graphite nucleation from liquid carbon through molecular simulations with first-principles machine learning potentials. Our simulations accurately reproduce the experimental phase diagram of carbon in the region around the GDL triple point and show that liquid carbon crystallises spontaneously upon cooling at constant pressure. Surprisingly, metastable graphite crystallises in the domain of diamond thermodynamic stability at pressures above the triple point. Furthermore, whereas diamond crystallises through a classical nucleation pathway, graphite follows a two-step process in which low-density fluctuations forego ordering. Calculations of the nucleation rates of the two competing phases confirm this result and reveal a manifestation of Ostwald's step rule where the strong metastability of graphite hinders the transformation to the stable diamond phase. Our results provide a new key to interpreting melting and recrystallisation experiments and shed light on nucleation kinetics in polymorphic materials with deep metastable states.</description>

      <title>Quantum null energy condition in quenched 2d CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum null energy condition (QNEC) is a lower bound on the expectation value of the null-null component of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of null variations of the entanglement entropy. A stronger version of the QNEC (the primary QNEC) is expected to hold in 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories (CFT). QNEC has been shown to impose non-trivial quantum thermodynamic restrictions on irreversible entropy production in quenches in 1+1 dimensional holographic CFTs. It is therefore natural to study if QNEC imposes similar bounds in other quench setups. In this paper we study QNEC in the Calabrese-Cardy global and local joining quenches using standard CFT techniques. In the global quench we show that the primary QNEC must hold at sufficiently early times and find that it imposes bounds on the four point correlators of twist fields in a boundary state. This is a constraint on the set of boundary states that satisfy the primary QNEC. Furthermore, we find that a violation of the primary QNEC implies a violation of the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) in a conformally transformed frame. In the local quench we find similar bounds on four point correlators from both the primary and the usual QNEC.</description>

Abstract: A free surface induces enhanced dynamics in glass formers. We study the dynamical enhancement of glassy films with a distinguishable-particle lattice model of glass free of elastic effects. We demonstrate that the thickness of the surface mobile layer depends on temperature differently under different definitions, although all are based on local structure relaxation rate. The rate can be fitted to a double exponential form with an exponential-of-power-law tail. Our approach and results exclude elasticity as the unique mechanism for the tail. Layer-resolved particle hopping rate, potentially a key measure for activated hopping, is also studied but it exhibits much shallower surface effects.</description>

      <title>Subexponential decay of local correlations from diffusion-limited dephasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chaotic quantum systems at finite energy density are expected to act as their own heat baths, rapidly dephasing local quantum superpositions. We argue that in fact this dephasing is subexponential for chaotic dynamics with conservation laws in one spatial dimension: all local correlation functions decay as stretched exponentials or slower. The stretched exponential bound is saturated for operators that are orthogonal to all hydrodynamic modes. This anomalous decay is a quantum coherent effect, which lies beyond standard fluctuating hydrodynamics; it vanishes in the presence of extrinsic dephasing. Our arguments are general, subject principally to the assumption that there exist zero-entropy charge sectors (such as the particle vacuum) with no nontrivial dynamics: slow relaxation is due to the persistence of regions resembling these inert vacua, which we term "voids". In systems with energy conservation, this assumption is automatically satisfied because of the third law of thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.</description>

Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH simulations.</description>
