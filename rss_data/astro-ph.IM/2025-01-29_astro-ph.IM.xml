      <title>VEGA: Voids idEntification using Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic voids, the nearly empty regions nestled between walls and filaments, are recognized for their extensive applications in the field of cosmology and astrophysics. However, a consensus on the definition of voids remains elusive, as various void-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape and density based on the method that were used. In this paper, we introduce an innovative void identification method that utilizes Genetic Algorithm analysis. VEGA employs the Voronoi tessellation technique and the Convex Hull algorithm to partition the dataset plane into distinct regions and calculate the volume of each region. For the first time, VEGA integrates Genetic Algorithm analysis with the luminosity density contrast function to identify and locate the possible void region candidates. This method utilizes a set of grid points, which enhances the implementation of Voronoi tessellation and enables VEGA to more effectively access the dataset space for the identification of void regions candidates, finding the center and the ultimate structure of voids. Finally, we applied the VEGA and Aikio-M\"ah\"onen (AM) methods to the same test dataset and compared the cosmic voids identified by VEGA with those identified by the AM method. This comparison demonstrated that the VEGA void-finding method yields reliable results and can be effectively applied to various particle distributions.</description>

      <title>A Study of Afterglow Signatures in NaI and CsI Scintillator Modules for the Background and Transient Observer Instrument on COSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of the afterglow signatures in NaI(Tl) and CsI(Tl) detector modules as part of the Background and Transient Observer (BTO) mission detector trade-study. BTO is a NASA Student Collaboration Project flying on the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) Small Explorer mission in 2027. The detectors utilized in this study are cylindrical in shape with a height and diameter of 5.1 cm and were read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). We conducted a radiation campaign at the HIMAC accelerator in Japan where the scintillators were irradiated with a 230 MeV/u helium beam (He beam) and 350 MeV/u carbon beam (C beam). We find that both the CsI and NaI scintillators exhibit afterglow signatures when irradiated with the C and He beams. The CsI crystal exhibits a stronger afterglow intensity with afterglow pulses occurring for an average 2.40 ms for C and 0.9 ms for He after the initial particle pulse. The duration of afterglow pulses in CsI is 8.6x and 5.6x the afterglow signal duration in NaI for C and He (0.28 ms and 0.16 ms, respectively). Although CsI has advantages such as a higher light yield and radiation hardness, the stronger afterglows in the CsI detector increase the complexity of the electronics and lead to a ~7x larger dead time per afterglow event or a ~3x higher energy threshold value. We use the measured dead times to predict the amount of observing time lost to afterglow-inducing events for an instrument like BTO in low Earth orbit. We simulate the background rates in a BTO-like orbit and find a total value of 114 counts/s for the full two-detector system. Based on the particle energies in the HIMAC experiment, we then determine that an event with sufficient energy to produce an afterglow signal occurs once every ~70 s and ~1.4 s in NaI and CsI detectors, respectively. Thus, we conclude that NaI is the better choice for the BTO mission.</description>

      <title>AMPEL workflows for LSST: Modular and reproducible real-time photometric classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern time-domain astronomical surveys produce high throughput data streams which require tools for processing and analysis. This will be critical for programs making full use of the alert stream from the Vera Rubin Observatory (VRO), where spectroscopic labels will only be available for a small subset of all transients. In this context, the AMPEL toolset can work as a code-to-data platform for the development of efficient, reproducible and flexible workflows for real-time astronomical application.
  We here introduce three different AMPEL channels constructed to highlight different uses of alert streams: to rapidly find infant transients (SNGuess), to provide unbiased transient samples for follow-up (FollowMe) and to deliver final transient classifications (FinalBet). These pipelines already contain placeholders for mechanisms which will be essential for the optimal usage of VRO alerts: combining different classifiers, including host galaxy information, population priors and sampling non-gaussian photometric redshift distributions. Based on the ELAsTiCC simulation, all three channels are already working at a high level: SNGuess correctly tags 99% of all young supernovae, FollowMe illustrates how an unbiased subset of alerts can be selected for spectroscopic follow-up in the context of cosmological probes and FinalBet includes priors to achieve successful classifications for &gt;~80% of all extragalactic transients.
  The fully functional workflows presented here are all public and can be used as starting points for any group wishing to optimize pipelines for their specific VRO science programs. AMPEL is designed to allow this to be done in accordance with FAIR principles: both software and results can be easily shared and results reproduced. The code-to-data environment ensures that models developed this way can be directly applied to the real-time LSST stream parsed by AMPEL.</description>

      <title>A novel inversion algorithm for weak gravitational lensing using quasi-conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the challenges in weak gravitational lensing by galaxies and clusters is to infer the projected mass density distribution from gravitational lensing measurements, which is known as inversion problem. We introduce a novel theoretical approach to solve the inversion problem. The cornerstone of the proposed method lies in a complex formalism that describes the lens mapping as quasi-conformal mapping with the Beltrami coefficient given by the negative of the reduced shear, which is, in principle, observable from the image ellipticities. We propose an algorithm called QCLens that is based on this complex formalism. QCLens computes the underlying quasi-conformal mapping with a finite element approach by reducing the problem to two elliptic partial differential equations solely depending on the reduced shear field. Experimental results for both the Schwarzschild and singular isothermal lens demonstrate the agreement of our proposed method with the analytically computable solutions.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear fitting of undersampled discrete datasets in astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data analysis and interpretation often relies on an approximation of an empirical dataset by some analytic functions or models. Actual implementations usually rely on a non-linear multi-dimensional optimization algorithm, typically Levenberg--Marquardt (LM) or other flavors of Newtonian gradient methods. A vast majority of datasets in optical and infrared astronomy are represented by values on a discrete grid because the actual signal is sampled by regularly shaped pixels in the light detectors. Here we come to the main problem of nearly all widely used implementations of nonlinear optimization methods: the function that is being fitted is evaluated at central pixel positions rather than integrated over the pixel areas. Therefore, the best-fitting set of parameters returned by the minimization routine might not be the best representation of the observed dataset, especially if a dataset is undersampled. For example, a central pixel of a 1D Gaussian with a dispersion of 1 pix (2.36 pix FWHM; so not too strongly undersampled) will be about 4.2% lower than its central evaluated value if integrated. To handle this effect properly, one needs to perform numerical or analytic integration of a model within the pixel boundaries. We will discuss possible computationally efficient solutions and test our preliminary implementation of a nonlinear fitting using LM minimization that correctly accounts for the discrete nature of the data.</description>

      <title>Tackling artefacts in the timing of relativistic pulsar binaries: towards the SKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common signal-processing approximations produce artefacts when timing pulsars in relativistic binary systems, especially edge-on systems with tight orbits, such as the Double Pulsar. In this paper, we use extensive simulations to explore various patterns that arise from the inaccuracies of approximations made when correcting dispersion and Shapiro delay. In a relativistic binary, the velocity of the pulsar projected onto the line-of-sight varies significantly on short time scales, causing rapid changes in the apparent pulsar spin frequency, which is used to convert dispersive delays to pulsar rotational phase shifts. A well-known example of the consequences of this effect is the artificial variation of dispersion measure (DM) with binary phase, first observed in the Double Pulsar 20 years ago. We show that ignoring the Doppler shift of the spin frequency when computing the dispersive phase shift exactly reproduces the shape and magnitude of the reported DM variations. We also simulate and study two additional effects of much smaller magnitude, which are caused by the assumption that the spin frequency used to correct dispersion is constant over the duration of the sub-integration and over the observed bandwidth. We show that failure to account for these two effects leads to orbital phase-dependent dispersive smearing that leads to apparent orbital DM variations. The functional form of the variation depends on the orbital eccentricity. In addition, we find that a polynomial approximation of the timing model is unable to accurately describe the Shapiro delay of edge-on systems with orbits less than 4 hours, which poses problems for the measurements of timing parameters, most notably the Shapiro delay. This will be a potential issue for sensitive facilities like the FAST and the forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA); therefore, a more accurate phase predictor is indispensable.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of new radio occultation observations among small satellites at Venus by data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) for radio occultation measurements (RO) among small satellites, which are expected to be useful for future Venus missions. The effectiveness of the observations based on realistic orbit calculations was evaluated by reproduction of the "cold collar", a unique thermal structure in the polar atmosphere of Venus. Pseudo-temperature observations for the OSSEs were provided from the Venus atmospheric GCM in which the cold collar was reproduced by the thermal forcing. The vertical temperature distributions between 40 and 90 km altitudes at observation points were assimilated. The result showed that the cold collar was most clearly reproduced in the case where the temperature field in high-latitudes was observed twice a day, suggesting that the proposed observation is quite effective to improve the polar atmospheric structure at least. Although the cold collar was also reproduced in the OSSEs for Longwave Infrared Camera (LIR) observations, the result seemed unrealistic and inefficient compared to that obtained in the RO OSSEs. The present study shows that the OSSEs can be used to evaluate observation plans and instruments in terms of reproducibility of specific atmospheric phenomena, and applied to future missions targeting planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>First Axion-Like Particle Results from a Broadband Search for Wave-Like Dark Matter in the 44 to 52 $\mu$eV Range with a Coaxial Dish Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results from the first axion-like particle search conducted using a dish antenna. The experiment was conducted at room temperature and sensitive to axion-like particles in the $44-52\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$ range ($10.7 - 12.5\,\mathrm{GHz}$). The novel dish antenna geometry was proposed by the BREAD collaboration and previously used to conduct a dark photon search in the same mass range. To allow for axion-like particle sensitivity, the BREAD dish antenna was placed in a $3.9\,\mathrm{T}$ solenoid magnet at Argonne National Laboratory. In the presence of a magnetic field, axion-like dark matter converts to photons at the conductive surface of the reflector. The signal is focused onto a custom coaxial horn antenna and read out with a low-noise radio-frequency receiver. No evidence of axion-like dark matter was observed in this mass range and we place the most stringent laboratory constraints on the axion-photon coupling strength, $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$, in this mass range at 90\% confidence.</description>

      <title>SMA-X: Versatile information sharing in and around telescopes, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We developed the SMA eXchange (SMA-X) as a real-time data sharing solution, built atop a central Redis database. SMA-X is a storage convention, facilitated by a set of server-side Lua scripts (or Redis functions) which enable efficient low-latency and high-throughput real-time sharing of hierarchically structured data among the various systems and subsystems of the telescope. It enables fast, atomic retrievals of specific leaf elements, branches, and sub-trees, including associated metadata (types, dimensions, timestamps, and origins, and more). At the Submillimer Array (SMA) we rely on it since 2021 to share a diverse set of ~10,000 real-time variables, including arrays, across more than 100 computers, with information being published every 10 ms in some cases. SMA-X is open-source, and is freely available to everyone through a set of public GitHub repositories, including C/C++ and Python3 libraries to allow integration with observatory applications. A set of command-line tools provide access to the database from the POSIX shell and/or from any scripting language, and we also provide a configurable system daemon for archiving the observatory state at regular intervals into a time-series Structured Query Language (SQL) database to create a detailed historical record.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field tunable spectral response of kinetic inductance detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tune the onset of optical response in aluminium kinetic inductance detectors from a natural cutoff frequency of 90 GHz to 60 GHz by applying an external magnetic field. The change in spectral response is due to the decrease of the superconducting gap, from 90 GHz at zero magnetic field to 60 GHz at a magnetic field of around 3 mT. We characterize the variation of the superconducting gap, the detector frequency shift and the internal quality factor as a function of the applied field. In principle, the magnetic field tunable response could be used to make spectroscopic measurements. In practice, the internal quality factor behaves hysteretically with the magnetic field due to the presence of vortices in the thin superconducting film. We conclude by discussing possible solutions to achieve spectroscopy measurements using kinetic inductance detectors and magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Doppler correlation-driven vetoes for the Frequency Hough analysis in continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved method for vetoing candidates of continuous gravitational-wave sources during all-sky searches utilizing the Frequency Hough pipeline. This approach leverages linear correlations between source parameters induced by the Earth Doppler effect, which can be effectively identified through the Hough Transform. Candidates that do not align with these patterns are considered spurious and can thus be vetoed, enhancing the depth and statistical significance of follow-up analyses. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the method calibration, which intrinsically linked to the total duration of the observing run. On average, the procedure successfully vetoes $56\%$ of candidates. To assess the method performance, we conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation injecting fake continuous-wave signals into data from the third observing run of the LIGO detectors. This analysis allowed us to infer strain amplitude upper limits at a $90\%$ confidence level. We found that the optimal sensitivity is $h_0^{90\%} = 3.62^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\times 10^{-26}$ in the [128, 200] Hz band, which is within the most sensible frequency band of the LIGO detectors.</description>

      <title>Extraction of gravitational wave signals from LISA data in the presence of artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission is being developed by ESA with NASA participation. As it has recently passed the Mission Adoption milestone, models of the instruments and noise performance are becoming more detailed, and likewise prototype data analyses must as well. Assumptions such as Gaussianity, stationarity, and data continuity are unrealistic, and must be replaced with physically motivated data simulations, and data analysis methods adapted to accommodate such likely imperfections. To this end, the LISA Data Challenges have produced datasets featuring time-varying and unequal constellation armlength, and measurement artifacts including data interruptions and instrumental transients. In this work, we assess the impact of these data artifacts on the inference of Galactic Binary and Massive Black Hole properties. Our analysis shows that the treatment of noise transients and gaps is necessary for effective parameter estimation, as they substantially corrupt the analysis if unmitigated. We find that straightforward mitigation techniques can significantly if imperfectly suppress artifacts. For the Galactic Binaries, mitigation of glitches was essentially total, while mitigations of the data gaps increased parameter uncertainty by approximately 10%. For the Massive Black Hole binaries the particularly pernicious glitches resulted in a 30% uncertainty increase after mitigations, while the data gaps can increase parameter uncertainty by up to several times. Critically, this underlines the importance of early detection of transient gravitational waves to ensure they are protected from planned data interruptions.</description>

Abstract: Different stellar populations may be identified through differences in chemical, kinematic, and chronological properties, suggesting the interplay of various physical mechanisms that led to their origin and subsequent evolution. As such, the identification of stellar populations is key for gaining insight into the evolutionary history of the Milky Way galaxy. This task is complicated by the fact that stellar populations share significant overlap in their chrono-chemo-kinematic properties, hindering efforts to identify and define stellar populations. Our goal is to offer a novel and effective methodology that can provide deeper insight into the nonlinear and nonparametric properties of the multidimensional physical parameters that define stellar populations. For this purpose we explore the ability of manifold learning to differentiate stellar populations with minimal assumptions about their number and nature. Manifold learning is an unsupervised machine learning technique that seeks to intelligently identify and disentangle manifolds hidden within the input data. To test this method, we make use of Gaia DR3-like synthetic stellar samples generated from the FIRE-2 cosmological simulations. These represent red-giant stars constrained by asteroseismic data from TESS. We reduce the 5-dimensional input chrono-chemo-kinematic parameter space into 2-dimensional latent space embeddings generated by manifold learning. We then study these embeddings to assess how accurately they represent the original data and whether they contain meaningful information that can be used to discern stellar populations. We conclude that manifold learning possesses promising abilities to differentiate stellar populations when considering realistic observational constraints.</description>
