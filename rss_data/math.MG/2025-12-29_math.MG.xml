      <title>Finite Groups of Random Walks in the Quarter Plane and Periodic $4$-bar Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve two long standing open problems, one from probability theory formulated by Malyshev in 1970 and another one from a crossroad of geometry and dynamics, going back to Darboux in 1879. The Malyshev problem is of finding effective, explicit necessary and sufficient conditions in the closed form to characterize all random walks in the quarter plane with a finite group of the random walk of order $2n$, for all $n\ge 2$, in the generic case where the underlining biquadratic is an elliptic curve. Until now, the results were known only for $n=2, 3, 4$ and were obtained using ad-hoc methods developed separately for each of the three cases. We provide a method that solves the problem for all $n$ and in a unified way. We also consider situations with singular biquadratics. Further, we establish a new two-way relationship between \emph{diagonal} random walks in the quarter plane and $4$-bar links. We describe all $n$-periodic Darboux transformations for $4$-bar link problems for all $n\ge 2$, thus completely solving the Darboux problem, that he solved for $n=2$. We introduce \emph{$k$ semi-periodicity} as a novel and natural type of periodicity of the Darboux transformations, where after $k$ iterations of the Darboux transformation, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one, but of opposite orientation. By introducing new objects, \emph{the secondary $(2-2)$-correspondence} and the related \emph{secondary cubic} of the centrally-symmetric biquadratics, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for $k$-semi-periodicity for $4$-bar links for all $k\ge 2$ in an explicit closed form.</description>

      <title>Spectral selections, commutativity preservation and Coxeter-Lipschitz maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system whose graph is connected, with no infinite edges. A self-map $\tau$ of $W$ such that $\tau_{\sigma\theta}\in \{\tau_{\theta},\ \sigma\tau_{\theta}\}$ for all $\theta\in W$ and all reflections $\sigma$ (analogous to being 1-Lipschitz with respect to the Bruhat order on $W$) is either constant or a right translation. A somewhat stronger version holds for $S_n$, where it suffices that $\sigma$ range over smaller, $\theta$-dependent sets of reflections.
  These combinatorial results have a number of consequences concerning continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps $\mathrm{SU}(n)\to M_n$ defined on special unitary groups: every such map is a conjugation composed with (a) the identity; (b) transposition, or (c) a continuous diagonal spectrum selection. This parallels and recovers Petek's analogous statement for self-maps of the space $H_n\le M_n$ of self-adjoint matrices, strengthening it slightly by expanding the codomain to $M_n$.</description>
