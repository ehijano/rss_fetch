      <title>On the Run from the Dark Side of the Muon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis strategy for probing physics beyond the Standard Model via modifications to the parton distribution functions (PDFs) in a muon beam, which measurably alter the kinematics of all hard processes at a future muon collider. High-energy muon colliders represent an opportunity to probe new physics using precision measurements and novel search strategies. At sufficiently high energies, light particles act as ``constituents'' of the muon described by PDFs. As a concrete case study, we apply this framework to an $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ gauge boson and demonstrate that, for masses in the range of approximately 50--100 GeV, this indirect PDF-based approach outperforms traditional searches relying on direct gauge boson production. These results highlight muon PDF probes as a powerful and promising avenue for beyond the Standard Model physics searches at a future muon collider.</description>

      <title>Probing Ultralight Dark Matter at the Mega-Planck Scale with the Thorium Nuclear Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter is expected to induce oscillations of nuclear parameters. These oscillations are characterized by extremely weak couplings or high suppression scales, with the Planck scale - the characteristic scale of quantum gravity - serving as a natural benchmark. Probing this phenomenon requires systems with exceptional sensitivity to shifts in nuclear energies. The uniquely low-energy nuclear isomeric transition in ${}^{229}$Th provides such sensitivity: it directly probes the nuclear interaction and, owing to a near cancellation between electromagnetic and nuclear contributions, its response to changes in nuclear structure is greatly amplified. We devise and perform a new type of ultrasensitive search for dark matter which uses the precision nuclear spectroscopy at JILA to set the strongest bounds in the mass range $10^{-21}\,{\rm eV} \lesssim m_{\rm DM} \lesssim 10^{-19}\,{\rm eV}$. Our results probe effective interaction scales exceeding $10^6$ times the Planck scale (the Mega-Planck scale) and establish the ${}^{229}$Th system as the leading probe of dark matter couplings to the nuclear sector.</description>

      <title>Rescuing Overabundant Dark Matter with a Strongly First Order Phase Transition in the Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dark sector consisting of fermionic dark matter (DM) charged under a broken dark $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry, interacting with the Standard Model through kinetic mixing. In such models, the DM annihilation cross section is typically suppressed by the small kinetic mixing and or a heavy mediator, often leading to an overabundant relic density. We show that the observed DM abundance can be achieved if the dark Higgs undergoes a strong first order phase transition after DM freeze-out. In this scenario, the relic abundance is set by thermal freeze-out in the symmetric phase and subsequently reduced by entropy injection from the phase transition, rather than by annihilation in the broken phase. We find that to reproduce the observed relic abundance, the required phase transition is generically supercooled. The resulting stochastic gravitational wave signal lies within the sensitivity of future experiments, providing a complementary probe of this framework. Moreover, a strongly supercooled phase transition can potentially account for the NANOGrav signal for DM masses below $O(10)$ GeV.</description>

      <title>New Physics and Symmetry Tests with Polarized Photon Fusion and Dipole Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss new-physics searches and symmetry tests with dipole moments, emphasizing the role of polarization observables. As a primary benchmark, we consider polarized photon fusion in the $e^+ e^-$ environment of the Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) and study $\gamma \gamma \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ in the nearly back-to-back region, where a transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) description provides a convenient framework for organizing polarization effects. We show that linearly polarized photons induce characteristic azimuthal asymmetries in the $\tau^+ \tau^-$ kinematics, enabling polarization-based observables that enhance sensitivity to the $\tau$ electromagnetic dipole form factors. Moreover, $CP$-even and $CP$-odd dipole interactions can be disentangled through distinct angular structures, offering a systematic path to probe $\tau$ dipole moments with improved precision at future lepton colliders. As an illustration, we obtain an improved $2\sigma$ reach on the anomalous magnetic dipole moment, $-4.6 \times 10^{-3} &lt; \mathrm{Re}(a_\tau) &lt; 7.0 \times 10^{-3}$, reaching a precision level close to the Standard Model expectation. To place these prospects in a broader context, we briefly summarize the experimental status of dipole-moment measurements across different fermionic systems and highlight their complementarity in constraining new physics. We illustrate this interplay with supersymmetric scenarios featuring $R$-parity violation, in which loop-induced dipole moments provide correlated probes of $CP$-conserving and $CP$-violating interactions. Taken together, polarized photon fusion and precision dipole measurements constitute a coherent program for testing fundamental symmetries and exploring physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Relativistic corrections to gluon fragmentation into the $^3P_{J}^{[1,8]}$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute relativistic corrections to the gluon fragmentation functions to ${}^3P_J^{[1,8]}$ Fock states of heavy quarkonium within non-relativistic QCD factorization framework. We find that, at $\mathcal{O}(v^2)$ sub-leading order, the $S$-$D$ mixing effect must be taken into account to absorb the infrared divergence of spin-triplet $P$-wave production within full QCD into the NRQCD long-distance matrix elements. Unlike the $S$-wave case, we find that the short-distance coefficients of the fragmentation functions at leading and sub-leading order are no longer proportional to each other. However, upon convolution with the gluon production cross section, their ratios are almost constant across the whole $p_T$ region. We find the relativistic corrections to be negative and substantial, which makes them a non-negligible ingredient in the study of $J/\psi$ production at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Regge trajectories for the doubly heavy triquarks $((Qq)\bar{Q}')$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We attempt to apply the Regge trajectory approach to the doubly heavy triquarks $((Qq)\bar{Q}^{\prime})$ $(Q,\,Q'=b,\,c; q=u,\,d,\,s)$. We propose the Regge trajectory relations for the doubly heavy triquarks, and then employ them to crudely estimate the spectra of the triquarks $((cu)\bar{c})$, $((cu)\bar{b})$, $((cs)\bar{c})$, $((cs)\bar{b})$, $((bu)\bar{c})$, $((bu)\bar{b})$, $((bs)\bar{c})$, and $((bs)\bar{b})$. The $\lambda$-trajectories and the $\rho$-trajectories are investigated. The triquark Regge trajectory becomes a new and very simple approach for estimating the spectra of triquarks. It also provides a simple method to investigate the $\rho$-mode and $\sigma$-mode excitations of pentaquarks and hexaquarks in the triquark picutre. Moreover, the spin-averaged masses of the ground states of pentaquarks $(\bar{c}(cu))(cu)$, $(\bar{b}(bu))(bu)$ and $(\bar{c}(cu))(bu)$ are estimated, which are consistent with other theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Decoding the near-threshold $X_{0,\,1}(4140)$ and $X_{1}(4685)$ states via OZI-suppressed coupled-channel scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To decode the near-threshold dynamics of the $X_{0,\,1}(4140)$ and $X_{1}(4685)$ states, we investigate the OZI-suppressed $\{D_{s}\bar{D}_{s},\, J/\psi \phi,\, D_{s}^{\ast}\bar{D}_{s}^{\ast}\}$ coupled-channel scattering in $B\to D_{s}\bar{D}_{s} K$ decays using the effective range expansion. We demonstrate that the $X_{0}(4140)$, associated with a dip in the lineshape, corresponds to a dynamically generated pole near the $J/\psi \phi$ threshold. The single-channel $J/\psi \phi$ scattering length is extracted to be $1.11\pm 0.65\,\rm{fm}$, yielding an effective scattering length of $0.12^{+0.20}_{-0.10}+i0.78^{+0.20}_{-0.40} \, \rm{fm}$ when coupled channels are included. By treating the spin-spin interaction as a subleading effect, we predict a $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ virtual state near the $J/\psi \phi$ threshold, which naturally resolves the empirical ambiguities surrounding the $X_{1}(4140)$ width. Extending this framework via heavy quark spin symmetry, we further interpret the $X_{1}(4685)$ as a $\psi(2S)\phi$ hadronic molecule. Ultimately, these findings highlight how the $X(4140)$ family and $X_{1}(4685)$ serve as unique theoretical windows into the Fierz rearrangement and OZI suppression mechanisms in low-energy strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Strangeness is the key: from $\bar{K}N$ to $\bar{D}_s D K$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kaon, the lightest hadron containing a strangeness quark, is very peculiar. It is a Nambu-Goldstone boson, but significantly heavier than the pion. As a result, its interaction with a matter particle, such as the nucleon or a heavy-light meson, such as the $D$ meson, is completely determined by chiral dynamics and much stronger than its pion cousin. The strong attractive interaction has brought us many surprises and is manifested in the peculiar nature of many particles, such as the mysterious $\Lambda(1405)$ and $D_{s0}^*(2317)$. These two particles can be understood as $\bar{K}N$ and $DK$ hadronic molecules, respectively. They also imply the existence of three-body hadronic molecules that await future discovery. In this talk, I review some recent developments in our understanding of hadronic interactions involving the kaon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the possibility of detecting the existence of mirror matter, a possible component of dark matter, through neutron interferometry. We develop an interferometer using bandpass multilayers in reflection and transmission geometry and discuss its advantages and limitations. We demonstrate that our setup can probe a considerable range of neutron-mirror neutron mixing parameters allowing us to show the existence of mirror matter using present day neutron sources based on fission or spallation processes.</description>

      <title>Tri-Resonant Leptogenesis in a Non-Holomorphic Modular A$_4$ Scotogenic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate low-scale baryogenesis \textit{via} tri-resonant leptogenesis within the scotogenic model with a scalar dark matter embedded in non-holomorphic modular $A_4$ symmetry framework. The model naturally accommodates three nearly degenerate right-handed (RH) neutrinos when they are assigned to the triplet representation of $A_4$. The near degeneracy originates from treating the symmetric contribution to the Majorana mass matrix, arising from the $\mathbf{3}\otimes\mathbf{3}$ decomposition of $A_4$, as a small perturbation to the dominant singlet contribution. Generalized CP (gCP) symmetry is imposed in the model, rendering the complex modulus $\tau$ as the sole source of CP violation. In particular, for the inverted hierarchy (IH), the predicted $3\sigma$ range of $\theta_{23}$ lies in the lower octant close to maximal value while CP phase $\delta_{\mathrm{CP}}$ and the Majorana phase $\alpha_{21}$ are predicted to lie close to $0^\circ$ or $360^\circ$. Also, in this case, predicted values of $m_{ee}$ and $\sum_i m_i$ can be tested and constrained by future neutrinoless double beta decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$ experiments, as well as by cosmological observations, particularly DESI+BAO and Planck data. In fact DESI+BAO disallows IH in the model. We further show that successful baryogenesis can be achieved for both normal hierarchy (NH) and inverted hierarchy (IH) of light neutrino masses with RH neutrino masses as low as $537~\mathrm{GeV}$ rendering this scenario experimentally testable. For NH, RH neutrino mass degeneracy of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-7}\!-\!10^{-6})$ is required, while for IH a stronger degeneracy of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-8})$ is needed. Remarkably, in the NH case, successful baryogenesis can occur even in the deep washout regime with decay parameters of $\mathcal{O}(10^{5})$ owing to the tri-resonant enhancement of the CP asymmetry and the inclusion of flavor effects.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Dark Matter Detection with a Ferromagnet Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A levitated ferromagnet provides an exceptionally sensitive probe of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) through measuring weak magnetic-like field signals. We propose a ferromagnet lattice magnetometer that coherently combines multiple levitated ferromagnets to enhance effective sensitivity. By replacing a single ferromagnet with a lattice, we increase the total polarized spin while preserving the intrinsic dynamical response of each constituent ferromagnet. We show that magnetic dipole-dipole interactions within the lattice can be dynamically suppressed through a high-frequency magnetic field, rendering the system effectively noninteracting, at the cost of only a moderate reduction in signal amplitude due to the distinct renormalization of linear and quadratic spin responses. We analyze the noise properties of the lattice and demonstrate that collective readout leads to favorable scaling with the number of ferromagnets. Interpreted in terms of axion-electron, dark photon, and axion-photon couplings, our results yield projected sensitivities that significantly exceed existing single-ferromagnet implementations. In particular, for axion-photon interactions, we find a nontrivial lattice-induced enhancement of the signal itself, leading to sensitivities that surpass existing constraints over a broad mass range.</description>

      <title>Toward Precision Helicity PDFs from Global DIS and SIDIS Fits with Projected EIC Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new global determination of the helicity-dependent parton distribution functions (PDFs) of the proton, based on inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive DIS (SIDIS) data within a consistent next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD framework. In addition to existing measurements, we incorporate simulated pseudodata for the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), considering two beam-energy configurations, $E_e \times E_p = 5 \times 41~\mathrm{GeV^2}$ and $18 \times 275~\mathrm{GeV^2}$, corresponding to an extended kinematic reach down to $x \sim 10^{-5}$. We focus on longitudinal double-spin asymmetries $A_1^h$ for charge-separated pion and kaon production in SIDIS off a longitudinally polarized proton target. These projected measurements significantly improve the flavor separation of sea-quark polarized PDFs ($\Delta \bar{u}$, $\Delta \bar{d}$, $\Delta s$) and reduce the uncertainties on both quark and gluon helicity distributions, with the largest impact at small $x$. Polarized PDFs are extracted using a neural-network parametrization and a Monte Carlo replica methodology to propagate experimental uncertainties, while theoretical constraints such as positivity are imposed during the fit. We demonstrate that the inclusion of EIC pseudodata leads to a substantially more precise determination of polarized PDFs, with the largest impact in the small-$x$ region. The resulting polarized PDF sets are provided in the {\tt LHAPDF} format.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration effects onto the meson spectrum from a Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light meson spectra are studied in a Dyson-Schwinger/Bethe-Salpeter approach to QCD. By varying the interaction strength of three sets of models for the quark-antiquark interaction, the transition from the chiral symmetric to the chirally broken regime in the vacuum is studied. The simplest type of these models leads to degenerate meson spectra for a large domain of the strength parameter. The more sophisticated and thus more realistic models show significantly smaller parameter domains for which degenerate meson spectra are obtained. The underlying mechanism for obtaining and then lifting degeneracies is traced back to the location of the quark propagators' poles, in particular, whether they are beyond or within the domain of integration in the Bethe-Salpeter equation. In view of this mechanism the potential relation of the obtained degeneracies to the dynamical emergence of symmetries is discussed, adding thereby another point of view on the conjectured chiral spin symmetry of QCD in the temperature domain right above the crossover.</description>

      <title>Neutral Scalar Signatures at a Muon Collider in the $Z_3$ symmetric Three Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending the scalar sector of the Standard Model is a well-motivated approach to exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we investigate the phenomenology of the Three Higgs Doublet Model at a future muon collider. The scalar spectrum of the 3HDM comprises three CP-even Higgs bosons, two CP-odd Higgs bosons, and a pair of charged Higgs states. Focusing on Higgs pair production via muon-antimuon annihilation, we study the production and decay of neutral scalar states through the process $\mu^+\mu^- \to \phi_i \phi_j$, assuming a mass hierarchy in which the SM-like CP-even Higgs is the lightest state. We analyze several benchmark scenarios leading to $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$ and $b\bar{b}t\bar{t}$ final states, and perform a cut-and-count analysis at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=3$ TeV. Our results demonstrate that a future muon collider provides a sensitive and promising environment to probe extended Higgs sectors, with neutral scalar states in the mass range of $200-400$ GeV being discoverable with $5\sigma$ significance for integrated luminosities of $\mathcal{O}(1-4 \ \mathrm{ab}^{-1})$.</description>

      <title>Hyperon longitudinal polarization and vector meson spin alignment in a thermal model for heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of a common local spin equilibrium for both spin-1/2 and spin-1 particles is incorporated into a thermal model of particle production in heavy-ion collisions at the top RHIC energies. We show that an effective spin polarization tensor leading to a correct description of the longitudinal spin polarization of $\Lambda$ hyperons simultaneously yields a positive alignment of vector mesons ($\phi$ and $K^{*0}$) that grows monotonically with transverse momentum and centrality. Similar trends can be seen in the data, suggesting a possible common mechanism for longitudinal spin polarization and alignment. However, model calculations are insufficient to explain the data in a fully quantitative way. The correlation found between the magnitude of the $\Lambda$ longitudinal polarization and vector meson alignment suggests further more elaborate investigations of this issue.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative effects and soft-gluon dynamics in low-$p_T$ Drell-Yan production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse-momentum spectrum of Drell-Yan lepton pairs at small $p_T$ probes non-perturbative QCD effects, including intrinsic partonic transverse momentum and initial-state soft-gluon radiation. The novel approach PDF2ISR is employed to study the transverse-momentum spectrum of Drell-Yan lepton pairs in the small-$p_T(\ell\ell)$ region. This framework is particularly well suited for such investigations, as it provides a systematic treatment of the dominant non-perturbative effects and their interplay. In order to extract robust physical conclusions, a detailed analysis of the technical aspects involved in the simulation of the intrinsic transverse momenta of partons inside the proton, as well as the remnant recoil schemes, was carried out. Furthermore, different approaches for the treatment of the strong coupling at low scales were investigated and confronted with available experimental data. This comparison enabled an assessment of the sensitivity of the experimental measurements to the chosen low-scale behaviour of $\alpha_s$.</description>

      <title>Compact Representation of Particle-Collision Events for Physics-Informed Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a compact, physics-driven event representation, RMM-C46, designed to compress the high-dimensional rapidity mass matrix (RMM) into a low-dimensional, interpretable feature set suitable for physics-informed machine learning (ML) and quantum computing applications. The full RMM encodes detailed pairwise correlations among jets, b-jets, leptons, photons, and missing transverse energy but contains more than a thousand values per event, making it computationally heavy for large-scale training and incompatible with current low-qubit quantum devices. The proposed RMM-C46 input space for ML preserves the physical block structure of the RMM through aggregated invariant mass, rapidity difference, and transverse energy components, reducing the size of the original RMM by over an order of magnitude while maintaining interpretability. Applied to simulated proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV, these representations match or exceed the discriminative performance of the full RMM in both supervised and unsupervised ML tasks. Their compactness, stability, and physics transparency also make them naturally compatible with near-term quantum machine learning architectures. RMM-C46 provides a scalable, efficient, and quantum-ready alternative to the full RMM for next-generation collider physics analyses.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes: Probing ultralight axion-like particles with quantum technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the physics of ultralight axion-like particles (ALPs) as dark matter candidates and the experimental strategies used to search for them with precision and quantum technologies. In the ultralight regime, the enormous occupation number of the dark matter field motivates a classical description in terms of a coherently oscillating background, leading to distinctive, time-dependent signatures in laboratory observables. We discuss the effective field theory framework governing ALP interactions with Standard Model fields, and show how different operators give rise to qualitatively different experimental signals. The lecture notes cover both conversion-based searches enabled by the axion-photon coupling, such as haloscopes and helioscopes, and precision experiments sensitive to oscillations of fundamental constants and material properties. These include atomic and nuclear clocks, optical cavities, laser and unequal time-delay interferometers, and mechanical or solid state resonators. Emphasis is placed on the physical origin of the sensitivity of each platform, the role of coherence, bandwidth, and noise, and the complementarity between different technologies across a wide range of ALP masses. Together, these approaches provide broad and overlapping coverage of ultralight dark matter parameter space and define a rapidly evolving experimental programme with strong discovery potential.</description>

      <title>Stochastic galactic supernova flux of semi-relativistic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New exotic particles with MeV masses, such as axion-like particles or light dark matter, can be emitted from core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with semi-relativistic velocities. Due to their speed dispersion, they would arrive at Earth as an extended packet with a time spread that can be as large as tens of millennia for typical detectors. It has been argued in the literature that the superposition of packets from all galactic SNe would give rise to a smooth and stationary diffuse flux that could be observable on terrestrial experiments. In this article, we critically examine this hypothesis by carrying out a numerical simulation of the galactic history of SN explosions. We show that, although the particle packets do overlap, due to the short observational time window, each of them only contributes with a very narrow range of energies and with an intensity that depends on the SN distance. As a consequence, the energy dependence of the resulting flux is extremely sensitive to the stochastic nature of the SN population and far from smooth. This has profound implications for the expected signature in terrestrial experiments, which displays a spectral shape that is not properly described by the smooth approximation. We develop a numerical tool to compute this stochastic galactic flux for generic semi-relativistic particles, which also allows us to explore sub-MeV particles, where the smooth diffuse flux approach does not hold. To test this framework, we revisit existing bounds on axion-like particles and fermionic dark matter, finding weaker constraints than previously reported.</description>

      <title>Light dark sector via thermal decays of Dark Matter: the case of a 17 MeV particle coupled to electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental observations, most notably those reported by the ATOMKI and Positron Annihilation into Dark Matter Experiment (PADME) collaborations, have hinted anomalies that may indicate the presence of a new resonance with a mass around $17\,\text{MeV}$, potentially interacting with both nucleons and electrons. Since 2020, ATOMKI has observed this resonance in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states in ${}^{8}\mathrm{Be}$, ${}^{4}\mathrm{He}$, and ${}^{12}\mathrm{C}$. More recently, in 2025, PADME, operating at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati, has also hinted a similar excess, in this case in the $e^{+}e^{-}$ final-state events originating from positron annihilation on fixed-target atomic electrons of Carbonium. This concordance strengthens the case for a common underlying origin, potentially involving a new boson, conventionally referred to as $X_{17}$.
  Despite these intriguing developments, the global experimental landscape remains highly dynamic, particularly in light of recent MEG~II constraints, and a definitive confirmation or exclusion of the $X_{17}$ hypothesis is still lacking. Within this evolving and exciting context, this thesis investigates whether a hypothetical $17\,\text{MeV}$ particle, coupled to electrons as suggested by the PADME observations, could function as a mediator between the Standard Model and previously unexplored hidden sectors. Such a mediator could, in principle, offer a novel pathway toward addressing one of the principal outstanding inconsistencies of the Standard Model: the nature and origin of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the one-loop calculation of the Higgs mass spectrum of the scale-invariant THDM, relying on a direct calculation of the relevant Feynman diagrams. We highlight a number of incorrect assumptions in earlier calculations that relied on the effective-potential approach. In contrast with the earlier findings, we show that the one-loop corrections can have an effect of ${\cal O}(10\%)$ on the predictions for the BSM-Higgs masses, and they can also induce non-negligible mixing between the SM-like and BSM states in the neutral-scalar sector.</description>

      <title>Testing the cosmic distance-duality relation with localized fast radio bursts: a cosmological model-independent study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the Etherington cosmic distance-duality relation (CDDR), by comparing Type Ia supernova (SNIa) luminosity-distance information from the Pantheon+ compilation with an angular-diameter-distance reconstructed from localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). The core of our methodology is a data-driven reconstruction from FRBs using artificial neural networks (ANNs): we infer a smooth mean extragalactic dispersion-measure relation and use its redshift derivative to recover $H(z)$ and hence $D_\mathrm{A}^{\rm FRB}(z)$ without assuming a parametric form for the expansion history. Possible deviations from CDDR are parameterized through three one-parameter models of $\eta(z)\equiv D_\mathrm{L}/[(1+z)^2D_\mathrm{A}]$. We implement two complementary likelihoods: (i) a direct approach using individual SNIa with the full Pantheon+ covariance, and (ii) a machine-learning approach in which we reconstruct the SN Hubble diagram on the FRB redshift grid, propagating SN and FRB uncertainties into non-diagonal covariance matrices via Monte Carlo and bootstrap realizations. Within the FRB reconstruction, we anchor the mean extragalactic dispersion measure at $z=0$, which yields a data-driven constraint on the average host/near-source contribution $\mathrm{DM}_{\rm host}=128.8\pm 34.1\,\mathrm{pc\,cm^{-3}}$ ($3\sigma$ of statistical confidence). We find that both likelihood implementations give consistent posteriors and no statistically significant evidence for departures from CDDR at the current precision.</description>

      <title>Breit corrections to moderately charged ions in all-orders calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The atomic properties of heavy, moderately-charged ions are important for a wide variety of applications, including precision tests of fundamental physics and for the study and development of atomic and nuclear clocks. In these systems it is known that relativistic effects, such as the Breit interaction and radiative quantum electrodynamics corrections, are important for an accurate understanding of atomic properties. It is also known that inclusion of correlations alongside the Breit effect is crucial. In this work we include the Breit interaction into all-orders calculations of energy levels and fine structure intervals of ions in the Cs and Fr isoelectronic sequences. This requires modifying the electron Green's function to account for Breit within the all-orders correlation potential method, which sums dominating series of perturbation diagrams exactly using a Feynman diagram technique. We find that Breit corrections to the energies of moderately ionized ions along these sequences are very large, particularly for the f states. We also observe a significant deviation from experiment for these levels. Incorporating Breit into the all-orders correlation potential provides a significant additional contribution beyond including Breit at the second-order level alone. While this does not resolve the disagreement in the energy levels, it does substantially improve the fine-structure intervals beyond what is achieved by including Breit only at second order. Furthermore, we include the frequency-dependent Breit interaction into the Dirac-Fock procedure, and find that this does not significantly modify the energy levels at this order of approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transverse momentum spectra ($p_T$) and elliptic flow ($v_2$) of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, $p$, and $\bar{p}$ produced in peripheral Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 7.7$, 11.5, 19.6, 27, and 39 GeV in the Beam Energy Scan (BES) Program at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The analysis is carried out within an expanding elliptic fire-cylinder model that incorporates longitudinal expansion and anisotropic transverse flow. Particle production at kinetic freeze-out is obtained using a local equilibrium distribution function with a blast-wave-like fluid velocity profile derived from the expansion dynamics of the elliptic fire-cylinder. The model parameters governing the collective expansion are first constrained by fitting the midrapidity $p_T$ spectra of $\pi^{\pm}$ and are then applied, without further adjustment, to $K^{\pm}$, $p$, and $\bar{p}$. The model provides a consistent description of the $p_T$ spectra and reproduces the qualitative behavior of the elliptic flow for all considered particle species.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational data in cosmology indicate a small, positive, and nonvanishing cosmological constant that dominates the energy budget of the present universe. The origin of the cosmological constant from a quantum perspective remains unresolved, with a discrepancy of approximately 120 orders of magnitude between its observed value and theoretical estimates. Motivated by earlier work of Gibbons, we analyze the cosmological constant problem within a quantum-gravitational framework based on Schwarzian theory and its ensemble averaging. We then derive the phenomenological value of the dark energy density and obtain the corresponding equation of state. In this model, the cosmological constant arises from the ensemble average of time-reparametrization modes.</description>

Abstract: In this work we investigate several phenomenological and technical aspects related to electroweak (EW) corrections at a high-energy muon collider, focusing on direct production processes (no VBF configurations). We study in detail the accuracy of the Sudakov approximation, in particular the Denner-Pozzorini algorithm, comparing it with exact calculations at NLO EW accuracy. We also assess the relevance of resumming EW Sudakov logarithms (EWSL) at 3 and 10 TeV collisions. Furthermore, we scrutinise the impact of additional Heavy Boson Radiation (HBR), namely the weak emission of $W, Z$, and Higgs bosons in inclusive and semi-inclusive configurations. All results are obtained via the fully automated and publicly available code MadGraph5_aMC@NLO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present higher-order results for $s$-channel single-top-quark production that are derived from soft-gluon resummation. I show that the soft-gluon corrections provide the dominant contribution to the QCD corrections, and that they approximate very well the exact results through NNLO. Furthermore, approximate N$^3$LO corrections are computed by using the expansion of the resummed cross section to third order in the strong coupling. The calculation treats the final-state $b$-quarks as massless but I also show how to extend the formalism to the case of massive $b$-quarks. The higher-order corrections are large at LHC energies and they improve the theoretical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Early Universe production of $W$ bosons in neutrino decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study, via perturbative methods, the rates of production of $W$ bosons emitted in neutrino decays during the early stages of the Universe. We compute the transition amplitude corresponding to the first order of de Sitter electroweak perturbation theory and study its various limiting cases. The transition rates are derived using minimal subtraction and dimensional regularization. In the end we attempt to obtain the density number of $W$ bosons produced in perturbative transitions in de Sitter spacetime, using the rates obtained in this paper and in previous ones, and analyze the density number with respect to the particle momenta and renormalisation mass $\mu$.</description>

      <title>DeepQuark: A Deep-Neural-Network Approach to Multiquark Bound States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the first time, we implement the deep-neural-network-based variational Monte Carlo approach for the multiquark bound states, whose complexity surpasses that of electron or nucleon systems due to strong SU(3) color interactions. We design a novel and high-efficiency architecture, DeepQuark, to address the unique challenges in multiquark systems such as stronger correlations, extra discrete quantum numbers, and intractable confinement interaction. Our method demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion Monte Carlo and Gaussian expansion method, in the nucleon, doubly heavy tetraquark, and fully heavy tetraquark systems. Notably, it outperforms existing calculations for pentaquarks, exemplified by the triply heavy pentaquark. For the nucleon, we successfully incorporate three-body flux-tube confinement interactions without additional computational costs. In tetraquark systems, we consistently describe hadronic molecule $T_{cc}$ and compact tetraquark $T_{bb}$ with an unbiased form of wave function ansatz. In the pentaquark sector, we obtain weakly bound $\bar D^*\Xi_{cc}^*$ molecule $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ with $S=\frac{5}{2}$ and its bottom partner $P_{bb\bar b}(15569)$. They can be viewed as the analogs of the molecular $T_{cc}$. We recommend experimental search of $P_{cc\bar c}(5715)$ in the D-wave $J/\psi \Lambda_c$ channel. DeepQuark holds great promise for extension to larger multiquark systems, overcoming the computational barriers in conventional methods. It also serves as a powerful framework for exploring confining mechanism beyond two-body interactions in multiquark states, which may offer valuable insights into nonperturbative QCD and general many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson effects in an interacting hadron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The universality of electric charge as a quantum number allows thermoelectric properties to manifest across diverse systems, starting from a hot quantum chromodynamic matter in heavy-ion collisions at a high energy scale to semiconductors in condensed matter systems at a low energy scale. In this work, we explore the emergence of magneto-transport phenomena, specifically the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson effects, in a hot and dense hadronic medium produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider energies. These phenomena arise due to the combined influence of temperature gradients and non-zero baryon chemical potential, particularly in the presence of an external magnetic field. Using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation, we analyze the behavior of the hadronic medium considering different frameworks of hadron resonance gas models. The presence of external magnetic fields breaks the isotropy of the thermoelectric transport coefficient matrix, giving rise to new components of the Thomson coefficient, namely, magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients. For the first time, we estimate the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients, which originate from the temperature dependence of the magneto-Seebeck coefficient and Nernst coefficient, respectively, in hadron gas under the influence of a static and time-varying magnetic field. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the higher-order thermoelectric properties of the hot and dense hadronic medium in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: We present a computation of diboson production in the $W^\pm Z$ channel at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), incorporating leptonic decays of the gauge bosons and considering intermediate gauge bosons with definite polarization states. The analysis includes contributions from the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT) and is carried out at next-to-leading order accuracy in QCD, matched to a parton-shower simulation. Our implementation allows for the selection of specific helicity configurations, both in the Standard Model and in the presence of dimension-six operators inducing anomalous triple-gauge-boson couplings. This work provides a key ingredient for both polarization-template and quantum-tomography analyses of diboson systems at the LHC within the SMEFT framework.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures from Lepton Number Breaking Phase Transitions with Flat Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensions of the Standard Model typically contain ``flaton fields" defined as fields with large vacuum expectation values and almost flat potentials where scalar self-coupling is small or vanishes at tree level. Such potentials have been used to drive a secondary inflationary epoch after a primary phase of inflation, in what are called thermal inflation models. Although the primordial, high-scale inflationary epoch can solve the horizon and flatness problems, it does not always resolve difficulties associated with late-time relics produced in extensions of the Standard Model. These relics typically decay too late, injecting entropy and energetic particles that spoil successful predictions like Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. It is here that thermal inflation plays a crucial role: diluting unwanted relics by many orders of magnitude without erasing the baryon asymmetry or the large-scale structure set up by the earlier phase of inflation. The preferred scale for this phenomenon is in the range $10^6-10^8$ GeV if one considers supergravity, but without it, any scale above the EW scale is valid. We investigate a typical form of these potentials and determine what are the conditions for the potentials to develop a barrier such that when the flatons settle to the true minimum, the associated Gravitational Waves can be observed, focusing on first-order phase transitions from spontaneous lepton number breaking.</description>

      <title>Freeze-in and Freeze-out in a Right-Handed Neutrino Extended MSSM with a Seesaw Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of saturating the relic density bound with light Higgsinos. When the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model is extended with right-handed neutrino superfields and the seesaw scale is very low, right-handed sneutrinos can be produced via the freeze-in mechanism. In such a case we can have essentially two independent sources for dark matter, the traditional freeze-out of Higgsinos and the freeze-in of right-handed sneutrinos. The heavier of these two will decay to the lighter species with a delay. We rule out such a scenario for all seesaw models as the lifetime of sterile neutrinos produced over-abundantly via Dodelson-Widrow mechanism exceeds the age of the universe and will contribute to the relic density.</description>

      <title>Proposal to use laser-accelerated electrons to probe the axion-electron coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The axion is a hypothetical particle associated with a possible solution to the strong CP problem and is a leading candidate for dark matter. In this paper we investigate the emission of axions by accelerated electrons. We find the emission probability and energy within the WKB approximation for an electron accelerated by an electromagnetic field. As an application, we estimate the number of axions produced by electrons accelerated using two counter-propagating high-intensity lasers and discuss how they would be converted to photons to be detected. We find that, under realistic experimental conditions, competitive model-independent bounds on the coupling between the axion and the electron could be achieved in such an experiment.</description>

      <title>Dispersive determination of resonances from $\pi\pi$ scattering data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a precise, model- and parametrization-independent dispersive determination of the $f_0(500)$, $\rho(770)$, $f_0(980)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_0(1370)$, $\rho(1450)$, $f_0(1500)$, and $\rho_3(1690)$ resonance pole parameters. They are obtained from the analytic continuation, by means of continued fractions, of forward dispersion relations, whose input is a recent global dispersive analysis of $\pi \pi$ scattering data. From this dispersive study, we find no indications of other resonant poles below 1.7 GeV. Beyond this energy, we also provide resonance pole parameters from the direct analytic continuation of Global Fits to the three existing incompatible datasets. Depending on the dataset we find poles for the $\rho(1700)$, $f_0(1710)$, $\rho(1900)$, $f_2(1950)$, and $f_0(2020)$ resonances. We also present the Argand diagrams of these Global Fits and illustrate that each resonance does not necessarily have to trace a full circle in the diagram.</description>

Abstract: In this article, the electroweak transition form factors of $\Sigma_b\to\Sigma_c$, $\Xi'_b\to\Xi'_c$ and $\Omega_b\to\Omega_c$ are analyzed within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. In phenomenological side, all possible couplings of interpolating current to hadronic states are considered, and the Dirac structure dependence on the form factors is systematically eliminated. In QCD side, our calculation incorporates both the perturbative part and the contributions from vacuum condensates up to dimension 8. This systematic inclusion of higher-dimensional terms accounts for a broader set of Feynman diagrams, thereby enhancing the comprehensiveness and reliability of the operator product expansion. Using the obtained form factors, we study the partial widths of semileptonic decays $\Sigma_b\to\Sigma_cl\bar{\nu}_l$, $\Xi'_b\to\Xi'_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ and $\Omega_b\to\Omega_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ ($l=e$, $\mu$ and $\tau$). The results indicate that these decay widths approximately satisfy SU(3) flavor symmetry. Next, we calculate the branching ratios for the decay process $\Omega_b\to\Omega_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ and compare them with the results from other collaborations. Furthermore, the lepton universality ratios and some asymmetry parameters of these decay processes are also analyzed, which provide information for the study of new physics. We hope that these results will serve as a useful reference for future theoretical and experimental studies of weak decays involving heavy flavor baryons.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Star Properties with NJL and MFTQCD Model: A Bayesian Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The composition of the core of neutron stars (NS) is still under debate. One possibility is that because of the high densities reached in their cores, matter could be deconfined into quark matter. We investigate the existence of hybrid stars, using microscopic models to describe different phases of matter. Within the adopted microscopic models we calculate properties of NS and properties of matter. We want to probe the pQCD calculations influence and analyze properties that identify a transition to deconfined matter. Bayesian approach is applied to generate 8 sets of equations of state (EOS). A Maxwell construction is adopted to describe the deconfinement transition. For the hadron phase, we consider a stiff and a soft EOS obtained from the Relativistic Mean Field model with nonlinear meson terms. For the quark phase, we use 2 different models: the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with multiquark interactions and the Mean Field Theory of QCD, a model similar to the vector MIT bag model. Bayesian inference was applied to determine the model parameters that satisfy the X-ray observations from NICER and have phase transition at densities between 0.15 - 0.40 fm$^{-3}$. We also applied restrictions from the pQCD calculations to half of the sets. Hybrid stars are compatible with current observational data. The pQCD restrictions reduce the value of the $M_{max}$. However, even applying this restriction, the models were able to reach values of $2.1 - 2.3 M_\odot$. The conformal limit was still not attained at the center of the most massive stars. The vector interactions are essential to describe hybrid stars with a mass above $2 M_\odot$. The multiquark interactions introduced may affect the limits of some quantities considered as indicators of the presence of a deconfined phase. It is possible to find a set of EOS, that predict that inside NS the renormalized matter trace anomaly is always positive.</description>

      <title>Late-blooming magnetars: awakening as long period transients after a dormant cooling epoch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-period transients are an elusive class of compact objects uncovered by radio surveys. While magnetars are a leading candidate for those sources that appear isolated, several observational properties challenge the established evolutionary framework: (i) low quiescent X-ray luminosities, (ii) $\sim$hour-long rotational periods, and (iii) highly-variable radio flux. It is shown via magnetothermal modelling that, if electric currents thread the fluid core at the time of crust freezing, the neutron star remains multiband silent for an initial period of approximately 0.1 Myr while cooling passively. Once the crust becomes cold enough, the Hall effect begins to dominate the magnetic evolution, triggering crustal failures that inject magnetospheric twist that initiates radio pulsing while depleting rotational kinetic energy from an already-slow star. Depending on where electric currents circulate, such 'late-blooming' magnetars manifesting as long-period transients may thus form a distinct branch from soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.</description>

      <title>A Compact Story of Positivity in de Sitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments have yielded significant progress towards systematically understanding loop corrections to de Sitter (dS) correlators. In close analogy with physics in Anti-de Sitter (AdS), large logarithms can result from loops that can be interpreted as corrections to the dimensions of operators. In contrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that the theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent, particularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these issues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral representation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). We review the general arguments that yield positivity constraints on dS correlators from both perspectives. Our particular focus will be on vertex operators for compact scalar fields, since this case introduces novel complications. We will explain how to resolve apparent disagreements between different techniques for calculating the anomalous dimensions for principal series fields coupled to these vertex operators. Along the way, we will offer new proofs of positivity of the anomalous dimensions, and explain why renormalization group flow associated with these anomalous dimensions in SdSET is the same as resumming bubble diagrams in the spectral representation.</description>

      <title>Self-regularized entropy: What does black hole entropy predict for tests of Kerr no-hair theorem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the canonical (brick-wall) entropy of Hawking radiation in a in a quantum black hole model whose strong-field exterior is modeled phenomenologically, to first order in a small quadrupole parameter, by the static q-metric, which is an exact vacuum solution of the Einstein equations. WKB counting of trapped near-horizon cavity modes shows that, within the perturbative small-deformation regime studied here, a modest quadrupolar deformation self-regularizes the ultraviolet divergence: the entropy becomes finite without an ad hoc cutoff. Adopting the Hawking temperature and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass as external thermodynamic inputs, matching this canonical entropy to that benchmark yields an entropy-motivated deformation scale which, when interpreted phenomenologically in a stationary extension, corresponds to percent-to-tens-of-percent violations of the Kerr multipole relations, and provides concrete observational targets for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT), the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and planned third-generation (3G) ground-based gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Gauging the Standard Model 1-form symmetry via gravitational instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fate of the Standard Model (SM) $\mathbb Z_6^{(1)}$ electric $1$-form global symmetry in the background of gravitational instantons, focusing on Eguchi-Hanson (EH) geometries. We show that EH instantons support quantized $\mathbb Z_6^{(1)}$ fluxes localized on their $S^2$ bolt, inducing fractional topological charge without backreacting on the geometry. The requirement that quark and lepton wavefunctions be globally well-defined under parallel transport imposes boundary conditions, removing ill-defined fermion zero modes; the surviving spectrum is confirmed by an explicit solution of the Dirac equation and by the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem. The Euclidean path integral in the EH background can be interpreted as a transition amplitude from an entangled state between two identical halves of space to the vacuum. Summing over all $\mathbb{Z}_6^{(1)}$ flux sectors in the path integral gauges the SM $1$-form symmetry; thus, it cannot persist as an exact global symmetry in the semiclassical limit of gravity. We further show that these fluxes induce baryon- and lepton-number violating processes, which are exponentially suppressed due to the smallness of the hypercharge coupling constant.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Stars with Large Quark Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are interesting objects capable of reaching densities unattainable on Earth. The properties of matter under these conditions remain a mystery. Exotic matter, including quark matter, may be present in the NS core. In this work, we explore the possible compositions of NS cores, in particular, the possible existence of large quark cores. We use the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model with nonlinear terms for the hadron phase and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and Mean Field Theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (MFTQCD) for the quark phase. Through Bayesian inference, we obtain different sets of equations: four sets with hybrid equations and one set with only the hadron phase. We impose constraints regarding the properties of nuclear matter, X-ray observational data from NICER, gravitational wave data from the binary neutron star merger GW170817, perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations, and causality. The MFTQCD allows for a phase transition to quark matter at low densities, just above saturation density, while for the NJL sets, the phase transition occurs above twice the saturation density. As a result, the MFTQCD model predicts the presence of quark matter in the inner core of 1.4 M$_\odot$ NSs, while NJL models suggest a low probability of quark matter in the interior of a 1.4 M$_\odot$ NS. Both models predict the existence of quark matter in 2 M$_\odot$ NSs. The slope of the mass-radius curve has been shown to carry information about the presence of quark matter. In particular, a positive slope at 1.8 M$_\odot$ indicates the presence of non-nucleonic matter. A hybrid star with a stiff quark equation of state could explain a larger radius in more massive stars, such as two solar mass stars, compared to canonical NSs.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flows in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\,\text{GeV}$ with a Skyrme pseudopotential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the lattice Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model, we present a systematic study of proton anisotropic flow observables measured by the HADES collaboration, by utilizing the recently developed density-, momentum- and isospin-dependent N$5$LO Skyrme pseudopotential. In particular, we investigate the impacts of the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials, the stiffness of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) EOS, the high-density behaviors of the symmetry energy and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections on proton $v_{1}$, $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$, and $v_{4}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} = 2.4\,\text{GeV}$. Our results show that the proton anisotropic flows are strongly sensitive to the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potential as well as the incompressibility coefficient $K_0$ of SNM. In addition, the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_2$ exhibits a modest sensitivity to the higher-order skewness coefficient $J_0$ and kurtosis coefficient $I_0$ of SNM as well as the momentum dependence of the symmetry potential, while the transverse momentum dependence of the proton $v_1$ is shown to modestly depend on the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections. Moreover, the high-density symmetry energy seems to have limited effects on the proton anisotropic flows. These findings highlight the necessity of considering the momentum dependence of nucleon mean-field potentials including the symmetry potential, the higher-order characteristic parameters of SNM EOS beyond $K_0$, and the in-medium modification of nucleon-nucleon elastic cross sections, in future Bayesian transport model analyses on proton anisotropic flows in heavy-ion collisions at HADES energies, thereby to extract information on nuclear matter EOS as well as the associated underlying nuclear effective interactions.</description>

      <title>ClearPotential: Revealing Local Dark Matter in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ClearPotential, a data-driven, three-dimensional measurement of the gravitational potential of the local Milky Way using unsupervised machine learning, without the symmetry assumptions, specific functional forms, and binning required in previous work. The potential is modeled as a neural network, optimized to solve the equilibrium collisionless Boltzmann equation for the observed phase space density of Gaia DR3 Red Clump stars within 4 kpc of the Sun. This density is obtained from data using normalizing flows, and our unsupervised solution to the Boltzmann equation automatically corrects for selection effects from crowding and the dust-driven extinction of starlight. Our fully-differentiable model of the gravitational potential allows us to map the acceleration and mass density of the Galaxy in the volume around the Sun, including in the dust-obscured disk towards the Galactic Center. We determine the dark matter density at the Solar radius to be $(0.84 \pm 0.08)\times 10^{-2}\,{M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$, and analyze the structure of the dark matter halo. We find strong evidence for a tilted oblate halo, weak preference for a cored inner profile, and the strongest constraints to date on a possible dark matter disk. We place a bound on the timescale of disequilibrium in the local Milky Way, and find mild evidence for disequilibrium using independent acceleration measurements from timings of binary pulsar systems. This work provides the clearest map of the local Galactic potential to date and marks an important step in the era of data-driven astrometry.</description>

      <title>DAMSA Experiment Conceptual Design White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DAMSA (DArk Messenger Searches at an Accelerator) is a novel short-baseline accelerator experiment aimed at probing short-lived physics processes, including searches for evidence of a dark sector of particle physics and well-motivated Standard Model signals. Motivated by open questions in neutrino physics and the absence of conclusive evidence for conventional weakly interacting massive particles, DAMSA targets MeV-to-sub-GeV dark-sector messengers with feeble couplings that can be produced in abundance at the PIP-II LINAC. By employing an ultra-short baseline of order one meter, DAMSA is uniquely positioned to overcome the beam-dump "ceiling" that limits sensitivity to promptly decaying particles in longer-baseline experiments. The conceptual design emphasizes a beam-dump production scheme combined with a compact detector optimized for rare decays while mitigating intense neutron-induced backgrounds inherent to high-power proton beams. To validate the experimental strategy and detector technologies, the Little DAMSA Path-Finder (LDPF) proof-of-concept experiment is proposed, focusing on axion-like particles decaying to two photons and operating with 300 MeV electron beams at FAST. Successful realization of LDPF will establish the feasibility of the DAMSA approach, enabling a broad and powerful program to explore short-lived new physics and precision Standard Model processes in a previously inaccessible regime. This conceptual design document outlines the technical details of DAMSA's physics goals, the beam facility proposals, key experimental challenges and how to overcome them, and the proposed experimental staging campaigns.</description>
