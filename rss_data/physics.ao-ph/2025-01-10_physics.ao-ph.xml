      <title>Simultaneous emulation and downscaling with physically-consistent deep learning-based regional ocean emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on top of the success in AI-based atmospheric emulation, we propose an AI-based ocean emulation and downscaling framework focusing on the high-resolution regional ocean over Gulf of Mexico. Regional ocean emulation presents unique challenges owing to the complex bathymetry and lateral boundary conditions as well as from fundamental biases in deep learning-based frameworks, such as instability and hallucinations. In this paper, we develop a deep learning-based framework to autoregressively integrate ocean-surface variables over the Gulf of Mexico at $8$ Km spatial resolution without unphysical drifts over decadal time scales and simulataneously downscale and bias-correct it to $4$ Km resolution using a physics-constrained generative model. The framework shows both short-term skills as well as accurate long-term statistics in terms of mean and variability.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric stability sets maximum moist heat and convection in the midlatitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme moist heatwaves pose a serious threat to our society and human health. To manage heat-related risks, it is crucial to improve our understanding of what sets the maximum moist heat. This question has been extensively studied for moist heat in the tropics under the assumption of moist neutrality, but it remains less explored over midlatitude continents, where this assumption is not applicable. The frequent concurrent occurrence of extreme moist heat and intense convection over midlatitude land supports the prevailing hypothesis that deep convection terminates heatwaves and sets their peak intensity. Here a theory is eveloped based on the onset of convection to provide a theoretical prediction for both the maximum near-surface moist heat and potential convection over midlatitude land. Our framework demonstrates that the intensities of moist heat and convection are constrained by a preexisting energy barrier in the lower free troposphere, which suppresses convection and enables the buildup of moist heat and convective instability. This barrier, often marked by a temperature or energy inversion, varies only slightly over time, suggesting the potential to predict maximum intensities of moist heat and convection from predefined lower free tropospheric properties. This framework aligns with the stored-energy nature of deep convection over midlatitude continents, offering insights into understanding the evolution of extreme heat and convection.</description>

      <title>Large eddy simulation of ocean mesoscale eddies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoscale eddies produce lateral (2D) fluxes that need to be parameterized in eddy-permitting (1/4-degree) global ocean models due to insufficient horizontal resolution. Here, we systematically apply methods from the 3D LES community to parameterize lateral vorticity fluxes produced by mesoscale eddies leveraging an explicit filtering approach together with a dynamic procedure. The developed subfilter closure is implemented into the GFDL MOM6 ocean model and is evaluated in an idealized double-gyre configuration, both a-priori and a-posteriori. For sufficiently resolved grids, the LES simulations converge to the filtered high-resolution data. However, limitations in the proposed closure are observed when the filter scale approaches the energy-containing scales: the a-priori performance drops and a-posteriori experiments fail to converge to the filtered high-resolution data. Nevertheless, the proposed closure is accurate in predicting the mean flow in a-posteriori simulations at all resolutions considered (1/2-1/8 degrees). Finally, we propose parameterizing the thickness fluxes using a Bardina model which further improves simulations at the coarsest resolutions (1/2-1/3 degrees).</description>

      <title>Winter Noctilucent Clouds Following Sudden Stratospheric Warming: First Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesospheric structures identical to summer noctilucent clouds were observed during the evening and the morning twilight of the night of December 17-18, 2024 in Siberian Russia. Basing on the available photo data, the mean altitude of the clouds 70.1+-1.5 km was measured by umbral colorimetric method. This coincided spatially and temporary with deep temperature minimum below 160K in mesosphere, followed the polar vortex displacement and warming of stratosphere below the clouds. The satellite data on temperature and water vapor is used to study the nature of this unexpected event.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Reinvention of Hydrological Modeling for Accurate Predictions and Interpretation to Transform Earth System Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional equation-driven hydrological models often struggle to accurately predict streamflow in challenging regional Earth systems like the Tibetan Plateau, while hybrid and existing algorithm-driven models face difficulties in interpreting hydrological behaviors. This work introduces HydroTrace, an algorithm-driven, data-agnostic model that substantially outperforms these approaches, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency of 98% and demonstrating strong generalization on unseen data. Moreover, HydroTrace leverages advanced attention mechanisms to capture spatial-temporal variations and feature-specific impacts, enabling the quantification and spatial resolution of streamflow partitioning as well as the interpretation of hydrological behaviors such as glacier-snow-streamflow interactions and monsoon dynamics. Additionally, a large language model (LLM)-based application allows users to easily understand and apply HydroTrace's insights for practical purposes. These advancements position HydroTrace as a transformative tool in hydrological and broader Earth system modeling, offering enhanced prediction accuracy and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Vertical shear instabilities in rotating stellar radiation zones: effects of the full Coriolis acceleration and thermal diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotation deeply impacts the structure and the evolution of stars. To build coherent 1D or multi-D stellar structure and evolution models, we must systematically evaluate the turbulent transport of momentum and matter induced by hydrodynamical instabilities of radial and latitudinal differential rotation in stably stratified thermally diffusive stellar radiation zones. In this work, we investigate vertical shear instabilities in these regions. The full Coriolis acceleration with the complete rotation vector at a general latitude is taken into account. We formulate the problem by considering a canonical shear flow with a hyperbolic-tangent profile. We perform linear stability analysis on this base flow using both numerical and asymptotic Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) methods. Two types of instabilities are identified and explored: inflectional instability, which occurs in the presence of an inflection point in shear flow, and inertial instability due to an imbalance between the centrifugal acceleration and pressure gradient. Both instabilities are promoted as thermal diffusion becomes stronger or stratification becomes weaker. Effects of the full Coriolis acceleration are found to be more complex according to parametric investigations in wide ranges of colatitudes and rotation-to-shear and rotation-to-stratification ratios. Also, new prescriptions for the vertical eddy viscosity are derived to model the turbulent transport triggered by each instability. We foresee that the inflectional instability will be responsible for turbulent transport in the equatorial region of strongly-stratified radiative zones in slowly rotating stars while the inertial instability triggers turbulence in the polar regions of weakly-stratified radiative zones in fast-rotating stars.</description>

      <title>Convex Optimization of Initial Perturbations toward Quantitative Weather Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19546v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes introducing convex optimization to find initial perturbations of atmospheric states to realize specified changes in subsequent weather. In the proposed method, we formulate and solve an inverse problem to find effective perturbations in atmospheric variables so that controlled variables satisfy specified changes at a specified time. The proposed method first constructs a sensitivity matrix of controlled variables, such as accumulated precipitation, to the initial atmospheric variables, such as temperature and humidity, through sensitivity analysis using a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. Then a convex optimization problem is formulated to achieve various control specifications involving not only quadratic functions but also absolute values and maximum values of the controlled variables and initial atmospheric variables in the cost function and constraints. The proposed method was validated through a benchmark warm bubble experiment using the NWP model. The experiments showed that the identified perturbations successfully realized specified spatial distributions of accumulated precipitation.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporally Coherent Probabilistic Generation of Weather from Climate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local climate information is crucial for impact assessment and decision-making, yet coarse global climate simulations cannot capture small-scale phenomena. Current statistical downscaling methods infer these phenomena as temporally decoupled spatial patches. However, to preserve physical properties, estimating spatio-temporally coherent high-resolution weather dynamics for multiple variables across long time horizons is crucial. We present a novel generative approach that uses a score-based diffusion model trained on high-resolution reanalysis data to capture the statistical properties of local weather dynamics. After training, we condition on coarse climate model data to generate weather patterns consistent with the aggregate information. As this inference task is inherently uncertain, we leverage the probabilistic nature of diffusion models and sample multiple trajectories. We evaluate our approach with high-resolution reanalysis information before applying it to the climate model downscaling task. We then demonstrate that the model generates spatially and temporally coherent weather dynamics that align with global climate output.</description>
