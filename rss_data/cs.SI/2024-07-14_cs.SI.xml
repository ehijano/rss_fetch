      <title>Commute-Time-Optimised Graphs for GNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore graph rewiring methods that optimise commute time. Recent graph rewiring approaches facilitate long-range interactions in sparse graphs, making such rewirings commute-time-optimal $\textit{on average}$. However, when an expert prior exists on which node pairs should or should not interact, a superior rewiring would favour short commute times between these privileged node pairs. We construct two synthetic datasets with known priors reflecting realistic settings, and use these to motivate two bespoke rewiring methods that incorporate the known prior. We investigate the regimes where our rewiring improves test performance on the synthetic datasets. Finally, we perform a case study on a real-world citation graph to investigate the practical implications of our work.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Subgraph Network with Prompt Learning for Interpretable Depression Detection on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive social media data can reflect people's authentic thoughts, emotions, communication, etc., and therefore can be analyzed for early detection of mental health problems such as depression. Existing works about early depression detection on social media lacked interpretability and neglected the heterogeneity of social media data. Furthermore, they overlooked the global interaction among users. To address these issues, we develop a novel method that leverages a Heterogeneous Subgraph Network with Prompt Learning(HSNPL) and contrastive learning mechanisms. Specifically, prompt learning is employed to map users' implicit psychological symbols with excellent interpretability while deep semantic and diverse behavioral features are incorporated by a heterogeneous information network. Then, the heterogeneous graph network with a dual attention mechanism is constructed to model the relationships among heterogeneous social information at the feature level. Furthermore, the heterogeneous subgraph network integrating subgraph attention and self-supervised contrastive learning is developed to explore complicated interactions among users and groups at the user level. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for depression detection on social media.</description>

      <title>Tracking Patterns in Toxicity and Antisocial Behavior Over User Lifetimes on Large Social Media Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing amount of attention has been devoted to the problem of "toxic" or antisocial behavior on social media. In this paper we analyze such behavior at very large scales: we analyze toxicity over a 14-year time span on nearly 500 million comments from Reddit and Wikipedia, grounded in two different proxies for toxicity.
  At the individual level, we analyze users' toxicity levels over the course of their time on the site, and find a striking reversal in trends: both Reddit and Wikipedia users tended to become less toxic over their life cycles on the site in the early (pre-2013) history of the site, but more toxic over their life cycles in the later (post-2013) history of the site. We also find that toxicity on Reddit and Wikipedia differ in a key way, with the most toxic behavior on Reddit exhibited in aggregate by the most active users, and the most toxic behavior on Wikipedia exhibited in aggregate by the least active users. Finally, we consider the toxicity of discussion around widely-shared pieces of content, and find that the trends for toxicity in discussion about content bear interesting similarities with the trends for toxicity in discussion by users.</description>

      <title>Influencer Self-Disclosure Practices on Instagram: A Multi-Country Longitudinal Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a longitudinal study of more than ten years of activity on Instagram consisting of over a million posts by 400 content creators from four countries: the US, Brazil, Netherlands and Germany. Our study shows differences in the professionalisation of content monetisation between countries, yet consistent patterns; significant differences in the frequency of posts yet similar user engagement trends; and significant differences in the disclosure of sponsored content in some countries, with a direct connection with national legislation. We analyse shifts in marketing strategies due to legislative and platform feature changes, focusing on how content creators adapt disclosure methods to different legal environments. We also analyse the impact of disclosures and sponsored posts on engagement and conclude that, although sponsored posts have lower engagement on average, properly disclosing ads does not reduce engagement further. Our observations stress the importance of disclosure compliance and can guide authorities in developing and monitoring them more effectively.</description>

      <title>Linking Datasets on Organizations Using Half A Billion Open-Collaborated Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02533v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scholars studying organizations often work with multiple datasets lacking shared identifiers or covariates. In such situations, researchers usually use approximate string ("fuzzy") matching methods to combine datasets. String matching, although useful, faces fundamental challenges. Even where two strings appear similar to humans, fuzzy matching often struggles because it fails to adapt to the informativeness of the character combinations. In response, a number of machine learning methods have been developed to refine string matching. Yet, the effectiveness of these methods is limited by the size and diversity of training data. This paper introduces data from a prominent employment networking site (LinkedIn) as a massive training corpus to address these limitations. By leveraging information from the LinkedIn corpus regarding organizational name-to-name links, we incorporate trillions of name pair examples into various methods to enhance existing matching benchmarks and performance by explicitly maximizing match probabilities. We also show how relationships between organization names can be modeled using a network representation of the LinkedIn data. In illustrative merging tasks involving lobbying firms, we document improvements when using the LinkedIn corpus in matching calibration and make all data and methods open source.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Review of Community Detection in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11798v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of complex networks has significantly advanced our understanding of community structures which serves as a crucial feature of real-world graphs. Detecting communities in graphs is a challenging problem with applications in sociology, biology, and computer science. Despite the efforts of an interdisciplinary community of scientists, a satisfactory solution to this problem has not yet been achieved. This review article delves into the topic of community detection in graphs, which serves as a thorough exposition of various community detection methods from perspectives of modularity-based method, spectral clustering, probabilistic modelling, and deep learning. Along with the methods, a new community detection method designed by us is also presented. Additionally, the performance of these methods on the datasets with and without ground truth is compared. In conclusion, this comprehensive review provides a deep understanding of community detection in graphs.</description>

      <title>Human-machine social systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From fake social media accounts and generative-AI chatbots to financial trading algorithms and self-driving vehicles, robots, bots, and algorithms are proliferating and permeating our communication channels, social interactions, economic transactions, and transportation arteries. Networks of multiple interdependent and interacting humans and autonomous machines constitute complex social systems where the collective outcomes cannot be deduced from either human or machine behavior alone. Under this paradigm, we review recent research from across a range of disciplines and identify general dynamics and patterns in situations of competition, coordination, cooperation, contagion, and collective decision-making, with context-rich examples from high-frequency trading markets, a social media platform, an open-collaboration community, and a discussion forum. To ensure more robust and resilient human-machine communities, researchers should study them using complex-system methods, engineers should explicitly design AI for human-machine and machine-machine interactions, and regulators should govern the ecological diversity and social co-evolution of humans and machines.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Recommendations for Users with Decaying Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems capable of providing diverse sets of results are a focus of increasing importance, with motivations ranging from fairness to novelty and other aspects of optimizing user experience. One form of diversity of recent interest is calibration, the notion that personalized recommendations should reflect the full distribution of a user's interests, rather than a single predominant category -- for instance, a user who mainly reads entertainment news but also wants to keep up with news on the environment and the economy would prefer to see a mixture of these genres, not solely entertainment news. Existing work has formulated calibration as a subset selection problem; this line of work observes that the formulation requires the unrealistic assumption that all recommended items receive equal consideration from the user, but leaves as an open question the more realistic setting in which user attention decays as they move down the list of results.
  In this paper, we consider calibration with decaying user attention under two different models. In both models, there is a set of underlying genres that items can belong to. In the first setting, where items are represented by fine-grained mixtures of genre percentages, we provide a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm by extending techniques for constrained submodular optimization. In the second setting, where items are coarsely binned into a single genre each, we surpass the $(1-1/e)$ barrier imposed by submodular maximization and give a $2/3$-approximate greedy algorithm. Our work thus addresses the problem of capturing ordering effects due to decaying attention, allowing for the extension of near-optimal calibration from recommendation sets to recommendation lists.</description>
