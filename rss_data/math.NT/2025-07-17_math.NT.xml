      <title>On a family of sums of powers of the floor function and their links with generalized Dedekind sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we are concerned with a family of sums involving the floor function. With $r$ a non negative integer and $n$ and $m$ positive integers we consider the sums \begin{equation*}\mathbf{S}_{r}\left(n,m\right)=\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}{\left\lfloor \frac{km}{n}\right\rfloor}^r\end{equation*} While a formula for $\mathbf{S}_1$ is well known, we provide closed-form formulas for $\mathbf{S}_2$ and $\mathbf{S}_3$ as well as the reciprocity laws they satisfy. Additionally, one can find a closed-form formula for the classical Dedekind sum using the Euclidean algorithm. Finally, we provide a general formula for $\mathbf{S}_r$ showing its dependency on generalized Dedekind sums.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for mask polynomials with many cyclotomic divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a nonempty set $A \subset \mathbb{N}\cup\{0\}$, define the mask polynomial $A(X)=\sum_{a\in A} X^a$. Suppose that there are $s_1,\dots,s_k\in\nn\setminus\{1\}$ such that the cyclotomic polynomials $\Phi_{s_1},\dots,\Phi_{s_k}$ divide $A(X)$. What is the smallest possible size of $A$? For $k=1$, this was answered by Lam and Leung in 2000. Less is known about the case when $k\geq 2$; in particular, one may ask whether (similarly to the $k=1$ case) the optimal configurations have a simple ``fibered" structure on each scale involved. We prove that this is true in a number of special cases, but false in general, even if further strong structural assumptions are added. Results of this type are expected to have a broad range of applications, including Favard length of product Cantor sets, Fuglede's spectral set conjecture, and the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture on integer tilings.</description>

      <title>Blocking Sets and Power Residue Modulo Integers with Bounded Number of Prime Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q$ be an odd prime and $k$ be a natural number. We show that a finite subset of integers $S$ that does not contain any perfect $q^{th}$ power, contains a $q^{th}$ power residue modulo almost every natural numbers $N$ with at most $k$ prime factors if and only if $S$ corresponds to a $k$-blocking set of $\PG(\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n})$. Here, $n$ is the number of distinct primes that divides the $q$-free parts of elements of $S$. Consequently, this geometric connection enables us to utilize methods from Galois geometry to derive lower bounds for the cardinalities of such sets $S$ and to completely characterize such $S$ of the smallest and the second smallest cardinalities. Furthermore, the property of whether a finite subset of integers contains a $q^{th}$ power residue modulo almost every integer $N$ with at most $k$ prime factors is invariant under the action of projective general linear group $\mathrm{PGL}(n, q)$.</description>

      <title>Variant of Ramanujan polynomials and a conjecture of Maji &amp; Sarkar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We settle a conjecture proposed by B. Maji and T. Sarkar regarding the location of zeros of a two-parameter family of reciprocal polynomials, $R_{k,\ell}(z)$ for positive integers $k$ and $\ell$. These polynomials are generalizations of Ramanujan polynomials studied by M. R. Murty, C. Smyth, and R. Wang. More specifically, we show that except for two real zeros, all other zeros of $R_{k,\ell}(z)$ lie on the unit circle.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution of the sequence of the first $N$ elements of the discrete dynamical system generated by the M\"obius transformation $x \mapsto (\alpha x + \beta)/(\gamma x + \delta)$ over a finite field of $p$ elements at the moments of time that correspond to $Q$-smooth numbers, that is, to numbers composed out of primes up to $Q$. In particular, we obtain nontrivial estimates of exponential sums with such sequences.</description>

      <title>Dimension sequences of modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $N \geq 1$, let $S_{2}^{\text{new}}(N)$ denote the newspace of cuspidal modular forms of weight $2$ and level $N$. In 2004, Greg Martin conjectured that as a sequence in $N$, $\dim S_2^{\text{new}}(N)$ takes on all possible natural numbers. In this paper, we investigate several generalizations and variations of this type of problem. In each case, we provide a complete characterization of when such a property holds.</description>

Abstract: We count the number of Galois extensions $M/\mathbb{Q}$ with fixed Galois group $\text{Gal}(M/\mathbb{Q})=D_4$ ordered by multi-invariants introduced by Gundlach. We verify the asymptotic behavior predicted by Gundlach's version of Malle's conjecture. We compare the leading constant to recent predictions by Loughran and Santens.</description>

      <title>Quasimodular forms arising from Jacobi's theta function and special symmetric polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ramanujan derived a sequence of even weight $2n$ quasimodular forms $U_{2n}(q)$ from derivatives of Jacobi's weight $3/2$ theta function. Using the generating function for this sequence, one can construct sequences of quasimodular forms of all nonnegative integer weights with minimal input: a weight 1 modular form and a power series $F(X)$. Using the weight 1 form $\theta(q)^2$ and $F(X)=e^{X/2}$, we obtain a sequence $\{Y_n(q)\}$ of weight $n$ quasimodular forms on $\Gamma_0(4)$ whose symmetric function avatars $\widetilde{Y}_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ are the symmetric polynomials $T_n(\pmb{x}^k)$ that arise naturally in the study of syzygies of numerical semigroups. With this information, we settle two conjectures about the $T_n(\pmb{x}^k).$ Finally, we note that these polynomials are systematically given in terms of the Borel-Hirzebruch $\widehat{A}$-genus for spin manifolds, where one identifies power sum symmetric functions $p_i$ with Pontryagin classes.</description>

      <title>On the Lebesgue-Nagell equation $x^2-2 = y^p$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Lebesgue-Nagell equation \begin{align*}
  x^2-2=y^p \end{align*} in integers $x,y,p$ with $p\geq 3$ an odd prime. A longstanding folklore conjecture asserts that the only solutions are the ``trivial'' ones with $y=-1$. We confirm the conjecture unconditionally for $p\leq 13$, and prove the conjecture holds for $p&gt;1831$ through a careful application of lower bounds for linear forms in two logarithms. We also show that any ``nontrivial'' solution must satisfy $y &gt; 10^{1000}$. In addition, we establish auxiliary results that may support future progress on the problem, and we revisit prior claims in the literature regarding unresolved cases of the equation.</description>

      <title>Depth one part of Tannakian groups of filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(F_r M)_{r\in\mathbb{Z}}$ be a finite filtration on an object $M$ of a neutral Tannakian category $\mathbf{T}$ in characteristic zero. Let $u(M)=u^F(M)$ be the Lie algebra of the subgroup of the Tannakian fundamental group of $M$ that acts trivially on the associated graded $Gr^FM$. The filtration $F_\bullet M$ induces a filtration on the internal Hom $\underline{Hom}(M,M)$, which in turn induces a filtration $F_\bullet u(M)$ on $u(M)$. This filtration on $u(M)$ is concentrated in negative degrees. In this paper, we give a description of the graded piece $Gr^F_{-1}u( M)$ in terms of the extensions $F_{r+1}M/F_{r-1}M\in Ext^1(Gr^F_{r+1}M, Gr^F_{r}M)$. In particular, these extensions determine $Gr^F_{-1}u(M)$. Note that here we neither assume the filtration is functorial, nor we assume that $Gr^FM$ is semisimple. The problem of studying $u(M)$ in this generality is motivated by the desire to understand Tannakian groups associated to a mixed motive and its realizations, including realizations for which semisimplicity of realizations of pure motives is not known and realizations that lack an interesting functorial weight filtration.
  We also give two related applications. The first is an equivalent condition in the generality described above for when $u(M)$ coincides with its trivial upper bound $F_{-1}\underline{Hom}(M,M)$. This result generalizes earlier criteria for maximality of $u(M)$ obtained by various authors in special contexts or under limiting conditions. In the second application, we apply the results to the setting of a neutral Tannakian category with a functorial weight filtration $W_\bullet$. Combining the constructions of [arXiv:2307.15487] with our general maximality criterion we prove a result about the structure of the set of isomorphism classes of objects $M$ for which $Gr^WM$ is isomorphic to a given graded object $A$ and $u^W(M)=W_{-1}\underline{Hom}(M,M)$.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Hecke eigenbases from Ehrhart polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\ell\in\{0,1,\dots,n\}$, we consider the function extracting the $\ell$th coefficient of the Ehrhart polynomials of lattice polytopes in $\mathbb{R}^n$. These functions form a basis of the space of unimodular invariant valuations. We show that, in even dimensions, these functions are in fact simultaneous symplectic Hecke eigenfunctions. We leverage this and apply the theory of spherical functions and their associated zeta functions to prove analytic, asymptotic, and combinatorial results about the arithmetic functions averaging $\ell$th Ehrhart coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.03584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the supersingular locus of a reduction at an inert prime of the Shimura variety attached to $\mathrm{GU}(2,n-2)$. More concretely, we realize irreducible components of the supersingular locus as closed subschemes of flag schemes over Deligne--Lusztig varieties defined by explicit conditions after taking perfections. Moreover we study the intersections of the irreducible components. Stratifications of Deligne--Lusztig varieties defined using powers of Frobenius action appear in the description of the intersections.</description>

      <title>Small gaps between almost-twin primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $m \in \mathbb{N}$ be large. We show that there exist infinitely many primes $q_{1}&lt; \cdot\cdot\cdot &lt; q_{m+1}$ such that \[ q_{m+1}-q_{1}=O(e^{7.63m}) \] and $q_{j}+2$ has at most \[ \frac{7.36m}{\log 2} + \frac{4\log m}{\log 2} + 21 \] prime factors for each $1 \leq j \leq m+1$. This improves the previous result of Li and Pan, replacing $m^{4}e^{8m}$ by $e^{7.63m}$ and $\frac{16m}{\log 2} + \frac{5\log m}{\log 2} + 37$ by $\frac{7.36m}{\log 2} + \frac{4\log m}{\log 2} + 21$. The main inputs are the Maynard-Tao sieve, a minorant for the indicator function of the primes constructed by Baker and Irving, for which a stronger equidistribution theorem in arithmetic progressions to smooth moduli is applicable, and Tao's approach previously used to estimate $\sum_{x \leq n &lt; 2x} \mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{P}}(n)\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{P}}(n+12)\omega_{n}$, where $\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{P}}$ stands for the characteristic function of the primes and $\omega_{n}$ are multidimensional sieve weights.</description>

      <title>Approximation of L-functions associated to Hecke cusp eigenforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a family of approximations for L-functions of Hecke cusp eigenforms, according to a recipe first described by Matiyasevich for the Riemann xi function. We show that these approximations converge to the true L-function and point out the role of an equidistributional notion in ensuring the approximation is well-defined, and along the way we demonstrate error formulas which may be used to investigate analytic properties of the L-function and its derivatives, such as the locations and orders of zeros. Together with the Euler product expansion of the L-function, the family of approximations also encodes some of the key features of the L-function such as its functional equation. As an example, we apply this method to the L-function of the modular discriminant and demonstrate that the approximation successfully locates zeros of the L-function on the critical line. Finally, we derive via Mellin transforms a convolution-type formula which leads to precise error bounds in terms of the incomplete gamma function. This formula can be interpreted as an alternative definition for the approximation and sheds light on Matiyasevich's procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate factorization problems for twisted triple product Galois representations over real quadratic fields, arising from families of Hilbert cusp forms. Specifically, we address the factorization in two distinct settings determined by the order of vanishing of associated $L$-unctions at their central critical values-namely, the rank (1,1) and rank (0,2) cases. Our results generalize the algebraic factorization framework developed by B\"{u}y\"{u}kboduk et al. in higher rank scenario to the setting of real quadratic fields. Notably, our work yields the first known factorization result in the higher rank (0,2) case, marking a significant advancement in the study of triple product motives over totally real fields.</description>

      <title>On the arithmetic average of the first $n$ primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The arithmetic average of the first $n$ primes, $\bar p_n = {1\over n} \sum_{i=1}^n p_i$, exhibits very many interesting and subtle properties. Since the transformation from $p_n \to \bar p_n$ is extremely easy to invert, $p_n = n\bar p_n - (n-1)\bar p_{n-1}$, it is clear that these two sequences $p_n \longleftrightarrow \bar p_n$ must ultimately carry exactly the same information. But the averaged sequence $\bar p_n$, while very closely correlated with the primes, ($\bar p_n \sim {1\over2} p_n$), is much "smoother'', and much better behaved. Using extensions of various standard results I shall demonstrate that the prime-averaged sequence $\bar p_n$ satisfies prime-averaged analogues of the Cramer, Andrica, Legendre, Oppermann, Brocard, Fourges, Firoozbakht, Nicholson, and Farhadian conjectures. (So these prime-averaged analogues are not conjectures, they are theorems.) The crucial key to enabling this pleasant behaviour is the "smoothing'' process inherent in averaging. Whereas the asymptotic behaviour of the two sequences is very closely correlated the local fluctuations are quite different.</description>

      <title>Explicit sumset sizes in additive number theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05329v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is an open problem in additive number theory to compute and understand the full range of sumset sizes of finite sets of integers, that is, the set $\mathcal{R}_{\mathbf{Z}}(h,k)= \{|hA|:A \subseteq {\mathbf{Z}} \text{ and } |A|=k\}$ for all integers $h \geq 3$ and $k \geq 3$. This paper constructs certain infinite families of finite sets of size $k$ and computes their $h$-fold sumset sizes.</description>

      <title>A generic approach to proving Tur\'{a}n-type inequalities for sequences that admit exact formulas, with an application to unimodal sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an asymptotic expansion with effective error bound for $u(n)$, counting the number of unimodal sequences of size $n$. We prove that $u(n)$ satisfies the higher order Tur\'{a}n inequalities for $n\geq33$ and that certain second $j$-shifted difference of $u(n)$ are positive.</description>

      <title>Henselian schemes in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08644v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global analogue of a Henselian local ring is a Henselian pair: a ring A and an ideal I which satisfy a condition resembling Hensel's lemma regarding lifting coprime factorizations of polynomials over A/I to factorizations over A. The geometric counterpart is the notion of a Henselian scheme, which is an analogue of a tubular neighborhood in algebraic geometry.
  In this paper we revisit the foundations of the theory of Henselian schemes. The pathological behavior of quasi-coherent sheaves on Henselian schemes in characteristic 0 makes them poor models for an "algebraic tube" in characteristic 0. We show that such problems do not arise in positive characteristic, and establish good properties for analogues of smooth and \'etale maps in the general Henselian setting.</description>

      <title>Decomposition results for multiplicative actions and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by partition regularity problems of homogeneous quadratic equations, we prove multiple recurrence and convergence results for multiplicative measure preserving actions with iterates given by rational sequences involving polynomials that factor into products of linear forms in two variables. We focus mainly on actions that are finitely generated, and the key tool in our analysis is a decomposition result for any bounded measurable function into a sum of two components, one that mimics concentration properties of pretentious multiplicative functions and another that mimics vanishing properties of aperiodic multiplicative functions. Crucial to part of our arguments are some new seminorms that are defined by a mixture of addition and multiplication of the iterates of the action, and we prove an inverse theorem that explicitly characterizes the factor of the system on which these seminorms vanish.</description>
