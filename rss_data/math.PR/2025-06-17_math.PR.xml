      <title>Functional central limit theorem for dependent models with finite memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide complementary results for a family of models with dependence on their previous $k$-sum. Using a martingale-based approach, we establish a functional central limit theorem and analyze the limiting behavior of the center of mass. Additionally, we explore the connection between our findings and the study of certain reinforced random walks in the literature</description>

      <title>Noise-induced stabilization in a chemical reaction network without boundary effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a chemical reaction network that is unstable under deterministic mass action kinetics, exhibiting finite-time blow-up of trajectories in the interior of the state space, but whose stochastic counterpart is positive recurrent. This provides an example of noise-induced stabilization of the model's dynamics arising due to noise perturbing transversally the divergent trajectories of the system that is independently of boundary effects. The proof is based on a careful decomposition of the state space and the construction of suitable Lyapunov functions in each region.</description>

      <title>Voter model on heterogeneous directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the consensus dynamics of the voter model on large random graphs with heterogeneous and directed features, focusing in particular on networks with power-law degree distributions. By extending recent results on sparse directed graphs, we derive exact first-order asymptotics for the expected consensus time in directed configuration models with i.i.d. Pareto-distributed in- and out-degrees. For any tail exponent {\alpha}&gt;0, we derive the mean consensus time scaling depending on the network size and a pre-factor that encodes detailed structural properties of the degree sequences. We give an explicit description of the pre factor in the directed setting. This extends and sharpens previous mean-field predictions from statistical physics, providing the first explicit consensus-time formula in the directed heavy-tailed setting. Through extensive simulations, we confirm the validity of our predictions across a wide range of heterogeneity regimes, including networks with infinite variance and infinite mean degree distribution. We further explore the interplay between network topology and voter dynamics, highlighting how degree fluctuations and maximal degrees shape the consensus landscape. Complementing the asymptotic analysis, we provide numerical evidence for the emergence of Wright-Fisher diffusive behavior in both directed and undirected ensembles under suitable mixing conditions, and demonstrate the breakdown of this approximation in the in the infinite mean regime.</description>

      <title>The multinomial dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $N$-dimer cover of a graph is a collection of edges (with multiplicity) such that each vertex is contained in exactly $N$ edges in the collection. The multinomial dimer model is a natural probability measure on $N$-dimer covers. We study the behavior of these measures on periodic bipartite graphs in ${\mathbb R}^d$, in the scaling limit as the multiplicity $N$ and then the size of the graph go to infinity.
  In this iterated limit, we prove a large deviation principle, where the rate function is the integral of an explicit surface tension, and show that random configurations concentrate on a limit shape which is the unique solution to an associated Euler-Lagrange equation. We further show that the associated critical gauge functions, which exist in the $N\to\infty$ limit on each finite graph, converge in the scaling limit to a limiting gauge function which solves a dual Euler-Lagrange equation.
  We use our techniques to compute explicit limit shapes in some two and three dimensional examples, such as the Aztec diamond and ``Aztec cuboid". These $3d$ examples are the first stat mech models in dimensions $d\ge3$ where limit shapes can be computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>Law of large numbers for the discriminant of random polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f_n$ be a random polynomial of degree $n$, whose coefficients are independent and identically distributed random variables with mean-zero and variance one. Let $\Delta(f_n)$ denote the discriminant of $f_n$, that is $\Delta(f_n) = A^{2n-2}\prod_{i &lt; j} (\alpha_j - \alpha_i)^2$ where $A$ is the leading coefficient of $f_n$ and $\alpha_1,\ldots\alpha_n$ are its roots. We prove that with high probability $$|\Delta(f_n)| = n^{2n} e^{-{\sf D}_\ast n(1+o(1))}$$ as $n\to \infty$, for some explicit universal constant ${\sf D}_\ast&gt;0$. A key step in the proof is an analytic representation for the logarithm of the discriminant, which captures both the distributional reciprocal symmetry of the random roots and the cancellations this symmetry induces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a non-exchangeable system of interacting quantum particles with mean-field type interactions, subject to continuous measurement on a class of dense graphs. In the mean-field limit, we derive a graphon-based quantum filtering system of equations, study its well-posedness, and establish a propagation of chaos result for multiple bosonic systems with blockwise interactions. We then discuss applications to quantum graphon games and quantum state preparation.</description>

Abstract: We obtain error rates for large deviations of sums of i.i.d. random variables in, a particular case, of the domain of a non-symmetric infinite mean $\alpha=1$-stable law. The focus of this work is on the method of proof via analytic techniques rather than the particular result.</description>

      <title>Point process convergence of extremes in $K$-symmetric exclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the behavior of extremal particles in $K$-symmetric exclusion on $\mathbb{Z}$ when the process starts from certain infinite-particle step configurations where there are no particles to the right of a maximal one. In such a system, the occupancy of a site is limited to at most $K \geq 1$. Let $X^{(0)}_t\geq X^{(1)}_t\geq \cdots$ denote the order statistics of the particles in the system. We show that the point process $\sum_{m=0}^\infty \delta_{v_t(X_{t/K}^{(m)})}$ converges in distribution as $t \to \infty$ to a Poisson random measure on $\mathbb{R}$ with intensity proportional to $e^{-x}\,dx$, where $v_t(x) = (\sigma b_t)^{-1}x - a_t$, $a_t = \log(t/ (\sqrt{2\pi} \log t))$, $b_t = (t/\log t)^{1/2}$, and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the random walk jump probabilities.
  From this limit, we further deduce the asymptotic joint distributions for the extreme statistics and the spacings between them. Moreover, to probe effects of the number of particles on the behavior of the extremes, we consider an array of truncated step profiles supported on blocks of $L(t)$ sites at times $t\geq 0$. Letting $L(t) \to \infty$ with $t \to \infty$, we obtain Poisson random measure limits in different scaling regimes determined by $L(t)$.
  These results show robustness of both previously known and newly introduced superdiffusive scaling limits for the extremes in the symmetric exclusion process ($K=1$) by extending them to the larger class of $K\geq 2$ exclusion. Furthermore, proofs are more general than previously known techniques, relying on moment bounds and a semigroup monotonicity estimate to control particle correlations.</description>

      <title>Permutation invariance in last-passage percolation and the distribution of the Busemann process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In i.i.d. exponential last-passage percolation, we describe the joint distribution of Busemann functions, over all edges and over all directions, in terms of a joint last-passage problem in a finite inhomogeneous environment. More specifically, the Busemann increments within a $k\times\ell$ grid, and associated to $d$ different directions, are equal in distribution to a particular collection of last-passage increments inside a $(k+d-1)\times(\ell+d-1)$ grid. The joint Busemann distribution was previously described along a horizontal line by Fan and the fourth author, using certain queuing maps. By contrast, our new description explicitly gives the joint distribution for any collection of edges (not just along a horizontal line) using only finitely many random variables. Our result thus provides an exact and accessible way to sample from the joint distribution. In the proof, we rely on one-directional marginal distributions of the inhomogeneous Busemann functions recently studied by Janjigian and the second and fourth authors. Another innovation of our argument is a joint invariance of inhomogeneous last-passage times under permutation of the inhomogeneity parameters. This result does not appear to be contained among the last-passage invariances recently described by Dauvergne. Our proof of invariance is also rather different, using the Burke property instead of the RSK correspondence, and leading to an explicit coupling of the weights before and after the permutation of the parameters.</description>

      <title>Strong Detection Threshold for Correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Graphs with Constant Average Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a pair of correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $\mathcal G(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};s)$ that are subsampled from a common parent Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph with average degree $\lambda$ and subsampling probability $s$. We establish a sharp information-theoretic threshold for the detection problem between this model and two independent Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $\mathcal G(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n})$, showing that strong detection is information-theoretically possible if and only if $s&gt;\min\{ \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda}}, \sqrt{\alpha} \}$ where $\alpha\approx 0.338$ is the Otter's constant. Our result resolves a constant gap between arXiv:2203.14573 and arXiv:2008.10097.</description>

      <title>Stochastic intrinsic gradient flows on the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct stochastic gradient flows on the $2$-Wasserstein space $\mathcal P_2$ over $\mathbb R^d$ for energy functionals of the type $W_F(\rho d x)=\int_{\mathbb R^d}F(x,\rho(x))d x$. The functions $F$ and $\partial_2 F$ are assumed to be locally Lipschitz on $\mathbb R^d\times (0,\infty)$. This includes the relevant examples of $W_F$ as the entropy functional or more generally the Lyapunov function of generalized porous media equations. First, we define a class of Gaussian-based measures $\Lambda$ on $\mathcal P_2$ together with a corresponding class of symmetric Markov processes ${(R_t)}_{t\geq 0}$. Then, using Dirichlet form techniques we perform stochastic quantization for the perturbations of these objects which result from multiplying such a measure $\Lambda$ by a density proportional to $e^{-W_F}$. Then it is proved that the intrinsic gradient $DW_F(\mu)$ is defined for $\Lambda$-a.e. $\mu$ and that the Gaussian-based reference measure $\Lambda$ can be chosen in such way that the distorted process ${(\mu_t)}_{t\geq 0}$ is a martingale solution for the equation $d\mu_t=-DW_t(\mu_t) d t+d R_t$, $t\geq 0$.</description>

      <title>A universal cutoff phenomenon for mean-field exchange models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a broad class of high-dimensional mean-field exchange models, encompassing both noisy and singular dynamics, along with their dual processes. This includes a generalized version of the averaging process as well as some non-reversible extensions of classical exchange dynamics, such as the flat Kac model. Within a unified framework, we analyze convergence to stationarity from worst-case initial data in Wasserstein distance. Our main result establishes a universal cutoff phenomenon at an explicit mixing time, with a precise window and limiting Gaussian profile. The mixing time and profile are characterized in terms of the logarithm of the size-biased redistribution random variable, thus admitting a natural entropic interpretation.</description>

      <title>Space-time fractional stochastic partial differential equations driven by L\'evy white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the following space-time fractional stochastic nonlinear partial differential equation \begin{equation*}
  \left(\partial_t^{\beta}+\frac{\nu}{2}\left(-\Delta\right)^{\alpha / 2}\right) u=I_{t}^{\gamma}\Big[ f(t,x,u)-\sum_{i=1}^{d} \frac{\partial}{\partial x_i} q_i(t,x,u)+ \sigma(t,x,u) F_{t,x}\Big] \end{equation*} for a random field $u(t,x):[0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^d \mapsto\mathbb{R}$, where $\alpha&gt;0, \beta\in(0,2), \gamma\ge0, \nu&gt;0, F_{t,x}$ is a L\'evy space-time white noise, $I_{t}^\gamma$ stands for the Riemann-Liouville integral in time, and $f,q_i,\sigma:[0,\infty)\times\mathbb{R}^d\times\mathbb{R} \mapsto\mathbb{R}$ are measurable functions. Under suitable polynomial growth conditions, we establish the existence and uniqueness of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$-valued local solutions when the L\'evy white noise $F_{t,x}$ contains Gaussian noise component. Furthermore, for $p\in[1,2]$, we derive the existence and uniqueness of $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$-valued local solutions for the equation driven by pure jump L\'evy white noise. Finally, we obtain certain stronger conditions for the existence and uniqueness of global solutions.</description>

      <title>The effects of initial conditions on the accuracy of mean-field approximations of Markov processes on large random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a general class of stochastic processes (containing, e.g. SIS and SIR models) on large random networks, focusing on a particular general class of random graph models. To approximate the expected dynamics of these processes, we employ a mean-field technique known as the N-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation (NIMFA). Our primary goal is to quantify the impact of the randomness in the network topology on the accuracy of such approximations. While classical work by Kurtz established strong approximation results for density-dependent Markov chains using mean-field on the complete-graph of order $N$, yielding error bounds of order $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$, we demonstrate that in the context of NIMFA on random graphs, the error admits a refined characterization depending on initial conditions. Specifically, for generic initial conditions, the worst case error is of order $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}$, where $d$ is the expected average degree of the graph. This result highlights how network sparsity contributes an additional source of variability not captured by classical mean-field approaches. Furthermore, when the initial conditions are taken to be fairly homogeneous, we show that the error term is of order $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}+\frac{1}{d}$, where $N$ is the number of nodes, underscoring the intricate role of the choice of initial conditions in the error bounds. Our analysis connects with recent interest in quantifying the role of graph heterogeneity in epidemic thresholds and dynamics.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the entropy production rate and time-reversibility for general jump diffusions (L\'{e}vy processes) on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We first formulate the entropy production rate and explore its associated thermodynamic relations for jump diffusions. Subsequently, we derive the entropy production rate using the relative entropy between the forward and time-reversed path measures for stationary jump diffusions via the Girsanov transform. Furthermore, we establish the equivalence among time-reversibility, zero entropy production rate, detailed balance condition, and the gradient structure for stationary jump diffusions.</description>

      <title>Betti numbers in the Random Connection Model for higher-dimensional simplicial complexes and the Boolean model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random simplicial complexes, as generalizations of random graphs, have become increasingly popular in the literature in recent years. In this paper, we consider a new model for a random simplicial complex that was introduced in arXiv:2506.11918, which generalizes the Random Connection Model in a natural way and includes several models used in the literature as special cases. We focus on the marked stationary case with vertices in $R^d\times A$, where the mark space $A$ is an arbitrary Borel space. We will derive a central limit theorem for an abstract class of functionals and show that many of the typical functionals considered in the study of simplicial complexes, such as Betti numbers, fall into this class. As an important special case, we obtain a central limit theorem for Betti numbers in the Boolean model.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we work in the framework of Hilbert-valued Wiener structures and derive a functional version of the second-order Gaussian Poincar\'e inequality that leads to abstract bounds for Gaussian process approximation in $d_2$ distance. Our abstract bounds are flexible and can be applied in various examples including functional Breuer-Major central limit theorems, shallow neural networks, and spatial statistics of SPDEs solutions.</description>

      <title>Non-exchangeable mean-field theory for adaptive weights: propagation of chaos and graphon sampling lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mean-field theory for large, non-exchangeable particle (agent) systems where the states and interaction weights co-evolve in a coupled system of SDEs. A first main result is a generalization of the propagation of chaos. The weight adaptation in the SDEs makes the classical approach of using a static probability space as the continuum limit for the agent labels inadequate. We address this by introducing a label space endowed with a filtration that captures the stochasticity. While this yields a well-posed McKean-Vlasov SDE, its limit is not easily described by a Vlasov-type PDE. This difficulty, in turn, motivates the introduction of a unified metric that naturally combines the Wasserstein distance for states and the cut norm for weights. In this metric space, we establish the convergence of finite systems to their continuum limit. This result, analogous to the classical convergence of empirical measures, is a subtle consequence of a deep result from dense graph theory, namely the Sampling Lemma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study absolutely continuous curves in the adapted Wasserstein space of filtered processes. We provide a probabilistic representation of such curves as flows of adapted processes on a common filtered probability space, extending classical results to the adapted setting. Moreover, we characterize geodesics in this space and derive an adapted Benamou--Brenier-type formula by reformulating adapted optimal transport as an energy minimization problem. As an application, we obtain a Skorokhod-type representation for sequences of filtered processes under the adapted weak topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a complete characterization of the covariance structure of number statistics in boxes for hyperuniform point processes. Under a standard integrability assumption, the covariance depends solely on the overlap of the faces of the box. Beyond this assumption, a novel interpolating covariance structure emerges. This enables us to identify a limiting Gaussian 'coarse-grained' process, counting the number of points in large boxes as a function of the box position. Depending on the integrability assumption, this process may be continuous or discontinuous, e.g. in d=1 it is given by an increment process of a fractional Brownian motion.</description>

Abstract: Consider an $n\times n$ matrix $P$ with the following properties. All entries in $P$ are positive or $0$, the sum of each row is 1 and for all $i$ and $j$ in $\{1,\dots,n\}$ there exists a natural number $k$ such that the $(i,j)$ entry of the matrix $P^k$ is strictly positive. Then, there exists a unique row vector $v$ with only strictly positive entries, whose sum of entries is 1 and such that $vP=P$. We present a proof of this well-known result that uses only basic algebra and the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem.</description>

      <title>Approximate polymorphisms of predicates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A generalized polymorphism of a predicate $P \subseteq \{0,1\}^m$ is a tuple of functions $f_1,\dots,f_m\colon \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ satisfying the following property: If $x^{(1)},\dots,x^{(m)} \in \{0,1\}^n$ are such that $(x^{(1)}_i,\dots,x^{(m)}_i) \in P$ for all $i$, then also $(f_1(x^{(1)}),\dots,f_m(x^{(m)})) \in P$.
  We show that if $f_1,\dots,f_m$ satisfy this property for most $x^{(1)},\dots,x^{(m)}$ (as measured with respect to an arbitrary full support distribution $\mu$ on $P$), then $f_1,\dots,f_m$ are close to a generalized polymorphism of $P$ (with respect to the marginals of $\mu$).
  Our main result generalizes several results in the literature: linearity testing, quantitative Arrow theorems, approximate intersecting families, AND testing, and more generally $f$-testing.</description>

      <title>Optimal Experimental Design Criteria for Data-Consistent Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to design effective experiments is crucial for obtaining data that can substantially reduce the uncertainty in the predictions made using computational models. An optimal experimental design (OED) refers to the choice of a particular experiment that optimizes a particular design criteria, e.g., maximizing a utility function, which measures the information content of the data. However, traditional approaches for optimal experimental design typically require solving a large number of computationally intensive inverse problems to find the data that maximizes the utility function. Here, we introduce two novel OED criteria that are specifically crafted for the data consistent inversion (DCI) framework, but do not require solving inverse problems. DCI is a specific approach for solving a class of stochastic inverse problems by constructing a pullback measure on uncertain parameters from an observed probability measure on the outputs of a quantity of interest (QoI) map. While expected information gain (EIG) has been used for both DCI and Bayesian based OED, the characteristics and properties of DCI solutions differ from those of solutions to Bayesian inverse problems which should be reflected in the OED criteria. The new design criteria developed in this study, called the expected scaling effect and the expected skewness effect, leverage the geometric structure of pre-images associated with observable data sets, allowing for an intuitive and computationally efficient approach to OED. These criteria utilize singular value computations derived from sampled and approximated Jacobians of the experimental designs. We present both simultaneous and sequential (greedy) formulations of OED based on these innovative criteria. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness in our approach for solving stochastic inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Finding a long cycle in a percolated vertex expander</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the percolated graph $G_p$ has each edge independently retained with probability $p$. Collares, Diskin, Erde, and Krivelevich initiated the study of large structures in percolated single-scale vertex expanders, wherein every set of exactly $k$ vertices of $G$ has at least $dk$ neighbours before percolation. We extend their result to a conjectured stronger form, proving that if $p = (1+\varepsilon)/d$ and $G$ expands as above, then $G_p$ fails to contain a cycle of length $\Omega_\varepsilon(kd)$ with exponentially small probability.</description>

      <title>A Minimum Distance Estimator Approach for Misspecified Ergodic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimum distance estimator (MDE) for parameter identification in misspecified models characterized by a sequence of ergodic stochastic processes that converge weakly to the model of interest. The data is generated by the sequence of processes, and we are interested in inferring parameters for the limiting processes. We define a general statistical setting for parameter estimation under such model misspecification and prove the robustness of the MDE. Furthermore, we prove the asymptotic normality of the MDE for multiscale diffusion processes with a well-defined homogenized limit. A tractable numerical implementation of the MDE is provided and realized in the programming language Julia.</description>

      <title>Credit risk for large portfolios of green and brown loans: extending the ASRF model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a credit risk model for portfolios composed of green and brown loans, extending the ASRF framework via a two-factor copula structure. Systematic risk is modeled using potentially skewed distributions, allowing for asymmetric creditworthiness effects, while idiosyncratic risk remains Gaussian. Under a non-uniform exposure setting, we establish convergence in quadratic mean of the portfolio loss to a limit reflecting the distinct characteristics of the two loan segments. Numerical results confirm the theoretical findings and illustrate how value-at-risk is affected by portfolio granularity, default probabilities, factor loadings, and skewness. Our model accommodates differential sensitivity to systematic shocks and offers a tractable basis for further developments in credit risk modeling, including granularity adjustments, CDO pricing, and empirical analysis of green loan portfolios.</description>

      <title>The impact of uncertainty on regularized learning in games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how randomness and uncertainty influence learning in games. Specifically, we examine a perturbed variant of the dynamics of "follow-the-regularized-leader" (FTRL), where the players' payoff observations and strategy updates are continually impacted by random shocks. Our findings reveal that, in a fairly precise sense, "uncertainty favors extremes": in any game, regardless of the noise level, every player's trajectory of play reaches an arbitrarily small neighborhood of a pure strategy in finite time (which we estimate). Moreover, even if the player does not ultimately settle at this strategy, they return arbitrarily close to some (possibly different) pure strategy infinitely often. This prompts the question of which sets of pure strategies emerge as robust predictions of learning under uncertainty. We show that (a) the only possible limits of the FTRL dynamics under uncertainty are pure Nash equilibria; and (b) a span of pure strategies is stable and attracting if and only if it is closed under better replies. Finally, we turn to games where the deterministic dynamics are recurrent - such as zero-sum games with interior equilibria - and we show that randomness disrupts this behavior, causing the stochastic dynamics to drift toward the boundary on average.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic parabolic partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, multiplicative stochastic noise, and a monotone parabolic operator A. The growth and coercivity of A is controlled by a general N-function M, which depends on time, and spatial variable, but we do not assume any regularity with respect to the former. We show the existence of weak solutions to such system. As auxiliary result, we also provide the proof for the It\^{o}'s formula in Orlicz spaces. This general result applies to the ones studied in the literature, such as p(t, x)-Laplacian and double phase problems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Layered Decoding Scheduling for LDPC Codes Aided by Check Node Error Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, a new scheduling strategies for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes under layered belief propagation (LBP) is designed. Based on the criteria of prioritizing the update of check nodes with lower error probabilities, we propose two dynamic scheduling methods: dynamic error belief propagation (Dyn-EBP) and dynamic penalty error belief propagation (Dyn-PEBP). In Dyn-EBP, each check node is restricted from being updated the same number of times, whereas Dyn-PEBP removes this restriction and instead introduces a penalty term to balance the number of updates. Simulation results show that, for 5G new radio (NR) LDPC codes, our proposed scheduling methods can outperform existing dynamic and offline scheduling strategies under various blocklengths and code rates. This demonstrates that prioritizing the update of check nodes with lower error probabilities can lead to higher decoding efficiency and validates the effectiveness of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>The maximal potential energy of biased random walks on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.6799</link>
      <description>arXiv:1403.6799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The biased random walk on supercritical Galton--Watson trees is known to exhibit a multiscale phenomenon in the slow regime: the maximal displacement of the walk in the first $n$ steps is of order $(\log n)^3$, whereas the typical displacement of the walk at the $n$-th step is of order $(\log n)^2$. Our main result reveals another multiscale property of biased walks: the maximal potential energy of the biased walks is of order $(\log n)^2$ in contrast with its typical size, which is of order $\log n$. The proof relies on analyzing the intricate multiscale structure of the potential energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14729v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic behavior of zeroes of trigonometric polynomials under repeated differentiation. We show that if the zeroes of a real-rooted, degree $d$ trigonometric polynomial are distributed according to some probability measure $\nu$ in the large $d$ limit, then the zeroes of its $[2td]$-th derivative, where $t&gt;0$ is fixed, are distributed according to the free multiplicative convolution of $\nu$ and the free unitary Poisson distribution with parameter $t$. In the simplest special case, our result states that the zeroes of the $[2td]$-th derivative of the trigonometric polynomial $(\sin \frac \theta 2)^{2d}$ (which can be thought of as the trigonometric analogue of the Laguerre polynomials) are distributed according to the free unitary Poisson distribution with parameter $t$, in the large $d$ limit. The latter distribution is defined in terms of the function $\zeta=\zeta_t(\theta)$ which solves the implicit equation $\zeta - t \tan \zeta = \theta$ and satisfies $$ \zeta_t(\theta)= \theta + t \tan (\theta + t \tan (\theta + t \tan (\theta +\ldots))), \qquad \mathrm{Im}\, \theta &gt;0, \;\; t&gt;0. $$</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for the tagged empirical field of a general interacting gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01516v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with rare events in a general {interacting gas} at high temperature, by means of Large Deviations Principles. The main result is an LDP for the tagged empirical field, which features the competition of an energy term and an entropy term. The approach to proving this Large Deviations Principle is to first deduce one for the tagged empirical field of non-interacting particles at high temperature, and upgrade that result to interacting particle systems.</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds for exit times on metric measure Dirichlet spaces and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05894v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming the heat kernel on a doubling Dirichlet metric measure space has a sub-Gaussian bound, we prove an asymptotically sharp spectral upper bound on the survival probability of the associated diffusion process. As a consequence, we can show that the supremum of the mean exit time over all starting points is finite if and only if the bottom of the spectrum is positive. Among several applications, we show that the spectral upper bound on the survival probability implies a bound for the Hot Spots constant for Riemannian manifolds. Our results apply to interesting geometric settings including sub-Riemannian manifolds and fractals.</description>

      <title>Triangle processes on graphs with given degree sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08499v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The switch chain is a well-studied Markov chain which generates random graphs with a given degree sequence and has uniform stationary distribution. Motivated by the high number of triangles seen in some real-world networks, we study a variant of the switch chain which is more likely to produce graphs with higher numbers of triangles. Specifically, we apply a Metropolis scheme designed to have the following stationary distribution: graph $G$ has probability proportional to $\lambda^{\min\{t(G),\nu\}}$, where $t(G)$ is the number of triangles in $G$ and $\nu$ is a cut-off value introduced to moderate the impact of graphs with a very high number of triangles. We assume that the "activity" $\lambda$ satisfies $\lambda\geq 1$, and call the resulting chain the modified Metropolis switch chain. We prove that the modified Metropolis switch chain is rapidly mixing whenever the (standard) switch chain is rapidly mixing, provided that the activity and maximum degree are not too large.
  The triangle switch (or "$\triangle$-switch") chain is a restriction of the switch chain which only performs switches that change the set of triangles in the graph. We prove that the $\triangle$-switch chain is irreducible for any degree sequence with minimum degree at least 3, and prove a rapid mixing result for the modified Metropolis $\triangle$-switch chain.
  Finally, we investigate the distribution of triangles in random graphs with given degrees, under both the uniform distribution and the distribution in which graph $G$ has probability proportional to $\lambda^{t(G)}$. Our analysis implies that the imposition of the cut-off $\nu$ does not significantly impact the behaviour of these modified Metropolis chains over polynomially many steps</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13781v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is concerned with fractional Gaussian fields, i.e. Gaussian fields whose covariance operator is given by the inverse fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^{-s}$ (where, in particular, we include the case $s &gt;1$). We define a lattice discretization of these fields and show that their scaling limits -- with respect to the optimal Besov space topology (up to an endpoint case) -- are the original continuous fields. As a byproduct, in dimension $d&lt;2s$, we prove the convergence in distribution of the maximum of the fields. A key tool in the proof is a sharp error estimate for the natural finite difference scheme for $(-\Delta)^s$ under minimal regularity assumptions, which is also of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Uniform convergence of Dyson Ferrari--Spohn diffusions to the Airy line ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Dyson Ferrari--Spohn diffusion $\mathcal{X}^N = (\mathcal{X}^N_1,\dots,\mathcal{X}^N_N)$, consisting of $N$ non-intersecting Ferrari--Spohn diffusions $\mathcal{X}^N_1 &gt; \cdots &gt; \mathcal{X}^N_N &gt; 0$ on $\mathbb{R}$. This object was introduced by Ioffe, Velenik, and Wachtel (2018) as a scaling limit for line ensembles of $N$ non-intersecting random walks above a hard wall with area tilts, which model certain three-dimensional interfaces in statistical physics. It was shown by Ferrari and Shlosman (2023) that as $N\to\infty$, after a spatial shift of order $N^{2/3}$ and constant rescaling in time, the top curve $\mathcal{X}^N_1$ converges to the $\mathrm{Airy}_2$ process in the sense of finite-dimensional distributions. We extend this result by showing that the full ensemble $\mathcal{X}^N$ converges with the same shift and time scaling to the Airy line ensemble in the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets. In our argument we formulate a Brownian Gibbs property with area tilts for $\mathcal{X}^N$, which we show is equivalent after a global parabolic shift to the usual Brownian Gibbs property introduced by Corwin and Hammond (2014).</description>

Abstract: The family of Boltzmann distributions is used in statistical mechanics to describe the distribution of states in systems with a given temperature. We give a novel characterization of this family as the unique one satisfying independence for uncoupled systems. The theorem boils down to a statement about endomorphisms of the convolution semigroup of finitely supported probability measures on the natural numbers, or, alternatively, about endomorphisms of the multiplicative semigroup of polynomials with non-negative coefficients.</description>

      <title>Bivariate Bernstein-gamma functions, potential measures, and asymptotics of exponential functionals of L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\xi$ be a L\'{e}vy process and $I_\xi(t):=\int_{0}^te^{-\xi_s}\mathrm{d} s$, $t\geq 0,$ be the exponential functional of L\'{e}vy processes on deterministic horizon. Given that $\lim_{t\to \infty}\xi_t=-\infty$ we evaluate for general functions $F$ an upper bound on the rate of decay of $\mathbb{E}\left(F(I_\xi(t))\right)$ based on an explicit integral criterion. When $\mathbb{E}\left(\xi_1\right)\in\left(-\infty,0\right)$ and $\mathbb{P}\left(\xi_1&gt;t\right)$ is regularly varying of index $\alpha&gt;1$ at infinity, we show that the law of $I_\xi(t)$, suitably normed and rescaled, converges weakly to a probability measure stemming from a new generalisation of the product factorisation of classical exponential functionals. These results substantially improve upon the existing literature and are obtained via a novel combination between Mellin inversion of the Laplace transform of $\mathbb{E}\left(I^{-a}_{\xi}(t)\mathbf{1}_{\left\{I_{\xi}(t)\leq x\right\}}\right)$, $a\in (0,1)$, $x\in(0,\infty],$ and Tauberian theory augmented for integer-valued $\alpha$ by a suitable application of the one-large jump principle in the context of the de Haan theory. The methodology rests upon the representation of the aforementioned Mellin transform in terms of the recently introduced bivariate Bernstein-gamma functions for which we develop the following new results of independent interest (for general $\xi$): we link these functions to the $q$-potentials of $\xi$; we show that their derivatives at zero are finite upon the finiteness of the aforementioned integral criterion; we offer neat estimates of those derivatives along complex lines. These results are useful in various applications of the exponential functionals themselves and in different contexts where properties of bivariate Bernstein-gamma functions are needed. $\xi$ need not be non-lattice.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the Gibbs measure of an interacting particle system with a general interaction kernel at various temperature regimes. We are particularly interested in fine features of the convergence to the mean-field density as the number of particles tends to infinity. Our main results are concentration bounds, and estimates on the Laplace transform of fluctuations. The main technique is a regularization procedure for general interaction kernels, based on an associated parabolic flow.</description>

      <title>A general approach to massive upper bound for two-point function with application to self-avoiding walk torus plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a sufficient condition for the two-point function of a statistical mechanical model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d &gt; 2$, to be bounded uniformly near a critical point by $|x|^{-(d-2)} \exp [ -c|x| / \xi ]$, where $\xi$ is the correlation length. The condition is given in terms of a convolution equation satisfied by the two-point function, and we verify the condition for strictly self-avoiding walk in dimensions $d &gt; 4$ using the lace expansion. As an example application, we use the uniform bound to study the self-avoiding walk on a $d$-dimensional discrete torus with $d &gt; 4$, proving a ``plateau'' of the torus two-point function, a result previously obtained for weakly self-avoiding walk in dimensions $d &gt; 4$ by Slade. Our method has the potential to be applied to other statistical mechanical models on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ or on the torus.</description>

Abstract: We show pathwise uniqueness of multiplicative SDEs, in arbitrary dimensions, driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in (1/3,1)$ with volatility coefficient $\sigma$ that is at least $\gamma$-H\"older continuous for $\gamma &gt; \frac{1}{2H} \vee \frac{1-H}{H}$. This improves upon the long-standing results of [Lyo94 , Lyo98 , Dav08] which cover the same regime but require $\sigma$ to be at least $\frac{1}{H}$-H\"older continuous. Our central innovation is to combine stochastic averaging estimates with refined versions of the stochastic sewing lemma, due to [L\^e20, Ger22, MP22].</description>

      <title>Convergence to stationary measures for the half-space log-gamma polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the point-to-point half-space log-gamma polymer model in the unbound phase. We prove that the free energy increment process on the anti-diagonal path converges to the top marginal of a two-layer Markov chain with an explicit description, which can be interpreted as two random walks conditioned softly never to intersect. This limiting law is a stationary measure for the polymer on the anti-diagonal path.
  The starting point of our analysis is an embedding of the free energy into the half-space log-gamma line ensemble recently constructed by Barraquand, Corwin, and Das. Given the Gibbsian line ensemble structure, the main contribution of our work lies in developing a route to access and prove convergence to stationary measures via line ensemble techniques. Our argument relies on a description of the limiting behavior of two softly non-intersecting random walk bridges around their starting point, a result established in this paper that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hard-core model has as its configurations the independent sets of some graph instance $G$. The probability distribution on independent sets is controlled by a `fugacity' $\lambda&gt;0$, with higher $\lambda$ leading to denser configurations. We investigate the mixing time of Glauber (single-site) dynamics for the hard-core model on restricted classes of bounded-degree graphs in which a particular graph $H$ is excluded as an induced subgraph. If $H$ is a subdivided claw then, for all $\lambda$, the mixing time is $O(n\log n)$, where $n$ is the order of $G$. This extends a result of Chen and Gu for claw-free graphs. When $H$ is a path, the set of possible instances is finite. For all other $H$, the mixing time is exponential in $n$ for sufficiently large $\lambda$, depending on $H$ and the maximum degree of $G$.</description>

Abstract: We establish a new comparison between the Legendre transform of the cumulant generating function and the half-space depth of an arbitrary log-concave probability distribution on the real line, that carries on to the multidimensional setting. Combined with sharp estimates for the Cram\'{e}r transform of rotationally invariant measures, we are led to some new phase-transition type results for the asymptotics of the expected measure of random polytopes. As a byproduct of our analysis, we address a question on the sharp exponential separability constant for log-concave distributions, in the symmetric case.</description>

This is the invariant Gibbs measure for the dynamical $\Phi^3_2$-models. From our sharp estimates for the partition function, we establish a concentration phenomenon of the $\Phi^3_2$-measure around the zero field, leading to a triviality result in the infinite volume: the ensemble collapses onto a delta function on the zero field.</description>

      <title>Small ball probabilities for the passage time in planar first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study planar first-passage percolation with independent weights whose common distribution is supported in $(0,\infty)$ and is absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. We prove that the passage time from $x$ to $y$ denoted by $T(x,y)$ satisfies $$\max _{a\ge 0} \mathbb P \big( T(x,y)\in [a,a+1] \big) \le \frac{C}{\sqrt{\log \|x-y\|}},$$ answering a question posed by Ahlberg and de la Riva. This estimate recovers earlier results on the fluctuations of the passage time by Newman--Piza, Pemantle--Peres, and Chatterjee.</description>

Abstract: We consider a stochastic partial differential equation with piecewise constant coefficients driven by a multiplicative space-time white noise. The existence and uniqueness of the mild solution in Walsh sense is established. We mainly study the limit behavior of the temporal quartic variation of the mild solution.

      <description>arXiv:2501.00719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and study a system of Schr\"odinger's problems and functional equations in probability theory. More precisely, we consider a system of variational problems of relative entropies for probability measures on a Euclidean space with given two endpoint marginals, which can be defined inductively. We also consider an inductively defined system of functional equations, which are Euler's equations for our variational problems. These are generalizations of Schr\"odinger's problem and functional equation. % in probability theory. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions to our functional equations, % up to a multiplicative function, from which we show the existence and uniqueness of a minimizer of our variational problem. Our problem gives an approach for a stochastic optimal transport analog of the Knothe--Rosenblatt rearrangement
  via a variational problem point of view.</description>

Abstract: We consider stochastic different equations on $\mathbb R^d$ with coefficients depending on the path and distribution for the whole history. Under a local integrability condition on the time-spatial singular drift, the well-posedness and Lipschitz continuity in initial values are proved, which is new even in the distribution independent case. Moreover, under a monotone condition, the asymptotic log-Harnack inequality is established, which extends the corresponding result of [5] derived in the distribution independent case.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Limits for Measure-Valued Queueing Models Without State Space Collapse, With Application to General Random Order of Service Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Currently, there is no general theory for deriving diffusion approximations of queueing systems with high- or infinite-dimensional state descriptors. In this paper, we address this by developing a novel framework for deriving diffusion limit equations of queueing models. The method hinges on a martingale decomposition of dynamics driven by time-changed renewal processes, which are a common feature of many queueing models. We then prove a central limit theorem for models decomposed in this way, which gives the form of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that will be satisfied in the diffusion limit of such a system. Unlike existing approaches, our framework does not require state space collapse or tractable workload representations, enabling its application to systems with features such as reneging. We demonstrate the approach on a multiclass, multi-server random order of service queue with reneging and generally distributed interarrival, service, and patience times. In this setting, the state descriptor is measure-valued and the workload is nonlinear in the fluid limit. We prove tightness and derive SDEs satisfied by the diffusion limit. Our results offer a broadly applicable method for diffusion approximations in complex queueing systems without relying on dimension reductions or model-specific structure.</description>

Abstract: We derive non-linear stochastic Fokker-Planck equation from stochastic systems particles with individual and environmental noise via relative entropy method, with pathwise quantitative bounds. Moreover, we prove the existence of a unique strong solution to the associated Fokker-Planck equation. Our proof is based on tools from PDE analysis, stochastic analysis, functional inequalities, and also we use the dissipation of entropy which provides some bound on the Fisher information of the particle system. The approach applies to repulsive and attractive kernels.</description>

      <title>Extremal process of the local time of simple random walk on a regular tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a continuous-time simple random walk on a regular rooted tree of depth $n$ in two settings: either the walk is started from a leaf vertex and run until the tree root is first hit or it is started from the root and run until it has spent a prescribed amount of time there. In both cases we show that the extremal process associated with centered square-root local time on the leaves tends, as $n\to\infty$, to a decorated Poisson point process with a random intensity measure. While the intensity measure is specific to the local-time problem at hand, the decorations are exactly those for the tree-indexed Markov chain (a.k.a. Branching Random Walk or Gaussian Free Field) with normal step distribution. The proof demonstrates the latter by way of a Lindeberg-type swap of the decorations of the two processes which itself relies on a well-known isomorphism theorem.</description>

      <title>How good is your Laplace approximation of the Bayesian posterior? Finite-sample computable error bounds for a variety of useful divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.14992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laplace approximation is a popular method for constructing a Gaussian approximation to the Bayesian posterior and thereby approximating the posterior mean and variance. But approximation quality is a concern. One might consider using rate-of-convergence bounds from certain versions of the Bayesian Central Limit Theorem (BCLT) to provide quality guarantees. But existing bounds require assumptions that are unrealistic even for relatively simple real-life Bayesian analyses; more specifically, existing bounds either (1) require knowing the true data-generating parameter, (2) are asymptotic in the number of samples, (3) do not control the Bayesian posterior mean, or (4) require strongly log concave models to compute. In this work, we provide the first computable bounds on quality that simultaneously (1) do not require knowing the true parameter, (2) apply to finite samples, (3) control posterior means and variances, and (4) apply generally to models that satisfy the conditions of the asymptotic BCLT. Moreover, we substantially improve the dimension dependence of existing bounds; in fact, we achieve the lowest-order dimension dependence possible in the general case. We compute exact constants in our bounds for a variety of standard models, including logistic regression, and numerically demonstrate their utility. We provide a framework for analysis of more complex models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the null controllability for parabolic SPDEs involving both the state and the gradient of the state. To start with, an improved global Carleman estimate for linear forward (resp. backward) parabolic SPDEs with general random coefficients and square-integrable source terms is derived. Based on this, we further develop a new global Carleman estimate for linear forward (resp. backward) parabolic SPDEs with source terms in the Sobolev space of negative order, which enables us to deal with the global null controllability for linear backward (resp. forward) parabolic SPDEs with gradient terms. As a byproduct, a special energy-type estimate for the controlled system that explicitly depends on the parameters $\lambda,\mu$ and the weighted function $\theta$ is obtained, which makes it possible for extending the linear controllability to semi-linear backward (resp. forward) parabolic SPDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a resurgence of interest in incomplete U-statistics that only sum over a subset of kernel evaluations, due to their computational efficiency and asymptotic normality which can be leveraged to quantify the uncertainty of ensemble predictions in machine learning. In this paper, we study the weak convergences to normality of one such construction, the incomplete U-statistic with Bernoulli sampling, under three different regimes on the relative sizes of the raw sample and the computational budget. Under minimalistic moment assumptions, we establish accompanying Berry-Esseen bounds with the natural rates that characterize the accuracy of these normal approximations. The key ingredients in our proofs include a variable censoring technique and a methodology for establishing Berry-Esseen bounds for the so-called Studentized nonlinear statistics recently formalized in the Stein's method literature, as well as an exponential lower tail bound for non-negative kernel U-statistics.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the global well-posedness and interior regularity for the 2D Navier-Stokes equations driven by a fractional noise acting as an inhomogeneous Dirichlet-type boundary condition. The model describes a vertical slice of the ocean with a relative motion between the two surfaces and can be thought of as a stochastic variant of the Couette flow. The relative motion of the surfaces is modeled by a Gaussian noise which is coloured in space and fractional in time with Hurst parameter greater than 3/4.</description>

      <title>The loop equations for noncommutative geometries on quivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a path integral over Dirac operators that averages over noncommutative geometries on a fixed graph, as the title reveals, using quiver representations. We prove algebraic relations that are satisfied by the expectation value of the respective observables, computed in terms of integrals over unitary groups, with weights defined by the spectral action. These equations generalise the Makeenko-Migdal equations -- the constraints of lattice gauge theory -- from lattices to arbitrary graphs. As a perspective, our loop equations are combined with positivity conditions (on a matrix parametrised by composition of Wilson loops). On a simple quiver this combination known as `bootstrap' is fully worked out. The respective partition function boils down to an integral known as Gross-Witten-Wadia model; their solution confirms the solution bootstrapped by our loop equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of polynomials that we call fused Specht polynomials and use them to characterize irreducible representations of the fused Hecke algebra with parameter $q=-1$ in the space of polynomials. We apply the fused Specht polynomials to construct a basis for a space of holomorphic (chiral) conformal blocks with central charge $c=1$ which are degenerate at each point. In conformal field theory, this corresponds to all primary fields having conformal weight in the Kac table. The associated correlation functions are expected to give rise to conformally invariant boundary conditions for the Gaussian free field, which has also been verified in special cases.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we consider the 3D Cauchy problem for a coupled system arising in biomathematics, consisting of a chemotaxis model with a cubic logistic source and the stochastic tamed Navier-Stokes equations (STCNS, for short). Our main goal is to establish the existence and uniqueness of a global strong solution (strong in both the probabilistic and PDE senses) for the 3D STCNS system with large initial data. To achieve this, we first introduce a triple approximation scheme by using the Friedrichs mollifier, frequency truncation operators, and cut-off functions. This scheme enables the construction of sufficiently smooth approximate solutions and facilitates the effective application of the entropy-energy method. Then, based on a newly derived stochastic version of the entropy-energy inequality, we further establish some a priori higher-order energy estimates, which together with the stochastic compactness method, allow us to construct the strong solution for the STCNS system.</description>
