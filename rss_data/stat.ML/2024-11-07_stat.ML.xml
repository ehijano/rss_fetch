      <title>Solving stochastic partial differential equations using neural networks in the Wiener chaos expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) numerically by using (possibly random) neural networks in the truncated Wiener chaos expansion of their corresponding solution. Moreover, we provide some approximation rates for learning the solution of SPDEs with additive and/or multiplicative noise. Finally, we apply our results in numerical examples to approximate the solution of three SPDEs: the stochastic heat equation, the Heath-Jarrow-Morton equation, and the Zakai equation.</description>

      <title>Designing a Linearized Potential Function in Neural Network Optimization Using Csisz\'{a}r Type of Tsallis Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, learning for neural networks can be viewed as optimization in the space of probability measures. To obtain the exponential convergence to the optimizer, the regularizing term based on Shannon entropy plays an important role. Even though an entropy function heavily affects convergence results, there is almost no result on its generalization, because of the following two technical difficulties: one is the lack of sufficient condition for generalized logarithmic Sobolev inequality, and the other is the distributional dependence of the potential function within the gradient flow equation. In this paper, we establish a framework that utilizes a linearized potential function via Csisz\'{a}r type of Tsallis entropy, which is one of the generalized entropies. We also show that our new framework enable us to derive an exponential convergence result.</description>

      <title>A Subsampling Based Neural Network for Spatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of deep neural networks in geospatial data has become a trending research problem in the present day. A significant amount of statistical research has already been introduced, such as generalized least square optimization by incorporating spatial variance-covariance matrix, considering basis functions in the input nodes of the neural networks, and so on. However, for lattice data, there is no available literature about the utilization of asymptotic analysis of neural networks in regression for spatial data. This article proposes a consistent localized two-layer deep neural network-based regression for spatial data. We have proved the consistency of this deep neural network for bounded and unbounded spatial domains under a fixed sampling design of mixed-increasing spatial regions. We have proved that its asymptotic convergence rate is faster than that of \cite{zhan2024neural}'s neural network and an improved generalization of \cite{shen2023asymptotic}'s neural network structure. We empirically observe the rate of convergence of discrepancy measures between the empirical probability distribution of observed and predicted data, which will become faster for a less smooth spatial surface. We have applied our asymptotic analysis of deep neural networks to the estimation of the monthly average temperature of major cities in the USA from its satellite image. This application is an effective showcase of non-linear spatial regression. We demonstrate our methodology with simulated lattice data in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Improved Regret of Linear Ensemble Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we close the fundamental gap of theory and practice by providing an improved regret bound for linear ensemble sampling. We prove that with an ensemble size logarithmic in $T$, linear ensemble sampling can achieve a frequentist regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$, matching state-of-the-art results for randomized linear bandit algorithms, where $d$ and $T$ are the dimension of the parameter and the time horizon respectively. Our approach introduces a general regret analysis framework for linear bandit algorithms. Additionally, we reveal a significant relationship between linear ensemble sampling and Linear Perturbed-History Exploration (LinPHE), showing that LinPHE is a special case of linear ensemble sampling when the ensemble size equals $T$. This insight allows us to derive a new regret bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ for LinPHE, independent of the number of arms. Our contributions advance the theoretical foundation of ensemble sampling, bringing its regret bounds in line with the best known bounds for other randomized exploration algorithms.</description>

      <title>Partial Structure Discovery is Sufficient for No-regret Learning in Causal Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal knowledge about the relationships among decision variables and a reward variable in a bandit setting can accelerate the learning of an optimal decision. Current works often assume the causal graph is known, which may not always be available a priori. Motivated by this challenge, we focus on the causal bandit problem in scenarios where the underlying causal graph is unknown and may include latent confounders. While intervention on the parents of the reward node is optimal in the absence of latent confounders, this is not necessarily the case in general. Instead, one must consider a set of possibly optimal arms/interventions, each being a special subset of the ancestors of the reward node, making causal discovery beyond the parents of the reward node essential. For regret minimization, we identify that discovering the full causal structure is unnecessary; however, no existing work provides the necessary and sufficient components of the causal graph. We formally characterize the set of necessary and sufficient latent confounders one needs to detect or learn to ensure that all possibly optimal arms are identified correctly. We also propose a randomized algorithm for learning the causal graph with a limited number of samples, providing a sample complexity guarantee for any desired confidence level. In the causal bandit setup, we propose a two-stage approach. In the first stage, we learn the induced subgraph on ancestors of the reward, along with a necessary and sufficient subset of latent confounders, to construct the set of possibly optimal arms. The regret incurred during this phase scales polynomially with respect to the number of nodes in the causal graph. The second phase involves the application of a standard bandit algorithm, such as the UCB algorithm. We also establish a regret bound for our two-phase approach, which is sublinear in the number of rounds.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal and Tractable Estimation under Shift-Invariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How hard is it to estimate a discrete-time signal $(x_{1}, ..., x_{n}) \in \mathbb{C}^n$ satisfying an unknown linear recurrence relation of order $s$ and observed in i.i.d. complex Gaussian noise? The class of all such signals is parametric but extremely rich: it contains all exponential polynomials over $\mathbb{C}$ with total degree $s$, including harmonic oscillations with $s$ arbitrary frequencies. Geometrically, this class corresponds to the projection onto $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ of the union of all shift-invariant subspaces of $\mathbb{C}^\mathbb{Z}$ of dimension $s$. We show that the statistical complexity of this class, as measured by the squared minimax radius of the $(1-\delta)$-confidence $\ell_2$-ball, is nearly the same as for the class of $s$-sparse signals, namely $O\left(s\log(en) + \log(\delta^{-1})\right) \cdot \log^2(es) \cdot \log(en/s).$ Moreover, the corresponding near-minimax estimator is tractable, and it can be used to build a test statistic with a near-minimax detection threshold in the associated detection problem. These statistical results rest upon an approximation-theoretic one: we show that finite-dimensional shift-invariant subspaces admit compactly supported reproducing kernels whose Fourier spectra have nearly the smallest possible $\ell_p$-norms, for all $p \in [1,+\infty]$ at once.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Aleatoric Uncertainty of the Treatment Effect: A Novel Orthogonal Learner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating causal quantities from observational data is crucial for understanding the safety and effectiveness of medical treatments. However, to make reliable inferences, medical practitioners require not only estimating averaged causal quantities, such as the conditional average treatment effect, but also understanding the randomness of the treatment effect as a random variable. This randomness is referred to as aleatoric uncertainty and is necessary for understanding the probability of benefit from treatment or quantiles of the treatment effect. Yet, the aleatoric uncertainty of the treatment effect has received surprisingly little attention in the causal machine learning community. To fill this gap, we aim to quantify the aleatoric uncertainty of the treatment effect at the covariate-conditional level, namely, the conditional distribution of the treatment effect (CDTE). Unlike average causal quantities, the CDTE is not point identifiable without strong additional assumptions. As a remedy, we employ partial identification to obtain sharp bounds on the CDTE and thereby quantify the aleatoric uncertainty of the treatment effect. We then develop a novel, orthogonal learner for the bounds on the CDTE, which we call AU-learner. We further show that our AU-learner has several strengths in that it satisfies Neyman-orthogonality and is doubly robust. Finally, we propose a fully-parametric deep learning instantiation of our AU-learner.</description>

      <title>Reducing Hyperparameter Tuning Costs in ML, Vision and Language Model Training Pipelines via Memoization-Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training or fine-tuning of machine learning, vision, and language models is often implemented as a pipeline: a sequence of stages encompassing data preparation, model training and evaluation. In this paper, we exploit pipeline structures to reduce the cost of hyperparameter tuning for model training/fine-tuning, which is particularly valuable for language models given their high costs in GPU-days. We propose a "memoization-aware" Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm, EEIPU, that works in tandem with a pipeline caching system, allowing it to evaluate significantly more hyperparameter candidates per GPU-day than other tuning algorithms. The result is better-quality hyperparameters in the same amount of search time, or equivalently, reduced search time to reach the same hyperparameter quality. In our benchmarks on machine learning (model ensembles), vision (convolutional architecture) and language (T5 architecture) pipelines, we compare EEIPU against recent BO algorithms: EEIPU produces an average of $103\%$ more hyperparameter candidates (within the same budget), and increases the validation metric by an average of $108\%$ more than other algorithms (where the increase is measured starting from the end of warm-up iterations).</description>

      <title>Optimal Defenses Against Gradient Reconstruction Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed to prevent data leakage through collaborative model training without centralized data storage. However, it remains vulnerable to gradient reconstruction attacks that recover original training data from shared gradients. To optimize the trade-off between data leakage and utility loss, we first derive a theoretical lower bound of reconstruction error (among all attackers) for the two standard methods: adding noise, and gradient pruning. We then customize these two defenses to be parameter- and model-specific and achieve the optimal trade-off between our obtained reconstruction lower bound and model utility. Experimental results validate that our methods outperform Gradient Noise and Gradient Pruning by protecting the training data better while also achieving better utility.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference on the Boolean Hypercube with the Quantum Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive variational inference upper-bounds on the log-partition function of pairwise Markov random fields on the Boolean hypercube, based on quantum relaxations of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We then propose an efficient algorithm to compute these bounds based on primal-dual optimization. An improvement of these bounds through the use of ''hierarchies,'' similar to sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchies is proposed, and we present a greedy algorithm to select among these relaxations. We carry extensive numerical experiments and compare with state-of-the-art methods for this inference problem.</description>

      <title>Multilingual hierarchical classification of job advertisements for job vacancy statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop a multilingual classifier and conditional probability estimator of occupation codes for online job advertisements according in accordance with the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) extended with the Polish Classification of Occupations and Specializations (KZiS), which is analogous to the European Classification of Occupations. In this paper, we utilise a range of data sources, including a novel one, namely the Central Job Offers Database, which is a register of all vacancies submitted to Public Employment Offices. Their staff members code the vacancies according to the ISCO and KZiS. A hierarchical multi-class classifier has been developed based on the transformer architecture. The classifier begins by encoding the jobs found in advertisements to the widest 1-digit occupational group, and then narrows the assignment to a 6-digit occupation code. We show that incorporation of the hierarchical structure of occupations improves prediction accuracy by 1-2 percentage points, particularly for the hand-coded online job advertisements. Finally, a bilingual (Polish and English) and multilingual (24 languages) model is developed based on data translated using closed and open-source software. The open-source software is provided for the benefit of the official statistics community, with a particular focus on international comparability.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Transfer Reinforcement Learning: Provable Sample Efficiency from Shifted-Dynamics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online Reinforcement learning (RL) typically requires high-stakes online interaction data to learn a policy for a target task. This prompts interest in leveraging historical data to improve sample efficiency. The historical data may come from outdated or related source environments with different dynamics. It remains unclear how to effectively use such data in the target task to provably enhance learning and sample efficiency. To address this, we propose a hybrid transfer RL (HTRL) setting, where an agent learns in a target environment while accessing offline data from a source environment with shifted dynamics. We show that -- without information on the dynamics shift -- general shifted-dynamics data, even with subtle shifts, does not reduce sample complexity in the target environment. However, with prior information on the degree of the dynamics shift, we design HySRL, a transfer algorithm that achieves problem-dependent sample complexity and outperforms pure online RL. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that HySRL surpasses state-of-the-art online RL baseline.</description>

      <title>GUIDE-VAE: Advancing Data Generation with User Information and Pattern Dictionaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative modelling of multi-user datasets has become prominent in science and engineering. Generating a data point for a given user requires employing user information, and conventional generative models, including variational autoencoders (VAEs), often ignore that. This paper introduces GUIDE-VAE, a novel conditional generative model that leverages user embeddings to generate user-guided data. By allowing the model to benefit from shared patterns across users, GUIDE-VAE enhances performance in multi-user settings, even under significant data imbalance. In addition to integrating user information, GUIDE-VAE incorporates a pattern dictionary-based covariance composition (PDCC) to improve the realism of generated samples by capturing complex feature dependencies. While user embeddings drive performance gains, PDCC addresses common issues such as noise and over-smoothing typically seen in VAEs.
  The proposed GUIDE-VAE was evaluated on a multi-user smart meter dataset characterized by substantial data imbalance across users. Quantitative results show that GUIDE-VAE performs effectively in both synthetic data generation and missing record imputation tasks, while qualitative evaluations reveal that GUIDE-VAE produces more plausible and less noisy data. These results establish GUIDE-VAE as a promising tool for controlled, realistic data generation in multi-user datasets, with potential applications across various domains requiring user-informed modelling.</description>

      <title>Weighted Sobolev Approximation Rates for Neural Networks on Unbounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the approximation capabilities of shallow neural networks in weighted Sobolev spaces for functions in the spectral Barron space. The existing literature already covers several cases, in which the spectral Barron space can be approximated well, i.e., without curse of dimensionality, by shallow networks and several different classes of activation function. The limitations of the existing results are mostly on the error measures that were considered, in which the results are restricted to Sobolev spaces over a bounded domain. We will here treat two cases that extend upon the existing results. Namely, we treat the case with bounded domain and Muckenhoupt weights and the case, where the domain is allowed to be unbounded and the weights are required to decay. We first present embedding results for the more general weighted Fourier-Lebesgue spaces in the weighted Sobolev spaces and then we establish asymptotic approximation rates for shallow neural networks that come without curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Mind the spikes: Benign overfitting of kernels and neural networks in fixed dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of over-parameterized neural networks trained to near-zero training error has caused great interest in the phenomenon of benign overfitting, where estimators are statistically consistent even though they interpolate noisy training data. While benign overfitting in fixed dimension has been established for some learning methods, current literature suggests that for regression with typical kernel methods and wide neural networks, benign overfitting requires a high-dimensional setting where the dimension grows with the sample size. In this paper, we show that the smoothness of the estimators, and not the dimension, is the key: benign overfitting is possible if and only if the estimator's derivatives are large enough. We generalize existing inconsistency results to non-interpolating models and more kernels to show that benign overfitting with moderate derivatives is impossible in fixed dimension. Conversely, we show that rate-optimal benign overfitting is possible for regression with a sequence of spiky-smooth kernels with large derivatives. Using neural tangent kernels, we translate our results to wide neural networks. We prove that while infinite-width networks do not overfit benignly with the ReLU activation, this can be fixed by adding small high-frequency fluctuations to the activation function. Our experiments verify that such neural networks, while overfitting, can indeed generalize well even on low-dimensional data sets.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Distributionally Robust Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article focuses on a class of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems where, unlike the growing body of the literature, the objective function is potentially nonlinear in the distribution. Existing methods to optimize nonlinear functions in probability space use the Frechet derivatives, which present theoretical and computational challenges. Motivated by this, we propose an alternative notion for the derivative and corresponding smoothness based on Gateaux (G)-derivative for generic risk measures. These concepts are explained via three running risk measure examples of variance, entropic risk, and risk on finite support sets. We then propose a G-derivative-based Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm for generic nonlinear optimization problems in probability spaces and establish its convergence under the proposed notion of smoothness in a completely norm-independent manner. We use the set-up of the FW algorithm to devise a methodology to compute a saddle point of the nonlinear DRO problem. Finally, we validate our theoretical results on two cases of the $entropic$ and $variance$ risk measures in the context of portfolio selection problems. In particular, we analyze their regularity conditions and "sufficient statistic", compute the respective FW-oracle in various settings, and confirm the theoretical outcomes through numerical validation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Content Moderation with Culturally-Aware Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Content moderation on a global scale must navigate a complex array of local cultural distinctions, which can hinder effective enforcement. While global policies aim for consistency and broad applicability, they often miss the subtleties of regional language interpretation, cultural beliefs, and local legislation. This work introduces a flexible framework that enhances foundation language models with cultural knowledge. Our approach involves fine-tuning encoder-decoder models on media-diet data to capture cultural nuances, and applies a continued training regime to effectively integrate these models into a content moderation pipeline. We evaluate this framework in a case study of an online podcast platform with content spanning various regions. The results show that our culturally adapted models improve the accuracy of local violation detection and offer explanations that align more closely with regional cultural norms. Our findings reinforce the need for an adaptable content moderation approach that remains flexible in response to the diverse cultural landscapes it operates in and represents a step towards a more equitable and culturally sensitive framework for content moderation, demonstrating what is achievable in this domain.</description>

      <title>Parameter uncertainties for imperfect surrogate models in the low-noise regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01810v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian regression determines model parameters by minimizing the expected loss, an upper bound to the true generalization error. However, the loss ignores misspecification, where models are imperfect. Parameter uncertainties from Bayesian regression are thus significantly underestimated and vanish in the large data limit. This is particularly problematic when building models of low-noise, or near-deterministic, calculations, as the main source of uncertainty is neglected. We analyze the generalization error of misspecified, near-deterministic surrogate models, a regime of broad relevance in science and engineering. We show posterior distributions must cover every training point to avoid a divergent generalization error and design an ansatz that respects this constraint, which for linear models incurs minimal overhead. This is demonstrated on model problems before application to thousand dimensional datasets in atomistic machine learning. Our efficient misspecification-aware scheme gives accurate prediction and bounding of test errors where existing schemes fail, allowing this important source of uncertainty to be incorporated in computational workflows.</description>

      <title>Root Cause Analysis of Outliers with Missing Structural Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work conceptualized root cause analysis (RCA) of anomalies via quantitative contribution analysis using causal counterfactuals in structural causal models (SCMs).The framework comes with three practical challenges: (1) it requires the causal directed acyclic graph (DAG), together with an SCM, (2) it is statistically ill-posed since it probes regression models in regions of low probability density, (3) it relies on Shapley values which are computationally expensive to find.
  In this paper, we propose simplified, efficient methods of root cause analysis when the task is to identify a unique root cause instead of quantitative contribution analysis. Our proposed methods run in linear order of SCM nodes and they require only the causal DAG without counterfactuals. Furthermore, for those use cases where the causal DAG is unknown, we justify the heuristic of identifying root causes as the variables with the highest anomaly score. To this end, we prove that anomalies with small scores are unlikely to cause those with large scores and show upper bounds for the likelihood of causal pathways with non-monotonic anomaly scores.</description>

      <title>Communication-Efficient Adaptive Batch Size Strategies for Distributed Local Gradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern deep neural networks often require distributed training with many workers due to their large size. As the number of workers increases, communication overheads become the main bottleneck in data-parallel minibatch stochastic gradient methods with per-iteration gradient synchronization. Local gradient methods like Local SGD reduce communication by only synchronizing model parameters and/or gradients after several local steps. Despite an understanding of their convergence and the importance of batch sizes for training efficiency and generalization, optimal batch sizes for local gradient methods are difficult to determine. We introduce adaptive batch size strategies for local gradient methods that increase batch sizes adaptively to reduce minibatch gradient variance. We provide convergence guarantees under homogeneous data conditions and support our claims with image classification and language modeling experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategies for both training efficiency and generalization.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to employ the language of Cartan moving frames to study the geometry of the data manifolds and its Riemannian structure, via the data information metric and its curvature at data points. Using this framework and through experiments, explanations on the response of a neural network are given by pointing out the output classes that are easily reachable from a given input. This emphasizes how the proposed mathematical relationship between the output of the network and the geometry of its inputs can be exploited as an explainable artificial intelligence tool.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Multi-Task Learning on ReLU Neural Network Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the properties of solutions to multi-task shallow ReLU neural network learning problems, wherein the network is trained to fit a dataset with minimal sum of squared weights. Remarkably, the solutions learned for each individual task resemble those obtained by solving a kernel method, revealing a novel connection between neural networks and kernel methods. It is known that single-task neural network training problems are equivalent to minimum norm interpolation problem in a non-Hilbertian Banach space, and that the solutions of such problems are generally non-unique. In contrast, we prove that the solutions to univariate-input, multi-task neural network interpolation problems are almost always unique, and coincide with the solution to a minimum-norm interpolation problem in a Sobolev (Reproducing Kernel) Hilbert Space. We also demonstrate a similar phenomenon in the multivariate-input case; specifically, we show that neural network learning problems with large numbers of diverse tasks are approximately equivalent to an $\ell^2$ (Hilbert space) minimization problem over a fixed kernel determined by the optimal neurons.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent Finds Over-Parameterized Neural Networks with Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression: A Distribution-Free Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression by an over-parameterized two-layer neural network trained by gradient descent (GD) in this paper. We show that, if the neural network is trained by GD with early stopping, then the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of $\cO(\eps_n^2)$, which is the same rate as that for the classical kernel regression trained by GD with early stopping, where $\eps_n$ is the critical population rate of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the network and $n$ is the size of the training data. It is remarked that our result does not require distributional assumptions on the training data, in a strong contrast with many existing results which rely on specific distributions such as the spherical uniform data distribution or distributions satisfying certain restrictive conditions. The rate $\cO(\eps_n^2)$ is known to be minimax optimal for specific cases, such as the case that the NTK has a polynomial eigenvalue decay rate which happens under certain distributional assumptions. Our result formally fills the gap between training a classical kernel regression model and training an over-parameterized but finite-width neural network by GD for nonparametric regression without distributional assumptions. We also provide confirmative answers to certain open questions or address particular concerns in the literature of training over-parameterized neural networks by GD with early stopping for nonparametric regression, including the characterization of the stopping time, the lower bound for the network width, and the constant learning rate used in GD.</description>

      <title>Robustifying automatic speech recognition by extracting slowly varying features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.07400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past few years, it has been shown that deep learning systems are highly vulnerable under attacks with adversarial examples. Neural-network-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are no exception. Targeted and untargeted attacks can modify an audio input signal in such a way that humans still recognise the same words, while ASR systems are steered to predict a different transcription. In this paper, we propose a defense mechanism against targeted adversarial attacks consisting in removing fast-changing features from the audio signals, either by applying slow feature analysis, a low-pass filter, or both, before feeding the input to the ASR system. We perform an empirical analysis of hybrid ASR models trained on data pre-processed in such a way. While the resulting models perform quite well on benign data, they are significantly more robust against targeted adversarial attacks: Our final, proposed model shows a performance on clean data similar to the baseline model, while being more than four times more robust.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference on the Final-Layer Output of Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02420v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks are simple to train but they typically produce overconfident predictions. In contrast, Bayesian neural networks provide good uncertainty quantification but optimizing them is time consuming due to the large parameter space. This paper proposes to combine the advantages of both approaches by performing Variational Inference in the Final layer Output space (VIFO), because the output space is much smaller than the parameter space. We use neural networks to learn the mean and the variance of the probabilistic output. Using the Bayesian formulation we incorporate collapsed variational inference with VIFO which significantly improves the performance in practice. On the other hand, like standard, non-Bayesian models, VIFO enjoys simple training and one can use Rademacher complexity to provide risk bounds for the model. Experiments show that VIFO provides a good tradeoff in terms of run time and uncertainty quantification, especially for out of distribution data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove explicit bounds on the exponential rate of convergence for the momentum stochastic gradient descent scheme (MSGD) for arbitrary, fixed hyperparameters (learning rate, friction parameter) and its continuous-in-time counterpart in the context of non-convex optimization. In the small step-size regime and in the case of flat minima or large noise intensities, these bounds prove faster convergence of MSGD compared to plain stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The results are shown for objective functions satisfying a local Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality and under assumptions on the variance of MSGD that are satisfied in overparametrized settings. Moreover, we analyze the optimal choice of the friction parameter and show that the MSGD process almost surely converges to a local minimum.</description>

      <title>Density Ratio Estimation-based Bayesian Optimization with Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization has attracted huge attention from diverse research areas in science and engineering, since it is capable of efficiently finding a global optimum of an expensive-to-evaluate black-box function. In general, a probabilistic regression model is widely used as a surrogate function to model an explicit distribution over function evaluations given an input to estimate and a training dataset. Beyond the probabilistic regression-based methods, density ratio estimation-based Bayesian optimization has been suggested in order to estimate a density ratio of the groups relatively close and relatively far to a global optimum. Developing this line of research further, supervised classifiers are employed to estimate a class probability for the two groups instead of a density ratio. However, the supervised classifiers used in this strategy are prone to be overconfident for known knowledge on global solution candidates. Supposing that we have access to unlabeled points, e.g., predefined fixed-size pools, we propose density ratio estimation-based Bayesian optimization with semi-supervised learning to solve this challenge. Finally, we show the empirical results of our methods and several baseline methods in two distinct scenarios with unlabeled point sampling and a fixed-size pool and analyze the validity of our proposed methods in diverse experiments.</description>

Abstract: Identifying the relationship between healthcare attributes, lifestyles, and personality is vital for understanding and improving physical and mental well-being. Machine learning approaches are promising for modeling their relationships and offering actionable suggestions. In this paper, we propose Virtual Human Generative Model (VHGM), a machine learning model for estimating healthcare, lifestyles, and personality attributes. VHGM is a deep generative model trained with masked modeling to learn the joint distribution of attributes conditioned on known ones. Using heterogeneous tabular datasets, VHGM learns more than 2,000 attributes efficiently. We numerically evaluate the performance of VHGM and its training techniques and have deployed VHGM as a Web service, enabling various healthcare applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sampling from a multimodal distribution is a fundamental and challenging problem in computational science and statistics. Among various approaches proposed for this task, one popular method is Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). In this paper, we propose an ensemble-based version of AIS by combining it with population-based Monte Carlo methods to improve its efficiency. By keeping track of an ensemble instead of a single particle along some continuation path between the starting distribution and the target distribution, we take advantage of the interaction within the ensemble to encourage the exploration of undiscovered modes. Specifically, our main idea is to utilize either the snooker algorithm or the genetic algorithm used in Evolutionary Monte Carlo. We discuss how the proposed algorithm can be implemented and derive a partial differential equation governing the evolution of the ensemble under the continuous time and mean-field limit. We also test the efficiency of the proposed algorithm on various continuous and discrete distributions.</description>

Abstract: Oja's algorithm for Streaming Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for $n$ data-points in a $d$ dimensional space achieves the same sin-squared error $O(r_{\mathsf{eff}}/n)$ as the offline algorithm in $O(d)$ space and $O(nd)$ time and a single pass through the datapoints. Here $r_{\mathsf{eff}}$ is the effective rank (ratio of the trace and the principal eigenvalue of the population covariance matrix $\Sigma$). Under this computational budget, we consider the problem of sparse PCA, where the principal eigenvector of $\Sigma$ is $s$-sparse, and $r_{\mathsf{eff}}$ can be large. In this setting, to our knowledge, \textit{there are no known single-pass algorithms} that achieve the minimax error bound in $O(d)$ space and $O(nd)$ time without either requiring strong initialization conditions or assuming further structure (e.g., spiked) of the covariance matrix. We show that a simple single-pass procedure that thresholds the output of Oja's algorithm (the Oja vector) can achieve the minimax error bound under some regularity conditions in $O(d)$ space and $O(nd)$ time. We present a nontrivial and novel analysis of the entries of the unnormalized Oja vector, which involves the projection of a product of independent random matrices on a random initial vector. This is completely different from previous analyses of Oja's algorithm and matrix products, which have been done when the $r_{\mathsf{eff}}$ is bounded.</description>

      <title>Policy Mirror Descent with Lookahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) stands as a versatile algorithmic framework encompassing several seminal policy gradient algorithms such as natural policy gradient, with connections with state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms such as TRPO and PPO. PMD can be seen as a soft Policy Iteration algorithm implementing regularized 1-step greedy policy improvement. However, 1-step greedy policies might not be the best choice and recent remarkable empirical successes in RL such as AlphaGo and AlphaZero have demonstrated that greedy approaches with respect to multiple steps outperform their 1-step counterpart. In this work, we propose a new class of PMD algorithms called $h$-PMD which incorporates multi-step greedy policy improvement with lookahead depth $h$ to the PMD update rule. To solve discounted infinite horizon Markov Decision Processes with discount factor $\gamma$, we show that $h$-PMD which generalizes the standard PMD enjoys a faster dimension-free $\gamma^h$-linear convergence rate, contingent on the computation of multi-step greedy policies. We propose an inexact version of $h$-PMD where lookahead action values are estimated. Under a generative model, we establish a sample complexity for $h$-PMD which improves over prior work. Finally, we extend our result to linear function approximation to scale to large state spaces. Under suitable assumptions, our sample complexity only involves dependence on the dimension of the feature map space instead of the state space size.</description>

      <title>Applying Guidance in a Limited Interval Improves Sample and Distribution Quality in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Guidance is a crucial technique for extracting the best performance out of image-generating diffusion models. Traditionally, a constant guidance weight has been applied throughout the sampling chain of an image. We show that guidance is clearly harmful toward the beginning of the chain (high noise levels), largely unnecessary toward the end (low noise levels), and only beneficial in the middle. We thus restrict it to a specific range of noise levels, improving both the inference speed and result quality. This limited guidance interval improves the record FID in ImageNet-512 significantly, from 1.81 to 1.40. We show that it is quantitatively and qualitatively beneficial across different sampler parameters, network architectures, and datasets, including the large-scale setting of Stable Diffusion XL. We thus suggest exposing the guidance interval as a hyperparameter in all diffusion models that use guidance.</description>

      <title>Detecting critical treatment effect bias in small subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized trials are considered the gold standard for making informed decisions in medicine, yet they often lack generalizability to the patient populations in clinical practice. Observational studies, on the other hand, cover a broader patient population but are prone to various biases. Thus, before using an observational study for decision-making, it is crucial to benchmark its treatment effect estimates against those derived from a randomized trial. We propose a novel strategy to benchmark observational studies beyond the average treatment effect. First, we design a statistical test for the null hypothesis that the treatment effects estimated from the two studies, conditioned on a set of relevant features, differ up to some tolerance. We then estimate an asymptotically valid lower bound on the maximum bias strength for any subgroup in the observational study. Finally, we validate our benchmarking strategy in a real-world setting and show that it leads to conclusions that align with established medical knowledge.</description>

      <title>Model Reconstruction Using Counterfactual Explanations: A Perspective From Polytope Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations provide ways of achieving a favorable model outcome with minimum input perturbation. However, counterfactual explanations can also be leveraged to reconstruct the model by strategically training a surrogate model to give similar predictions as the original (target) model. In this work, we analyze how model reconstruction using counterfactuals can be improved by further leveraging the fact that the counterfactuals also lie quite close to the decision boundary. Our main contribution is to derive novel theoretical relationships between the error in model reconstruction and the number of counterfactual queries required using polytope theory. Our theoretical analysis leads us to propose a strategy for model reconstruction that we call Counterfactual Clamping Attack (CCA) which trains a surrogate model using a unique loss function that treats counterfactuals differently than ordinary instances. Our approach also alleviates the related problem of decision boundary shift that arises in existing model reconstruction approaches when counterfactuals are treated as ordinary instances. Experimental results demonstrate that our strategy improves fidelity between the target and surrogate model predictions on several datasets.</description>

      <title>Long-term foehn reconstruction combining unsupervised and supervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foehn winds, characterized by abrupt temperature increases and wind speed changes, significantly impact regions on the leeward side of mountain ranges, e.g., by spreading wildfires. Understanding how foehn occurrences change under climate change is crucial. Unfortunately, foehn cannot be measured directly but has to be inferred from meteorological measurements employing suitable classification schemes. Hence, this approach is typically limited to specific periods for which the necessary data are available. We present a novel approach for reconstructing historical foehn occurrences using a combination of unsupervised and supervised probabilistic statistical learning methods. We utilize in-situ measurements (available for recent decades) to train an unsupervised learner (finite mixture model) for automatic foehn classification. These labeled data are then linked to reanalysis data (covering longer periods) using a supervised learner (lasso or boosting). This allows to reconstruct past foehn probabilities based solely on reanalysis data. Applying this method to ERA5 reanalysis data for six stations across Switzerland and Austria achieves accurate hourly reconstructions of north and south foehn occurrence, respectively, dating back to 1940. This paves the way for investigating how seasonal foehn patterns have evolved over the past 83 years, providing valuable insights into climate change impacts on these critical wind events.</description>

      <title>Domain Adaptation for Offline Reinforcement Learning with Limited Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns effective policies from a static target dataset. Despite state-of-the-art (SOTA) offline RL algorithms being promising, they highly rely on the quality of the target dataset. The performance of SOTA algorithms can degrade in scenarios with limited samples in the target dataset, which is often the case in real-world applications. To address this issue, domain adaptation that leverages auxiliary samples from related source datasets (such as simulators) can be beneficial. In this context, determining the optimal way to trade off the source and target datasets remains a critical challenge in offline RL. To the best of our knowledge, this paper proposes the first framework that theoretically and experimentally explores how the weight assigned to each dataset affects the performance of offline RL. We establish the performance bounds and convergence neighborhood of our framework, both of which depend on the selection of the weight. Furthermore, we identify the existence of an optimal weight for balancing the two datasets. All theoretical guarantees and optimal weight depend on the quality of the source dataset and the size of the target dataset. Our empirical results on the well-known Procgen Benchmark substantiate our theoretical contributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes are based on a lecture delivered by NC on March 2021, as part of an advanced course in Princeton University on the mathematical understanding of deep learning. They present a theory (developed by NC, NR and collaborators) of linear neural networks -- a fundamental model in the study of optimization and generalization in deep learning. Practical applications born from the presented theory are also discussed. The theory is based on mathematical tools that are dynamical in nature. It showcases the potential of such tools to push the envelope of our understanding of optimization and generalization in deep learning. The text assumes familiarity with the basics of statistical learning theory. Exercises (without solutions) are included.</description>

      <title>Timer-XL: Long-Context Transformers for Unified Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Timer-XL, a generative Transformer for unified time series forecasting. To uniformly predict 1D and 2D time series, we generalize next token prediction, predominantly adopted for causal generation of 1D sequences, to multivariate next token prediction. The proposed paradigm uniformly formulates various forecasting scenarios as a long-context generation problem. We opt for the generative Transformer, which can capture global-range and causal dependencies while providing contextual flexibility, to implement unified forecasting on univariate series characterized by non-stationarity, multivariate time series with complicated dynamics and correlations, and covariate-informed contexts that include both endogenous and exogenous variables. Technically, we propose a universal TimeAttention to facilitate generative Transformers on time series, which can effectively capture fine-grained intra- and inter-series dependencies of flattened time series tokens (patches) and is further strengthened by position embeddings in both temporal and variable dimensions. Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance across challenging forecasting benchmarks through a unified approach. As a large time series model, it demonstrates notable model transferability by large-scale pre-training, as well as contextual flexibility in token lengths, positioning it as a one-for-all forecaster.</description>

      <title>LDAdam: Adaptive Optimization from Low-Dimensional Gradient Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LDAdam, a memory-efficient optimizer for training large models, that performs adaptive optimization steps within lower dimensional subspaces, while consistently exploring the full parameter space during training. This strategy keeps the optimizer's memory footprint to a fraction of the model size. LDAdam relies on a new projection-aware update rule for the optimizer states that allows for transitioning between subspaces, i.e., estimation of the statistics of the projected gradients. To mitigate the errors due to low-rank projection, LDAdam integrates a new generalized error feedback mechanism, which explicitly accounts for both gradient and optimizer state compression. We prove the convergence of LDAdam under standard assumptions, and show that LDAdam allows for accurate and efficient fine-tuning and pre-training of language models.</description>

      <title>Provably Transformers Harness Multi-Concept Word Semantics for Efficient In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have displayed remarkable creative prowess and emergence capabilities. Existing empirical studies have revealed a strong connection between these LLMs' impressive emergence abilities and their in-context learning (ICL) capacity, allowing them to solve new tasks using only task-specific prompts without further fine-tuning. On the other hand, existing empirical and theoretical studies also show that there is a linear regularity of the multi-concept encoded semantic representation behind transformer-based LLMs. However, existing theoretical work fail to build up an understanding of the connection between this regularity and the innovative power of ICL. Additionally, prior work often focuses on simplified, unrealistic scenarios involving linear transformers or unrealistic loss functions, and they achieve only linear or sub-linear convergence rates. In contrast, this work provides a fine-grained mathematical analysis to show how transformers leverage the multi-concept semantics of words to enable powerful ICL and excellent out-of-distribution ICL abilities, offering insights into how transformers innovate solutions for certain unseen tasks encoded with multiple cross-concept semantics. Inspired by empirical studies on the linear latent geometry of LLMs, the analysis is based on a concept-based low-noise sparse coding prompt model. Leveraging advanced techniques, this work showcases the exponential 0-1 loss convergence over the highly non-convex training dynamics, which pioneeringly incorporates the challenges of softmax self-attention, ReLU-activated MLPs, and cross-entropy loss. Empirical simulations corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>FactTest: Factuality Testing in Large Language Models with Finite-Sample and Distribution-Free Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02603v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The propensity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate hallucinations and non-factual content undermines their reliability in high-stakes domains, where rigorous control over Type I errors (the conditional probability of incorrectly classifying hallucinations as truthful content) is essential. Despite its importance, formal verification of LLM factuality with such guarantees remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce FactTest, a novel framework that statistically assesses whether a LLM can confidently provide correct answers to given questions with high-probability correctness guarantees. We formulate factuality testing as hypothesis testing problem to enforce an upper bound of Type I errors at user-specified significance levels. Notably, we prove that our framework also ensures strong Type II error control under mild conditions and can be extended to maintain its effectiveness when covariate shifts exist. Our approach is distribution-free and works for any number of human-annotated samples. It is model-agnostic and applies to any black-box or white-box LM. Extensive experiments on question-answering (QA) and multiple-choice benchmarks demonstrate that FactTest effectively detects hallucinations and improves the model's ability to abstain from answering unknown questions, leading to an over 40% accuracy improvement.</description>
