      <title>Heron: Visualizing and Controlling Chemical Reaction Explorations and Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated and high-throughput quantum chemical investigations into chemical processes have become feasible in great detail and broad scope. This results in an increase in complexity of the tasks and in the amount of generated data. An efficient and intuitive way for an operator to interact with these data and to steer virtual experiments is required. Here, we introduce Heron, a graphical user interface that allows for advanced human-machine interactions with quantum chemical exploration campaigns into molecular structure and reactivity. Heron offers access to interactive and automated explorations of chemical reactions with standard electronic structure modules, haptic force feedback, microkinetic modeling, and refinement of data by automated correlated calculations including black-box complete active space calculations. It is tailored to the exploration and analysis of vast chemical reaction networks. We show how interoperable modules enable advanced workflows and pave the way for routine low-entrance-barrier access to advanced modeling techniques.</description>

      <title>No more gap-shifting: Stochastic many-body-theory based TDHF for accurate theory of polymethine cyanine dyes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an individually fitted screened-exchange interaction for the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method and show that it resolves the missing binding energies in polymethine organic dye molecules compared to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The interaction kernel, which can be thought as a dielectric function, is generated by stochastic fitting to the screened-Coulomb interaction of many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), specific to each system. We test our method on the flavylium (Flav) and indocyanine green (ICG) dye families with a modifiable length of the polymethine bridge, leading to excitations ranging from the visible to short-wave infrared (SWIR). Our approach validates earlier observations on the importance of inclusion of medium range exchange for the exciton binding energy. Our resulting method, TDHF@$v_W$, also achieves a mean absolute error on par with MBPT at a computational cost on par with local-functional TDDFT.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Precise Force Field Optimization for Biomolecules Using DPA-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular simulations are essential tools in computational chemistry, enabling the prediction and understanding of molecular interactions and thermodynamic properties of biomolecules. However, traditional force fields face significant challenges in accurately representing novel molecules and complex chemical environments due to the labor-intensive process of manually setting optimization parameters and the high computational cost of quantum mechanical calculations. To overcome these difficulties, we fine-tuned a high-accuracy DPA-2 pre-trained model and applied it to optimize force field parameters on-the-fly, significantly reducing computational costs. Our method combines this fine-tuned DPA-2 model with a node-embedding-based similarity metric, allowing seamless augmentation to new chemical species without manual intervention. We applied this process to the TYK2 inhibitor and PTP1B systems and demonstrated its effectiveness through the improvement of free energy perturbation calculation results. This advancement contributes valuable insights and tools for the computational chemistry community.</description>

      <title>Stability of monodomain III-V crystals and antiphase boundaries over a Si monoatomic step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we compare the stabilities of different III-V crystals configurations on stepped Si substrates, with or without anti-phase boundaries, for abrupt and compensated interfaces, using density functional theory. Thermodynamic stability of the different heterostructures is analyzed with an atomic scale description of charge densities distribution and mechani-cal strain. We show that the configuration where a III-V crystal adapts to a Si monoatomic step through change of charge compensation at the hetero-interface is much more stable than the configuration in which an antiphase boundary is formed. This study thus demonstrates that antiphase boundaries commonly observed in III-V/Si samples are not origi-nating from Si monoatomic step edges but from inevitable kinetically driven coalescence of monophase 3D III-V islands.</description>

      <title>Automated Molecular Concept Generation and Labeling with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly transforming scientific research. Explainable AI methods, such as concept-based models (CMs), are promising for driving new scientific discoveries because they make predictions based on meaningful concepts and offer insights into the prediction process. In molecular science, however, explainable CMs are not as common compared to black-box models like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), primarily due to their requirement for predefined concepts and manual label for each instance, which demand domain knowledge and can be labor-intensive. This paper introduces a novel framework for Automated Molecular Concept (AutoMolCo) generation and labeling. AutoMolCo leverages the knowledge in Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate predictive molecular concepts and label them for each molecule. Such procedures are repeated through iterative interactions with LLMs to refine concepts, enabling simple linear models on the refined concepts to outperform GNNs and LLM in-context learning on several benchmarks. The whole AutoMolCo framework is automated without any human knowledge inputs in either concept generation, labeling, or refinement, thereby surpassing the limitations of extant CMs while maintaining their explainability and allowing easy intervention. Through systematic experiments on MoleculeNet and High-Throughput Experimentation (HTE) datasets, we demonstrate that the AutoMolCo-induced explainable CMs are beneficial and promising for molecular science research.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of Transient Absorption in Hybrid Dual-Plasmonic Au/CuS Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transient absorption in plasmonic materials has recently attracted attention of the chemistry and optics communities as a technique to understand dynamic processes and hot carriers generation on ultrafast timescales. In this context, hybrid Au/CuS nanostructures were recently investigated via ultrafast pump-probe transient absorption spectroscopy revealing an exotic dual-plasmonic behavior. Namely, the excitation of a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in Au (pump at 551 nm) or CuS (pump at 1051 nm), leads to a transient response in the counterpart. This phenomenon was attributed to Landau damping, which stems from hot carrier generation and injection mechanisms at the interface between the two materials. Here, we employ numerical modeling to further clarify the origin of such response in hybrid Au/CuS nanostructures. The geometry of the hybrid nanostructures is first investigated via steady-state simulations (only probe), confirming an UFO-shaped configuration. We provide clarification on the role of the size ratio between Au and CuS. Finally, we present the simulation of transient absorption in the pump-probe regime, which qualitatively replicates our experimental observations, thus identifying the plasmonic response modified via Landau damping as the main governing mechanism. Our numerical approach provides an important tool for the modeling of transient absorption spectroscopy and can support experimental research on dual-plasmonic materials for applications in spectroscopy, photocatalysis, thermoplasmonics, sensing, and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Purcell effect in chiral environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Purcell effect describes the modification of the spontaneous decay rate in the presence of electromagnetic media and bodies. In this work, we shed light on the dependencies and magnitude of this effect for chiral materials. Using the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics and Fermi's golden rule, we study a chiral bulk medium with and without local-field corrections, an idealised chiral mirror and a chiral surface. The results imply that the chiral effect is greatest for large transition frequencies, molecules with large optical rotatory strength and media with a strong cross-susceptibility. In the case of a half space, short distances from the molecule to the interface additionally enhance the effect.</description>

      <title>How Does Mg$^{2+}_{(aq)}$ Interact with ATP$_{(aq)}$? Biomolecular Structure through the Lens of Liquid-Jet Photoelectron Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Site-specific information on how adenosine triphosphate in the aqueous phase (ATP$_{(aq)}$) interacts with magnesium (Mg$^{2+}_{(aq)}$) is a prerequisite to understanding its complex biochemistry. To gather such information, we apply liquid-jet photoelectron spectroscopy (LJ-PES) assisted by electronic-structure calculations to study ATP$_{(aq)}$ solutions with and without dissolved Mg$^{2+}$. Valence photoemission data reveal spectral changes in the phosphate and adenine features of ATP$_{(aq)}$ due to interactions with the divalent cation. Chemical shifts in Mg 2p, Mg 2s, P 2p, and P 2s core-level spectra as a function of the Mg$^{2+}$/ATP concentration ratio are correlated to the formation of [MgATP]$^{-2}_{(aq)}$ and Mg$_2$ATP$_{(aq)}$ complexes, demonstrating the element-sensitivity of the technique to Mg$^{2+}$-phosphate interactions. In addition, we report and compare P 2s data from ATP$_{(aq)}$ and adenosine mono- and di-phosphate (AMP$_{(aq)}$ and ADP$_{(aq)}$, respectively) solutions, probing the electronic structure of the phosphate chain and the local environment of individual phosphate units in ATP$_{(aq)}$. Finally, we have recorded intermolecular Coulombic decay (ICD) spectra initiated by ionization of Mg 1s electrons to probe ligand exchange in the Mg$^{2+}$-ATP$_{(aq)}$ coordination environment, demonstrating the unique capabilities of ICD for revealing structural information. Our results provide an overview of the electronic structure of ATP$_{(aq)}$ and Mg$^{2+}$-ATP$_{(aq)}$ moieties relevant to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions that are central to bioenergetics in living organisms.</description>

      <title>How quickly can sodium-ion learn? Assessing scenarios for techno-economic competitiveness against lithium-ion batteries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries have garnered significant attention as a potentially low-cost alternative to lithium-ion batteries, which have experienced supply shortages and pricing volatility of key minerals. Here we assess their techno-economic competitiveness against incumbent lithium-ion batteries using a modeling framework incorporating componential learning curves constrained by minerals prices and engineering design floors. We compare projected sodium-ion and lithium-ion price trends across over 6,000 scenarios while varying Na-ion technology development roadmaps, supply chain scenarios, market penetration, and learning rates. Assuming substantial progress can be made along technology roadmaps via targeted R&amp;D, we forecast many sodium-ion pathways to be price competitive against low-cost lithium-ion variants in the early 2030s. Additionally, we show timelines are highly sensitive to movements in critical minerals supply chains--namely that of lithium, graphite, and nickel. Modeled outcomes suggest increasing sodium-ion energy densities to decrease materials intensity to be among the most impactful ways to improve competitiveness.</description>

      <title>Simulating Ultrafast Transient Absorption Spectra from First Principles using a Time-Dependent Configuration Interaction Probe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) is among the most common ultrafast photochemical experiments, but its interpretation remains challenging. In this work, we present an efficient and robust method for simulating TAS signals from first principles. Excited-state absorption and stimulated emission (SE) signals are computed using time-dependent complete active space configuration interaction (TD-CASCI) simulations, leveraging the robustness of time-domain simulation to minimize electronic structure failure. We demonstrate our approach by simulating the TAS signal of 1$^\prime$-hydroxy-2$^\prime$-acetonapthone (HAN) from ab initio multiple spawning nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. Our results are compared to gas-phase TAS data recorded from both jet-cooled ($T\sim$ 40 K) and hot ($\sim$ 403 K) molecules via cavity-enhanced transient absorption spectroscopy (CE-TAS). Decomposition of the computed spectrum allows us to assign a rise in the SE signal to excited-state proton transfer and the ultimate decay of the signal to relaxation through a twisted conical intersection. The total cost of computing the observable signal ($\sim$1700 graphics processing unit hours for $\sim$4 ns of electron dynamics) was markedly less than that of the ab initio multiple spawning calculations used to compute the underlying nonadiabatic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Molecular Charge-Transfer Model for Multi-step Auger-Meitner Decay Cascade Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fragmentation of molecular cations following inner-shell decay processes in molecules containing heavy elements underpins the x-ray damage effects observed in x-ray scattering measurements of biological and chemical materials, as well as in medical applications involving Auger-electron emitting radionuclides. Traditionally, these processes are modeled using simulations that describe the electronic structure at an atomic level, thereby omitting molecular bonding effects. This work addresses the gap by introducing a novel approach that couples a decay spawning dynamics algorithm with ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to characterize ultrafast dynamics on the potential energy surfaces. We apply our method to a model decay cascade following K-shell ionization of IBr and subsequent K\b{eta} fluorescence decay. We examine two competing channels that undergo two decay steps, resulting in ion pairs with a total +3 charge state. This approach provides a continuous description of the electron transfer dynamics occurring during the multi-step decay cascade and molecular fragmentation, revealing the combined inner-shell decay and charge transfer timescale to be approximately 75 fs. Our computed kinetic energies of ion fragments show good agreement with experimental data.</description>

Abstract: The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed a transformative shift with the emergence of large language models (LLMs), revolutionizing various language tasks and applications, and the integration of LLM into specialized domains enhances their capabilities for domain-specific applications. Notably, NLP has made significant strides in organic chemistry, particularly in predicting synthetic tasks, paving the way for the development of LLMs tailored to the organic chemistry field. In this work, we introduce SynAsk, a comprehensive organic chemistry domain-specific LLM platform developed by AIChemEco Inc. By finetuning an LLM with domain-specific data and integrating it with a chain of thought approach, SynAsk seamlessly accesses our knowledge base and advanced chemistry tools in a question-and-answer format. This includes functionalities such as a basic chemistry knowledge base, molecular information retrieval, reaction performance prediction, retrosynthesis prediction, chemical literature acquisition, and more. This novel methodology synergizes fine-tuning techniques with external resource integration, resulting in an organic chemistry-specific model poised to facilitate research and discovery in the field. Accessible via http://synask.aichemeco.com, SynAsk represents a significant advancement in leveraging NLP for synthetic applications.</description>

      <title>The tilted-plane structure of the energy of finite quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The piecewise linearity condition on the total energy with respect to the total magnetization of finite quantum systems is derived, using the infinite-separation-limit technique. This generalizes the well-known constancy condition, related to static correlation error, in approximate density functional theory (DFT). The magnetic analog of the DFT Koopmans' theorem is also derived. Moving to fractional electron count, the tilted plane condition is derived, lifting certain assumptions in previous works. This generalization of the flat plane condition characterizes the total energy surface of a finite system for all values of electron count N and magnetization M. This result is used in combination with tabulated spectroscopic data to show the flat plane-structure of the oxygen atom, among others. We find that derivative discontinuities with respect to electron count sometimes occur at non-integer values. A diverse set of tilted plane structures is shown to occur in d-orbital subspaces, depending on chemical coordination. General occupancy-based total-energy expressions are demonstrated thereby to be necessarily dependent on the symmetry-imposed degeneracies.</description>

Abstract: Crystal Orbital Overlap Population (COOP) is one of the effective tools for chemical-bonding analysis, and thus it has been utilized in the materials development and characterization. In this study, we developed a code to perform the COOP-based chemical-bonding analysis based on the wavefunction obtained from a first principles all-electron calculation with numeric atom-centered orbitals. The chemical-bonding analysis using the developed code was demonstrated for F2 and Si. Furthermore, we applied the method to analyze the chemical-bonding changes associated with a Li intercalation in three representative layered materials: graphite, MoS2, and ZrNCl, because of their great industrial importance, particularly for the applications in battery and superconducting materials. The COOP analysis provided some insights for understanding the intercalation mechanism and the stability of the intercalated materials from a chemical-bonding viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Life beyond Fritz: On the detachment of electrolytic bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on detachment characteristics of hydrogen bubbles during electrolysis. Using a transparent (Pt or Ni) electrode enables us to directly observe the bubble contact line and bubble size. Based on these quantities we determine other parameters such as the contact angle and volume through solutions of the Young-Laplace equation. We observe bubbles without ('pinned bubbles') and with ('spreading bubbles') contact line spreading, and find that the latter mode becomes more prevalent if the concentration of HClO4 is greater than or equal to 0.1 M. The departure radius for spreading bubbles is found to drastically exceed the value predicted by the well-known formula of W. Fritz (Physik. Zeitschr. 1935, 36, 379-384) for this case. We show that this is related to the contact line hysteresis, which leads to pinning of the contact line after an initial spreading phase at the receding contact angle. The departure mode is then similar to a pinned bubble and occurs once the contact angle reaches the advancing contact angle of the surface.
