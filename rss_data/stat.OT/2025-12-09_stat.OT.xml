      <title>Evidence and Elimination: A Bayesian Interpretation of Falsification in Scientific Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical conception of falsification presents scientific theories as entities that are decisively refuted when their predictions fail. This picture has long been challenged by both philosophical analysis and scientific practice, yet the relationship between Popper's eliminative view of theory testing and Bayesian model comparison remains insufficiently articulated. This paper develops a unified account in which falsification is reinterpreted as a Bayesian process of model elimination. A theory is not rejected because it contradicts an observation in a logical sense; it is eliminated because it assigns vanishing integrated probability to the data in comparison with an alternative model. This reinterpretation resolves the difficulties raised by the Duhem-Quine thesis, clarifies the status of auxiliary hypotheses, and explains why ad hoc modifications reduce rather than increase theoretical credibility. The analysis is illustrated through two classical episodes in celestial mechanics, the discovery of Neptune and the anomalous precession of Mercury. In the Neptune case, an auxiliary hypothesis internal to Newtonian gravity dramatically increases the marginal likelihood of the theory, preserving it from apparent refutation. In the Mercury case, no permissible auxiliary modification can rescue the Newtonian model, while general relativity assigns high probability to the anomaly without adjustable parameters. The resulting posterior collapse provides a quantitative realisation of Popper's eliminative criterion. Bayesian model comparison therefore supplies the mathematical structure that Popper's philosophy lacked and offers a coherent account of scientific theory change as a process of successive eliminations within a space of competing models.</description>

      <title>Interpret the estimand framework from a causal inference perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The estimand framework proposed by ICH in 2017 has brought fundamental changes in the pharmaceutical industry. It clearly describes how a treatment effect in a clinical question should be precisely defined and estimated, through attributes including treatments, endpoints and intercurrent events. However, ideas around the estimand framework are commonly in text, and different interpretations on this framework may exist. This article aims to interpret the estimand framework through its underlying theories, the causal inference framework based on potential outcomes. The statistical origin and formula of an estimand is given through the causal inference framework, with all attributes translated into statistical terms. We describe how five strategies proposed by ICH to analyze intercurrent events are incorporated in the statistical formula of an estimand, and we also suggest a new strategy to analyze intercurrent events. The roles of target populations and analysis sets in the estimand framework are compared and discussed based on the statistical formula of an estimand. This article recommends continuing studying causal inference theories behind the estimand framework and improving the estimand framework with greater methodological comprehensibility and availability.</description>

      <title>Modeling diffusion in networks with communities: a multitype branching process approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of diffusion in complex networks are widely studied to understand how entities, such as information, diseases, or behaviors, spread in an interconnected environment. Complex networks often present community structure, and tools to analyze diffusion processes on networks with communities are needed. In this paper, we develop theoretical tools using multi-type branching processes to model and analyze diffusion processes, following a simple contagion mechanism, across a broad class of networks with community structure. We show how, by using limited information about the network -- the degree distribution within and between communities -- we can calculate standard statistical characteristics of propagation dynamics, such as the extinction probability, hazard function, and cascade size distribution. These properties can be estimated not only for the entire network but also for each community separately.
  Furthermore, we estimate the probability of spread crossing from one community to another where it is not currently spreading. We demonstrate the accuracy of our framework by applying it to two specific examples: the Stochastic Block Model and a log-normal network with community structure. We show how the initial seeding location affects the observed cascade size distribution on a heavy-tailed network and that our framework accurately captures this effect.</description>
