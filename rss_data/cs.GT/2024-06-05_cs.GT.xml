      <title>Causal Inference from Competing Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many applications of RCTs involve the presence of multiple treatment administrators -- from field experiments to online advertising -- that compete for the subjects' attention. In the face of competition, estimating a causal effect becomes difficult, as the position at which a subject sees a treatment influences their response, and thus the treatment effect. In this paper, we build a game-theoretic model of agents who wish to estimate causal effects in the presence of competition, through a bidding system and a utility function that minimizes estimation error. Our main technical result establishes an approximation with a tractable objective that maximizes the sample value obtained through strategically allocating budget on subjects. This allows us to find an equilibrium in our model: we show that the tractable objective has a pure Nash equilibrium, and that any Nash equilibrium is an approximate equilibrium for our general objective that minimizes estimation error under broad conditions. Conceptually, our work successfully combines elements from causal inference and game theory to shed light on the equilibrium behavior of experimentation under competition.</description>

      <title>Adaptively Perturbed Mirror Descent for Learning in Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a payoff perturbation technique for the Mirror Descent (MD) algorithm in games where the gradient of the payoff functions is monotone in the strategy profile space, potentially containing additive noise. The optimistic family of learning algorithms, exemplified by optimistic MD, successfully achieves {\it last-iterate} convergence in scenarios devoid of noise, leading the dynamics to a Nash equilibrium. A recent re-emerging trend underscores the promise of the perturbation approach, where payoff functions are perturbed based on the distance from an anchoring, or {\it slingshot}, strategy. In response, we propose {\it Adaptively Perturbed MD} (APMD), which adjusts the magnitude of the perturbation by repeatedly updating the slingshot strategy at a predefined interval. This innovation empowers us to find a Nash equilibrium of the underlying game with guaranteed rates. Empirical demonstrations affirm that our algorithm exhibits significantly accelerated convergence.</description>

      <title>Minimally Modifying a Markov Game to Achieve Any Nash Equilibrium and Value</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the game modification problem, where a benevolent game designer or a malevolent adversary modifies the reward function of a zero-sum Markov game so that a target deterministic or stochastic policy profile becomes the unique Markov perfect Nash equilibrium and has a value within a target range, in a way that minimizes the modification cost. We characterize the set of policy profiles that can be installed as the unique equilibrium of some game, and establish sufficient and necessary conditions for successful installation. We propose an efficient algorithm, which solves a convex optimization problem with linear constraints and then performs random perturbation, to obtain a modification plan with a near-optimal cost.</description>

      <title>Auctions and mass transportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey paper we present classical and recent results relating the auction design and the optimal transportation theory. In particular, we discuss in details the seminal result of Daskalakis, Deckelbaum and Tzamos \cite{DDT} about duality between auction design with $1$ bidder and the weak transportation problem. Later investigations revealed the connection of multi-bidder case to the Beckmann's transportation problem. In this paper we overview a number of works on related subjects (monopolist's problem, regularity issues, weak transportation, measure ordering etc.). In addition, we prove some new results on duality for unreduced mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Solution Concepts in Hierarchical Games under Bounded Rationality with Applications to Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.10033v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With autonomous vehicles (AV) set to integrate further into regular human traffic, there is an increasing consensus on treating AV motion planning as a multi-agent problem. However, the traditional game-theoretic assumption of complete rationality is too strong for human driving, and there is a need for understanding human driving as a \emph{bounded rational} activity through a behavioural game-theoretic lens. To that end, we adapt four metamodels of bounded rational behaviour: three based on Quantal level-k and one based on Nash equilibrium with quantal errors. We formalize the different solution concepts that can be applied in the context of hierarchical games, a framework used in multi-agent motion planning, for the purpose of creating game theoretic models of driving behaviour. Furthermore, based on a contributed dataset of human driving at a busy urban intersection with a total of approximately 4k agents and 44k decision points, we evaluate the behaviour models on the basis of model fit to naturalistic data, as well as their predictive capacity. Our results suggest that among the behaviour models evaluated, at the level of maneuvers, modeling driving behaviour as an adaptation of the Quantal level-k model with level-0 behaviour modelled as pure rule-following provides the best fit to naturalistic driving behaviour. At the level of trajectories, bounds sampling of actions and a maxmax non-strategic models is the most accurate within the set of models in comparison. We also find a significant impact of situational factors on the performance of behaviour models.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence between the minimax theorem and strong duality of conic linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the almost equivalence between two-player zero-sum games and conic linear programming problems in reflexive Banach spaces. The previous fundamental results of von Neumann, Dantzig, Adler, and von Stengel, regarding the equivalence between finite games with strategy sets defined over $\mathbb{R}^n$, and linear programming, are therefore generalized to the infinite-dimensional case. In fact, we show that for every two-player zero-sum game with a bilinear function of the form $u(x,y)=\langle y,Ax\rangle$, for some linear operator $A$, and strategy sets that represent bases of convex cones, the minimax theorem holds, and its game value and Nash equilibria can be computed by solving a primal-dual pair of conic linear problems. Conversely, the minimax theorem for the same class of games "almost always" implies strong duality of conic linear programming. The main results are applied to a number of infinite zero-sum games, whose classes include those of semi-infinite, semidefinite, time-continuous, quantum, polynomial, and homogeneous separable games.</description>

      <title>Intrusion Tolerance for Networked Systems through Two-Level Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01741v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate intrusion tolerance for a system with service replicas as a two-level optimal control problem. On the local level node controllers perform intrusion recovery, and on the global level a system controller manages the replication factor. The local and global control problems can be formulated as classical problems in operations research, namely, the machine replacement problem and the inventory replenishment problem. Based on this formulation, we design TOLERANCE, a novel control architecture for intrusion-tolerant systems. We prove that the optimal control strategies on both levels have threshold structure and design efficient algorithms for computing them. We implement and evaluate TOLERANCE in an emulation environment where we run 10 types of network intrusions. The results show that TOLERANCE can improve service availability and reduce operational cost compared with state-of-the-art intrusion-tolerant systems.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-Learning with Incentive Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09005v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most concurrent blockchain systems rely heavily on the Proof-of-Work (PoW) or Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanisms for decentralized consensus and security assurance. However, the substantial energy expenditure stemming from computationally intensive yet meaningless tasks has raised considerable concerns surrounding traditional PoW approaches, The PoS mechanism, while free of energy consumption, is subject to security and economic issues. Addressing these issues, the paradigm of Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) seeks to employ challenges of practical significance as PoW, thereby imbuing energy consumption with tangible value. While previous efforts in Proof of Learning (PoL) explored the utilization of deep learning model training SGD tasks as PoUW challenges, recent research has revealed its vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and the theoretical hardness in crafting a byzantine-secure PoL mechanism. In this paper, we introduce the concept of incentive-security that incentivizes rational provers to behave honestly for their best interest, bypassing the existing hardness to design a PoL mechanism with computational efficiency, a provable incentive-security guarantee and controllable difficulty. Particularly, our work is secure against two attacks to the recent work of Jia et al. [2021], and also improves the computational overhead from $\Theta(1)$ to $O(\frac{\log E}{E})$. Furthermore, while most recent research assumes trusted problem providers and verifiers, our design also guarantees frontend incentive-security even when problem providers are untrusted, and verifier incentive-security that bypasses the Verifier's Dilemma. By incorporating ML training into blockchain consensus mechanisms with provable guarantees, our research not only proposes an eco-friendly solution to blockchain systems, but also provides a proposal for a completely decentralized computing power market in the new AI age.</description>

      <title>Complete Game Logic with Sabotage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Game Logic with sabotage ($\mathsf{GL_s}$) is introduced as a simple and natural extension of Parikh's game logic with a single additional primitive, which allows players to lay traps for the opponent. $\mathsf{GL_s}$ can be used to model infinite sabotage games, in which players can change the rules during game play. In contrast to game logic, which is strictly less expressive, $\mathsf{GL_s}$ is exactly as expressive as the modal $\mu$-calculus. This reveals a close connection between the entangled nested recursion inherent in modal fixpoint logics and adversarial dynamic rule changes characteristic for sabotage games. A natural Hilbert-style proof calculus for $\mathsf{GL_s}$ is presented and proved complete using syntactic equiexpressiveness reductions. The completeness of a simple extension of Parikh's calculus for game logic follows.</description>
