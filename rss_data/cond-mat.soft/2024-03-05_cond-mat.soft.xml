      <title>Design principles for fast and efficient self-assembly processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-assembly is a fundamental concept in biology and of significant interest to nanotechnology. Significant progress has been made in characterizing and controlling the properties of the resulting structures, both experimentally and theoretically. However, much less is known about kinetic constraints and determinants of dynamical properties like time efficiency, although these constraints can become severe limiting factors of self-assembly processes. Here we investigate how the time efficiency and other dynamical properties of reversible self-assembly depend on the morphology (shape) of the building blocks for systems in which the binding energy between the constituents is large. As paradigmatic examples, we stochastically simulate the self-assembly of constituents with triangular, square, and hexagonal morphology into two-dimensional structures of a specified size. We find that the constituents' morphology critically determines the assembly time and how it scales with the size of the target structure. Our analysis reveals three key structural parameters defined by the morphology: The nucleation size and attachment order, which describe the effective order of the chemical reactions by which clusters nucleate and grow, respectively, and the growth exponent, which determines how the growth rate of an emerging structure scales with its size. Using this characterization, we formulate an effective theory of the self-assembly kinetics, which we show exhibits an inherent scale invariance. This allows us to identify general scaling laws that describe the minimal assembly time as a function of the size of the target structure. We show how these insights on the kinetics of self-assembly processes can be used to design assembly schemes that could significantly increase the time efficiency and robustness of artificial self-assembly processes.</description>

      <title>Critical scaling for dense granular flow between parallel plates near jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the flow of dense granular materials between parallel plates driven by an external force. The granular materials form a jammed solid-like state when the external force is below a critical force, while they flow like fluids above the critical force. The transition is characterized by the mass flux. The critical force depends on the average packing fraction and the distance between the plates. The scaling laws for the critical force and the mass flux are predicted theoretically based on a continuum model. They are numerically verified.</description>

      <title>Weak non-linearities of amorphous polymer under creep</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creep behavior of an amorphous poly(etherimide) (PEI) polymer is investigated in the vicinity of its glass transition in a weakly non linear regime where the acceleration of the creep response is driven by local configurational rearrangements. From the time shifts of the creep compliance curves under increasing applied stresses in the range 1-15~\si{\mega\pascal}, we determine a macroscopic acceleration factor. At the start of creep, the stress is homogeneous and the macroscopic acceleration can be assimilated to that of the local rearrangements which is shown to vary as $f=e^{-(\sigma/Y)^n} $ with $n=2 \pm 0.2$, where $\sigma$ is the local stress and $Y$ is a decreasing function of compliance. This experimental result is in agreement with the recent theory of Long \textit{et al.} (\textit{Phys. Rev. Mat.} (2018) \textbf{2}, 105601 ) which predicts $n=2$. From a mean field approximation, we interpret the variation of $Y$ with compliance as the result of the development of stress heterogneities during creep.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the basis of the thermodynamic theory of the excluded volume effects, we show that the size exponent varies abruptly, depending on the change of the segment concentration. For linear polymers, the exponent changes discontinuously from $\nu=3/5$ for the isolated system ($\bar{\phi}=0$) in good solvents to $\nu=1/2$ in the finite concentration ($0&lt;\bar{\phi}\le1$), while for branched polymers having $\nu_{0}=1/4$, the corresponding exponent varies from $\nu=1/2$ ($\bar{\phi}=0$) to $\nu\cong 1/3$ ($0&lt;\bar{\phi}\le1$).</description>

      <title>Emergence of Accurate Atomic Energies from Machine Learned Noble Gas Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) gives access to well-defined local atomic energies. Due to their locality, these energies are potentially interesting in fitting atomistic machine learning models as they inform about physically relevant properties. However, computationally, quantum-mechanically accurate local energies are notoriously difficult to obtain for large systems. Here, we show that by employing semi-empirical correlations between different components of the total energy, we can obtain well-defined local energies at a moderate cost. We employ this methodology to investigate energetics in noble liquids or argon, krypton, and their mixture. Instead of using these local energies to fit atomistic models, we show how well these local energies are reproduced by machine-learned models trained on the total energies. The results of our investigation suggest that smaller neural networks, trained only on the total energy of an atomistic system, are more likely to reproduce the underlying local energy partitioning faithfully than larger networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that networks more capable of this energy decomposition are, in turn, capable of transferring to previously unseen systems. Our results are a step towards understanding how much physics can be learned by neural networks and where this can be applied, particularly how a better understanding of physics aids in the transferability of these neural networks.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of bubble transport in porous electrodes and catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation and transport of gas bubbles across a model porous catalyst/electrode using lattice Boltzmann simulations. This approach enables us to systematically examine the influence of a wide range of morphologies, flow velocities, and reaction rates on the efficiency of gas production. By exploring these parameters, we identify critical parameter combinations that significantly contribute to an enhanced yield of gas output. Our simulations reveal the existence of an optimal pore geometry for which the product output is maximized. Intriguingly, we also observe that lower flow velocities improve gas production by leveraging on coalescence-induced bubble detachment from the catalyst.</description>

      <title>Controlled creation of point defects in 3D colloidal crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal defects crucially influence the properties of crystalline materials and have been extensively studied. Even for the simplest type of defect - the point defect - however, basic properties such as their diffusive behavior, and their interactions, remain elusive on the atomic scale. Here we demonstrate in-situ control over the creation of isolated point defects in a 3D colloidal crystal allowing insight on a single particle level. Our system consists of thermoresponsive microgel particles embedded in a crystal of non-responsive colloids. Heating this mixed particle system triggers the shrinking of the embedded microgels, which then vacate their lattice positions creating vacancy-interstitial pairs. We use temperature-controlled confocal laser scanning microscopy to verify and visualize the formation of the point defects. In addition, by re-swelling the microgels we quantify the local lattice distortion around an interstitial defect. Our experimental model system provides a unique opportunity to shed new light on the interplay between point defects, on the mechanisms of their diffusion, on their interactions, and on collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Machine learning that predicts well may not learn the correct physical descriptions of glassy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of glasses makes it challenging to explain their dynamics. Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a promising pathway for understanding glassy dynamics by linking their structural features to rearrangement dynamics. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was one of the first methods used to detect such correlations. Specifically, a certain output of SVMs trained to predict dynamics from structure, the distance from the separating hyperplane, was interpreted as being linearly related to the activation energy for the rearrangement. By numerical analysis of toy models, we explore under which conditions it is possible to infer the energy barrier to rearrangements from the distance to the separating hyperplane. We observe that such successful inference is possible only under very restricted conditions. Typical tests, such as the apparent Arrhenius dependence of the probability of rearrangement on the inferred energy and the temperature, or high cross-validation accuracy do not guarantee success. We propose practical approaches for measuring the quality of the energy inference and for modifying the inferred model to improve the inference, which should be usable in the context of realistic datasets.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on generalized transport: From single-molecule to bulk observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the transport of any scalar observable in $d$-dimensional non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The result -- a time-integrated generalized speed limit -- reflects the thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g. in time-resolved X-ray scattering.</description>

      <title>Strong Casimir-like Forces in Flocking Active Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confining in space the equilibrium fluctuations of statistical systems with long-range correlations is known to result into effective forces on the boundaries. Here we demonstrate the occurrence of Casimir-like forces in the non-equilibrium context provided by flocking active matter. In particular, we consider a system of aligning self-propelled particles in two spatial dimensions, which are transversally confined by reflecting or partially reflecting walls. We show that in the ordered flocking phase this confined active vectorial fluid is characterized by extensive boundary layers, as opposed to the finite ones usually observed in confined scalar active matter. Moreover, a finite-size,fluctuation-induced contribution to the pressure on the wall emerges, which decays slowly and algebraically upon increasing the distance between the walls. We explain our findings, which display a certain degree of universality, within a hydrodynamic description of the density and velocity fields.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a hexagonal pattern in shear-thickening suspensions under orbital oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense particle suspension under shear may lose its uniform state to large local density and stress fluctuations, which challenge the mean-field description of the system. Here, we explore the novel dynamics of a non-Brownian suspension under orbital oscillations, where localized density waves along the flow direction appear beyond an excitation frequency threshold and self-organize into a hexagonal pattern across the system. The spontaneous occurrence of the inhomogeneity pattern arises from a coupling between particle advection and the shear-thickening nature of the suspension. Through linear stability analysis, we show that they overcome the stabilizing effects of particle pressure at sufficient particle volume fraction and oscillation frequency. In addition, the long-standing density waves degenerate into random fluctuations when replacing the free surface with rigid confinement. It indicates that the shear-thickened state is intrinsically heterogeneous, and the boundary conditions are crucial for developing local disturbance.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Stability of a Model Quasicrystal and its Approximants with a Periodic Substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.04827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasicrystals and their periodic approximants are complex phases, which have by now been observed in many metallic alloys, soft matter systems, and particle simulations. In recent experiments of thin-film perovskites on solid substrates, the type of complex phase was found to change depending on thermodynamic conditions and the type of substrate used. Here, we investigate the effect of a substrate on the relative stability of a two-dimensional model quasicrystal and its approximants. Our numerical methods are molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations that take into account phason flips explicitly. For weak substrates, we observe an incommensurate-commensurate transition, in which a continuous series of QC approximants locks into a discrete number of approximants. For stronger substrates, an enhancement of the stability of the dodecagonal quasicrystal and a variants of square lattices were found. All phenomena can be explained by the interplay of the model system with the substrate. Our results demonstrate that designing novel complex periodic and quasiperiodic structures by choice of suitable substrates is a promising strategy.</description>

      <title>Stochastic kinetic theory applied to coarse-grained polymer model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stochastic field theory approach is applied to a coarse-grained polymer model that will enable studies of polymer behavior under non-equilibrium conditions. This article is focused on the validation of the new model in comparison to explicit Langevin equation simulations under conditions with analytical solutions. The polymers are modeled as Hookean dumbbells in one dimension, without including hydrodynamic interactions and polymer-polymer interactions. Stochastic moment equations are derived from the full field theory. The accuracy of the field theory and moment equations are quantified using autocorrelation functions. The full field theory is only accurate for large number of polymers due to keeping track of rare occurrences of polymers with a large stretch. The moment equations do not have this error because they do not explicitly track these configurations. The accuracy of both methods depends on the spatial degree of discretization. The timescale of decorrelation over length scales bigger than the spatial discretization is accurate, while there is an error over the scale of single mesh points.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry in Polymer-Solvent Interactions Yields Complex Thermoresponsive Behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermoresponsive polymers hold both fundamental and technological importance, but the essential physics driving their intriguing behavior is not wholly understood. We introduce a lattice framework that incorporates elements of Flory-Huggins solution theory and the $q$-state Potts model to study the phase behavior of polymer solutions and single-chain conformational characteristics. Importantly, the framework does not employ any temperature- or composition-dependent parameters. With this minimal Flory-Huggins-Potts framework, we show that orientation-dependent interactions, specifically between monomer segments and solvent particles, are alone sufficient to observe upper critical solution temperatures, miscibility loops, and hourglass-shaped spinodal curves. Signatures of emergent phase behavior are found in single-chain Monte Carlo simulations, which display heating- and cooling-induced coil-globule transitions linked to energy fluctuations. The model also capably describes a range of experimental systems. This work provides new insights regarding the microscopic physics that underpin complex thermoresponsive behavior in polymers.</description>

      <title>Effective interaction between guest charges immersed in 2D jellium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The model under study is an infinite 2D jellium of pointlike particles with elementary charge $e$, interacting via the logarithmic potential and in thermal equilibrium at the inverse temperature $\beta$. Two cases of the coupling constant $\Gamma\equiv \beta e^2$ are considered: the Debye-H\"uckel limit $\Gamma\to 0$ and the free-fermion point $\Gamma=2$. In the most general formulation, two guest particles, the one with charge $q e$ (the valence $q$ being an arbitrary integer) and the hard core of radius $\sigma&gt;0$ and the pointlike one with elementary charge $e$, are immersed in the bulk of the jellium at distance $d\ge \sigma$. Two problems are of interest: the asymptotic large-distance behavior of the excess charge density induced in the jellium and the effective interaction between the guest particles. Technically, the induced charge density and the effective interaction are expressed in terms of multi-particle correlations of the pure (translationally invariant) jellium system. It is shown that the separation form of the induced charge density onto its radial and angle parts, observed previously in the limit $\Gamma\to 0$, is not reproduced at the coupling $\Gamma=2$. Based on an exact expression for the effective interaction between guest particles at $\Gamma=2$, oppositely ($q=0,-1,-2,\ldots$) charged guest particles always attract one another while likely ($q=1,2,\ldots$) charged guest particles repeal one another up to a certain distance $d$ between them and then the mutual attraction takes place up to asymptotically large (finite) distances.</description>

Abstract: We propose a binary nonadditive Asakura-Oosawa-like mixture as an example for the classical limit of a Luttinger liquid. We determine the equation of state and structure of this mixture and discuss the paradoxical situation that one faces when working with a quantum liquid without a ground state.
