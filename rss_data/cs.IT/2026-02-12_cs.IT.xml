      <title>Robust Semantic Transmission for Low-Altitude UAVs: Predictive Channel-Aware Scheduling and Generative Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) downlink transmission facilitates critical time-sensitive visual applications but is fundamentally constrained by bandwidth scarcity and dynamic channel impairments. The rapid fluctuation of the air-to-ground (A2G) link creates a regime where reliable transmission slots are intermittent and future channel quality can only be predicted with uncertainty. Conventional deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) methods transmit coupled feature streams, causing global reconstruction failure when specific time slots experience deep fading. Decoupling semantic content into a deterministic structure component and a stochastic texture component enables differentiated error protection strategies aligned with channel reliability. A predictive transmission framework is developed that utilizes a split-stream variational codec and a channel-aware scheduler to prioritize the delivery of structural layout over reliable slots. Experimental evaluations indicate that this approach achieves a 5.6 dB gain in peak signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio over single-stream baselines and maintains structural fidelity under significant prediction mismatch.</description>

      <title>Predictive-State Communication: Innovation Coding and Reconciliation under Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shannon theory models communication as the reliable transfer of symbol sequences, with performance governed by capacity and rate-distortion limits. When both endpoints possess strong predictors -- as in modern large language models and related generative priors -- literal symbol transport is no longer the only operational regime. We propose predictive-state communication (PSC), in which the transmitter and receiver maintain an explicit shared predictive state, and the physical channel is used primarily to convey innovations, i.e., corrective information that reconciles the receiver's provisional trajectory with the transmitter's realized trajectory. This viewpoint replaces entropy-rate accounting by cross-entropy accounting under model mismatch, and it introduces feasibility constraints that depend jointly on capacity, delay, and perceptual continuity requirements; the resulting operating set is typically a bounded perception-capacity band rather than a one-sided threshold. We outline the protocol and architectural implications (state identifiers, anchors, bounded rollback, and patch-based updates) and provide a stylized illustrative example to visualize the induced feasibility region and its dependence on predictive quality.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Interference Management for TN-NTN Coexistence in the Upper Mid-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coexistence of terrestrial networks (TN) and non-terrestrial networks (NTN) in the frequency range 3 (FR3) upper mid-band presents considerable interference concerns, as dense TN deployments can severely degrade NTN downlink performance. Existing studies rely on interference-nulling beamforming, precoding, or exclusion zones that require accurate channel state information (CSI) and static coordination, making them unsuitable for dynamic NTN scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we develop an optimization framework that jointly controls TN downlink power, uplink power, and antenna downtilt to protect NTN links while preserving terrestrial performance. The resultant non-convex coupling between TN and NTN parameters is addressed by a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning method that develops adaptive power and tilt control strategies. Simulation results demonstrate a reduction up to 8 dB in the median interference-to-noise ratio (INR) while maintaining over 87% TN basestation activity, outperforming conventional baseline methods and validating the feasibility of the proposed strategy for FR3 coexistence.</description>

      <title>Information Abstraction for Data Transmission Networks based on Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems, particularly the human brain, achieve remarkable energy efficiency by abstracting information across multiple hierarchical levels. In contrast, modern artificial intelligence and communication systems often consume significant energy overheads in transmitting low-level data, with limited emphasis on abstraction. Despite its implicit importance, a formal and computational theory of information abstraction remains absent. In this work, we introduce the Degree of Information Abstraction (DIA), a general metric that quantifies how well a representation compresses input data while preserving task-relevant semantics. We derive a tractable information-theoretic formulation of DIA and propose a DIA-based information abstraction framework. As a case study, we apply DIA to a large language model (LLM)-guided video transmission task, where abstraction-aware encoding significantly reduces transmission volume by $99.75\%$, while maintaining semantic fidelity. Our results suggest that DIA offers a principled tool for rebalancing energy and information in intelligent systems and opens new directions in neural network design, neuromorphic computing, semantic communication, and joint sensing-communication architectures.</description>

      <title>Enormous Fluid Antenna Systems (E-FAS) for Multiuser MIMO: Channel Modeling and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enormous fluid antenna systems (E-FAS), the system concept that utilizes position reconfigurability in the large scale, have emerged as a new architectural paradigm where intelligent surfaces are repurposed from passive smart reflectors into multi-functional electromagnetic (EM) interfaces that can route guided surface waves over walls, ceilings, and building facades, as well as emit space waves to target receivers. This expanded functionality introduces a new mode of signal propagation, enabling new forms of wireless communication. In this paper, we provide an analytical performance characterization of an E-FAS-enabled wireless link. We first develop a physics-consistent end-to-end channel model that couples a surface-impedance wave formulation with small-scale fading on both the base station (BS)-surface and launcher-user segments. We illustrate that the resulting effective BS-user channel remains circularly symmetric complex Gaussian, with an enhanced average power that explicitly captures surface-wave attenuation and junction losses. For single-user cases with linear precoding, we derive the outage probability and ergodic capacity in closed forms, together with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotics that quantify the gain of E-FAS over purely space-wave propagation. For the multiuser case with zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we derive the distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and obtain tractable approximations for the ergodic sum-rate, explicitly revealing how the E-FAS macro-gain interacts with the BS spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). In summary, our analysis shows that E-FAS preserves the diversity order dictated by small-scale fading while improving the coding gain enabled by cylindrical surface-wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Integrated Sensing and Computation with Indefinite Causal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum operations with indefinite causal order (ICO) represent a framework in quantum information processing where the relative order between two events can be indefinite. In this paper, we investigate whether sensing and computation, two canonical tasks in quantum information processing, can be carried out within the ICO framework. We propose a scheme for integrated sensing and computation that uses the same quantum state for both tasks. The quantum state is represented as an agent that performs state observation and learns a function of the state to make predictions via a parametric model. Under an ICO operation, the agent experiences a superposition of orders, one in which it performs state observation and then executes the required computation steps, and another in which the agent carries out the computation first and then performs state observation. This is distinct from prevailing information processing and machine intelligence paradigms where information acquisition and learning follow a strict causal order, with the former always preceding the latter. We provide experimental results and we show that the proposed scheme can achieve small training and testing losses on a representative task in magnetic navigation.</description>

      <title>Binary Flow Matching: Prediction-Loss Space Alignment for Robust Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a powerful framework for generative modeling, with recent empirical successes highlighting the effectiveness of signal-space prediction ($x$-prediction). In this work, we investigate the transfer of this paradigm to binary manifolds, a fundamental setting for generative modeling of discrete data. While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules. Finally, with alignment secured, we examine design choices specific to binary data, revealing a topology-dependent distinction between probabilistic objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and geometric losses (e.g., mean squared error). Together, these results provide theoretical foundations and practical guidelines for robust flow matching on binary -- and related discrete -- domains, positioning signal-space alignment as a key principle for robust diffusion learning.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Variational Bayesian Learning for Channel Estimation with OTFS Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has demonstrated significant advantages in high-mobility scenarios in future 6G networks. However, existing channel estimation methods often overlook the structured sparsity and clustering characteristics inherent in realistic clustered delay line (CDL) channels, leading to degraded performance in practical systems. To address this issue, we propose a novel nonparametric Bayesian learning (NPBL) framework for OTFS channel estimation. Specifically, a stick-breaking process is introduced to automatically infer the number of multipath components and assign each path to its corresponding cluster. The channel coefficients within each cluster are modeled by a Gaussian mixture distribution to capture complex fading statistics. Furthermore, an effective pruning criterion is designed to eliminate spurious multipath components, thereby enhancing estimation accuracy and reducing computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of normalized mean squared error compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Utility Tradeoffs in Quantum Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When sensitive information is encoded in data, it is important to ensure the privacy of information when attempting to learn useful information from the data. There is a natural tradeoff whereby increasing privacy requirements may decrease the utility of a learning protocol. In the quantum setting of differential privacy, such tradeoffs between privacy and utility have so far remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study optimal privacy-utility tradeoffs for both generic and application-specific utility metrics when privacy is quantified by $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-quantum local differential privacy. In the generic setting, we focus on optimizing fidelity and trace distance between the original state and the privatized state. We show that the depolarizing mechanism achieves the optimal utility for given privacy requirements. We then study the specific application of learning the expectation of an observable with respect to an input state when only given access to privatized states. We derive a lower bound on the number of samples of privatized data required to achieve a fixed accuracy guarantee with high probability. To prove this result, we employ existing lower bounds on private quantum hypothesis testing, thus showcasing the first operational use of them. We also devise private mechanisms that achieve optimal sample complexity with respect to the privacy parameters and accuracy parameters, demonstrating that utility can be significantly improved for specific tasks in contrast to the generic setting. In addition, we show that the number of samples required to privately learn observable expectation values scales as $\Theta((\varepsilon \beta)^{-2})$, where $\varepsilon \in (0,1)$ is the privacy parameter and $\beta$ is the accuracy tolerance. We conclude by initiating the study of private classical shadows, which promise useful applications for private learning tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-field multi-antenna wireless communication has attracted growing research interest in recent years. Despite this development, most of the current literature on antennas and reflecting structures relies on simplified models, whose validity for real systems remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce a physically consistent near-field model, which we use to evaluate commonly used models. Our results indicate that common models are sufficient for basic beamfocusing, but fail to accurately predict the sidelobes and frequency dependence of reflecting structures.</description>

      <title>Variational Optimality of F\"ollmer Processes in Generative Diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and analyze generative diffusions that transport a point mass to a prescribed target distribution over a finite time horizon using the stochastic interpolant framework. The drift is expressed as a conditional expectation that can be estimated from independent samples without simulating stochastic processes. We show that the diffusion coefficient can be tuned \emph{a~posteriori} without changing the time-marginal distributions. Among all such tunings, we prove that minimizing the impact of estimation error on the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence selects, in closed form, a F\"ollmer process -- a diffusion whose path measure minimizes relative entropy with respect to a reference process determined by the interpolation schedules alone. This yields a new variational characterization of F\"ollmer processes, complementing classical formulations via Schr\"odinger bridges and stochastic control. We further establish that, under this optimal diffusion coefficient, the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence becomes independent of the interpolation schedule, rendering different schedules statistically equivalent in this variational sense.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Thresholds for Bipartite Latent-Space Graphs under Noisy Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11129v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study information-theoretic phase transitions for the detectability of latent geometry in bipartite random geometric graphs RGGs with Gaussian d-dimensional latent vectors while only a subset of edges carries latent information determined by a random mask with i.i.d. Bern(q) entries. For any fixed edge density p in (0,1) we determine essentially tight thresholds for this problem as a function of d and q. Our results show that the detection problem is substantially easier if the mask is known upfront compared to the case where the mask is hidden.
  Our analysis is built upon a novel Fourier-analytic framework for bounding signed subgraph counts in Gaussian random geometric graphs that exploits cancellations which arise after approximating characteristic functions by an appropriate power series. The resulting bounds are applicable to much larger subgraphs than considered in previous work which enables tight information-theoretic bounds, while the bounds considered in previous works only lead to lower bounds from the lens of low-degree polynomials. As a consequence we identify the optimal information-theoretic thresholds and rule out computational-statistical gaps. Our bounds further improve upon the bounds on Fourier coefficients of random geometric graphs recently given by Bangachev and Bresler [STOC'24] in the dense, bipartite case. The techniques also extend to sparser and non-bipartite settings, at least if the considered subgraphs are sufficiently small. We furhter believe that they might help resolve open questions for related detection problems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Head Finite-State Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce multi-head finite-state dimension, a generalization of finite-state dimension in which a group of finite-state agents (the heads) with oblivious, one-way movement rules, each reporting only one symbol at a time, enable their leader to bet on subsequent symbols in an infinite data stream. In aggregate, such a scheme constitutes an $h$-head finite state gambler whose maximum achievable growth rate of capital in this task, quantified using betting strategies called gales, determines the multi-head finite-state dimension of the sequence. The 1-head case is equivalent to finite-state dimension as defined by Dai, Lathrop, Lutz and Mayordomo (2004). In our main theorem, we prove a strict hierarchy as the number of heads increases, giving an explicit sequence family that separates, for each positive integer $h$, the earning power of $h$-head finite-state gamblers from that of $(h+1)$-head finite-state gamblers. We prove that multi-head finite-state dimension is stable under finite unions but that the corresponding quantity for any fixed number $h&gt;1$ of heads--the $h$-head finite-state predimension--lacks this stability property.</description>

      <title>Entropy Functions on Two-Dimensional Faces of Polymatroidal Region of Degree Four: Part II: Information Theoretic Constraints Breed New Combinatorial Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26552</link>

Abstract: Characterization of entropy functions is of fundamental importance in information theory. By imposing constraints on their Shannon outer bound, i.e., the polymatroidal region, one obtains the faces of the region and entropy functions on them with special structures. In this series of two papers, we characterize entropy functions on the $2$-dimensional faces of the polymatroidal region $\Gamma_4$. In Part I, we formulated the problem, enumerated all $59$ types of $2$-dimensional faces of $\Gamma_4$ by a algorithm, and fully characterized entropy functions on $49$ types of them. In this paper, i.e., Part II, we will characterize entropy functions on the remaining $10$ types of faces, among which $8$ types are fully characterized and $2$ types are partially characterized. To characterize these types of faces, we introduce some new combinatorial design structures which are interesting in themselves.</description>

      <title>Experimental Validation of Reflective Near-Field Beamfocusing using a b-bit RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the first experimental validation of reflective near-field beamfocusing using a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). While beamfocusing has been theoretically established as a key feature of large-aperture RISs, its practical realization has remained unexplored. We derive new analytical expressions for the array gain achieved with a $b$-bit RIS in near-field line-of-sight scenarios, characterizing both the finite depth and angular width of the focal region. The theoretical results are validated through a series of measurements in an indoor office environment at 28 GHz using a one-bit 1024-element RIS. The experiments confirm that beamfocusing can be dynamically achieved and accurately predicted by the proposed simplified analytical model, despite the presence of hardware imperfections and multipath propagation. These findings demonstrate that near-field beamfocusing is a robust and practically viable feature of RIS-assisted wireless communications.</description>

      <title>On the Subpacketization Level of the Banawan-Ulukus Multi-Message PIR Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note analyzes a linear recursion that arises in the computation of the subpacketization level for the multi-message PIR scheme of Banawan and Ulukus. We derive an explicit representation for the normalized subpacketization level $L$, whose smallest integer multiple yields the subpacketization level of the scheme, in terms of the number of servers $N$, the total number of messages $K$, and the number of demand messages $D$. The resulting formula shows that $L$ is a polynomial in $N$ with nonnegative coefficients, and its leading term is $N^{K-D+1}/D$.</description>

      <title>ItDPDM: Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05082v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative modeling of non-negative, discrete data, such as symbolic music, remains challenging due to two persistent limitations in existing methods. Firstly, many approaches rely on modeling continuous embeddings, which is suboptimal for inherently discrete data distributions. Secondly, most models optimize variational bounds rather than exact data likelihood, resulting in inaccurate likelihood estimates and degraded sampling quality. While recent diffusion-based models have addressed these issues separately, we tackle them jointly. In this work, we introduce the Information-Theoretic Discrete Poisson Diffusion Model (ItDPDM), inspired by photon arrival process, which combines exact likelihood estimation with fully discrete-state modeling. Central to our approach is an information-theoretic Poisson Reconstruction Loss (PRL) that has a provable exact relationship with the true data likelihood. ItDPDM achieves improved likelihood and sampling performance over prior discrete and continuous diffusion models on a variety of synthetic discrete datasets. Furthermore, on real-world datasets such as symbolic music and images, ItDPDM attains superior likelihood estimates and competitive generation quality-demonstrating a proof of concept for distribution-robust discrete generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Reducing measurements in quantum erasure correction by quantum local recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22890v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As measurements are costly and prone to errors on certain quantum computing devices, we should reduce the number of measurements and the number of measured qudits as small as possible in quantum erasure correction. It is intuitively obvious that a decoder can omit measurements of stabilizers that are irrelevant to erased qudits, but this intuition has not been rigorously formalized as far as the author is aware. In this paper, we formalize relevant stabilizers sufficient to correct erased qudits with a quantum stabilizer code, by using a recent idea from quantum local recovery. The minimum required number of measured stabilizer observables is also clarified. As an application, we also show that correction of $\delta$ erasures on a generalized surface code proposed by Delfosse, Iyer and Poulin requires at most $\delta$ measurements of vertexes and at most $\delta$ measurements of faces, independently of its code parameters.</description>

      <title>Implicit Hypothesis Testing and Divergence Preservation in Neural Network Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the supervised training dynamics of neural classifiers through the lens of binary hypothesis testing. We model classification as a set of binary tests between class-conditional distributions of representations and empirically show that, along training trajectories, well-generalizing networks increasingly align with Neyman-Pearson optimal decision rules via monotonic improvements in KL divergence that relate to error rate exponents. We finally discuss how this yields an explanation and possible training or regularization strategies for different classes of neural networks.</description>
