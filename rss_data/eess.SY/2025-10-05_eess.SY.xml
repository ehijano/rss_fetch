      <title>An Encoder-Decoder Network for Beamforming over Sparse Large-Scale MIMO Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an end-to-end deep learning framework for downlink beamforming in large-scale sparse MIMO channels. The core is a deep EDN architecture with three modules: (i) an encoder NN, deployed at each user end, that compresses estimated downlink channels into low-dimensional latent vectors. The latent vector from each user is compressed and then fed back to the BS. (ii) a beamformer decoder NN at the BS that maps recovered latent vectors to beamformers, and (iii) a channel decoder NN at the BS that reconstructs downlink channels from recovered latent vectors to further refine the beamformers. The training of EDN leverages two key strategies: (a) semi-amortized learning, where the beamformer decoder NN contains an analytical gradient ascent during both training and inference stages, and (b) knowledge distillation, where the loss function consists of a supervised term and an unsupervised term, and starting from supervised training with MMSE beamformers, over the epochs, the model training gradually shifts toward unsupervised using the sum-rate objective. The proposed EDN beamforming framework is extended to both far-field and near-field hybrid beamforming scenarios. Extensive simulations validate its effectiveness under diverse network and channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Precise HDV Positioning through Safety-Aware Integrated Sensing and Communication in a Value-of-Information-Driven 6G V2X System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) have unlocked new potential for addressing the dual demands of high-resolution positioning and reliable communication in 6G Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks. These capabilities are vital for transmitting safety-critical data from Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) to improve metrics such as Time to Collision (TTC) and reduce the Collision Risk (CR) ratio. However, limited radio resources and interference remain major obstacles to achieving both precision and capacity simultaneously. The challenge intensifies in mixedtraffic scenarios involving Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs), which lack connectivity and cannot share their status or positioning. Additionally, CAV sensors are limited in range and accuracy, making detection of HDVs unreliable. ISAC plays a pivotal role here by enabling the sensing of HDV positions via shared communication infrastructure, improving environmental awareness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Value of Information (VoI) metric that prioritizes the transmission of safety-critical data. The joint sensing-communication-control problem is modeled as a two-time-scale sequential decision process and solved using a Multi-Agent Distributed Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm. By focusing on high- VoI data, the framework reduces complexity and optimizes network and traffic resource usage. Simulations show that the proposed approach significantly reduces the CR ratio by at least 33% and improves the TTC by up to 66%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing safety and efficiency in mixedautonomy environments.</description>

      <title>Conceptualizing and Modeling Communication-Based Cyberattacks on Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) is rapidly proliferating across electric vehicles (EVs) and internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, enhancing traffic flow while simultaneously expanding the attack surface for communication-based cyberattacks. Because the two powertrains translate control inputs into motion differently, their cyber-resilience remains unquantified. Therefore, we formalize six novel message-level attack vectors and implement them in a ring-road simulation that systematically varies the ACC market penetration rates (MPRs) and the spatial pattern of compromised vehicles. A three-tier risk taxonomy converts disturbance metrics into actionable defense priorities for practitioners. Across all simulation scenarios, EV platoons exhibit lower velocity standard deviation, reduced spacing oscillations, and faster post-attack recovery compared to ICE counterparts, revealing an inherent stability advantage. These findings clarify how controller-to-powertrain coupling influences vulnerability and offer quantitative guidance for the detection and mitigation of attacks in mixed automated traffic.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modeling and Control System Analysis for Continuous-Disc Filters in Pulp Mill Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vacuum disc filtration is critical in pulp mills for white liquor clarification and pulp washing, involving tightly coupled dynamics between rotational speed, vacuum pressure, slurry concentration, filtrate flow, and cake thickness. These nonlinear interactions are often regulated using empirical methods, lacking formal modeling and control. This article develops a dynamic, multivariable model of a continuous-disc filter (CD-filter) system based on first principles, simplified to a single representative disc for tractability. A linearized state-space model supports the design of two control strategies: a decentralized PI-based scheme and a centralized model predictive control (MPC). MATLAB-Simulink simulations reveal that MPC outperforms PI in tracking accuracy, overshoot reduction, and disturbance rejection. A 3D efficiency surface illustrates the importance of coordinating inlet flow and solids concentration. Results highlight the need for advanced multivariable control in optimizing CD-filter performance.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stochastic Distribution System Hardening Based on Bayesian Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme weather frequently cause widespread outages in distribution systems (DSs), demonstrating the importance of hardening strategies for resilience enhancement. However, the well-utilization of real-world outage data with associated weather conditions to make informed hardening decisions in DSs is still an open issue. To bridge this research gap, this paper proposes a data-driven stochastic distribution line (DL) hardening strategy. First, a deep neural network (DNN) regression model is developed to predict the probabilistic evolution of outage scenarios under various hardening decisions. Based on the DNN predictions, the problem is formulated as a decision-dependent distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model, accounting for uncertainties in outage scenario distributions using a data-driven ambiguity set. To address decision-dependent uncertainty, a Bayesian online learning algorithm is proposed. This algorithm decomposes the original problem into inner and outer problems. Then, it iteratively refines hardening decisions by sequentially incorporating outage data and dynamically updating decision-specific ambiguity sets by using Bayes' theorem and Bayesian Inference. Also, the convergence of the algorithm is proven through dynamic regret analysis. Finally, case studies are implemented on a real-world DS in Redfield, Iowa, USA. A dataset spanning 24 years (2001-2024) is constructed based on the utility outage records. The simulation results validates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description>

      <title>Power Distribution System Blackstart Restoration Using Renewable Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating renewable energy sources into the grid not only reduces global carbon emissions, but also facilitates distribution system (DS) blackstart restoration. This process leverages renewable energy, inverters, situational awareness and distribution automation to initiate blackstart at the DS level, obtaining a fast response and bottom-up restoration. In this Review, we survey the latest technological advances for DS blackstart restoration using renewable energy. We first present mathematical models for distributed energy resources (DERs), network topology, and load dynamics. We then discuss how the situational awareness can help improve restoration performance through real-time monitoring and forecasting. Next, the DS blackstart restoration problem, including objectives, constraints, and existing methodologies for decision-making are provided. Lastly, we outline remaining challenges, and highlight the opportunities and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Situationally Aware Rolling Horizon Multi-Tier Load Restoration Considering Behind-The-Meter DER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restoration in power distribution systems (PDSs) is well studied, however, most existing research focuses on network partition and microgrid formation, where load transfer is limited to adjacent feeders. This focus is not practical, as when adjacent feeders lack sufficient capacity, utilities may request support from more distant feeders in practice. Such a hirarchical restoration is complex, especially when involving changing system conditions due to cold load pickup and delayed reconnection of behind-the-meter DERs. To fill this research gap, a situationally aware multi-tier load restoration framework is proposed. Specifically, models are proposed to describe the multi-tier load restoration, including the multi-tier load transfer and substation transformer and feeder protection models. By introducing binary actional switching variables and load block transfer variables, the models effectively captures the dynamics of switches and multi-tier transfer process. To integrate situational awareness of evolving system conditions, the problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) and then embedded within a rolling horizon optimization. Particularly, a set of safeguarded constraints are developed based on segment-level restoration reward bounds to mitigate the myopia of traditional rolling horizon optimization. The proposed safeguarded rolling strategy guarantees that each time step is lower bounded by a $(1-\varepsilon)$-fraction of its optimal restoration potential, thereby balancing short-term switching decisions with long-term restoration goals. Finally, cases studies on the modified IEEE 123-node test feeder validate the proposed multi-tier restoration framework.</description>

      <title>A Bilevel Optimization Framework for Adversarial Control of Gas Pipeline Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyberattacks on pipeline operational technology systems pose growing risks to energy infrastructure. This study develops a physics-informed simulation and optimization framework for analyzing cyber-physical threats in petroleum pipeline networks. The model integrates networked hydraulic dynamics, SCADA-based state estimation, model predictive control (MPC), and a bi-level formulation for stealthy false-data injection (FDI) attacks. Pipeline flow and pressure dynamics are modeled on a directed graph using nodal pressure evolution and edge-based Weymouth-type relations, including control-aware equipment such as valves and compressors. An extended Kalman filter estimates the full network state from partial SCADA telemetry. The controller computes pressure-safe control inputs via MPC under actuator constraints and forecasted demands. Adversarial manipulation is formalized as a bi-level optimization problem where an attacker perturbs sensor data to degrade throughput while remaining undetected by bad-data detectors. This attack-control interaction is solved via Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) reformulation, which results in a tractable mixed-integer quadratic program. Test gas pipeline case studies demonstrate the covert reduction of service delivery under attack. Results show that undetectable attacks can cause sustained throughput loss with minimal instantaneous deviation. This reveals the need for integrated detection and control strategies in cyber-physical infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed Time Control using Linear Matrix Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a synthesis approach aiming to guarantee a minimum upper-bound for the time taken to reach a target set of non-zero measure that encompasses the origin, while taking into account uncertainties and input and state constraints. This approach is based on a harmonic transformation of the Lyapunov function and a novel piecewise quadratic representation of this transformed Lyapunov function over a simplicial partition of the state space. The problem is solved in a policy iteration fashion, whereas the evaluation and improvement steps are formulated as linear matrix inequalities employing the structural relaxation approach. Though initially formulated for uncertain polytopic systems, extensions to piecewise and nonlinear systems are discussed. Three examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in different scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Control-Barrier-Function-Based Algorithm for Policy Adaptation in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of adapting a predesigned policy, represented by a parameterized function class, from a solution that minimizes a given original cost function to a trade-off solution between minimizing the original objective and an additional cost function. The problem is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, where deviations from the optimal value of the original cost are explicitly constrained. To solve it, we develop a closed-loop system that governs the evolution of the policy parameters, with a closed-loop controller designed to adjust the additional cost gradient to ensure the satisfaction of the constraint. The resulting closed-loop system, termed control-barrier-function-based policy adaptation, exploits the set-invariance property of control barrier functions to guarantee constraint satisfaction. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical experiments on the Cartpole and Lunar Lander benchmarks from OpenAI Gym, as well as a quadruped robot, thereby illustrating both its practicality and potential for real-world policy adaptation.</description>

      <title>Periodic Event-Triggered Prescribed Time Control of Euler-Lagrange Systems under State and Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a periodic event-triggered adaptive barrier control policy for the trajectory tracking problem of perturbed Euler-Lagrangian systems with state, input, and temporal (SIT) constraints. In particular, an approximation-free adaptive-barrier control architecture is designed to ensure prescribed-time convergence of the tracking error to a prescribed bound while rejecting exogenous disturbances. In contrast to existing approaches that necessitate continuous real-time control action, the proposed controller generates event-based updates through periodic evaluation of the triggering condition. Additionally, we derive an upper bound on the monitoring period by analysing the performance degradation of the filtered tracking error to facilitate periodic evaluation of the event-triggered strategy. To this end, a time-varying threshold function is considered in the triggering mechanism to reduce the number of triggers during the transient phase of system behaviour. Notably, the proposed design avoids Zeno behaviour and precludes the need for continuous monitoring of the triggering condition. A simulation and experimental study is undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed control scheme.</description>

      <title>Life Estimation of HVDC Cable Insulation under Load Cycles: from Macroscopic to Microscopic Charge Conduction Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper goes one step forward in the life estimation of HVDC cable insulation under load cycles by introducing for the first time a microscopic model of charge conduction and transport i.e., Bipolar Charge Transport BCT model for electric field calculation inside the insulation thickness. The paper firstly includes the development and the validation of BCT model with that found in literature. Then, the parameters of the developed BCT model are optimized using Pulsed Electro-Acoustic PEA space charge measurements. Followed by the integration of the developed, validated and optimized model into the electric field calculation for life estimation of a 500 kV DC-XLPE insulated cable subjected to Type Test load cycles according to Cigre Techical Brochure 852. The developed microscopic model is compared to the macroscopic models already found in the literature. The microscopic model shows a comparable electric field inversion similarly to macroscopic models. However, the behavior of the microscopic model is noticed to be different under heating and cooling load cycles. In hot cable, the maximum electric field stabilizes at different amplitude and position inside the insulation thickness in both models. This investigation has been carried out in the framework of the HEU-NEWGEN research project.</description>

      <title>Delay-Tolerant Augmented-Consensus-based Distributed Directed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed optimization finds applications in large-scale machine learning, data processing and classification over multi-agent networks. In real-world scenarios, the communication network of agents may encounter latency that may affect the convergence of the optimization protocol. This paper addresses the case where the information exchange among the agents (computing nodes) over data-transmission channels (links) might be subject to communication time-delays, which is not well addressed in the existing literature. Our proposed algorithm improves the state-of-the-art by handling heterogeneous and arbitrary but bounded and fixed (time-invariant) delays over general strongly-connected directed networks. Arguments from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and augmented consensus formulation are applied to prove the convergence to the optimal value. Simulations are provided to verify the results and compare the performance with some existing delay-free algorithms.</description>

      <title>Global Convergence of Policy Gradient for Entropy Regularized Linear-Quadratic Control with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for sequential decision-making in dynamic environments, particularly when system parameters are unknown. This paper investigates RL-based control for entropy-regularized Linear Quadratic control (LQC) problems with multiplicative noises over an infinite time horizon. First, we adapt the Regularized Policy Gradient (RPG) algorithm to stochastic optimal control settings, proving that despite the non-convexity of the problem, RPG converges globally under conditions of gradient domination and near-smoothness. Second, based on zero-order optimization approach, we introduce a novel model free RL algorithm: Sample-Based Regularized Policy Gradient (SB-RPG). SB-RPG operates without knowledge of system parameters yet still retains strong theoretical guarantees of global convergence. Our model leverages entropy regularization to accelerate convergence and address the exploration versus exploitation trade-off inherent in RL. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the efficacy of SB-RPG in unknown-parameters environments.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Air Mixing Reduces the Efficiency of Commercial Buildings Behaving as Virtual Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commercial building Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems can provide flexibility to the electricity grid. Some researchers have found it convenient to model HVAC systems as virtual batteries. These models also better align with models used by grid planners and operators. However, experiments have shown that HVAC load shifting can be inefficient, and virtual battery models do not capture this inefficiency well. While the models typically use the average room temperature as the system's ``state of charge," they do not capture other factors that affect HVAC power/energy such as airflow and mixing. Here, we develop a new analytical building model to explore how incomplete mixing of supply air into a conditioned space leads to inefficiency in a virtual battery capturing the dynamics of HVAC fan power load shifting. The model qualitatively matches experimental results better than previous models, and shows that, as mixing becomes worse, the virtual battery becomes less efficient. Unfortunately, air mixing is unmeasured/unmeasurable. However, we show that, by closing the loop around measurements of fan power, we can improve the virtual battery's performance without the need for air mixing measurements. For example, in one case, we show a roundtrip efficiency improvement from 0.75 to 0.99.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading for Multi-Microgrids: Improved Double Auction Mechanism and Prediction-Free Online Trading Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer-to-peer energy trading offers a promising solution for enhancing renewable energy utilization and economic benefits within interconnected microgrids. However, existing real-time P2P markets face two key challenges: high computational complexity in trading mechanisms, and suboptimal participant decision-making under diverse uncertainties. Existing prediction-based decision-making methods rely heavily on accurate forecasts, which are typically unavailable for microgrids, while prediction-free methods suffer from myopic behaviors. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an improved double auction mechanism combined with an adaptive step-size search algorithm to reduce computational burden, and a data-driven dual-reference online optimization (DDOO) framework to enhance participant decision-making. The improved mechanism simplifies bidding procedures, significantly reducing computational burden and ensuring rapid convergence to the market equilibrium. Additionally, the prediction-free DDOO framework mitigates myopic decision-making by introducing two informative reference signals. Case studies on a 20-microgrid system demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed mechanism and approach. The improved mechanism significantly decreases the computational time while increasing local energy self-sufficiency periods from 0.01% to 29.86%, reducing reverse power flow periods from 24.51% to 3.96%, and lowering average operating costs by 19.20%. Compared with conventional approaches such as Lyapunov optimization and model predictive control, the DDOO framework achieves a 10%-13% reduction in operating costs with an optimality gap of only 5.76%.</description>

      <title>Economic zone data-enabled predictive control for connected open water systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time regulation of water distribution in connected open water systems is critical for ensuring system safety and meeting operational requirements. In this work, we consider a connected open water system that includes linkage hydraulic structures such as weirs, pumps and sluice gates. We propose a mixed-integer economic zone data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) approach, which is used to maintain the water levels of the branches within desired zones to avoid floods and reduce the energy consumption of the pumps in the considered water system. The proposed DeePC-based approach predicts the future dynamics of the system water levels, and generates optimal control actions based on system input and output data, thereby eliminating the need for both first-principles modeling and explicit data-driven modeling. To achieve multiple control objectives in order of priority, we utilize lexicographic optimization and adapt traditional DeePC cost function for zone tracking and energy consumption minimization. Additionally, Bayesian optimization is utilized to determine the control target zone, which effectively balances zone tracking and energy consumption in the presence of external disturbances. Comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method maintains water levels within the desired zone for 97.04% of the operating time, with an average energy consumption of 33.5 kWh per 0.5 h. Compared to baseline methods, the proposed approach reduces the zone-tracking mean square error by 98.82% relative to economic zone DeePC without Bayesian optimization, and lowers energy consumption by 44.08% relative to economic set-point tracking DeePC. As compared to passive pump/gate control, the proposed method lowers the frequency of zone violations by 86.94% and the average energy consumption by 4.69%.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue Tracking of Large-Scale Systems Impacted by Time Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper focuses on tracking eigenvalue trajectories in power system models with time delays. We formulate a continuation-based approach that employs numerical integration to follow eigenvalues as system parameters vary, in the presence of one or multiple delayed variables. The formulation preserves the sparsity of the delay differential-algebraic equation (DDAE) system model and allows treating the delay magnitude itself as a varying parameter with implementation aspects discussed in detail. Accuracy is demonstrated on a modified IEEE 39-bus system with distributed energy resources. Scalability is discussed using a realistic dynamic model of the Irish transmission network.</description>

      <title>A Dimension-Decomposed Learning Framework for Online Disturbance Identification in Quadrotor SE(3) Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadrotor stability under complex dynamic disturbances and model uncertainties poses significant challenges. One of them remains the underfitting problem in high-dimensional features, which limits the identification capability of current learning-based methods. To address this, we introduce a new perspective: Dimension-Decomposed Learning (DiD-L), from which we develop the Sliced Adaptive-Neuro Mapping (SANM) approach for geometric control. Specifically, the high-dimensional mapping for identification is axially ``sliced" into multiple low-dimensional submappings (``slices"). In this way, the complex high-dimensional problem is decomposed into a set of simple low-dimensional tasks addressed by shallow neural networks and adaptive laws. These neural networks and adaptive laws are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without any pre-training or persistent excitation (PE) condition. To enhance the interpretability of the proposed approach, we prove that the full-state closed-loop system exhibits arbitrarily close to exponential stability despite multi-dimensional time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties. This result is novel as it demonstrates exponential convergence without requiring pre-training for unknown disturbances and specific knowledge of the model.</description>

      <title>Improved Robustness of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Control of Time-Varying Systems by Bounded Extremum Seeking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of robust model independent bounded extremum seeking (ES) feedback control to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) controllers for a class of nonlinear time-varying systems. DRL has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and, like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning for costate initialization using Markov chain Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global search and optimization of long-duration, low-thrust spacecraft trajectories with the indirect method is challenging due to a complex solution space and the difficulty of generating good initial guesses for the costate variables. This is particularly true in multibody environments. Given data that reveals a partial Pareto optimal front, it is desirable to find a flexible manner in which the Pareto front can be completed and fronts for related trajectory problems can be found. In this work we use conditional diffusion models to represent the distribution of candidate optimal trajectory solutions. We then introduce into this framework the novel approach of using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms with self-supervised fine-tuning to achieve the aforementioned goals. Specifically, a random walk Metropolis algorithm is employed to propose new data that can be used to fine-tune the diffusion model using a reward-weighted training based on efficient evaluations of constraint violations and missions objective functions. The framework removes the need for separate focused and often tedious data generation phases. Numerical experiments are presented for two problems demonstrating the ability to improve sample quality and explicitly target Pareto optimality based on the theory of Markov chains. The first problem does so for a transfer in the Jupiter-Europa circular restricted three-body problem, where the MCMC approach completes a partial Pareto front. The second problem demonstrates how a dense and superior Pareto front can be generated by the MCMC self-supervised fine-tuning method for a Saturn-Titan transfer starting from the Jupiter-Europa case versus a separate dedicated global search.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Prediction Error Method and Subspace Identification: A Weighted Null Space Fitting Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subspace identification methods (SIMs) have proven to be very useful and numerically robust for building state-space models. While most SIMs are consistent, few if any can achieve the efficiency of the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE). Conversely, the prediction error method (PEM) with a quadratic criteria is equivalent to MLE, but it comes with non-convex optimization problems and requires good initialization points. This contribution proposes a weighted null space fitting (WNSF) approach for estimating state-space models, combining some key advantages of the two aforementioned mainstream approaches. It starts with a least-squares estimate of a high-order ARX model, and then a multi-step least-squares procedure reduces the model to a state-space model on canoncial form. It is demonstrated through statistical analysis that when a canonical parameterization is admissible, the proposed method is consistent and asymptotically efficient, thereby making progress on the long-standing open problem about the existence of an asymptotically efficient SIM. Numerical and practical examples are provided to illustrate that the proposed method performs favorable in comparison with SIMs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Optimal Path Planning in Dynamic Environments Using Koopman MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven model predictive control framework for mobile robots navigating in dynamic environments, leveraging Koopman operator theory. Unlike the conventional Koopman-based approaches that focus on the linearization of system dynamics only, our work focuses on finding a global linear representation for the optimal path planning problem that includes both the nonlinear robot dynamics and collision-avoidance constraints. We deploy extended dynamic mode decomposition to identify linear and bilinear Koopman realizations from input-state data. Our open-loop analysis demonstrates that only the bilinear Koopman model can accurately capture nonlinear state-input couplings and quadratic terms essential for collision avoidance, whereas linear realizations fail to do so. We formulate a quadratic program for the robot path planning in the presence of moving obstacles in the lifted space and determine the optimal robot action in an MPC framework. Our approach is capable of finding the safe optimal action 320 times faster than a nonlinear MPC counterpart that solves the path planning problem in the original state space. Our work highlights the potential of bilinear Koopman realizations for linearization of highly nonlinear optimal control problems subject to nonlinear state and input constraints to achieve computational efficiency similar to linear problems.</description>

      <title>Assist-as-needed Control for FES in Foot Drop Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foot drop is commonly managed using Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES), typically delivered via open-loop controllers with fixed stimulation intensities. While users may manually adjust the intensity through external controls, this approach risks overstimulation, leading to muscle fatigue and discomfort, or understimulation, which compromises dorsiflexion and increases fall risk. In this study, we propose a novel closed-loop FES controller that dynamically adjusts the stimulation intensity based on real-time toe clearance, providing "assistance as needed". We evaluate this system by inducing foot drop in healthy participants and comparing the effects of the closed-loop controller with a traditional open-loop controller across various walking conditions, including different speeds and surface inclinations. Kinematic data reveal that our closed-loop controller maintains adequate toe clearance without significantly affecting the joint angles of the hips, the knees, and the ankles, and while using significantly lower stimulation intensities compared to the open-loop controller. These findings suggest that the proposed method not only matches the effectiveness of existing systems but also offers the potential for reduced muscle fatigue and improved long-term user comfort and adherence.</description>

      <title>Single-Rod Brachiation Robot: Mechatronic Control Design and Validation of Prejump Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete mechatronic design of a minimal configuration brachiation robot is presented. The robot consists of a single rigid rod with gripper mechanisms attached to both ends. The grippers are used to hang the robot on a horizontal bar on which it swings or rotates. The motion is imposed by repositioning the robot's center of mass, which is performed using a crank-slide mechanism. Based on a non-linear model, an optimal control strategy is proposed, for repositioning the center of mass in a bang-bang manner. Consequently, utilizing the concept of input-output linearization, a continuous control strategy is proposed that takes into account the limited torque of the crank-slide mechanism and its geometry. An increased attention is paid to energy accumulation towards the subsequent jump stage of the brachiation. These two strategies are validated and compared in simulations. The continuous control strategy is then also implemented within a low-cost STM32-based control system, and both the swing and rotation stages of the brachiation motion are experimentally validated.</description>

Abstract: Proactive preservation of steel structures at culturally significant heritage sites like the San Sebastian Basilica in the Philippines requires accurate corrosion forecasting. This study developed an Internet of Things hardware system connected with LoRa wireless communications to monitor heritage buildings with steel structures. From a three year dataset generated by the IoT system, we built a machine learning framework for predicting atmospheric corrosion rates using only temperature and relative humidity data. Deployed via a Streamlit dashboard with ngrok tunneling for public access, the framework provides real-time corrosion monitoring and actionable preservation recommendations. This minimal-data approach is scalable and cost effective for heritage sites with limited monitoring resources, showing that advanced regression can extract accurate corrosion predictions from basic meteorological data enabling proactive preservation of culturally significant structures worldwide without requiring extensive sensor networks</description>

      <title>Distributed Feedback-Feedforward Algorithms for Time-Varying Resource Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies distributed Time-Varying Resource Allocation (TVRA) where the local cost functions, global equality constraints, and Local Feasibility Constraints (LFCs) vary with time. Algorithms that mimic the structure of feedback-feedforward control systems are proposed. Feedback and feedforward laws are generated using local estimates from a distributed estimator, while a distributed controller enforces the stationarity condition within a fixed time and updates the candidate solution accordingly. To handle the LFCs, feedback laws based on projection and feedforward laws that switch between different modes are introduced as an initialization-free alternative to the barrier-based methods used in most related works. Our projection-based method guarantees that, for any infeasible initial value, the state trajectory enters the locally feasible set within a fixed time and remains within it thereafter, and that the set is forward invariant if the initial value is locally feasible. Convergence analyses are conducted under mild assumptions. For cases without LFCs, the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal trajectory within a fixed time. For cases with LFCs, the proposed algorithm is globally asymptotically stable at the optimal trajectory while exhibiting fixed-time convergence between consecutive switching instants. Numerical examples and a power system application verify their effectiveness.</description>

Abstract: Koopman operator theory has emerged as a powerful tool for system identification, particularly for approximating nonlinear time-invariant systems (NTIS). This paper considers a network of agents with limited observation capabilities that collaboratively estimate the dynamics of an NTIS. A distributed deep Koopman learning algorithm is developed by integrating Koopman operator theory, deep neural networks, and consensus-based coordination. In the proposed framework, each agent approximates the system dynamics using its partial measurements and lifted states exchanged with its neighbors. This cooperative scheme enables accurate reconstruction of the global dynamics despite the absence of full-state information at individual agents. Simulation results on the Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI Gym demonstrate that the proposed method achieves performance comparable to the centralized deep Koopman learning with full-state access.</description>

      <title>Distributed Koopman Learning using Partial Trajectories for Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed data-driven framework for dynamics learning, termed distributed deep Koopman learning using partial trajectories (DDKL-PT). In this framework, each agent in a multi-agent system is assigned a partial trajectory offline and locally approximates the unknown dynamics using a deep neural network within the Koopman operator framework. By exchanging local estimated dynamics rather than training data, agents achieve consensus on a global dynamics model without sharing their private training trajectories. Simulation studies on a surface vehicle demonstrate that DDKL-PT attains consensus with respect to the learned dynamics, with each agent achieving reasonably small approximation errors over the testing data. Furthermore, a model predictive control scheme is developed by integrating the learned Koopman dynamics with known kinematic relations. Results on goal-tracking and station-keeping tasks support that the distributedly learned dynamics are sufficiently accurate for model-based optimal control.</description>

      <title>Future pathways for eVTOLs: A design optimization perspective</title>

Abstract: The rapid development of advanced urban air mobility, particularly electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, requires interdisciplinary approaches involving the future urban air mobility ecosystem. Operational cost efficiency, regulatory aspects, sustainability, and environmental compatibility should be incorporated directly into the conceptual design of aircraft and across operational and regulatory strategies. In this work, we apply a novel multidisciplinary design optimization framework for the conceptual design of eVTOL aircraft. The framework optimizes conventional design elements of eVTOL aircraft over a generic mission and integrates a comprehensive operational cost model to directly capture economic incentives of the designed system through profit modeling for operators. We introduce a novel metric, the cross-transportation Figure of Merit (FoM), to compare the optimized eVTOL system with various competing road, rail, and air transportation modes in terms of sustainability, cost, and travel time. We investigate four objective-specific eVTOL optimization designs in a broad scenario space, mapping regulatory, technical, and operational constraints to generate a representation of potential urban air mobility stakeholder-centric design objectives. The analysis of an optimized profit-maximizing eVTOL, cost-minimizing eVTOL, sustainability-maximizing eVTOL, and a combined FoM-maximizing eVTOL design highlights significant trade-offs in the area of profitability, operational flexibility, and sustainability strategies. This underlines the importance of incorporating multiple operationally tangential disciplines into the design process, while also reflecting the diverse priorities of stakeholders such as operators, regulators, and society.</description>

      <title>Koopman-Nemytskii Operator: A Linear Representation of Nonlinear Controlled Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Koopman operator lifts a nonlinear system into an infinite-dimensional function space and represents it as a linear dynamics, its definition is restricted to autonomous systems, i.e., does not incorporate inputs or disturbances. To the end of designing state-feedback controllers, the existing extensions of Koopman operator, which only account for the effect of open-loop values of inputs, does not involve feedback laws on closed-loop systems. Hence, in order to generically represent any nonlinear controlled dynamics linearly, this paper proposes a Koopman-Nemytskii operator, defined as a linear mapping from a product reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of states and feedback laws to an RKHS of states. Using the equivalence between RKHS and Sobolev-Hilbert spaces under certain regularity conditions on the dynamics and kernel selection, this operator is well-defined. Its data-based approximation, which follows a kernel extended dynamic mode decomposition (kernel EDMD) approach, have established errors in single-step and multi-step state predictions as well as accumulated cost under control.</description>

Abstract: Many industries now deploy high-fidelity simulators (digital twins) to represent physical systems, yet their parameters must be calibrated to match the true system. This motivated the construction of simulation-driven parameter estimators, built by generating synthetic observations for sampled parameter values and learning a supervised mapping from observations to parameters. However, when the true parameters lie outside the sampled range, predictions suffer from an out-of-distribution (OOD) error. This paper introduces a fine-tuning approach for the Two-Stage estimator that mitigates OOD effects and improves accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Verifiable Mission Planning For Space Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spacecraft must operate under environmental and actuator uncertainties while meeting strict safety requirements. Traditional approaches rely on scenario-based heuristics that fail to account for stochastic influences, leading to suboptimal or unsafe plans. We propose a finite-horizon, chance-constrained Markov decision process for mission planning, where states represent mission and vehicle parameters, actions correspond to operational adjustments, and temporal logic specifications encode operational constraints. We synthesize policies that optimize mission objectives while ensuring constraints are met with high probability. Applied to the GRACE-FO mission, the approach accounts for stochastic solar activity and uncertain thrust performance, yielding maneuver schedules that maximize scientific return and provably satisfy safety requirements. This work demonstrates how Markov decision processes can be applied to space missions, enabling autonomous operation with formal guarantees.</description>

      <title>Planning Stealthy Backdoor Attacks in MDPs with Observation-Based Triggers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates backdoor attack planning in stochastic control systems modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In a backdoor attack, the adversary provides a control policy that behaves well in the original MDP to pass the testing phase. However, when such a policy is deployed with a trigger policy, which perturbs the system dynamics at runtime, it optimizes the attacker's objective instead. To solve jointly the control policy and its trigger, we formulate the attack planning problem as a constrained optimal planning problem in an MDP with augmented state space, with the objective to maximize the attacker's total rewards in the system with an activated trigger, subject to the constraint that the control policy is near optimal in the original MDP. We then introduce a gradient-based optimization method to solve the optimal backdoor attack policy as a pair of coordinated control and trigger policies. Experimental results from a case study validate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving stealthy backdoor attacks.</description>

Abstract: The paper focuses on the problem of tracking eigenvalue trajectories in large-scale power system models as system parameters vary. A continuation-based formulation is presented for tracing any single eigenvalue of interest, which supports sparse matrix representations and accommodates both explicit and semi-implicit differential-algebraic models. Key implementation aspects, such as numerical integration, matrix updates, derivative approximations, and handling defective eigenvalues, are discussed in detail and practical recommendations are duly provided. The tracking approach is demonstrated through a comprehensive case study on the IEEE 39-bus system, as well as on a realistic dynamic model of the Irish transmission system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Jets (APPJs) show significant potential for biomedical applications, but their inherent complexity, characterized by nonlinear dynamics and strong sensitivity to operating conditions like tip-to-surface distance, presents challenges for real-time control. This paper introduces the Neural Parameter-varying Data-enabled Predictive Control (NPV-DeePC) framework to address these issues. By integrating hypernetworks into the neural DeePC paradigm, NPV-DeePC adaptively captures system nonlinearities and parameter variations, dynamically adjusts the neural network's learned representation of the system, enabling accurate multi-step trajectory prediction and control. Simulation studies on surface temperature tracking and thermal dose delivery demonstrate that NPV-DeePC achieves higher accuracy and adaptability than existing controllers. Moreover, its computational efficiency supports real-time implementation, making it a practical approach for precise APPJ control and a generalizable solution for other nonlinear, parameter-varying systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing the uncertainty introduced by increasing renewable integration is crucial for secure power system operation, yet capturing it while preserving the full nonlinear physics of the grid remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a stochastic security constrained optimal power flow model with chance constraints supporting nonlinear AC power flow equations and non Gaussian uncertainties. We use general polynomial chaos expansion to model arbitrary uncertainties of finite variance, enabling accurate moment computations and robust prediction of system states across diverse operating scenarios. The chance constraints probabilistically limit inequality violations, providing a more flexible representation of controllable variables and the consequent power system operation. Case studies validate the proposed models effectiveness in satisfying operational constraints and capturing uncertainty with high fidelity. Compared to the deterministic formulation, it also uncovers a wider set of unsecure contingencies, highlighting improved uncertainty capture and operational insight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide a powerful framework for ensuring safety in dynamical systems. However, their application typically relies on full state information, which is often violated in real-world scenarios due to the availability of partial state information. In this work, we propose a neural network-based framework for the co-design of a safety controller, observer, and CBF for partially observed continuous-time systems. By formulating barrier conditions over an augmented state space, our approach ensures safety without requiring bounded estimation errors or handcrafted barrier functions. All components are jointly trained by formulating appropriate loss functions, and we introduce a validity condition to provide formal safety guarantees beyond the training data. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several case studies.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we study a class of linear-quadratic mean-field-type difference games with coupled affine inequality constraints. We show that the mean-field-type equilibrium can be characterized by the existence of a multiplier process which satisfies some implicit complementarity conditions. Further, we show that the equilibrium strategies can be computed by reformulating these conditions as a single large-scale linear complementarity problem. We illustrate our results with an energy storage problem arising in the management of microgrids.</description>

      <title>Improved Monte Carlo Planning via Causal Disentanglement for Structurally-Decomposed Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), as a general-purpose framework, often overlook the benefits of incorporating the causal structure of the transition and reward dynamics. For a subclass of resource allocation problems, we introduce the Structurally Decomposed MDP (SD-MDP), which leverages causal disentanglement to partition an MDP's temporal causal graph into independent components. By exploiting this disentanglement, SD-MDP enables dimensionality reduction and computational efficiency gains in optimal value function estimation. We reduce the sequential optimization problem to a fractional knapsack problem with log-linear complexity $O(T \log T)$, outperforming traditional stochastic programming methods that exhibit polynomial complexity with respect to the time horizon $T$. Additionally, SD-MDP's computational advantages are independent of state-action space size, making it viable for high-dimensional spaces. Furthermore, our approach integrates seamlessly with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), achieving higher expected rewards under constrained simulation budgets while providing a vanishing simple regret bound. Empirical results demonstrate superior policy performance over benchmarks across various logistics and finance domains.</description>

      <title>Scalable analysis of stop-and-go waves: Representation, measurements and insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing stop-and-go waves at the scale of miles and hours of data is an emerging challenge in traffic research. The past 5 years have seen an explosion in the availability of large-scale traffic data containing traffic waves and complex congestion patterns, making existing approaches unsuitable for repeatable and scalable analysis of traffic waves in these data. This paper makes a first step towards addressing this challenge by introducing an automatic and scalable stop-and-go wave identification method capable of capturing wave generation, propagation, dissipation, as well as bifurcation and merging, which have previously been observed only very rarely. Using a concise and simple critical-speed based definition of a stop-and-go wave, the proposed method identifies all wave boundaries that encompass spatio-temporal points where vehicle speed is below a chosen critical speed. The method is built upon a graph representation of the spatio-temporal points associated with stop-and-go waves, specifically wave front (start) points and wave tail (end) points, and approaches the solution as a graph component identification problem. It enables the measurement of wave properties at scale. The method is implemented in Python and demonstrated on a large-scale dataset, I-24 MOTION INCEPTION. Our results show insights on the complexity of traffic waves. Traffic waves can bifurcate and merge at a scale that has never been observed or described before. The clustering analysis of all the identified wave components reveals the different topological structures of traffic waves. We explored that the wave merge or bifurcation points can be explained by spatial features. The gallery of all the identified wave topologies is demonstrated at https://trafficwaves.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Active Alignments of Lens Systems with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning a lens system relative to an imager is a critical challenge in camera manufacturing. While optimal alignment can be mathematically computed under ideal conditions, real-world deviations caused by manufacturing tolerances often render this approach impractical. Measuring these tolerances can be costly or even infeasible, and neglecting them may result in suboptimal alignments. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that learns exclusively in the pixel space of the sensor output, eliminating the need to develop expert-designed alignment concepts. We conduct an extensive benchmark study and show that our approach surpasses other methods in speed, precision, and robustness. We further introduce relign, a realistic, freely explorable, open-source simulation utilizing physically based rendering that models optical systems with non-deterministic manufacturing tolerances and noise in robotic alignment movement. It provides an interface to popular machine learning frameworks, enabling seamless experimentation and development. Our work highlights the potential of RL in a manufacturing environment to enhance efficiency of optical alignments while minimizing the need for manual intervention.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Game-theoretic approaches and Nash equilibrium have been widely applied across various engineering domains. However, practical challenges such as disturbances, delays, and actuator limitations can hinder the precise execution of Nash equilibrium strategies. This work investigates the impact of such implementation imperfections on game trajectories and players' costs in the context of a two-player finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) nonzero-sum game. Specifically, we analyze how small deviations by one player, measured or estimated at each stage, affect the state and cost function of the other player. To mitigate these effects, we propose an adjusted control policy that optimally compensates for the deviations under the stated information structure and can, under certain conditions, exploit them to improve performance. Rigorous mathematical analysis and proofs are provided, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a representative numerical example.</description>

      <title>Online Feedback Optimization for Monotone Systems without Timescale Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) steers a dynamical plant to a cost-efficient steady-state, only relying on input-output sensitivity information, rather than on a full plant model. Unlike traditional feedforward approaches, OFO leverages real-time measurements from the plant, thereby inheriting the robustness and adaptability of feedback control. Unfortunately, existing theoretical guarantees for OFO assume that the controller operates on a slower timescale than the plant, which can affect responsiveness and transient performance. In this paper, we focus on relaxing this ``timescale separation'' assumption. Specifically, we consider the class of monotone systems, and we prove that OFO can achieve an optimal operating point, regardless of the time constants of controller and plant. By leveraging a small gain theorem for monotone systems, we derive several sufficient conditions for global convergence. Notably, these conditions depend only on the steady-state behavior of the plant, and they are entirely independent of the transient dynamics.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a neuromorphic system for cognitive load classification in a real-world setting, an Air Traffic Control (ATC) task, using a hardware implementation of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking features, extracted from an open-source dataset, were used to train and evaluate both conventional machine learning models and SNNs. Among the SNN architectures explored, a minimalistic, single-layer model trained with a biologically inspired delta-rule learning algorithm achieved competitive performance (80.6%). To enable deployment on neuromorphic hardware, the model was quantized and implemented on the mixed-signal DYNAP-SE chip. Despite hardware constraints and analog variability, the chip-deployed SNN maintained a classification accuracy of up to 73.5% using spike-based input. These results demonstrate the feasibility of event-driven neuromorphic systems for ultra-low-power, embedded cognitive state monitoring in dynamic real-world scenarios.</description>
