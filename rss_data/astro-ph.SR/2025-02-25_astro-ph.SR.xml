      <title>Sub-Millimeter Variability in the Envelope &amp; Warped Protostellar Disk of the Class 0 Protostar HOPS 358</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JCMT Transient Survey recently discovered that the Class 0 protostar HOPS 358 decreased in 350 GHz continuum brightness by $\sim25$% over the course of four years before brightening again for the next four. The JCMT lightcurve can be fit by a long timescale dip lasting roughly eight years. A shorter timescale periodicity is also apparent with a period of 1.75 years and a small 3% amplitude. NEOWise monitoring reveals that the mid-IR wavelength brightness of HOPS 358 follows a similar long-term pattern in time. Here, we present a study of nine epochs of ALMA observations of HOPS 358 taken over the course of the decline and subsequent rise in brightness seen with the JCMT to test whether the variation seen on $\sim15"$ scales, covering both disk and envelope, is also observed on smaller, $&lt;1"$ scales that primarily probe HOPS 358's protostellar disk. We detect both HOPS 358 and its southern companion, HOPS 358B, in our ALMA observations, and find that at least one of the two is varying. Assuming that HOPS 358 is the variable, the light curve has the same shape as that found by the JCMT. Additionally, our high resolution ALMA imaging of HOPS 358 reveals that the disk is warped, with a $16^{\circ}$ warp at a disk radius of 35 au, about halfway through the extent of the disk. The physical origin of the warp along with how it relates to the variability seen towards HOPS 358, however, remain unclear.</description>

      <title>New Stellar Parameters, Metallicities, and Elemental Abundance Ratios for 311 Metal-Poor Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present equivalent widths, improved model atmosphere parameters, and revised abundances for 14 species of 11 elements derived from high resolution optical spectroscopy of 311 metal-poor stars. All of these stars had their parameters previously published by Roederer et al. We use color-Teff relationships calibrated for Gaia and 2MASS photometry to calculate improved effective temperatures. We calculate log of surface gravity values using measurements derived from Gaia parallaxes and other fundamental stellar properties. We perform a standard LTE abundance analysis using MARCS model atmospheres and the MOOG line analysis software to rederive microturbulence velocity parameters, metallicities, and abundances based on O I, Na I, Mg I, Si I, K I, Ca I, Ti I, Ti II, Cr I, Cr II, Fe I, Fe II, Ni I, and Zn I lines using the previously measured equivalent widths. On average, the new Teff values are 310 K warmer, the new log g values are higher by 0.64 dex, and the new [Fe/H] values are higher by 0.26 dex. We apply NLTE corrections to the abundances derived from O I, Na I, Mg I, Si I, K I, Fe I, and Fe II lines. Our sample contains 6 stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -3.5, 28 stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -3.0, and 113 stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -2.5. Our revised abundances for these 311 stars are now in better agreement with those derived by previous studies of smaller samples of metal-poor stars in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Exact Nonlinear Decomposition of Ideal-MHD Waves Using Eigenenergies III: Gravity, Generalized Inhomogeneous Quasi-linear PDEs, Mode Conversion, and Numerical Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise tracking and measurement of the energy carried by the individual magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes has important implications and utility in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. Previously, this was only achievable in limited linear MHD cases in the $\beta \ll 1$ or $\beta \gg 1$ regimes. In a series of papers, of which this is the third, we introduced the Eigenenergy Decomposition Method (EEDM) and derived exact analytical expressions for the modal energy components--called eigenenergies--of nonlinear 3D disturbances governed by the homogeneous ideal-MHD equations. Here, we extend the method to inhomogeneous ideal-MHD by introducing a source term accounting for gravity, and provide detailed guidelines for applying the decomposition scheme to any general inhomogeneous quasi-linear PDEs that possess a globally conserved quantity, beyond the realm of MHD. Furthermore, we show that the eigenenergies can be used to locate and measure nonlinear mode conversions, which is an additional feature of the method. Finally, we provide well-categorized context for the application of the method to simulations and discuss the possible numerical inaccuracies that may inevitably arise due to discretization. This paper provides a more mature description of the method and its interpretation, and is recommended as the starting point for readers unfamiliar with the method.</description>

      <title>Discovery and characterization of ZTF J0112+5827: An 80.9-minute polar with strong cyclotron features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of ZTF J0112+5827, a new magnetic cataclysmic variable with an orbital period of 80.9 minutes. ROSAT observations revealed X-ray emission with an average flux of $(68.4 \pm 15.7) \times 10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ (0.1--2.4 keV). The ZTF light curves show ellipsoidal-like variability in the $g$ band and two prominent humps at phases $\sim$0.0 and $\sim$0.7 in $i$ and $r$ bands. Spectroscopic observations with the Palomar 200-inch telescope revealed cyclotron emission features and strong He II and Balmer emission lines. Doppler tomography shows clear accretion streams with line-of-sight velocities of $\sim$500 km s$^{-1}$, but no accretion disk. Analysis of cyclotron harmonics indicates a magnetic field strength of $38.7^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$ MG, confirming ZTF J0112+5827 as a polar system containing a strongly magnetic white dwarf.</description>

      <title>Physical parameters of 12201 ASAS-SN contact binaries determined by the Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of astronomical big data, more than one million contact binaries have been discovered. Traditional approaches of light curve analysis are inadequate for investigating such an extensive number of systems. This paper builds on prior research to present an advanced Neural Network model combined with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm and including spot parameters. This model was applied to 12785 contact binaries selected from All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. By removing those with goodness of fit less than 0.8, we obtained the physical parameters of 12201 contact binaries. Among these binaries, 4332 are A-subtype systems, while 7869 are W-type systems, and 1594 systems have mass ratios larger than 0.72 (H-subtype system). A statistical study of the physical parameters was carried out, and we found that there are two peaks in the mass ratio distribution and that the probability of the presence of spot is about 50%. In addition, the differences in flux between the two light maxima are from $-$0.1 to 0.1. As the orbital period and the temperature of the primary component decrease, the difference between the two light maxima becomes more pronounced. Based on the relationships between transfer parameter and luminosity ratio, as well as between luminosity ratio and mass ratio, we found that A-, W-, and H-type contact binaries are distributed in distinct regions.</description>

      <title>Bursty acceleration and 3D trajectories of electrons in a solar flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During a solar flare, electrons are accelerated to non-thermal energies as a result of magnetic reconnection. These electrons then propagate upwards and downwards from the energy release site along magnetic field lines and produce radio and X-ray emission. On 11 November 2022, an M5.1 solar flare was observed by the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board Solar Orbiter together with various ground- and space-based radio instruments. The flare was associated with several fine hard X-ray (HXR) structures and a complex set of metric radio bursts (type III, J, and narrowband). By studying the evolution of X-ray, extreme ultraviolet, and radio sources, we aim to study the trajectories of the flare-accelerated electrons in the lower solar atmosphere and low corona. We used observations from the STIX on board Solar Orbiter to study the evolution of X-ray sources. Using radio imaging from the Nan\c{c}ay Radio heliograph (NRH) and the Newkirk density model, we constructed 3D trajectories of 14 radio bursts. Imaging of the HXR fine structures shows several sources at different times. The STIX and NRH imaging shows correlated changes in the location of the HXR and radio source at the highest frequency during the most intense impulsive period. Imaging and 3D trajectories of all the bursts show that electrons are getting accelerated at different locations and along several distinct field lines. The longitude and latitude extent of the trajectories are ~30 arcsec and ~ 152 arcsec. We find that the electrons producing HXR and radio emission have similar acceleration origins. Importantly, our study supports the scenario that the flare acceleration process is temporally and spatially fragmentary, and during each of these small-scale processes, the electron beams are injected into a very fibrous environment and produce complex HXR and radio emission.</description>

      <title>Free-floating planetary mass objects in LDN 1495 from Euclid Early Release Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Substellar objects, including brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary-mass objects, are a significant product of star formation. Their sensitivity to initial conditions and early dynamical evolution makes them especially valuable for studying both planetary and stellar formation processes. Aims. We search for brown dwarfs and isolated planetary mass objects in a young star forming region to better constrain their formation mechanisms. Methods. We take advantage of Euclid unprecedented sensitivity, spatial resolution and wide-field of view to search for brown dwarfs and free-floating planetary mass objects in the LDN 1495 region of the Taurus molecular clouds. We combine the recent Euclid Early Release Observations with older very deep ground-based images obtained over more than 20 yr to derive proper motions and multi-wavelength photometry, and select members based on their morphology and their position in a proper motion diagram and in 9 color-magnitude diagrams. Results. We identify 15 point sources with proper motions, colors, and luminosity consistent with being members of LDN 1495. Six of these objects were already known M9-L1 members. The remaining nine are newly identified sources that could have spectral types ranging from late-M to early-T with masses potentially as low as 1-2 MJup based on their luminosity and according to evolutionary models. However, follow-up observations are needed to confirm their nature, spectral type and membership. If extrapolated to theentire Taurus star forming region, this result suggests the potential presence of several dozen free-floating planetary mass objects.</description>

      <title>Exploring the empirical instability strip for $\gamma$ Dor-type stars in eclipsing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research paper has light curve modelling, spectroscopy, and detailed asteroseismic studies for five detached eclipsing binaries with a $\gamma$ Dor component that have been found so far by the sky surveys. The objective is to study the pulsational characteristics of the oscillating stars of the systems, as well as to estimate their absolute parameters and their relation to the pulsational frequencies and enrich the sample size of this kind of system, which has been relatively poor up to today. The physical properties of these systems are compared with other similar cases and the locations of their components are plotted in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagrams. In order to discover the pulsation frequencies, the photometric data are analysed using eclipsing binary modelling methods and their residuals are subjected to Fourier analysis. Finally, we evaluated that there is a possible relationship between the pulsation periods of the primaries and the orbital period ($P_{\rm orb}$), the force exerted per gram on the surface of the pulsating star ($f$/M$_{\rm puls}$), and the fractional radius of the pulsating star ($r_{\rm puls}$) of the systems, using a sample of 39 eclipsing binary systems with $\gamma$ Dor type primaries. We utilised them to construct a unique observational $\gamma$ Dor instability strip, delineated by a lower limit of 6,850 K at the red edge and an upper limit of 7,360 K at the blue edge on the zero-age main sequence. The majority of 39 pure $\gamma$ Dor stars are located within the region that is covered by this observational strip.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic Super-Alfvenic Slippage Along Flare Ribbons Observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The apparent slipping motion of flare loops is regarded as a key feature of the 3D magnetic reconnection in the solar flares. The slippage with a super-Alfv\'enic speed could be defined as slipping-running reconnection while the slippage with a sub-Alfv\'enic speed is called slipping reconnection. Due to the limitation of the observational instrument temporal resolution, the apparent slippage of the flare loop footpoints along the flare ribbons with super-Alfv\'enic speed is quite rare to our knowledge. In this paper, we report a unique event that exhibits not only the sub-Alfv\'enic slippage, but also the quasiperiodic super-Alfv\'enic slippage of ribbon substructures during a C3.4-class flare (SOL2023-01-18-T15:23), using the high temporal resolution observations of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph ($\sim$2 s). The super-Alfv\'enic slippage with a speed of up to $\sim$ 1688 km s$^{-1}$ is directly observed in this study. The calculated period of the apparent super-Alfv\'enic slippage in both ribbons is between 8.4 and 11.9 seconds. This work provides the first observational evidence of the periodicity for the slipping-running magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Arecibo Multi-frequency IPS Observations: Solar Wind Density Turbulence Scale Sizes and their Anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of interplanetary scintillation (IPS) observations conducted with the Arecibo 305-m radio telescope during the minimum phase at the end of solar cycle 24 and the onset of solar cycle 25. These observations span a broad frequency range of ~300 to 3100 MHz, encompassing the P-, L-, and S-bands, and covered heliocentric distances from ~5 to 200 solar radii. The dynamic spectrum of the scintillations obtained at L-band shows a systematic decrease in the scintillation index from the lowest to the highest frequency, offering valuable insight into the influence of the solar wind density microstructures responsible for scintillation. Analyses of the scintillation index ($m$) for multiple sources at L-band, along with near-simultaneous observations of selected sources covering the P-, L-, and S-bands, clearly demonstrate a wavelength dependence of $m \propto \lambda^\omega$, which inherently leads to a dependence of $m$ on the Fresnel scale, when considering the effective distance to the scattering screen, $z$. The index $\omega$ ranges between $\sim$1 and 1.8. The average $\omega$ value of a source, determined from observations made on different days, exhibits variability across sources. The results on the radial dependence of scintillation agree with earlier IPS measurements. The temporal power spectra obtained over the wide frequency range exhibit a power-level evolution in accordance with the wavelength dependence, and a broadening with increasing observation frequency. Furthermore, the increased temporal-frequency rounding of the `Fresnel knee' in the spectrum with the observing frequency suggests a novel phenomenon: an increase in anisotropy as the scale size of the density-turbulence structure decreases.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a Disk-wind Origin for Fluorescent H$_2$ in Classical T Tauri Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use FUV spectra of 36 T Tauri stars, predominately from $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$'s ULLYSES program, to examine the kinematic properties of fluorescent H$_2$ emission lines for evidence of disk outflows. Leveraging improvements to the $\textit{HST}$-COS wavelength solution, we co-add isolated lines within four fluorescent progressions ([$\textit{v'}$,$\textit{J'}$] = [1,4], [1,7], [0,2], and [3,16]) to improve signal-to-noise, and we fit each co-added line profile with one or two Gaussian components. Of the high S/N line profiles (S/N $\geq$ 12 at the peak of the profile), over half are best fit with a combination of a broad and narrow Gaussian component. For profiles of the [1,4] and [1,7] progressions, we find a systematic blue-shift of a few km s$^{-1}$ between the broad and narrow centroid velocities and stellar radial velocities. For the [0,2] progression, we find centroid velocities consistently blueshifted with respect to stellar radial velocities on the order of -5 km s$^{-1}$ for the single and narrow components, and -10 km s$^{-1}$ for the broad components. Overall, the blueshifts observed in our sample suggest that the molecular gas traces an outflow from a disk wind in some sources, and not solely disk gas in Keplerian rotation. The low-velocity systematic blue-shifts, and emitting radii as inferred from line FWHMs, observed in our sample are similar to those observed with optical [O I] surveys of T Tauri stars. We estimate H$_2$ mass-loss rates of 10$^{-9}$ to 10$^{-11}$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, but incomplete knowledge of wind parameters limits comparisons to global models.</description>

      <title>Long-lived sunspots in historical records: a case study analysis from 1660 to 1676</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sunspot engravings and measurements in 1660-1676 are analyzed to retrieve sunspot area and heliocoordinates. Based on these data, we revise the Hoyt and Schatten (The role of the sun in climate change, 1997) hypothesis of long-lived sunspots during the Maunder minimum as a sign of weakened convection. Historical reports also clarify what each observer defined as a sunspot and the purpose of the observations. The reconstructed longitudes of sunspots allow us to evaluate the rotation rate, revealing that the historical rotation profile resembles that of long-lived sunspot groups in the modern era.</description>

      <title>Resolving spatial and temporal shock structures using LOFAR observations of type II radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks are one of the most powerful particle accelerators in the Universe. In the heliosphere, type II solar radio bursts are signatures of electrons accelerated by collisionless shocks launched at the Sun. Spectral observations of these bursts show a variety of fine structures often composing multiple type II lanes. The origin of these lanes and structures is not well understood and has been attributed to the inhomogeneous environment around the propagating shock. Here, we aim to determine the large-scale local structures near a coronal shock wave using high-resolution radio imaging observations of a complex type II radio burst observed on 3 October 2023. By using inteferometric imaging from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), combined with extreme ultraviolet observations, we investigate the origin of multiple type II lanes at low frequencies (30--80~MHz) relative to the propagating shock wave. We identify at least three radio sources at metric wavelengths corresponding to a multi-lane type II burst. The type II burst sources propagate outwards with a shock driven by a coronal mass ejection. We find a double radio source that exhibits increasing separation over time, consistent with the expansion rate of the global coronal shock. This suggests that the overall shock expansion is nearly self-similar, with acceleration hotspots forming at various times and splitting at a rate proportional to the shock's expansion. Our results show the importance of increased spatial resolution in determining either the small-scale spatial properties in coronal shocks or the structuring of the ambient medium. Possible shock corrugations or structuring of the upstream plasma at the scale of 10$^5$~km can act as hotspots for the acceleration of suprathermal electrons.</description>

      <title>The Legacy of Henrietta Leavitt: A Re-analysis of the First Cepheid Period-Luminosity Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Henrietta Swan Leavitt's discovery of the relationship between the period and luminosity (hereafter the Leavitt Law) of 25 variable stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud, published in 1912, revolutionized cosmology. These variables, eventually identified as Cepheids, became the first known "standard candles" for measuring extragalactic distances and remain the gold standard for this task today. Leavitt measured light curves, periods, and minimum and maximum magnitudes from painstaking visual inspection of photographic plates. Her work paved the way for the first precise series of distance measurements that helped set the scale of the Universe, and later the discovery of its expansion by Edwin Hubble in 1929. Here, we re-analyze Leavitt's first Period-Luminosity relation using observations of the same set of stars but with modern data and methods of Cepheid analysis. Using only data from Leavitt's notebooks, we assess the quality of her light curves, measured periods, and the slope and scatter of her Period-Luminosity relations. We show that modern data and methods, for the same objects, reduce the scatter of the Period-Luminosity relation by a factor of two. We also find a bias brightward at the short period end, due to the non-linearity of the plates and environmental crowding. Overall, Leavitt's results are in excellent agreement with contemporary measurements, reinforcing the value of Cepheids in cosmology today, a testament to the enduring quality of her work.</description>

      <title>Physics motivated models of pulsar X-ray hotspots: off-center dipole configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, it was proposed that an off-center dipole magnetic configuration, together with a non-trivial temperature profile, may be the best model to explain the X-ray light curve of PSR J0030+0451 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (\emph{NICER}). Using a theoretical model for the electric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from first principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap associated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple prescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us to derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the volumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it does not make a big difference in an aligned dipole case, the difference can be bigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437--4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find that our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves.</description>

      <title>Imaging and Spectral Performance of a Wide-gap CdTe Double-Sided Strip Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fourth flight of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager sounding rocket experiment (FOXSI-4) aimed to achieve the first imaging spectroscopic observations of mid-to-large class ( &gt;= GOES C5 class) solar flares, in contrast to the previous three flights that targeted relatively quiet regions of the Sun. To meet the emerging requirements for hard X-ray focal plane detectors for providing simultaneous diagnostics of spectrally (&lt;1 keV FWHM) and spatially (&lt;50 um) separated coronal and chromospheric emissions from solar flares, we developed a new strip-configuration detector called the wide-gap CdTe semiconductor double-sided strip detector (CdTe-DSD). The wide-gap CdTe-DSD employs a unique design principle to enhance position resolution. This enhancement is realized by expanding the gaps between electrodes to induce charge-sharing across adjacent strip electrodes and using this sharing energy information for position reconstruction to a level finer than the strip-pitch. However, the detector response becomes complex and requires consideration of various factors, such as the charge loss due to wider gaps and the dependence on the depth of photon interaction. Thus, we developed an energy reconstruction method that fully leverages the energy information between adjacent strips and from both the cathode and anode sides, achieving an energy resolution of 0.75 keV (FWHM) at 14 keV. Furthermore, we conducted an X-ray scanning experiment using a synchrotron beam at Spring-8 to evaluate the detector response with a fine scale of 10 um. Based on these results, we established a sub-strip position reconstruction method, demonstrating that X-rays interacting at the center of the gap can be determined with an accuracy of 20 um, and even those at the strip center can be determined with an accuracy of 50 um.</description>

      <title>Multiple stellar populations at less evolved stages. IV. evidence of helium enrichments in four Magellanic globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most globular clusters in the local group show multiple stellar populations, a pattern defined by variations of several light elements, with some also displaying dispersions in heavy elements. Since helium is the most immediate product of hydrogen burning, almost all models suggest that second-generation stars should show different levels of helium enrichment than first-generation stars. Therefore, investigating helium enrichment in stellar populations of globular clusters can constrain different theoretical models. Using the deep photometry carried out by the {\sl Hubble} Space Telescope, we have analyzed the morphologies of the main sequences of four Large Magellanic Cloud globular clusters, Hodge 11, NGC 1841, NGC 2210, and NGC 2257. We aim to constrain the helium distributions among their main sequence stars. We found a clear broadening of main sequences in all four clusters. After excluding the effects of photometric errors, differential reddening, unresolved binaries, and metallicity dispersions, this broadening would suggest a substantial helium enrichment in their star populations, ranging from $\delta{Y}=0.08$ to $\delta{Y}\geq0.12$, depending on the presumed helium distributions. Helium-enriched stars are comparable in number to normal stars within these clusters, and may even dominate, comprising approximately $\sim$40\% to over 80\% of the total stellar population. However, given the great distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud, it is difficult to rule out the significant impact of crowding, so our results may only represent an upper limit.</description>

Abstract: Some astrobiological models suggest that molecular clouds may serve as habitats for extraterrestrial life. This study reviews recent theoretical work addressing the physical and biochemical prerequisites for life in such environments, with particular focus on three subjects: (1) bioenergetic pathways under extreme low-temperature conditions; (2) the emergence and preservation of biomolecular chirality; and (3) detection methodologies for potential biosignatures. In this paper, we formally introduce the molecular cloud biology concept, which integrates all physicochemical and metabolic processes hypothesized to sustain life within molecular clouds. As a potential branch of astrobiology, molecular cloud biology warrants interdisciplinary collaborative research to validate its foundational assumptions and explore its scientific implications.</description>

      <title>X-ray Thomson scattering studies on spin-singlet stabilization of highly compressed H-like Be ions heated to two million degrees Kelvin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments at the US National Ignition Facility (NIF) [D\"{o}ppner et al., Nature {\bf 618}, 270-275 (2023)] have created highly compressed hot hydrogen-like Be plasmas. Published analyses of the the NIF experiment have used finite-$T$ multi-atom density-functional theory (DFT) with Molecular dynamics (MD), and Path-Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations. These methods are very expensive to implement and often lack physical transparency. Here we (i) relate their results to simpler first-principles average-atom results, (ii) establish the feasibility of rapid data analysis, with good accuracy and gain in physical transparency, and (iii) show that the NIF experiment reveals high-$T$ spin-singlet pairing of hydrogen-like Be ions with near neighbours. Our analysis predicts such stabilization over a wide range of compressed densities for temperatures close to two million Kelvin. Calculations of structure factors $S(k)$ for electrons or ions, the Raleigh weight and other quantities of interest to X-ray Thomson scattering are presented. We find that the NIF data at the scattering wavevector $k_{sc}$ of 7.89 \AA$^{-1}$ are more consistent with a density of $20\pm2$ g/cm$^3$, mean ionization $\bar{Z}=$3.25, at a temperature of $\simeq$ 1,800,000 K than the 34 g/cm$^3, \bar{Z}=3.4$ proposed by the NIF team. The relevance of ion-electron coupled-modes in studying small $k_{sc}$ data is indicated.</description>

      <title>TESSELLATE: Piecing Together the Variable Sky With TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TESSELLATE, a dedicated pipeline for performing an untargeted search documenting all variable phenomena captured by the TESS space telescope. Building on the TESSreduce difference imaging pipeline, TESSELLATE extracts calibrated and reduced photometric data for every full frame image in the TESS archive. Using this data, we systematically identify transient, variable and non-sidereal signals across timescales ranging from minutes to weeks. The high cadence and wide field of view of TESS enables us to conduct a comprehensive search of the entire sky to a depth of ~17 $m_i$. Based on the volumetric rates for known fast transients, we expect there to be numerous Fast Blue Optical Transients and Gamma Ray Burst afterglows present in the existing TESS dataset. Beyond transients, TESSELLATE can also identify new variable stars and exoplanet candidates, and recover known asteroids. We classify events using machine learning techniques and the work of citizen scientists via the Zooniverse Cosmic Cataclysms project. Finally, we introduce the TESSELLATE Sky Survey: a complete, open catalog of the variable sky observed by TESS.</description>

      <title>Accretion bursts in young intermediate-mass stars make planet formation challenging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of accretion bursts, dust accumulation, and the prospects for planetesimal formation in a gravitationally unstable magnetized protoplanetary disk with globally suppressed but episodically triggered magnetorotational instability (MRI), particularly in young intermediate-mass stars (YIMSs) but with a brief comparison to low-mass counterparts. We use numerical magnetohydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit (FEOSAD code) to model the formation and long-term evolution of a gravitationally unstable magnetized protoplanetary disk, including dust dynamics and growth, since the collapse of a massive slowly-rotating prestellar cloud core. Massive gas concentrations and dust rings form within the inner disk region owing to the radially varying efficiency of mass transport by gravitational instability (GI). These rings are initially susceptible to streaming instability (SI). However, gradual warming of the dust rings, thanks to high opacity and GI-induced influx of matter increases the gas temperature above a threshold for the MRI to develop via thermal ionization of alkaline metals. The ensuing MRI bursts destroy the dust rings, making planetesimal formation via SI problematic. In the later evolution phase, when the burst activity starts to diminish, SI becomes inefficient because of growing dust drift velocity and more extended inner dead zone, both acting to reduce the dust concentration below the threshold for SI to develop. Low-mass objects appear to be less affected by these adverse effects. Our results suggest that disks around young intermediate-mass stars may be challenging environments for planetesimal formation via SI. This may explain the dearth of planets around stars with $M_\ast &gt; 3.0 \,$$M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Multiple stellar populations in MOCCA globular cluster models: Transient spatial over-concentration of pristine red giant stars driven by strong dynamical encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Leitinger et al. (2023) and Cadelano et al (2024}) have shown that, in some Milky Way globular clusters (GCs), pristine red giant branch (RGB) stars are more centrally concentrated than enriched RGB stars. This contradicts most multiple-population formation scenarios, which predict that the enriched population 2p should initially be more concentrated than the pristine population 1P. We analyze a MOCCA GC model that exhibits a higher spatial concentration of 1P RGB stars than 2P RGB stars at 13 Gyr. The MOCCA models assume the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) pollution scenario, where 2P stars are initially more concentrated than 1P stars. Our results indicate that the observed spatial distributions of multiple populations, and possibly their kinematics, are significantly shaped by dynamical interactions. These interactions preferentially eject 2P RGB progenitors from the central regions, leading to a transient over-concentration of 1P RGB stars at late times. This effect is particularly relevant for GCs with present-day of a few $10^5 M_{\odot}$, which have retained only about 10 - 20 percent of their initial mass. Such clusters may appear dynamically young due to heating from a black hole subsystem, even if they have undergone significant mass loss and dynamical evolution. Additionally, the relatively small number of RGB stars in these clusters suggests that interpreting the spatial distributions of multiple populations solely from RGB stars may lead to biased conclusions about the overall distribution of 2P and 1P. The apparent over-concentration of the 1P relative to the 2P is likely a transient effect driven by the preferential removal of 2P RGB progenitors via strong dynamical encounters. MOCCA models of multiple stellar populations based on the AGB scenario may explain anomalous features observed in some Galactic GCs, such as NGC 3201 and NGC 6101.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the cluster of S-stars located in the Galactic Centre is tied to the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, but exactly how is still debated. In this paper, we investigate whether the Hills mechanism can simultaneously reproduce both the S-star cluster's properties and the observed number of hypervelocity stars. To do so, we forward-model the capture and disruption of binary stars originating from the nuclear star cluster (NSC) and the clockwise disk (CWD). We find that the ratio of evolved to main-sequence S-stars is highly sensitive to the origin of the binaries, and that neither the injection of binaries from the CWD nor from the NSC exclusively can reproduce all observations. However, when considering the injection of binaries from both locations, we are able to reproduce all the observations simultaneously, including the number of observed hypervelocity stars, the evolutionary stage of the S-stars, their luminosity function and the distribution of their semi-major axes. The implications of our findings include that ~90% of hypervelocity stars ejected over the past ~10 Myr should originate from the CWD, that the main-sequence S-stars originated in the CWD, and that the evolved S-stars originated in an old stellar population such as the NSC.</description>

      <title>Rotational effects on the small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using direct numerical simulations of forced rotating turbulence, we study the effect of rotation on the growth rate and the saturation level of the small-scale dynamo. For slow rotation rates, increasing the rotation rate reduces both the growth rate and the saturation level. Once the rotation rate crosses a threshold, large-scale vortices are formed which enhance the growth rate and the saturation level. Below this threshold, the suppression of the small-scale dynamo with increasing rotation is explained by the fact that at scales close to, but smaller than, the forcing scale, rotating turbulence is one-dimensionalized, with the velocity component along the rotation axis being larger than the other two components. This is due to the rotational destabilization of vortices produced by the forcing function. While the rotational effect on the growth rate becomes small at high Re, the ratio of the steady-state magnetic to kinetic energies remains suppressed by up to 35% as compared to the non-rotating case.</description>

Abstract: GJ 436b is the archetype warm Neptune exoplanet. The planet's thermal emission spectrum was previously observed via intensive secondary eclipse campaigns with Spitzer. The atmosphere has long been interpreted to be extremely metal-rich, out of chemical equilibrium, and potentially tidally heated. We present the first panchromatic emission spectrum of GJ 436b observed with JWST's NIRCAM (F322W2 and F444W) and MIRI (LRS) instruments between 2.4 and 11.9 $\mu$m. Surprisingly, the JWST spectrum appears significantly fainter around 3.6 $\mu$m than that implied by Spitzer photometry. The molecular absorption features in the spectrum are relatively weak, and we only find tentative evidence of CO$_2$ absorption at 2$\sigma$ significance. Under the assumption of a day-side blackbody, we find $T_{\rm day}$=662.8$\pm$5.0 K, which is similar to the zero Bond albedo equilibrium temperature. We use it to obtain a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the Bond albedo of $A_B{\le}$0.66. To understand the spectrum we employ 1D radiative-convective models but find that atmospheric constraints depend strongly on model assumptions. If thermochemical equilibrium is assumed, we find a cloudy metal-enriched atmosphere (metallicity $\ge$ 300$\times$solar). We employ 1D photochemical modeling to show that the observed spectrum is also consistent with a cloud-free, relatively lower-metallicity atmosphere (metallicity $\ge$ 80$\times$solar) with a cold internal temperature ($T_{\rm int}$$\sim$60 K). These are much lower metallicities and internal temperatures than inferences from Spitzer photometry. The low $T_{\rm day}$ and non-detection of transmission features at high spectral resolution does suggest a role for cloud opacity, but this is not definitive.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric abundances and bulk properties of the binary brown dwarf Gliese 229 Bab from JWST/MIRI spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI low-resolution spectroscopy ($4.75-14~\mu$m) of the first known substellar companion, Gliese 229 Bab, which was recently resolved into a tight binary brown dwarf. Previous atmospheric retrieval studies modeling Gliese 229 B as a single brown dwarf have reported anomalously high carbon-to-oxygen ratios (C/O) of $\approx 1.1$ using $1-5~\mu$m ground-based spectra. Here, we fit the MIRI spectrum of Gliese 229 Bab with a two-component binary model using the Sonora Elf Owl grid and additionally account for the observed $K$ band flux ratio of the binary brown dwarf. Assuming the two brown dwarfs share the same abundances, we obtain $\rm C/O=0.65\pm0.05$ and $\rm [M/H]=0.00^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ as their abundances ($2\sigma$ statistical errors), which are fully consistent with the host star abundances. We also recover the same abundances if we fit the MIRI spectrum with a single brown dwarf model, indicating that binarity does not strongly affect inferred abundances from mid-infrared data when the $T_\rm{eff}$ are similar between components of the binary. We measure $T_\rm{eff}=900^{+78}_{-29}~$K and $T_\rm{eff}=775^{+20}_{-33}~$K for the two brown dwarfs. We find that the vertical diffusion coefficients of $\log{K_\rm{zz}} \approx4.0$ are identical between the two brown dwarfs and in line with $\log{K_\rm{zz}}$ values inferred for isolated brown dwarfs with similar $T_\rm{eff}$. Our results demonstrate the power of mid-infrared spectroscopy in providing robust atmospheric abundance measurements for brown dwarf companions and by extension, giant planets.</description>

      <title>Superoutbursts and Positive Superhumps Occurred During the Standstill of a Z Cam-type Dwarf Nova</title>

Abstract: Dwarf novae are semi-detached binaries, where a white dwarf accretes material from a cool main-sequence companion via an accretion disk, and are known for their intermittent outbursts, making them key systems for studying accretion physics. The accumulation of large survey datasets has challenged traditional models, which assumed that the disk remains hot and cannot produce superoutbursts during the standstill of Z Cam-type dwarf nova and that superoutbursts require a mass ratio of $ q = M_2/M_1 \leq 0.25 - 0.33 $. Here we report the detection of superoutbursts and positive superhumps (PSHs) during a standstill in the Z Cam-type star AT Cnc with a mass ratio larger than 0.33. Notably, the PSHs evolve gradually before the superoutburst begins, suggesting that an eccentric, precessing disk forms first, with the superoutburst occurring as the disk radius continues to expand. These findings provide the first detailed observational evidence of superoutbursts and PSHs occurring during standstill, offering important new insights into the classification of dwarf novae and the underlying mechanisms of outbursts</description>

      <title>A novel q-PED method: precise physical properties of a merger-origin binary Cepheid OGLE-LMC-CEP-1347</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a double-lined binary (SB2) classical Cepheid, OGLE-LMC-CEP-1347, was discovered, with the orbital period (P$_{\rm orb} = 59$ days) five times shorter than of any binary Cepheid known before. The expected mass of the Cepheid was below $3.5$ M$_\odot$, which, if confirmed, would also probe the uncharted territory. The system configuration also pointed to the Cepheid as a merger. We present a novel method for determining precise physical parameters of binary Cepheids using both theory and observations. This q-PED method combines the measured mass ratio (q), pulsation (P), and evolutionary (E) models, and the known distance (D) supplemented with multi-band photometry. Applying it, we determined the mass of the Cepheid of $3.41 \pm 0.08$ M$_\odot$, its radius of $13.65 \pm 0.27$ R$_\odot$, the companion mass of $1.89 \pm 0.04$ M$_\odot$ and radius of $12.51 \pm 0.62$ R$_\odot$. With the current configuration, the apparent evolutionary age difference of almost 1 Gyr between the components strongly favors the Cepheid merger origin scenario. If so, the actual age of the Cepheid would be 1.09 Gyr, on the edge of Population II stars, indicating a significant fraction of Cepheids may be much older than typically assumed. We also applied our method to an eclipsing binary Cepheid OGLE-LMC-CEP-1812 with accurately determined physical parameters, obtaining a close agreement, which confirmed our method's reliability.</description>

      <title>Velocity Structure of Circumstellar Environment around Class 0/I Protostars: Uncertainty in the Protostellar Mass Estimation Using Circumstellar Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution observations have enabled detailed investigations of the circumstellar environments around Class 0/I protostars. Several studies have reported that the infall velocity of the envelope is a few times smaller than the free-fall velocity inferred from protostellar masses estimated via the observed rotational velocity of their Keplerian disks. To explore the physical origins of the slow infall, we perform a set of three-dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the star formation process, extending to $10^5$ yr after protostar formation. Our simulations show that the infall velocity decreases markedly at the outer edge of the pseudo-disk (at radii of $\sim\!100-1000$ au) and is much slower than the expected free-fall velocity. The degree of this reduction depends on (1) the initial magnetic field strength, (2) the alignment between the initial field and the rotation axis, and (3) the evolutionary stage of the system. Across our parameter space, the ratio of the infall velocity to the free-fall velocity is as small as $0.2-0.5$, which is consistent with the observations. We further examine the reliability of protostellar mass estimates derived from infall and rotational velocities. While the mass derived from disk rotation closely matches the true value, deviation by a factor of $0.3-2$ is found for the estimates using the infall velocity; it is underestimated due to slow infall, but could also be overestimated due to the contribution of disk mass. These findings underscore the critical role of magnetic fields in shaping star formation dynamics and highlight the uncertainties associated with protostellar mass estimates.</description>

      <title>The past, present and future of observations of externally irradiated disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge of interest in the community studying the effect of ultraviolet radiation environment, predominantly set by OB stars, on protoplanetary disc evolution and planet formation. This is important because a significant fraction of planetary systems, potentially including our own, formed in close proximity to OB stars. This is a rapidly developing field, with a broad range of observations across many regions recently obtained or recently scheduled. In this paper, stimulated by a series of workshops on the topic, we take stock of the current and upcoming observations. We discuss how the community can build on this recent success with future observations to make progress in answering the big questions of the field, with the broad goal of disentangling how external photoevaporation contributes to shaping the observed (exo)planet population. Both existing and future instruments offer numerous opportunities to make progress towards this goal.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning and LLM-based Methods Applied to Stellar Lightcurve Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light curves serve as a valuable source of information on stellar formation and evolution. With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, it can be effectively processed to extract astronomical patterns and information. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of deep-learning and large language model (LLM) based models for the automatic classification of variable star light curves, based on large datasets from the Kepler and K2 missions. Special emphasis is placed on Cepheids, RR Lyrae, and eclipsing binaries, examining the influence of observational cadence and phase distribution on classification precision. Employing AutoDL optimization, we achieve striking performance with the 1D-Convolution+BiLSTM architecture and the Swin Transformer, hitting accuracies of 94\% and 99\% correspondingly, with the latter demonstrating a notable 83\% accuracy in discerning the elusive Type II Cepheids-comprising merely 0.02\% of the total dataset.We unveil StarWhisper LightCurve (LC), an innovative Series comprising three LLM-based models: LLM, multimodal large language model (MLLM), and Large Audio Language Model (LALM). Each model is fine-tuned with strategic prompt engineering and customized training methods to explore the emergent abilities of these models for astronomical data. Remarkably, StarWhisper LC Series exhibit high accuracies around 90\%, significantly reducing the need for explicit feature engineering, thereby paving the way for streamlined parallel data processing and the progression of multifaceted multimodal models in astronomical applications. The study furnishes two detailed catalogs illustrating the impacts of phase and sampling intervals on deep learning classification accuracy, showing that a substantial decrease of up to 14\% in observation duration and 21\% in sampling points can be realized without compromising accuracy by more than 10\%.</description>

      <title>Strong constraints on a sharp change in $G$ as a solution to the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the gravitational constant $G$ abruptly decreased around 130 Myr ago, making Type Ia supernovae (SNe) in the Hubble flow intrinsically brighter than those in host galaxies with Cepheid distances. This would make Hubble flow SNe more distant, causing redshifts to rise slower with distance, potentially solving the Hubble tension. We explore a wide range of unattractive consequences of this ''$G$ step model'' (GSM). We find that since the luminosities of Sun-like stars scale as approximately $G^{5.6}$, the Solar luminosity would have dropped substantially 130 Myr ago in this scenario, likely pushing Earth into a planetary glaciation. However, there was no Snowball Earth episode in the last 500 Myr. The GSM also implies that the length of a year would have abruptly increased by about 10%, but the number of days per year has evolved broadly continuously according to geochronometry and cyclostratigraphy. The GSM would drastically alter stellar evolution, causing the Sun to have exhausted about 2/3 of its fuel supply rather than 1/2. This would lead make the Sun's helioseismic age exceed that of the oldest meteorite samples, but these agree excellently in practice. The expected age of the Universe also agrees well with that of the oldest Galactic stars assuming constant $G$. The GSM however implies these stars are younger, creating a lack of stars from the first 3 Gyr of cosmic history. These arguments cast severe doubt on the viability of the GSM: the solution to the Hubble tension should be sought elsewhere.</description>

      <title>A distance measurement of galaxies from JWST using star formation rate-stellar mass relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the star formation rate-stellar mass relation ($SFR - {M_ * }$) of galaxies to measure their luminosity distances as well as estimate cosmological parameters. We compile a sample of 341 high-redshift galaxies at $5 &lt; z &lt; 14$ and an additional 51 galaxies at $1.8 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$ from the JWST observations, which can be used to investigate the correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass, and determine their cosmological distance. The relation $SFR \propto {\kern 1pt} {({M_ * }/{M_ \odot })^\gamma }$ can be applied to check the nonlinear correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass ${M_ * }$ of galaxies and give their distance. Additionally, it also can be used to test if the $SFR - {M_ * }$ relation depends on redshift, and the data suggest that the $SFR $ is positively correlated with stellar mass, the $SFR - {M_ * }$ relation of the high-redshift galaxies has a redshift dependence. Finally, we combine the galaxy sample with Type Ia supernova (SNIa) data from the Pantheon compilation to test the property of dark energy, specifically addressing whether its density deviates from the constant, and give the statistical analysis results.</description>

      <title>1000-10,000 M$_\odot$ Primordial Stars Created the Nitrogen Excess in the Galaxy GS 3073 at $z = 5.55$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of the James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a wealth of new galaxies just a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang. Some of these galaxies exhibit unusual elemental abundances that are difficult to explain with stellar populations today. While Wolf-Rayet stars in multiple-burst populations, very massive or rapidly-rotating primordial stars, general relativistic explosions of metal-enriched supermassive stars, or the precursors of globular clusters can in principle account for the supersolar nitrogen to oxygen ratios in the galaxies GN-z11 and CEERS 1019, no known stars or supernovae can explain the far higher N/O ratio of 0.46 in GS 3073 at redshift $z =$ 5.55. Here we show that the extreme nitrogen abundances in GS 3073 can be produced by 1000 - 10,000 M$_{\odot}$ primordial (Pop III) stars. We find that these are the only candidates that can account for its large N/O ratios and its C/O and Ne/O ratios. GS 3073 is thus the first conclusive evidence in the fossil abundance record of the existence of supermassive Pop III stars at cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>What defines stationarity in space plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from the concept of entropy defect in thermodynamics, we construct the entropy formulation of space plasmas, and then use it to develop a measure of their stationarity. In particular, we show that statistics of this entropy results in two findings that improve our understanding of stationary and nonstationary systems: (i) variations of the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy do not exceed twice the value of the thermodynamic kappa, the parameter that provides a measure of the entropy defect in both stationary and nonstationary states, while becomes the shape parameter that labels the kappa distributions in stationary states; and (ii) the ratio of the deviation of the BG entropy with kappa scales with the kappa deviation via a power-law, while the respective exponent provides a stationarity deviation index (SDI), which measures the natural tendency of the system to depart from stationarity. We confirm the validity of these findings in three different heliospheric plasma datasets observed from three missions: (1) A solar energetic particle event, recorded by the Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun instrument onboard Parker Solar Probe; (2) Near Earth solar wind protons recorded by the Solar Wind Experiment instrument onboard WIND; and (3) Plasma protons in the heliosheath, source of energetic neutral atoms recorded by IBEX. The full strength and capability of the entropic deviation ratio and SDI can now be used by the space physics community for analyzing and characterizing the stationarity of space plasmas, as well as other researchers for analyzing any other correlated systems.</description>
