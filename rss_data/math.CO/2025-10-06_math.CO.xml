      <title>The distance spectrum of the bipartite double cover of strongly regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A strongly regular graph with parameters $(n,d,a,c)$ is a $d$-regular graph of order $n$, in which every pair of adjacent vertices has exactly $a$ common neighbor(s) and every pair of nonadjacent vertices has exactly $c$ common neighbor(s). Let $n$ be the number of vertices of the graph $G=(V,E)$. The distance matrix $D=D(G)$ of $G$ is an $n \times n $ matrix with the rows and columns indexed by $V$
  such that $D_{uv} = d_{G}(u, v)=d(u,v)$, where $d_{G}(u, v)$ is the distance between the vertices $u$ and $v$ in the graph $G$. In this paper, we are interested in determining the distance spectrum of the bipartite double cover of the family of strongly regular graphs. In other words, let $G=(V,E)$ be a strongly regular graph with parameters $(n,k,a,c)$. We show that there is a close relationship between the spectrum of $G$ and the distance spectrum of $B(G)$, where $B(G)$ is the double cover of $G$. We explicitly determine the distance spectrum of the graph $B(G)$, according to the spectrum of $G$. In fact, according to the parameters of the graph $G$.</description>

      <title>Two Proofs of the Hamiltonian Cycle Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamiltonian cycle polynomial can be evaluated to count the number of Hamiltonian cycles in a graph. It can also be viewed as a list of all spanning cycles of length $n$. We adopt the latter perspective and present a pair of original proofs for the Hamiltonian cycle identity which relates the Hamiltonian cycle polynomial to the important determinant and permanent polynomials. The first proof is a more accessible combinatorial argument. The second proof relies on viewing polynomials as both linear algebraic and combinatorial objects whose monomials form lists of graphs. Finally, a similar identity is derived for the Hamiltonian path polynomial.</description>

      <title>Construction of infinitely many trace-minimal graphs with maximum number of spanning trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A longstanding problem in spectral graph theory asks for graphs with maximum number of spanning trees among all connected simple graphs with a prescribed number of vertices and edges. Such graphs are called t-optimal graphs. Petingi and Rodr\'iguez [Discrete Math. 244 (2002), 351--373] achieved in finding infinitely many t-optimal graphs. Basically, they reduced the problem of finding t-optimal graphs to the determination of almost-regular graphs with minimum number of induced 3-paths.
  In this work we revisit the construction of t-optimal graphs given by Petingi and Rodr\'iguez. Then, we generalize the previous construction using the key concept of trace-minimal graph introduced by \'Abrego et al. [Linear Algebra Appl. 412 (2006) 161--221]. Finally, as a consequence, we construct infinitely many new t-optimal regular graphs.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial formula for Interpolation Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1996, Knop and Sahi introduced a remarkable family of inhomogeneous symmetric polynomials, defined via vanishing conditions, whose top homogeneous parts are exactly the Macdonald polynomials. Like the Macdonald polynomials, these interpolation Macdonald polynomials are closely connected to the Hecke algebra, and admit nonsymmetric versions, which generalize the nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials. In this paper we give a combinatorial formula for interpolation Macdonald polynomials in terms of signed multiline queues; this formula generalizes the combinatorial formula for Macdonald polynomials in terms of multiline queues given by Corteel-Mandelshtam-Williams.</description>

      <title>On $d$-distance $p$-packing domination number in strong products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $d$-distance $p$-packing domination number $\gamma_d^p(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the cardinality of a smallest set of vertices of $G$ which is both a $d$-distance dominating set and a $p$-packing. If no such set exists, then we set $\gamma_d^p(G) = \infty$. For an arbitrary strong product $G\boxtimes H$ it is proved that $\gamma_d^p(G\boxtimes H) \le \gamma_d^p(G) \gamma_d^p(H)$. By proving that $\gamma_d^p(P_m \boxtimes P_n) = \left \lceil \frac{m}{2d+1} \right \rceil \left \lceil \frac{n}{2d+1} \right \rceil$, and that if $\gamma_d^p(C_n) &lt; \infty$, then $\gamma_d^p(P_m \boxtimes C_n) = \left \lceil \frac{m}{2d+1} \right \rceil \left \lceil \frac{n}{2d+1} \right \rceil$, the sharpness of the upper bound is demonstrated. On the other hand, infinite families of strong toruses are presented for which the strict inequality holds. For instance, we present strong toruses with difference $2$ and demonstrate that the difference can be arbitrarily large if only one factor is a cycle. It is also conjectured that if $\gamma_d^p(G) = \infty$, then $\gamma_d^p(G\boxtimes H) = \infty$ for every graph $H$. Several results are proved which support the conjecture, in particular, if $\gamma_d^p(C_m)= \infty$, then $\gamma_d^p(C_m \boxtimes C_n)=\infty$.</description>

      <title>Spectral extremal problems for the $(p,Q)$-spectral radius of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be an $s$-vertex $r$-uniform hypergraph, and let $H$ be an $n$-vertex $r$-uniform hypergraph. Denote by $\mathcal{N}(Q,H)$ the number of isomorphic copies of $Q$ in $H$. For a hereditary family $\mathcal{P}$ of $r$-uniform hypergraphs, define $$\pi(Q,\mathcal{P}):=\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}\binom{n}{s}^{-1}\max\{\mathcal{N}(Q,H): H\in \mathcal{P}~~\mbox{and}~~|V(H)|=n\}.$$ For $p\geq1$, the $(p,Q)$-spectral radius of $H$ is defined as $$\lambda^{(p)}(Q,H):=\max_{\|\mathbf{x}\|_{p}=1}s!\sum_{\{i_{1},\ldots,i_{s}\}\in \binom{[n]}{s}}\mathcal{N}(Q,H[\{i_{1},\ldots,i_{s}\}])x_{i_{1}}\cdots x_{i_{s}}.$$
  %generalizing the concept of the $p$-spectral radius introduced by %Keevash, Lenz, and Mubayi \cite{KLM2014}.
  In this paper, we present a systematically investigation of the parameter $\lambda^{(p)}(Q,H)$. First, we prove that the limit $$\lambda^{(p)}(Q,\mathcal{P}):=\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}n^{s/p-s}\max\{\lambda^{(p)}(Q,H): H\in \mathcal{P}~~\mbox{and}~~|V(H)|=n\}$$ exists, and for $p&gt;1$, it satisfies $$\pi(Q,\mathcal{P})=\lambda^{(p)}(Q,\mathcal{P}).$$
  Second, we study spectral generalized Tur\'an problems.
  Specifically, we establish a spectral stability result and apply it to derive a spectral version of the Erd\H{o}s Pentagon Problem: for $p\geq1$ and sufficiently large $n$, the balanced blow-up of $C_{5}$ maximizes $\lambda^{(p)}(C_{5},H)$ among all $n$-vertex triangle-free graphs $H$, thereby improving a result of Liu \cite{Liu2025}. Furthermore, we show that for $p\geq1$ and sufficiently large $n$, the $l$-partite Tur\'an graph $T_{l}(n)$ attains the maximum $\lambda^{(p)}(K_{s},H)$ among all $n$-vertex F-free graphs $H$, where $F$ is an edge-critical graph with $\chi(F)=l+1$. This provides a spectral analogue of a theorem due to Ma and Qiu \cite{MQ2020}.</description>

      <title>The paired construction for Boolean functions on the slice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite set of size $n$. We consider real functions on the "slice" $\binom{V}{k}$, which are also known as functions in the Johnson scheme. For $I \subseteq J \subseteq V$, the characteristic function of the set of all $K\in\binom{V}{k}$ with $I \subseteq K \subseteq J$ is called "basic". In this article, we investigate a construction arising as the sum of two "opposite" basic functions. In essentially all cases, these "paired" functions are Boolean.
  Our main result is the determination of the exact degree -- regarding a representation by an $n$-variable polynomial -- of all paired functions. The proof is elementary and does not involve any spectral methods. First, we settle the middle layer case $n=2k$ by identifying and combining various relations among the degrees involved. Then the general case is reduced to the middle layer situation by means of derived, reduced, and dual functions.
  Remarkably, in certain situations, the degree is strictly smaller than what is guaranteed by the elementary upper bound for the sum of functions. This makes paired functions good candidates for fixed-degree Boolean functions of small support size. As it turns out, for $n = 2k$ and even degree $t \notin \{0,k\}$, paired functions provide the smallest known non-zero Boolean functions, surpassing the $t$-pencils, which is the smallest known construction in all other cases.</description>

      <title>Goodman-Strauss theorem revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Goodman-Strauss theorem states that for ``almost every" substitution, the family of substitution tilings is sofic, that is, it can be defined by local rules for some decoration of tiles. The conditions on the substitution that guarantee the soficity are not stated explicitly, but are scattered throughout the proof.
  In this paper we propose a version of Goodman-Strauss theorem in which the conditions on the substitution are stated explicitly. Although the conditions are quite restrictive, we show that, in combination with two simple tricks (taking a sufficiently large power of the substitution and combining small tiles into larger ones), our version of Goodman-Strauss theorem can also prove the soficity of the family of substitution tilings for ``almost every'' substitution.
  We also prove a similar theorem for the family of hierarchical tilings associated with the given substitution. A tiling is called hierarchical if it has a composition under the substitution, such that this composition also has a composition, and so on, infinitely many times. Every substitution tiling is hierarchical, but the converse is not always true. Fernique and Ollinger formulated some conditions on the substitution that guarantee that the family of hierarchical tilings is sofic. However, their technique does not prove this statement under such general conditions as in their paper. In the present paper, we show that under the same assumptions, as for our version of the Goodman-Strauss theorem, their technique works.</description>

      <title>A polynomial bound on the pathwidth of graphs edge-coverable by $k$ shortest paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dumas, Foucaud, Perez and Todinca (2024) recently proved that every graph whose edges can be covered by $k$ shortest paths has pathwidth at most $O(3^k)$. In this paper, we improve this upper bound on the pathwidth to a polynomial one; namely, we show that every graph whose edge set can be covered by $k$ shortest paths has pathwidth $O(k^4)$, answering a question from the same paper. Moreover, we prove that when $k\leq 3$, every such graph has pathwidth at most $k$ (and this bound is tight). Finally, we show that even though there exist graphs with arbitrarily large treewidth whose vertex set can be covered by $2$ isometric trees, every graph whose set of edges can be covered by $2$ isometric trees has treewidth at most $2$.</description>

      <title>Computing the number of realisations of a rigid graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02988v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is said to be rigid if, given a generic realisation of the graph as a bar-and-joint framework in the plane, there exist only finitely many other realisations of the graph with the same edge lengths modulo rotations, reflections and translations. In recent years there has been an increase of interest in determining exactly what this finite amount is, hereon known as the realisation number. Combinatorial algorithms for the realisation number were previously known for the special cases of minimally rigid and redundantly rigid graphs. In this paper we provide a combinatorial algorithm to compute the realisation number of any rigid graph, and thus solve an open problem of Jackson and Owen. We then adapt our algorithm to compute: (i) spherical realisation numbers, and (ii) the number of rank-3 PSD matrix completions of a generic partial matrix.</description>

      <title>(Injective) facet-complexity between simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the notion of facet-complexity, $\text{C}(\mathsf{L};\mathsf{K})$, for two simplicial complexes $\mathsf{L}$ and $\mathsf{K}$, along with basic results for this numerical invariant. This invariant $\text{C}(\mathsf{L};\mathsf{K})$ quantifies the \aspas{complexity} of the following question: When does there exist a facet simplicial map $\mathsf{L}\to \mathsf{K}$? A facet simplicial map is a simplicial map that preserves non-unitary facets. Likewise, we introduce the notion of injective facet-complexity, $\text{IC}(\mathsf{L};\mathsf{K})$. These invariants generalize the notion of (injective) hom-complexity between graphs, recently introduced by Zapata et al. We demonstrate a triangular inequality for (injective) facet-complexity and show that it is a simplicial complex invariant. Additionally, these invariants provide an obstruction to the existence of facet simplicial maps. We explore the sub-additivity of (injective) facet-complexity and we present a lower bound in terms of the chromatic number. Moreover, we provide an upper bound for $\mathrm{C}(\mathsf{L};\mathsf{H})$ in terms of the number of facets of $L$. Finally, we establish a formula for $\mathrm{IC}(\mathsf{L};\mathsf{K})$ when $\mathsf{L}$ is a pure simplicial complex and $K$ is a complete simplicial complex.</description>

Abstract: This note is dedicated to presenting a polynomial analogue of $(n+1)!C_n=2^n(2n-1)!!$ (with $C_n$ as the $n$-th Catalan number) in the context of labeled plane trees and increasing plane trees, based on the definition of improper edges in labeled plane trees. A new involution on labeled plane trees is constructed to establish this identity, implying that the number of improper edges and the number of proper edges are equidsitributed over the set of labeled plane trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The canonical van der Waerden theorem asserts that, for sufficiently large $n$, every colouring of $[n]$ contains either a monochromatic or a rainbow arithmetic progression of length $k$ ($k$-AP, for short). In this paper, we determine the threshold at which the binomial random subset $[n]_p$ almost surely inherits this canonical Ramsey type property. As an application, we show the existence of sets $A\subseteq [n]$ such that the $k$-APs in $A$ define a $k$-uniform hypergraph of arbitrarily high girth and yet any colouring of $A$ induces a monochromatic or rainbow $k$-AP.</description>

      <title>Digraph Yama Nim</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {\sc Yama Nim} is a variant of two piles {\sc Nim}. In this ruleset, the player chosses one of the piles and removes at least two tokens from the pile. In the same move, the player adds one token to the other pile. We show the winning strategies and SG-values of this ruleset.
  In addition, we introduce a generalization of {\sc Yama Nim}, named {\sc Digraph Yama Nim}. In this ruleset, a digraph is given and there are some tokens on each vertex of the digraph. Each player, in their turn, chooses one vertex and removes at least its out-degree plus one tokens from the vertex. Furthermore, one token is added to each vertex to which a directed edge from the chosen vertex is connected. We show that the winner determination problem of {\sc Digraph Yama Nim} is PSPACE-complete even when the input graph is bipartite and directed acyclic. Despite this, there are some cases that can be solved easily and we show them.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the lattices $\textbf m\times\textbf 2$ and $\textbf m\times\textbf 3$ are not Schur positive for $m\ge 8$. This confirms a conjecture of Li, Qiu, Yang, and Zhang, as an extension of counterexamples to a comment of Stanley on the universal Schur positivity of distributive lattices. Our main tools include Pieri's rules, and Wang and Wang's combinatorial formula for computing any Schur coefficient of the chromatic symmetric function of a graph in terms of special ribbon tabloids. We further show that the lattice $\textbf m\times\textbf 3$ is not strongly nice for $m\ge 44$.</description>

      <title>Many rays of the submodular cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the cone of submodular functions goes back to Jack Edmonds' seminal 1970 paper, which already highlighted the difficulty of characterizing its extreme rays. Since then, researchers from diverse fields have sought to characterize, enumerate, and bound the number of such rays. In this paper, we introduce an inductive construction that generates new rays of the submodular cone. This allows us to establish that the $n$-th submodular cone has at least $2^{2^{n-2}}$ rays, which improves upon the lower bound obtained from Hien Q. Nguyen's 1986 characterization of indecomposable matroid polytopes by a factor of order $\sqrt{n^3}$ in the exponent.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this note is to overview some of our work in Chernikov, Towsner'20 (arXiv:2010.00726) developing higher arity VC theory (VC$_n$ dimension), including a generalization of Haussler packing lemma, and an associated tame (slice-wise) hypergraph regularity lemma; and to demonstrate that it characterizes higher arity PAC learning (PAC$_n$ learning) in $n$-fold product spaces with respect to product measures introduced by Kobayashi, Kuriyama and Takeuchi'15. We also point out how some of the recent results in arXiv:2402.14294, arXiv:2505.15688, arXiv:2509.20404 follow from our work in arXiv:2010.00726.</description>

      <title>The Log-Rank Conjecture: New Equivalent Formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The log-rank conjecture is a longstanding open problem with multiple equivalent formulations in complexity theory and mathematics. In its linear-algebraic form, it asserts that the rank and partitioning number of a Boolean matrix are quasi-polynomially related.
  We propose a relaxed but still equivalent version of the conjecture based on a new matrix parameter, signed rectangle rank: the minimum number of all-1 rectangles needed to express the Boolean matrix as a $\pm 1$-sum. Signed rectangle rank lies between rank and partition number, and our main result shows that it is in fact equivalent to rank up to a logarithmic factor. Additionally, we extend the main result to tensors. This reframes the log-rank conjecture as: can every signed decomposition of a Boolean matrix be made positive with only quasi-polynomial blowup?
  As an application, we prove an equivalence between the log-rank conjecture and a conjecture of Lovett and Singer-Sudan on cross-intersecting set systems.</description>

      <title>Formal Cantor's theorem via abbreviations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We devise a calculus of abbreviation schemes for ZF formulas. These formulas are certain words over the alphabet $$ \{x_1,\,x_2,\,\dots\}\cup \{\in,\,=,\,\neg, \,\to,\,\leftrightarrow,\,\wedge,\, \vee,\,\exists,\,\forall,\,(,\,)\} $$ and have interpretations in structures $M=\langle X,\in_M,=_M\rangle$. In them $X$ is any nonempty set, $\in_M\,\subset X\times X$ and $=_M$ is $\{\langle x,x\rangle\colon\;x\in X\}$. Using an abbreviation scheme of length 9 we produce a ZF sentence $\varphi$ with length 494 such that $\varphi$ is true in $M$ iff Cantor's theorem - for no set there is a surjection from it to its power set - holds in $M$. We prove Cantor's theorem for the family of extensive structures $M$ (which generalizes classical Cantor's theorem) and translate this result into the language of digraphs. In conclusion we discuss extension of our approach to G\"odel's completeness theorem.</description>

      <title>Congestion bounds via Laplacian eigenvalues and their application to tensor networks with arbitrary geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedding the vertices of arbitrary graphs into trees while minimizing some measure of overlap is an important problem with applications in computer science and physics. In this work, we consider the problem of bijectively embedding the vertices of an $n$-vertex graph $G$ into the leaves of an $n$-leaf rooted binary tree $\mathcal{B}$. The congestion of such an embedding is given by the largest size of the cut induced by the two components obtained by deleting any vertex of $\mathcal{B}$. The congestion $\mathrm{cng}(G)$ is defined as the minimum congestion obtained by any embedding. We show that $\lambda_2(G)\cdot 2n/9\le \mathrm{cng} (G)\le \lambda_n(G)\cdot 2n/9$, where $0=\lambda_1(G)\le \cdots \le \lambda_n(G)$ are the Laplacian eigenvalues of $G$. We also provide a contraction heuristic given by hierarchically spectral clustering the original graph, which we numerically find to be effective in finding low congestion embeddings for sparse graphs. We numerically compare our congestion bounds on different families of graphs with regular structure (hypercubes and lattices), random graphs, and tensor network representations of quantum circuits. Our results imply lower and upper bounds on the memory complexity of tensor network contraction in terms of the underlying graph.</description>

      <title>On the Enumeration of all Unique Paths of Recombining Trinomial Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recombining trinomial trees are a workhorse for modeling discrete-event systems in option pricing, logistics, and feedback control. Because each node stores a state-dependent quantity, a depth-$D$ tree naively yields $\mathcal{O}(3^{D})$ trajectories, making exhaustive enumeration infeasible. Under time-homogeneous dynamics, however, the graph exhibits two exploitable symmetries: (i) translational invariance of nodes and (ii) a canonical bijection between admissible paths and ordered tuples encoding weak compositions. Leveraging these, we introduce a mass-shifting enumeration algorithm that slides integer "masses" through a cardinality tuple to generate exactly one representative per path-equivalence class while implicitly counting the associated weak compositions. This trims the search space by an exponential factor, enabling markedly deeper trees -- and therefore tighter numerical approximations of the underlying evolution -- to be processed in practice. We further derive an upper bound on the combinatorial counting expression that induces a theoretical lower bound on the algorithmic cost of approximately $\mathcal{O}\bigl(D^{1/2}1.612^{D}\bigr)$. This correspondence permits direct benchmarking while empirical tests, whose pseudo-code we provide, corroborate the bound, showing only a small constant overhead and substantial speedups over classical breadth-first traversal. Finally, we highlight structural links between our algorithmic/combinatorial framework and Motzkin paths with Narayana-type refinements, suggesting refined enumerative formulas and new potential analytic tools for path-dependent functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kauffman's clock theorem provides a distributive lattice structure on the set of states of a four-valent graph in the plane. We prove two distinct generalisations of this theorem, for four-valent graphs embedded in more general compact oriented surfaces. The proofs use results of Propp providing distributive lattice structures on matchings on bipartite plane graphs, and orientations of graphs with fixed circulation.</description>

Abstract: We show that the minimal number of skewed hyperplanes that cover the hypercube $\{0,1\}^{n}$ is at least $\frac{n}{2}+1$, and there are infinitely many $n$'s when the hypercube can be covered with $n-\log_{2}(n)+1$ skewed hyperplanes. The minimal covering problems are closely related to uncertainty principle on the hypercube, where we also obtain an interpolation formula for multilinear polynomials on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ of degree less than $\lfloor n/m \rfloor$ by showing that its coefficients corresponding to the largest monomials can be represented as a linear combination of values of the polynomial over the points $\{0,1\}^{n}$ whose hamming weights are divisible by $m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite poset $P$, we study the _whirling_ action on vertex-labelings of $P$ with the elements $\{0,1,2,\dotsc ,k\}$. When such labelings are (weakly) order-reversing, we call them $k$-bounded $P$-partitions. We give a general equivariant bijection between $k$-bounded $P$-partitions and order ideals of the poset $P\times [k]$ which conveys whirling to the well-studied rowmotion operator. As an application, we derive periodicity and homomesy results for rowmotion acting on the chain of V's poset $V \times [k]$. We are able to generalize some of these results to the more complicated dynamics of rowmotion on $C_{n}\times [k]$, where $C_{n}$ is the claw poset with $n$ unrelated elements each covering $\widehat{0}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ and $l$ be integers, both at least 2. A $(k,l)$-bipartite graph is an $l$-regular bipartite multigraph with coloured bipartite sets of size $k$. Define $\chi(k,l)$ and $\mu(k,l)$ to be the minimum and maximum order of automorphism groups of $(k,l)$-bipartite graphs, respectively. We determine $\chi(k,l)$ and $\mu(k,l)$ for $k\geq 8$, and analyse the generic situation when $k$ is fixed and $l$ is large. In particular, we show that almost all such graphs have automorphism groups which fix the vertices pointwise and have order far less than $\mu(k,l)$. These graphs are intimately connected with both contingency tables with uniform margins and uniform set partitions; we examine the uniform distribution on the set of $k\times k$ contingency tables with uniform margin $l$, showing that with high probability all entries stray far from the mean. We also show that the symmetric group acting on uniform set partitions is non-synchronizing.</description>

Abstract: A polytrope is a tropical polyhedron that is also classically convex. We study the tropical combinatorial types of polytropes associated to weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This family of polytropes arises in algebraic statistics when describing the model class of max-linear Bayesian networks. We show how the edge weights of a network directly relate to the facet structure of the corresponding polytrope. We also give a classification of polytropes from weighted DAGs at different levels of equivalence. These results give insight on the statistical problem of identifiability for a max-linear Bayesian network.</description>

Abstract: This work builds on a decomposition of a Cayley tree using the notion of a record, a concept closely related to the blob encoding of a tree introduced by Kreweras and Moszkowski, and Picciotto, that we explore and extend. We provide an alternative definition of parking functions and derive from it a record-preserving bijection between Cayley trees and parking functions. Finally, we use this bijection to establish an equidistribution between a sextuple of statistics on Cayley trees and a corresponding sextuple of statistics on parking functions.</description>

Abstract: Jordan schemes generalize association schemes in a similar way as Jordan algebras generalize the associative ones. It is well-known that association schemes of maximal rank are in one-to-one correspondence with groups (so-called thin schemes). In this paper, we classify Jordan schemes of maximal rank-to-order ratio and show that regular Jordan schemes correspond to a special class of Moufang loops, known as Ring Alternative loops.</description>

Abstract: For any cluster-tilting object $\mathsf{T}$ in the cluster category $\mathscr{C}_{n}$ of type $\mathbb{A}_{n}$, we construct a rank-four oriented matroid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ such that stackable triangulations of $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ are in bijection with equivalence classes of maximal green sequences with initial cluster $\mathsf{T}$. This generalises the result that equivalence classes of maximal green sequences of linearly oriented $\mathbb{A}_{n}$ are in bijection with triangulations of a three-dimensional cyclic polytope. The definition of the oriented matroid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ arises from the extriangulated structure on $\mathscr{C}_{n}$ which makes $\mathsf{T}$ projective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Burning and cooling are diffusion processes on graphs in which burned (or cooled) vertices spread to their neighbors with a new source picked at discrete time steps. In burning, the one tries to burn the graph as fast as possible, while in cooling one wants to delay cooling as long as possible.
  We consider $d$-fold strong products of paths, which generalize king graphs. The propagation of these graphs is radial, and models local spread of contagion in an arbitrary number of dimensions. We reduce the problem to a geometric tiling problem to obtain a bound for the burning number of a strong product of paths by a novel use of an Euler-Maclaurin formula, which is sharp under certain number theoretic conditions.
  Additionally, we consider liminal burning, which is a two-player perfect knowledge game played on graphs related to the effectiveness of controlled spread of contagion throughout a network. We introduce and study the number $k^*$, the smallest $k$ such that $b_{k}(G) = b(G)$.</description>

      <title>Totally positive Toeplitz matrices: classical and modern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By a theorem of Edrei, an infinite, normalised totally nonnegative upper-triangular Toeplitz matrices is determined by a pair of nonnegative parameter sequences, the `Schoenberg parameters', where nonzero parameters correspond to the roots and poles of a naturally associated generating function. These totally nonnegative Toeplitz matrices and their parameters also arise in the classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group by later work of Thoma. Moreover the Schoenberg parameters have an asymptotic interpretation in terms of irreducible representations of S_n and their Young diagrams by Vershik-Kerov. In this article we consider infinite totally positive Toeplitz matrices as limits of finite ones, and we obtain two further asymptotic descriptions of the Schoenberg parameters that are now related to quantum cohomology of the flag variety as n goes to infinity. One is related to asymptotics of normalised quantum parameters, and the other to asymptotics of the Chern classes of the tautological line bundles. We also describe the asymptotics of (quantum) Schubert classes in terms of the Schoenberg parameters. Our limit formulas relate to and were motivated by a tropical analogue of this theory that we survey. In the tropical setting one finds an asymptotic relationship between the `tropical Schoenberg parameters' and the weight map from Lusztig's parametrisation of the canonical basis.</description>

      <title>Well quasi-order and atomicity for combinatorial structures under consecutive orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider partially ordered sets of combinatorial structures under consecutive orders, meaning that two structures are related when one embeds in the other such that `consecutive' elements remain consecutive in the image. Given such a partially ordered set, we may ask decidability questions about its avoidance sets: subsets defined by a finite number of forbidden substructures. Two such questions ask, given a finite set of structures, whether its avoidance set is well quasi-ordered (i.e. contains no infinite antichains) or atomic (i.e. cannot be expressed as the union of two proper subsets). Extending some recent new approaches, we will establish a general framework, which enables us to answer these problems for a wide class of combinatorial structures, including graphs, digraphs and collections of relations.</description>

      <title>O(1) Insertion for Random Walk d-ary Cuckoo Hashing up to the Load Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14394v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The random walk $d$-ary cuckoo hashing algorithm was defined by Fotakis, Pagh, Sanders, and Spirakis to generalize and improve upon the standard cuckoo hashing algorithm of Pagh and Rodler. Random walk $d$-ary cuckoo hashing has low space overhead, guaranteed fast access, and fast in practice insertion time. In this paper, we give a theoretical insertion time bound for this algorithm. More precisely, for every $d\ge 3$ hashes, let $c_d^*$ be the sharp threshold for the load factor at which a valid assignment of $cm$ objects to a hash table of size $m$ likely exists. We show that for any $d\ge 4$ hashes and load factor $c&lt;c_d^*$, the expectation of the random walk insertion time is $O(1)$, that is, a constant depending only on $d$ and $c$ but not $m$.</description>

      <title>Resolving subcategories for gentle algebras I: Monogeneous resolving subcategories for gentle trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first part of a series that intends to study the resolving subcategories for gentle algebras over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$.
  In a general setting, we improve the precision of an algorithm from Takahashi for resolving closure calculations in well-behaved abelian categories. Then, we modify the geometric model of Baur--Coelho-Sim\~oes and Opper--Plamondon--Schroll to compute such subcategories for gentle quivers that have a finite global dimension.
  Finally, we focus on gentle quivers $(Q,R)$ such that $Q$ is a directed tree, and we study the monogeneous resolving subcategories, which are the ones generated by a single non-projective indecomposable $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R \rangle$-module. By the way, we prove that these subcategories are the join-irreducible elements of the poset of all the resolving subcategories ordered by inclusion.</description>

      <title>Free Inhomogeneous Wreath Product of Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the free inhomogeneous wreath product of compact matrix quantum groups, which generalizes the free wreath product (Bichon 2004). We use this to present a general technique to determine quantum automorphism groups of connected graphs in terms of their maximal biconnected subgraphs, provided that we have sufficient information about their quantum automorphism groups. We show that this requirement is met for forests, outerplanar graphs, and block graphs leading to algorithms to compute the quantum automorphism groups of these graphs.</description>

      <title>Relating Different Definitions of Linear Series on Tropical Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare strongly recursive tropical linear series as defined by Farkas, Jensen, and Payne with combinatorial limit linear series as defined by Amini and Gierczak. We show that strongly recursive tropical linear series of rank $r$ are combinatorial limit linear series of rank $r$ and construct a counterexample to the converse. We also present several extensions of our main result, including a simplification of the definition of combinatorial limit linear series and an investigation of their relationship with tropical linear series in the sense of Chang et al. Finally, we address the realizability of permutation arrays as local arrays of linear series on tropical curves. Finally, discuss the realizability of permutation arrays as local arrays of linear series on tropical curves.</description>

      <title>Parity of the partition function in quadratic progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The parity of the partition function $p(n)$ remains strikingly mysterious. Beyond a handful of fragmentary results, essentially nothing is known about the distribution of parity. We prove a uniform result on quadratic progressions. If $1&lt;D\equiv 23\pmod{24}$ is square-free and only divisible by primes $\ell\equiv 1, 7\pmod 8$, then both parities occur infinitely often among $$ p\left(\frac{Dm^2+1}{24}\right), $$ with $(m,6)=1.$ The argument takes place on the modular curve $X_0(6)$ and shows that parity along these thin orbits is \emph{not constant}. The proof connects classical identities for the partition generating function, through the method of (twisted) Borcherds products, to the arithmetic geometry of {\it ordinary} CM fibers on the Deligne-Rapoport model of $X_0(6)$ in characteristic 2. This result is a special case of a general theorem for the coefficients of suitable vector-valued weight 1/2 harmonic Maass forms that satisfy a "Heegner packet'' condition.</description>

      <title>Resolving subcategories for gentle algebras II: Resolving subcategories for gentle trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second part of a series that intends to study the resolving subcategories for gentle algebras over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$.
  As in the first part, we continue to focus on gentle quivers $(Q,R)$, where $Q$ is a directed tree, known as gentle trees. In our previous work, via a modified surface model for gentle algebras with finite global dimension, we studied the join-irreducible elements of the lattice of resolving subcategories of $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R \rangle - \text{mod}$, which happen to be those generated by a non-projective indecomposable object.
  In this paper, we notice that this lattice is not semidistributive in general and, accordingly, introduce a so-called upper join-decomposition, replacing the canonical one. Together with the techniques we develop in our geometric model, it allows us to describe the resolving subcategories of any gentle tree. These same techniques let us explicitly construct the resolving subcategory generated by any collection of indecomposable $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R\rangle$-modules.</description>
