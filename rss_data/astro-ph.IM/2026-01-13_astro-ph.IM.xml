      <title>Exoplanet characterization with NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanet atmosphere characterization has seen revolutionary advances over the last few years, providing us with unique insights into atmospheric chemistry, dynamics and planet formation mechanisms. However, true solar system analog planets remain inaccessible. A major goal for exoplanet science over the coming decades is to observe, and characterize, temperate rocky planets and cool gas giants in orbit around solar-type stars, with the prospect of detecting signs of habitability or even life. Characterization and categorization of these planets relies on direct spectroscopic observations capable of identifying molecular species in their atmospheres; however, these observations represent a substantial engineering challenge due to the extreme contrast between a temperate, Earth-sized exoplanet and its parent star. NASA's next flagship mission, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) - planned for launch in the mid-2040s - will boast a coronagraphic instrument capable of reaching the needed 10$^{-10}$ contrast, on an ultrastable platform enabling long integration times to achieve the required signal to noise. HWO will cover near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavelengths, enabling detections of key biosignature molecules and habitability indicators such as ocean glint and a vegetation `red edge'. Via early involvement in this groundbreaking observatory, including a potential UK instrument contribution, the UK exoplanet community now has an important opportunity to influence the telescope's design. To maintain our international competitiveness, we must be at the forefront of observational campaigns with HWO when it eventually launches, and this comes with the need for parallel development in laboratory astrophysics and computational modelling. Maximising our exploitation of this transformative NASA mission requires consistent financial support in these areas across the next two decades.</description>

      <title>Transiting exoplanets as the immediate future for population-level atmospheric science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transit method, during which a planet's presence is inferred by measuring the reduction in flux as it passes in front of its parent star, is a highly successful exoplanet detection and characterization technique. During transit, the small fraction of starlight that passes through a planet's atmosphere emerges with the fingerprints of atmospheric gases, aerosols and structure. During eclipse, the relatively small contribution of light from the planet itself may be observed as the planet is occulted by the star. For planets in near-edge-on, short-period orbits, observing the system throughout an entire orbit allows the varying flux from the planet to be extracted as the illuminated `dayside' rotates in and out of view. With spectroscopic observations, we can characterize not only the overall composition of the atmosphere, but also glean insights into atmospheric structure and dynamics. With over 6,000 transiting planets now discovered, such observations are currently our only window into a consistent sample of planetary atmospheres large enough to attempt a population-level study, a critical next step for our understanding of atmospheric science. The vast exoplanet population provides a laboratory for atmospheric physics, including chemistry, dynamics, cloud processes and evolution; extending these results to a larger number of targets will allow us to explore the effects of equilibrium temperature, gravity, mass and parent star type on atmospheric properties, as well as map observable trends to formation scenarios. These findings are critical for addressing STFC's Science Vision Challenge B: how do stars and planetary systems develop and how do they support the existence of life?. Here we outline how the UK must fit within this strategic context, suggest approaches and development for the future, and outline the unique capabilities and leadership of scientists across the UK.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Wavefront Error, Wavefront Sensing and Control, and Sensitivities into Exposure Time Calculations for Future Space Missions with the Error Budget Software (EBS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primary goal of NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) mission concept is to explore the Habitable Zones (HZ) of ~100 stellar systems and acquire spectra of ~25 terrestrial-type planets (with planet/star flux ratios on the order of 1E-10) which places tight constraints on the performance of observatory systems. In particular, coronagraph instrumentation needs to be matured for higher throughput, deeper contrasts, and better broadband performance, while also considering their sensitivity and ability to mitigate the impact of telescope instability and wavefront error (WFE), which can have a profound impact on exo-Earth imaging. The success of various proposed HWO mission architectures is often represented by the estimated exo-Earth candidate yield. Computation of the minimum exposure time to achieve the required signal-to-noise on a given target, using an exposure time calculator (ETC), is a key part of yield estimation. The impacts of coronagraph sensitivity, WFE, and wavefront sensing and control (WFS&amp;C) have been well studied in the context of developing error budgets for missions and instruments such as the Roman Coronagraph Instrument, but there is currently no easily accessible way to incorporate the effects of these key parameters into calculating exposure times for HWO. To address this, we developed the Error Budget Software (EBS) - an open-source tool that synthesizes sensitivity, WFE, and WFS&amp;C information for a variety of temporal and spatial scales and directly interfaces with the open-source yield code EXOSIMS to produce exposure times. We demonstrate how EBS can be used for mission error budgeting using the example of the Ultrastable Observatory Roadmap Team (USORT) observatory design. This includes both single and multi-variate parameter explorations using EBS where we identify trends between raw contrast and wavefront error, and detector noise and energy resolution.</description>

      <title>NASA Decadal Astrobiology Research and Exploration Strategy (NASA-DARES 2025) White Paper -- Habitable Worlds Observatory Living Worlds Science Cases: Research Gaps and Needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Executive Summary: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is the first astrophysics flagship mission with a key cross-divisional astrobiology science goal of searching for signs of life on rocky planets beyond our solar system. The Living Worlds Working Group under the Science, Technology, and Architecture Review Team (START) was charged with investigating how HWO could characterize potentially habitable exoplanets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood, search for signs of life, and interpret potential biosignatures within a false positive and false negative framework. In particular, we focused on (1) identifying biosignatures that have spectral features in the UV-Vis-NIR wavelength range and defining their measurement requirements, (2) determining additional information needed from the planet and planet system to interpret biosignatures and assess the likelihood of false positives, and (3) assembling current knowledge of likely HWO target stars and identify which properties of host stars and systems are most critical to know in advance of HWO. The Living Worlds atmospheric biosignatures science case is considered one of the key drivers in the design of the observatory. An additional 10 astrobiology science cases were developed that collectively revealed key research gaps and needs required to fully explore the observatory parameter space and perform science return analyses. Investment in these research gaps will require coordination across the Science Mission Directorate and fall under the purview of the new Division-spanning astrobiology strategy.</description>

      <title>Brahe: A Modern Astrodynamics Library for Research and Engineering Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brahe is a modern satellite dynamics library for research and engineering applications. The representation and prediction of satellite motion is the fundamental problem of astrodynamics. Current research and applications in space situational awareness, satellite task planning, and space mission operations require accurate and efficient numerical tools to perform coordinate transformations, model perturbations, and propagate orbits. While the core algorithms for predicting and modeling satellite motion have been known for decades, there is a lack of modern, open-source software that implements these algorithms in a way that is accessible to researchers and engineers. brahe is designed to address these challenges by providing a modern, open-source astrodynamics library that is quick-to-deploy, composable, extensible, and easy-to-learn.</description>

      <title>Computing Natural Magnitudes in the Photometric Systems of Astronomical Plates using Gaia DR3 SEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Accurate photometric calibration of astronomical photographic plates remains a fundamental challenge in astronomy, especially when bridging historical photographic data with modern observations due to the mismatch of spectral sensitivities of photographic plates and passbands of modern calibration catalogs. Aims. We intend to derive consistent natural magnitudes for celestial sources within the intrinsic photometric systems of astronomical photographic plates by using Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) blue photometer (BP) and red photometer (RP) low-resolution spectral data and to show its superiority to former methods. Methods. We compiled spectral characteristic data for emulsions and filters applied in photometric observations using glass plates. The collected color sensitivities, modified by atmospheric reddening depending on the air mass, are then used to compute accurate natural magnitudes and fluxes of objects in the photographic plates through synthetic photometry, utilizing a catalog of Gaia spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the wavelength range 330 nm to 1050 nm (XP spectra). This process uses GaiaXPy, a Python library designed to handle Gaia DR3 spectral data. These natural magnitudes are then compared with results from the color term method used to compile the data in existing photoplate archives. Results. Comparing the synthetic magnitudes with those existing in the Archives of Photographic PLates for Astronomical USE (APPLAUSE), we were able to reveal systematic errors of the existing data in the range of +/-0.3 mag and higher. In addition, the presented method allows for an accommodation of stars with similar color index but of different luminosity classes as well as an effective correction of atmospheric reddening at higher air masses, approximately 0.2 mag.</description>

      <title>The Potential Impact of Neuromorphic Computing on Radio Telescope Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio astronomy relies on bespoke, experimental and innovative computing solutions. This will continue as next-generation telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) take shape. Under increasingly demanding power consumption, and increasingly challenging radio environments, science goals may become intractable with conventional von Neumann computing due to related power requirements. Neuromorphic computing offers a compelling alternative, and combined with a desire for data-driven methods, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising real-time power-efficient alternative. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection is an attractive use-case for SNNs where recent exploration holds promise. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of deploying varying neuromorphic approaches across key stages in radio astronomy processing pipelines for several existing and near-term instruments. Our analysis paves a realistic path from near-term FPGA deployment of SNNs in existing instruments, allowing the addition of advanced data-driven RFI detection for no capital cost, to neuromorphic ASICs for future instruments, finding that commercially available solutions could reduce the power budget for key processing elements by up to three orders of magnitude, transforming the operational budget of the observatory. High-data-rate spectrographic processing could be a well-suited target for the neuromorphic computing industry, as we cast radio telescopes as the world's largest in-sensor compute challenge.</description>

      <title>A free-fall-based switching criterion for P^3 T N-body methods in collisional stellar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The P$^3$T scheme is a hybrid method for simulating gravitational $N$-body systems. It combines a fast particle-tree (PT) algorithm for long-range forces with a high-accuracy particle-particle (PP, direct $N$-body) solver for short-range interactions. Preserving both PT efficiency and PP accuracy requires a robust PT-PP switching criterion. We introduce a simple free-fall-based switching criterion for general stellar systems, alongside the commonly used velocity-dispersion-based ($\sigma$-based) criterion. Using the \textsc{petar} code with the P$^3$T scheme and slow-down algorithmic regularization for binaries and higher-order multiples, we perform extensive simulations of star clusters to evaluate how each criterion affects energy conservation and binary evolution. For systems in virial equilibrium, we find that the free-fall-based criterion is generally more accurate for low-$\sigma$ or loose clusters containing binaries, whereas the $\sigma$-based criterion is better suited for high-$\sigma$ systems. Under subvirial or fractal initial conditions, both criteria struggle to maintain high energy conservation; however, the free-fall-based criterion improves as the tree timestep is reduced, whereas the $\sigma$-based degrades due to its low-accuracy treatment of two-body encounters.</description>

      <title>Advanced computing for reproducibility of astronomy Big Data Science, with a showcase of AMIGA and the SKA Science prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) faces un- precedented technological challenges due to the vast scale and complexity of its data. This paper provides an overview of research by the AMIGA group to address these computing and reproducibility challenges. We present advancements in semantic data models, analysis services integrated into federated infrastructures, and the application to astronomy studies of techniques that enhance research transparency. By showcasing these astronomy work, we demonstrate that achieving reproducible science in the Big Data era is feasible. However, we conclude that for the SKAO to succeed, the development of the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet) must explicitly incorporate these reproducibility requirements into its fundamental architectural design. Embedding these standards is crucial to enable the global community to conduct verifiable and sustainable research within a federated environment.</description>

Abstract: The mean apparent magnitude of Amazon Leo satellites is 6.28 based on 1,938 observations. For spacecraft in their operational mode, 92% exceeded the brightness limit recommended by the IAU for interference with research, while 25% distract from aesthetic appreciation of the night sky.

      <title>First Multi-Constellation Observations of Navigation Satellite Signals in the Lunar Domain by Post-Processing L1/L5 IQ Snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to increase spacecraft autonomy for orbit determination has gained renewed momentum following the Lunar GNSS Receiver Experiment (LuGRE), which demonstrated feasible onboard GPS and Galileo signal reception and tracking at lunar distances. This work processes in-phase and quadrature (IQ) snapshots collected by the LuGRE receiver in cis-lunar space and on the lunar surface to assess multi-frequency, multi-constellation signal availability. Signals from additional systems beyond GPS and Galileo, including RNSS and SBAS constellations, are observable and successfully acquired exclusively in the recorded IQ snapshots. These observations provide the first experimental evidence that signals from multiple constellations, including systems not supported by LuGRE realtime operations, are detectable at unprecedented distances from Earth. Useful observables can be extracted from the IQ snapshots, despite minimal sampling rates, 4-bit quantization, and short durations (200 ms-2 s), through a hybrid coherent/non-coherent acquisition stage compensating for code Doppler. These observations are exploited to tune simulation tools and to perform extended simulation campaigns, showing that the inclusion of additional constellations significantly improves availability; for a 26 dB-Hz acquisition threshold, the fraction of epochs with at least four visible satellites increases from 11% to 46% of the total epoch count. These findings indicate that BeiDou, RNSS, and SBAS signals can substantially enhance GNSS-based autonomy for lunar and cislunar missions.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet observations of atmospheric escape in exoplanets with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the many recommendations of the Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020, we found that a priority area of research is to pave the pathways towards finding and characterizing habitable worlds. In this context, we aim to understand how planetary systems evolve through atmospheric escape, and develop techniques to identify potentially Earth-like worlds. Using the ultraviolet (UV) capabilities of the Habitable Worlds Observatory, we can use transit spectroscopy observations to determine what processes drive the evolution of exoplanets, how well can small exoplanets retain atmospheres, and search for Earth-like atmospheres. We advocate the development of a UV spectrograph that is capable of moderate- to high-resolution spectroscopy of point sources, access to key spectral features between 1000 and 3000 Angstrom, and UV detectors that are resilient to high count rates.</description>

      <title>In-ice Radio Signatures of Cosmic Ray Particle Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To detect ultra-high-energy neutrinos, experiments such as the Askaryan Radio Array and the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland target the radio emission induced by these particles as they cascade in the ice, using deep in-ice antennas at the South Pole or in Greenland. A crucial step toward this goal is the characterization of the in-ice radio emission from cosmic-ray-induced particle showers. These showers form a primary background for neutrino searches, but can also be used to validate the detection principle and provide calibration signals for in-ice radio detectors. In this work, we use the Monte-Carlo framework FAERIE to perform the first characterization of cosmic ray signals with simulations that incorporate both their in-air and in-ice emissions. We investigate cosmic ray signatures such as their radiation energy, timing, polarization and frequency spectrum and quantify how they depend on shower properties. These results provide key guidelines for cosmic-ray identification and cosmic-ray neutrino discrimination in future in-ice radio experiments.</description>

Abstract: The preparation of next-generation large-scale radio experiments requires running a fast and efficient number of simulations to explore multiple detector configurations over vast areas and develop novel methods for the reconstruction of air shower parameters. While Monte Carlo simulations are accurate and reliable tools, they are too computationally expensive to explore the full parameter space of these new detectors within a reasonable timescale. We introduce a new version of Radio Morphing, a semi-analytical tool designed to simulate the radio emission of any cosmic-ray induced air shower with zenith angle $\theta&gt;60^{\circ}$, at any desired antenna position, from the simulation data of a few reference showers at given positions. We present the latest performances of Radio Morphing which now provides simulation of air shower radio signals with average relative differences on the peak amplitude below $17\%$ on raw traces, below $15\%$ with a $3\sigma$ trigger threshold, below $13\%$ in the $[50-200]\,\rm MHz$ band, and even below $\sim 10\%$ in the $[30-80]\,\rm MHz$ band. These results are combined with a computation time reduced by more than four orders of magnitude, compared to standard Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Spec-o3: A Tool-Augmented Vision-Language Agent for Rare Celestial Object Candidate Vetting via Automated Spectral Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the limited generalization and interpretability of deep learning classifiers, The final vetting of rare celestial object candidates still relies on expert visual inspection--a manually intensive process. In this process, astronomers leverage specialized tools to analyze spectra and construct reliable catalogs. However, this practice has become the primary bottleneck, as it is fundamentally incapable of scaling with the data deluge from modern spectroscopic surveys. To bridge this gap, we propose Spec-o3, a tool-augmented vision-language agent that performs astronomer-aligned spectral inspection via interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning. Spec-o3 is trained with a two-stage post-training recipe: cold-start supervised fine-tuning on expert inspection trajectories followed by outcome-based reinforcement learning on rare-type verification tasks. Evaluated on five rare-object identification tasks from LAMOST, Spec-o3 establishes a new State-of-the-Art, boosting the macro-F1 score from 28.3 to 76.5 with a 7B parameter base model and outperforming both proprietary VLMs and specialized deep models. Crucially, the agent demonstrates strong generalization to unseen inspection tasks across survey shifts (from LAMOST to SDSS/DESI). Expert evaluations confirm that its reasoning traces are coherent and physically consistent, supporting transparent and trustworthy decision-making. Code, data, and models are available at \href{https://github.com/Maxwell-Jia/spec-o3}{Project HomePage}.</description>

      <title>On the 3D time evolution of the dust size distribution in protostellar envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust plays a fundamental role during protostellar collapse, disk and planet formation. Recent observations suggest that efficient dust growth may begin early, in the protostellar envelopes, potentially even before the formation of the disk. Three-dimensional models of protostellar evolution, addressing multi-size dust growth, gas and dust dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, are required to characterize the dust evolution in the embedded stages of star formation. We aim to establish a new framework for dust evolution models, following in 3D the dust size distribution both in time and space, in MHD models describing the formation and evolution of star-disk systems, at low numerical cost. We present our work coupling the COALA dust evolution module into the code RAMSES, performing the first 3D MHD simulation of protostellar collapse including simultaneously polydisperse dust growth modeled by the Smoluchowski equation as well as dust dynamics in the terminal velocity approximation. Ice-coated micron-sized grains can rapidly grow in the envelope and survive by not entering the fragmentation regime. The evolution of the dust size distribution is highly anisotropic due to the turbulent nature of the collapse and the development of favorable locations such as outflow cavity walls, which enhance locally the dust-to-gas ratio. We analyzed the first 3D non-ideal MHD simulations that self-consistently account for the dust dynamics and growth during the protostellar stage. Very early in the lifetime of a young embedded protostar, micron-sized grains can grow, and locally the dust size distribution deviates significantly from the MRN initial shape. This new numerical method opens the perspective to treat simultaneously gas/dust dynamics and dust growth in 3D simulations at a low numerical cost for several astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Bringing Computation to the data: Interoperable serverless function execution for astrophysical data analysis in the SRCNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serverless computing is a paradigm in which the underlying infrastructure is fully managed by the provider, enabling applications and services to be executed with elastic resource provisioning and minimal operational overhead. A core model within this paradigm is Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), where lightweight functions are deployed and triggered on demand, scaling seamlessly with workload. FaaS offers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and fine-grained scalability, qualities particularly relevant for large-scale scientific infrastructures where data volumes are too large to centralise and computation must increasingly occur close to the data. The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) exemplifies this challenge. Once operational, it will generate about 700~PB of data products annually, distributed across the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet), a federation of international centres providing storage, computing, and analysis services. In such a context, FaaS offers a mechanism to bring computation to the data. We studied the principles of serverless and FaaS computing and explored their application to radio astronomy workflows. Representative functions for astrophysical data analysis were developed and deployed, including micro-functions derived from existing libraries and wrappers around domain-specific applications. In particular, a Gaussian convolution function was implemented and integrated within the SRCNet ecosystem. The use case demonstrates that FaaS can be embedded into the existing SRCNet ecosystem of services, allowing functions to run directly at sites where data replicas are stored. This reduces latency, minimises transfers, and improves efficiency, aligning with federated, data-proximate computation. The results show that serverless models provide a scalable and efficient pathway to address the data volumes of the SKA era.</description>

      <title>Functionalization of Benzene Ices by Atomic Oxygen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small aromatic molecules, including functionalized derivatives of benzene, are known to be present throughout the different stages of star and planet formation. In particular, oxygen-bearing monosubstituted aromatics, likely including phenol, have been identified in the coma of comet 67P. This suggests that, earlier in the star and planet formation evolution, icy grains may act as both reservoirs and sites of functionalization for these small aromatics. We investigate the ice-phase reactivity of singlet oxygen atoms (O($^1$D)) with benzene, using ozone as a precursor that is readily photodissociated by relatively low-energy. Our experiments show that O($^1$D) efficiently reacts with benzene, forming phenol, benzene oxide, and oxepine as the main products. Phenol formation is temperature-independent, consistent with a barrierless insertion mechanism. In contrast, the formation of benzene oxide/oxepine shows a slight temperature dependence, suggesting that additional reaction pathways involving either ground-state or excited-state oxygen atoms may contribute. In H$_2$O and \COO ice matrices we find that dilution does not suppress formation of phenol. We extrapolate an experimental upper limit for the benzene-to-phenol conversion fraction of 27-44$\%$ during the lifetime of an interstellar cloud, assuming O($^1$D) production rates based on CO$_2$ ice abundances and a cosmic-ray induced UV field. We compare these estimates with a new analysis of data from the comet 67P, where the C$_6$H$_6$O/C$_6$H$_6$ ratio is 20$\pm$6$\%$. This value lies within our estimated range, suggesting that O($^1$D)-mediated chemistry is a viable pathway for producing oxygenated aromatics in cold astrophysical ices, potentially enriching icy planetesimals with phenol and other biorelevant compounds.</description>

      <title>Coordinate Systems and Transforms in Space Physics: Terms, Definitions, Implementations, and Recommendations for Reproducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In space physics, acronyms for coordinate systems (e.g., \texttt{GEI}, \texttt{GSM}) are commonly used; however, differences in their definitions and implementations can prevent reproducibility. In this work, we compare definitions in online resources, software packages, and frequently cited journal articles and show that implementation differences can lead to transformations between same-named coordinate systems and ephemerides values from different data providers to differ significantly. Based on these comparisons and results, and to enable reproducibility, we recommend that (a) a standard for acronyms and definitions for coordinate systems is developed; (b) a standards body develops a citable database of reference data needed for these transforms; (c) a central authority maintains the SPICE (Spacecraft, Planet, Instrument, C-matrix, Events) kernels used by space physics spacecraft missions to generate data products in different coordinate systems; and (d) software developers provide explicit comparisons of their implementations with the results of (b) and documentation on implementation choices. Additionally, we provide recommendations for scientists and metadata developers to ensure that sufficient information is provided to enable reproducibility if these recommendations are not implemented.</description>

      <title>Systematic Biases in Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation from Neglecting Orbital Eccentricity in Space-Based Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of gravitational-wave signals is essential for reliable inference of compact-binary source parameters, particularly for future space-based detectors operating in the milli- and deci-Hertz bands. In this work, we systematically investigate the parameter-estimation biases induced by neglecting orbital eccentricity when analyzing eccentric compact-binary coalescences with quasi-circular waveform templates. Focusing on the deci-Hertz detector B-DECIGO and the milli-Hertz detector LISA, we model eccentric inspiral signals using a frequency-domain waveform that incorporates eccentricity-induced higher harmonics and the time-dependent response of spaceborne detectors. We quantify systematic biases in the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, and luminosity distance using both Bayesian inference and the Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) formalism, and assess their significance relative to statistical uncertainties. By constructing mock gravitational-wave catalogs spanning stellar-mass and massive black-hole binaries, we identify critical initial eccentricities at which systematic errors become comparable to statistical errors. We find that for B-DECIGO, even very small eccentricities, $e_0\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ at 0.1 Hz, can lead to significant biases, whereas for LISA such effects typically arise at larger eccentricities, $e_0\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ at $10^{-4}$ Hz, due to the smaller number of in-band cycles. Comparisons between FCV predictions and full Bayesian analyses demonstrate good agreement within the regime where waveform mismatches remain small, especially when extrinsic parameters are pre-aligned to minimize mismatches. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating eccentricity in waveform models for future space-based gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Popcorn in the sky: Identifying primordial black holes in the gravitational-wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are possible sources of a gravitational-wave background (GWB), detectable with the next observing runs of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA. In case of a detection, it will be crucial to distinguish the possible sources of this GWB. One under-explored possibility is to exploit the duty cycle that quantifies the number of sources present in the time domain signal, which can be very different depending on the nature and population of the sources. We compute the duty cycle for a realistic population of PBH binaries, isolating the shot-noise, popcorn and continuous contributions to the GWB. We identify the dependence of the duty cycle on the signal frequency, duration and amplitude as a crucial metric for distinguishing PBHs from other sources in the GWB and constraining PBH models. Our work motivates the development of specific analysis tools to extract these observables, in order to unlock new cosmological insights with upcoming GW data.</description>

      <title>Needlets and foreground removal for SKAO hydrogen intensity maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensity Mapping (IM) of the 21-cm line of the neutral hydrogen (\textsc{Hi}) has become a compelling new technique to map the large-scale structure of the Universe. One of the main challenges is the presence of strong foreground emissions of several orders of magnitude larger than the \textsc{Hi}~signal. Here, we implement a version of the Principal Component Analysis, a blind component-separation technique, based on a kind of spherical wavelets called needlets. These functions exploit double localization both in real and in harmonic space. We test Need-PCA performances on a set of maps that simulates the SKA MID radio telescope in the AA4 configuration. We compare our results with other component separation methods such as Generalised Morphological Component Analysis (GMCA) and Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC). All the methods have comparable results, recovering the \textsc{Hi}~signal within 10\% accuracy across the frequency channels, in the multipole range 30 $\lesssim \ell \lesssim$ 136. We also test our pipeline in the presence of systematics such as polarization leakage. We find that the cleaning methods are insensitive to the presence of such systematic, yielding the same results as in the leakage-free case. Finally, under the assumption of a realistic telescope beam with sidelobes, we find that standard PCA and GMCA fails to recover the \textsc{Hi}~signal at larger scales, while the Need-PCA and Need-GMCA are less affected. GNILC tends to over-clean, yielding to a loss of the signal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates whether large language models (LLMs) offer advantages over traditional neural networks for astronomical data processing, in regimes with non-Gaussian, non-stationary noise and limited labeled samples. Gravitational wave observations provide an suitable test case, using only 90 LIGO events, finetuned LLMs achieve 97.4\% accuracy for identifying signals. Further experiments show that, in contrast to traditional networks that rely on large simulated datasets, additional simulated samples do not improve LLM performance, while scaling studies reveal predictable gains with increasing model size and dataset size. These results indicate that LLMs can extract discriminative structure directly from observational data and provide an efficient assessment for gravitational wave identification. The same strategy may extend to other astronomical domains with similar noise properties, such as radio or pulsar observations.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{Jipole}$: A Differentiable $\texttt{ipole}$-based Code for Radiative Transfer in Curved Spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent imaging of supermassive black holes by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has relied on exhaustive parameter-space searches, matching observations to large, precomputed libraries of theoretical models. As observational data become increasingly precise, the limitations of this computationally expensive approach grow more acute, creating a pressing need for more efficient methods. In this work, we present $\texttt{Jipole}$, an automatically differentiable (AD), $\texttt{ipole}$-based code for radiative transfer in curved spacetimes, designed to compute image gradients with respect to underlying model parameters. These gradients quantify how parameter changes-such as the black hole's spin or the observer's inclination-affect the image, enabling more efficient parameter estimation and reducing the number of required images. We validate $\texttt{Jipole}$ against $\texttt{ipole}$ in two analytical tests and then compare pixel-wise intensity derivatives from AD with those from finite-difference methods. We then demonstrate the utility of these gradients by performing parameter recovery for an analytical model using a conjugate gradient optimizer in three increasingly complex cases for the injected image: ideal, blurred, and blurred with added noise. In most cases, high-accuracy fits are obtained in only a few optimization steps, failing only in cases with extremely low signal-to-noise ratios and large blurring size kernels. These results highlight the potential of AD-based methods to accelerate robust, high-fidelity model-data comparisons in current and future black hole imaging efforts.</description>

      <title>SymBoltz.jl: a symbolic-numeric, approximation-free and differentiable linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SymBoltz is a new Julia package that solves the linear Einstein-Boltzmann equations. It features a symbolic-numeric interface for specifying equations, is free of approximation switching schemes and is compatible with automatic differentiation. Cosmological models are built from replaceable physical components in a way that scales well in model space, or alternatively written as one compact system of equations. The modeler should simply write down their equations, and SymBoltz solves them and eliminates friction in the modeling process. Symbolic knowledge enables powerful automation of tasks, such as separating computational stages like the background and perturbations, generating the analytical Jacobian matrix and its sparsity pattern, and interpolating arbitrary variables from the solution. Implicit solvers integrate the full stiff equations at all times without approximations, which greatly simplifies the code. Performance remains as good as in existing approximation-based codes due to high-order implicit methods that take long time steps, fast generated code, optimal handling of the Jacobian and efficient sparse matrix methods. Automatic differentiation gives exact derivatives of any output with respect to any input, which is important for gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in large parameter spaces, training of emulators, Fisher forecasting and sensitivity analysis. The main features form a synergy that reinforces the design of the code. Results agree with established codes to 0.1% with standard precision. More work is needed to implement additional features and for fast reverse-mode automatic differentiation of scalar loss functions. SymBoltz is available at https://github.com/hersle/SymBoltz.jl with single-command installation and extensive documentation, and welcomes all contributions.</description>

Abstract: (Edited) We introduce a flexible framework for building gravitational wave (GW) event catalogs in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation. Our framework couples the state-of-the-art binary population synthesis code SEVN with Arepo-GW -- a module fully integrated into the moving-mesh code Arepo -- to assign merger events of binary compact objects to stellar particles in simulations by stochastically sampling merger tables generated with SEVN. Arepo-GW supports both on-the-fly operation, producing event catalogs during simulations, and post-processing, using snapshots from existing runs. The algorithm is fully parallel and can be adapted to outputs from other simulation codes. To demonstrate the capabilities of our new framework, we applied Arepo-GW in post-processing to simulations from the MillenniumTNG suite, including its flagship box. We investigate key properties of the resulting GW event catalog, built on SEVN predictions, focusing on comoving merger rates, formation efficiencies, delay-time distributions, and progenitor mass and metallicity distributions. We also examine how these properties vary with simulated volume. We find that GW progenitor rates closely track simulated star formation histories and are generally consistent with current observational constraints at low redshift, aside from a factor of $\sim 4.5$ excess in binary black hole mergers. Moreover, our binary black hole merger rates decline more slowly with redshift than current observational estimates for $z \lesssim 1$. Finally, the analysis of progenitor mass functions across different formation channels reveals only mild redshift evolution, while the binary black hole mass function displays features compatible with current observational determinations. These findings highlight the potential of our novel framework to enable detailed predictions for upcoming GW surveys within a full cosmological context.</description>

      <title>Implications of Joint Spectral Analysis of Gamma-Ray Bursts detected by Fermi Large Area Telescope and Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on Phenomenological Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16475</link>

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have emerged as powerful cosmological probes for exploring the distant Universe, owing to their immense luminosities and detectability at high redshifts. Several empirical correlations have been established, particularly involving their energy properties. This work aims to enhance the precision of these correlations through joint spectral analysis, focusing on reducing uncertainties in both the spectral indices and the peak energy ($E_{\rm p}$) derived from spectral fitting. We extend previous studies using both traditional and novel spectral models, utilizing a sample of 37 GRBs observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope (LAT), incorporating the LAT Low-Energy (LLE) technique, over the period 2008-2024. Our analysis compares results from joint fits (GBM-LAT-LLE) against those from GBM-only fits. The study focuses on fitting time-integrated ${\rm T}_{90}$ and peak flux in the rest frame. Among the observable phenomenological correlations, we revisit the Amati and Yonetoku relations: the Amati relation links the intrinsic peak energy ($E_{i,\rm p}$) to the total isotropic energy ($E_{\rm iso}$) emitted during ${\rm T}_{90}$, while the Yonetoku relation connects $E_{i,\rm p}$ to the isotropic luminosity ($L_{\rm iso}$). Refining these correlations aims to deepen our understanding of GRB energetics and improve the precision of cosmological parameter estimates derived from GRB observations.</description>

      <title>The HITRAN2024 methane update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters of methane from many different studies were gathered to improve the HITRAN database towards its 2024 version. After a validation process using high-resolution FTS and CRDS spectra, about 80,000 lines of the four most abundant isotopologues were replaced from the dyad to the triacontad regions. These changes amount to 51,000 transition wavenumbers, 18,000 line intensities, 33,000 pressure-broadening half-widths, and 3300 assignments. 44,000 new lines were added with 16,000 old lines removed, extending the database from 12,000 cm$^{-1}$ up to 14,000 cm$^{-1}$, and covering some gaps. A greater focus was brought on the pentad, octad, and tetradecad regions, targeted by several remote sensing instruments. In these regions, comparisons of spectral fits from multiple line lists were performed, taking only the parameters that provide best fit for each line. In the $\nu _3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, speed-independent pressure broadening parameters of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were gathered and used to fit Pad\'e-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $\nu _3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries. The CH$_3$D broadening parameters were replaced in the same manner, for missing and low or high values, using a semi-empirical formula instead.</description>

      <title>Cavity Multimodes as an Array for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave cavities operated in the presence of a background magnetic field provide a promising avenue for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs). We demonstrate for the first time that the distinct antenna patterns of multiple electromagnetic modes within a single cavity enable localization and reconstruction of key properties of an incoming HFGW signal, including its polarization ratio and frequency drift rate. Using a 9-cell cavity commonly employed in particle accelerators as a representative example, we analyze the time-domain response of 18 nearly degenerate modes, which can be sequentially excited by a frequency-drifting signal. The sensitivity is further enhanced by the number of available modes, in close analogy to the scaling achieved by a network of independent detectors, enabling sensitivity to astrophysically plausible binary sources.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for radiative hydrodynamics in astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation hydrodynamics describes the interaction between high-temperature hypersonic plasmas and the radiation they emit or absorb, a coupling that plays a central role in many astrophysical phenomena related to accretion and ejection processes. The HADES code was developed to model such systems by coupling hydrodynamics with M1-gray or M1-multigroup radiative transfer models, which are well suited to optically intermediate media.
  Despite its accuracy, radiation hydrodynamics simulations remain extremely demanding in terms of computational cost. Two main limitations are responsible for this. First, the M1-multigroup model relies on a closure relation with no analytic expression, requiring expensive numerical evaluations. Second, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition strongly restricts the time step of the explicit schemes used in HADES. To overcome these difficulties, two complementary Artificial Intelligence based strategies were developed in this thesis.
  The first approach consists in training a Multi-Layer Perceptron to approximate the M1-multigroup closure relation. This method achieves excellent accuracy while reducing the computational cost by a factor of 3000, making it the most efficient approach currently available for this task. This performance gain enables high-fidelity simulations of radiative shocks, in which radiation directly influences the shock structure. In particular, increasing spectral resolution slows down the shock and enlarges the radiative precursor.
  The second approach explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to directly solve the radiation hydrodynamics equations and extrapolate simulations beyond their initial time range. Tests on purely hydrodynamic shocks show accurate handling of discontinuities, but application to radiative shocks remains challenging and requires further investigation.</description>
