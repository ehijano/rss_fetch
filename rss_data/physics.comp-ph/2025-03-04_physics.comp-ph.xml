      <title>Data Assimilation With An Integral-Form Ensemble Square-Root Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geoscientific applications of ensemble Kalman filters face several computational challenges arising from the high dimensionality of the forecast covariance matrix, particularly when this matrix incorporates localization. For square-root filters, updating the perturbations of the ensemble members from their mean is an especially challenging step, one which generally requires approximations that introduce a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. This paper describes an ensemble square-root filter which achieves a favorable trade-off between these factors by discretizing an integral representation of the Kalman filter update equations, and in doing so, avoids a direct evaluation of the matrix square-root in the perturbation update stage. This algorithm, which we call InFo-ESRF (``Integral-Form Ensemble Square-Root Filter''), is parallelizable and uses a preconditioned Krylov method to update perturbations to a high degree of accuracy. Through numerical experiments with both a Gaussian forecast model and a multi-layer Lorenz-type system, we demonstrate that InFo-ESRF is competitive or superior to several existing localized square-root filters in terms of accuracy and cost.</description>

      <title>Impacts of dynamic radiation transport to one-cell inversions on modern GPUs with higher-order discretization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To find deterministic solutions to the transient discrete-ordinates neutron-transport equation, source iterations (SI) are typically used to lag the scattering (and fission) source terms from subsequent iterations. For Cartesian geometries in one dimension, SI is parallel over the number of angles but not spatial cells; this is a disadvantage for many-core compute architectures like graphics processing units. One-cell inversion (OCI) is a class of alternative iterative methods that allow space-parallel radiation transport on heterogeneous compute architectures. For OCI, previous studies have shown that, in steady-state computations, spectral radius tends to unity when cells are optically thin regardless of the scattering ratio. In this work, we analyze how the convergence rate of an OCI scheme behaves when used for time-dependent neutron transport computations. We derive a second-order space-time discretization method from the simple corner balance and multiple balance time discretization schemes and show via Fourier analysis that it is unconditionally stable through time. Then, we derive and numerically solve the Fourier systems for both OCI and SI splittings of our discretization, showing that small mean-free times improve the spectral radius of OCI more than SI, and that spectral radius for OCI tends to zero as mean free time gets smaller. We extend both solvers to be energy dependent (using the multigroup assumption) and implement on an AMD MI250X using vendor-supplied batched LAPACK solvers. Smaller time steps improve the relative performance of OCI over SI, and, even when OCI requires more iterations to converge a problem, those iterations can be done much faster on a GPU. This leads to OCI performing better overall than SI on GPUs.</description>

      <title>Stress, Strain, or Displacement? A Novel Machine Learning Based Framework to Predict Mixed Mode I/II Fracture Toughness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of fracture toughness under complex loading conditions, like mixed mode I/II, is essential for reliable failure assessment. This paper aims to develop a machine learning framework for predicting fracture toughness and crack initiation angles by directly utilizing stress, strain, or displacement distributions represented by selected nodes as input features. Validation is conducted using experimental data across various mode mixities and specimen geometries for brittle materials. Among stress, strain, and displacement fields, it is shown that the stress-based features, when paired with Multilayer Perceptron models, achieve high predictive accuracy with R2 scores exceeding 0.86 for fracture load predictions and 0.94 for angle predictions. A comparison with the Theory of Critical Distances (Generalized Maximum Tangential Stress) demonstrates the high accuracy of the framework. Furthermore, the impact of input parameter selections is studied, and it is demonstrated that advanced feature selection algorithms enable the framework to handle different ranges and densities of the representing field. The framework's performance was further validated for datasets with a limited number of data points and restricted mode mixities, where it maintained high accuracy. The proposed framework is computationally efficient and practical, and it operates without any supplementary post-processing steps, such as stress intensity factor calculations.</description>

      <title>Insights into dendritic growth mechanisms in batteries: A combined machine learning and computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, researchers have increasingly sought batteries as an efficient and cost-effective solution for energy storage and supply, owing to their high energy density, low cost, and environmental resilience. However, the issue of dendrite growth has emerged as a significant obstacle in battery development. Excessive dendrite growth during charging and discharging processes can lead to battery short-circuiting, degradation of electrochemical performance, reduced cycle life, and abnormal exothermic events. Consequently, understanding the dendrite growth process has become a key challenge for researchers. In this study, we investigated dendrite growth mechanisms in batteries using a combined machine learning approach, specifically a two-dimensional artificial convolutional neural network (CNN) model, along with computational methods. We developed two distinct computer models to predict dendrite growth in batteries. The CNN-1 model employs standard convolutional neural network techniques for dendritic growth prediction, while CNN-2 integrates additional physical parameters to enhance model robustness. Our results demonstrate that CNN-2 significantly enhances prediction accuracy, offering deeper insights into the impact of physical factors on dendritic growth. This improved model effectively captures the dynamic nature of dendrite formation, exhibiting high accuracy and sensitivity. These findings contribute to the advancement of safer and more reliable energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Entropic learning enables skilful forecasts of ENSO phase at up to two years lead time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper builds on previous work in applying the entropy-optimal Sparse Probabilistic Approximation (eSPA) machine learning algorithm to the task of classifying the phase of ENSO, as determined by the Ni\~no3.4 index (Groom et al., Artif. Intell. Earth Syst., 2024). In this study, only observations and reanalyses from the satellite era are employed when training and validating the entropic learning models, and a full set of hindcasts are performed over the period from 2012 to 2022 (with a maximum lead time of 24 months) in order to determine out-of-sample skill. The features used for prediction are the leading principal components from a delay-embedded EOF analysis of global sea surface temperature, the vertical derivative of temperature at the equator in the tropical Pacific (a proxy for thermocline variability) and the zonal and meridional wind stresses in the tropical Pacific. Despite the limited number of data instances available for training (ranging from 350 monthly averages for the earliest hindcast to 520 as of December 2024), eSPA is shown to avoid overfitting in this small data regime and produces probabilistic forecasts with comparable skill to the combined (model-based) probabilistic forecasts produced from the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) ENSO prediction plume. At lead times longer than those available from the IRI plume, eSPA maintains skill out to 23 months in terms of the ranked probability skill score and 24 months in terms of the area under the ROC curve, all at a small fraction of the computational cost of running a dynamical ensemble prediction system. Furthermore, eSPA is shown to successfully forecast the 2015/16 and 2018/19 El Ni\~no events at 24 months lead time, the 2016/17, 2017/18 and 2020/21 La Ni\~na events at 24 months lead time and the 2021/22 and 2022/23 La Ni\~na events at 12 and 9 months lead time.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of erosive wear considering surface degradation using coupled CFD-DEM and a bond model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A three-dimensional simulation model is proposed here to study the erosive wear of structure caused by solid particles, which accounts for the accumulation of surface deformation and degradation during the erosion process. Although there are numerous studies on the erosion, they have been primarily based on semi-empirical equations to predict the material loss and lack of an engineering approach to account for the surface evolution during erosion process, which is proved to be of great important. Our proposed model aims to overcome these challenges. In this approach, a conventional volume of solid object is discretized into a number of discrete spherical elements. A bond network is added to connect neighbouring particles at micro-scale, forming a cohesive structure at macro-scale. It is indeed a combination of particulate flow simulation by coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) - Discrete Element Method (DEM) and materials modelling by DEM using a bond model. An extensive study of fluid response in both laminar and turbulent flow is conducted when the traditional continuous rigid object is replaced by a corresponding discrete deformable object composed of bonded spherical particles. The replacement of discrete object allows this model to naturally incorporate the three-way interaction of fluid, structure, and particles. The interaction between fluid and structure at macro-scale is implicitly represented by the interaction between fluid and bonded particles at micro-scale, while material properties and the micro-structure of the solid object are reproduced by properties of bond that account for deformation and fracture. Both resolved and unresolved coupling schemes result in good agreement with the traditional CFD approach.</description>

      <title>Seeded Topology Optimization for Commercial Foundry Integrated Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a seeded topology optimization methodology for integrated photonic devices fabricated on foundry platforms that yields improved performance compared to traditional topology optimization. We employ blurring filters and a DRC correction algorithm to more readily meet design rule checks yielding devices with fewer artifacts and improved correlation between simulation and measurements. We apply this process to an ultra-compact TE modal multiplexer, a TE mode converter, a polarization rotator, and a high-contrast grating reflector. The measured insertion loss of the TE mode converter was reduced from 1.37 dB to 0.64 dB through this optimization strategy. This approach enables the use of physics-informed device topologies in inverse design and maintains compliance to foundry constraints throughout optimization.</description>

      <title>Robust and tunable oxide nanoscrolls for solar-driven H$_2$ generation and storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen gas is a promising alternative to fossil fuels due to its high energy output and environmentally safe byproducts. Various morphologies of photocatalytic materials have been explored for high-efficiency H$_2$ production, for instance, quasi-1D nanoscroll structures that provide larger surface-to-volume ratio. Recently, we predicted layer-by-layer formation of stable oxide nanoscrolls directly from dichalcogenide precursors, eliminating the need for costly formation of two-dimensional oxides for a roll-up synthesis of nanoscrolls. In this study, we evaluate the suitability of those oxide nanoscroll materials MoO$_3$, WO$_3$, PdO$_2$, HfO$_2$, and GeO$_2$ for solar-driven photocatalytic H$_2$ production and storage. Using excited state theory simulations we discern their electronic properties as a function of interlayer scroll spacing and find them to possess electronic properties that are suitable for photocatalysis. Additionally, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations we show that they are also suitable for H$_2$ storage as the nanoscrolls exhibit effective trapping of hydrogen, even in the presence of defects and vacancies in the oxides. This work thus demonstrates the discovery of robust and tunable oxide nanoscrolls as novel materials for advancing solar-driven hydrogen technologies.</description>

      <title>Particle-based plasma simulation using a graph neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A surrogate model for particle-in-cell plasma simulations based on a graph neural network is presented. The graph is constructed in such a way as to enable the representation of electromagnetic fields on a fixed spatial grid. The model is applied to simulate beams of electrons in one dimension over a wide range of temperatures, drift momenta and densities, and is shown to reproduce two-stream instabilities - a common and fundamental plasma instability. Qualitatively, the characteristic phase-space mixing of counterpropagating electron beams is observed. Quantitatively, the model's performance is evaluated in terms of the accuracy of its predictions of number density distributions, the electric field, and their Fourier decompositions, particularly the growth rate of the fastest-growing unstable mode, as well as particle position, momentum distributions, energy conservation and run time. The model achieves high accuracy with a time step longer than conventional simulation by two orders of magnitude. This work demonstrates that complex plasma dynamics can be learned and shows promise for the development of fast differentiable simulators suitable for solving forward and inverse problems in plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Numerical search for three-body periodic free-fall orbits with central symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A specialized high-precision numerical search for equal-mass collisionless three-body periodic free-fall orbits with central symmetry is conducted. The search is based on Newton's method with initial approximations obtained by the grid-search method. Instead of solving the standard periodicity equation on the entire period a quarter-period equation that also characterizes the periodic orbits is solved. The number of the known orbits from the class is significantly enlarged. The linear stability of the orbits is also investigated. All of them are unstable. A discussion in relation to the efficiency of Newton's method applied with grid-search initial approximations is held.</description>

      <title>Shaping Laser Pulses with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High Power Laser (HPL) systems operate in the femtosecond regime--one of the shortest timescales achievable in experimental physics. HPL systems are instrumental in high-energy physics, leveraging ultra-short impulse durations to yield extremely high intensities, which are essential for both practical applications and theoretical advancements in light-matter interactions. Traditionally, the parameters regulating HPL optical performance are tuned manually by human experts, or optimized by using black-box methods that can be computationally demanding. Critically, black box methods rely on stationarity assumptions overlooking complex dynamics in high-energy physics and day-to-day changes in real-world experimental settings, and thus need to be often restarted. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by enabling sequential decision making in non-static settings. This work investigates the safe application of DRL to HPL systems, and extends the current research by (1) learning a control policy directly from images and (2) addressing the need for generalization across diverse dynamics. We evaluate our method across various configurations and observe that DRL effectively enables cross-domain adaptability, coping with dynamics' fluctuations while achieving 90% of the target intensity in test environments.</description>

      <title>Collective Neutrino Oscillations in Three Flavors on Qubit and Qutrit Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor oscillations are of primary importance in understanding the dynamic evolution of core-collapse supernovae and subsequent terrestrial detection, but also among the most challenging aspects of numerical simulations. This situation is complicated by the quantum many-body nature of the problem due to neutrino-neutrino interactions which demands a quantum treatment. An additional complication is the presence of three flavors, which often is approximated by the electron flavor and a heavy lepton flavor. In this work, we provide both qubit and qutrit encodings for all three flavors, and develop optimized quantum circuits for the time evolution and analyze the Trotter error. We conclude our study with a hardware experiment of a system of two neutrinos with superconducting hardware: the IBM Torino device for qubits and AQT device for qutrits. We find that error mitigation greatly helps in obtaining a signal consistent with simulations. While hardware results are comparable at this stage, we expect the qutrit setup to be more convenient for large-scale simulations since it does not suffer from probability leakage into nonphsycial qubit space, unlike the qubit setup.</description>

      <title>Compactfying Electronic Wavefunctions I: Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcorrelation (TC) techniques effectively enhance convergence rates in strongly correlated fermionic systems by embedding electron-electron cusp into the Jastrow factor of similarity transformations, yielding a non-Hermitian, yet iso-spectral, Hamiltonian. This non-Hermitian nature introduces significant challenges for variational methods such as the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG). To address these, existing approaches often rely on computationally expensive methods prone to errors, such as imaginary-time evolution. We introduce an Error-Mitigated Transcorrelated DMRG (EMTC-DMRG), a classical variational algorithm that overcomes these challenges by integrating existing techniques to achieve superior accuracy and efficiency. Key features of our algorithm include: (a) an analytical formulation of the transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard Hamiltonian; (b) a numerically exact, uncompressed Matrix Product Operator (MPO) representation developed via symbolic optimization and the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm; and (c) a time-independent DMRG with a two-site sweep algorithm; (d) we use Davidson solver even for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. Our method significantly enhances computational efficiency and accuracy in determining ground-state energies for the two-dimensional transcorrelated Fermi-Hubbard model with periodic boundary conditions. Additionally, it can be adapted to compute both ground and excited states in molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings-induced CMB anisotropies in light of Weighted Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the morphological measures in assessing the geometrical and topological properties of a generic cosmological stochastic field, we propose an extension of the weighted morphological measures, specifically the $n$th conditional moments of derivative (cmd-$n$). This criterion assigns a distinct weight to each excursion set point based on the associated field. We apply the cmd-$n$ on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to identify the cosmic string networks (CSs) through their unique Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins effect on the temperature anisotropies. We also formulate the perturbative expansion of cmd-$n$ for the weak non-Gaussian regime up to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma_0^3)$. We propose a comprehensive pipeline designed for analyzing the morphological properties of string-induced CMB maps within the flat sky approximation. To evaluate the robustness of our proposed criteria, we employ string-induced high-resolution flat-sky CMB simulated patches of $7.2$ deg$^2$ size with a resolution of $0.42$ arc-minutes. Our results demonstrate that the minimum detectable value of cosmic string tension is $G\mu\gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-7}$ when a noise-free map is analyzed with normalized cmd-$n$. Whereas for the ACT, CMB-S4, and Planck-like experiments at 95.45\% confidence level, the normalized cmd-$n$ can distinguish the CSs network for $G\mu\gtrsim2.9 \times 10^{-7}$, $G\mu\gtrsim 2.4\times 10^{-7}$ and $G\mu\gtrsim 5.8\times 10^{-7}$, respectively. The normalized cmd-$n$ exhibits a significantly enhanced capability in the detection of CSs relative to the Minkowski Functionals.</description>

      <title>On a hyperbolic Duffing oscillator with linear damping and periodic forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Duffing oscillator describes the dynamics of a mass suspended on a spring with position-dependent stiffness. The mass is assumed to experience a linear damping and a time-dependent external forcing. The model has been instrumental in theoretical investigations of dynamical properties of systems with parity-conserving symmetry, where a double-well substrate connects two metastable states separated by a barrier. Physical systems of interest include nonlinear feedback-controlled mass-spring-damper oscillators, active hysteresis circuits (e.g. memristors), protein chains prone to hydrogen bond-mediated conformational transitions, centro-symmetric crystals and so on. In this work we consider a Duffing-type oscillator with a double-well potential represented by a hyperbolic function of mass position. The hyperbolic double-well potential has two degenerate minima that can be smoothly tuned by varying a deformability parameter, leaving unchanged the barrier height. We investigate solutions of the equation of motion in the absence and presence of damping and forcing. In the absence of perturbations numerical solutions lead to a periodic train of anharmonic oscillations featuring a crystal of pulse solitons of sech types. However, when the hyperbolic double-well potential is inverted, analytical solutions can be obtained which turn out to be kink-soliton crystals described by Jacobi elliptic functions. When damping and forcing are taken into consideration, the system dynamics can transit from periodic to chaotic phases or vice-versa via period-doubling or period-halving bifurcations, by simply varying the deformability parameter. The Poincar\'e map of the proposed model carries the well-known characteristic signatures of chaos presursors of the standard Duffing model, which happens to be just a particular case of the bistable oscillator model with the hyperbolic double-well potential.</description>

      <title>The emergent dynamics of double-folded randomly branching ring polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistics of randomly branching double-folded ring polymers are relevant to the secondary structure of RNA, the large-scale branching of plectonemic DNA (and thus bacterial chromosomes), the conformations of single-ring polymers migrating through an array of obstacles, as well as to the conformational statistics of eukaryotic chromosomes and melts of crumpled, non-concatenated ring polymers. Double-folded rings fall into different dynamical universality classes depending on whether the random tree-like graphs underlying the double-folding are quenched or annealed, and whether the trees can undergo unhindered Brownian motion in their spatial embedding. Locally, one can distinguish (i) repton-like mass transport around a fixed tree, (ii) the spontaneous creation and deletion of side branches, and (iii) displacements of tree node, where complementary ring segments diffuse together in space. Here we employ dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a suitable elastic lattice polymer model of double-folded, randomly branching ring polymers to explore the mesoscopic dynamics that emerge from different combinations of the above local modes in three different systems: ideal non-interacting rings, self-avoiding rings, and rings in the melt state. We observe the expected scaling regimes for ring reptation, the dynamics of double-folded rings in an array of obstacles, and Rouse-like tree dynamics as limiting cases. Of particular interest, the monomer mean-square displacements of $g_1\sim t^{0.4}$ observed for crumpled rings with $\nu=1/3$ are similar to the subdiffusive regime observed in bacterial chromosomes. In our analysis, we focus on the question to which extent contributions of different local dynamical modes to the emergent dynamics are simply additive. Notably, we reveal a non-trivial acceleration of the dynamics of interacting rings, when all three types of local motion are present.</description>

      <title>Flat bands and temperature-driven phase transition in quasi-one-dimensional zigzag chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat-band materials have garnered extensive attention due to their captivating properties associated with strong correlation effects. While flat bands have been discovered in several types of 2D materials, their existence in 1D systems remains elusive. Here, we propose a 1D frustrated lattice, specifically the 1D zigzag lattice, as a platform for hosting flat bands. This lattice can be experimentally realized by growing CuTe chains on Cu(111). The presence of flat bands was confirmed by tight-binding model analysis, first-principles calculations, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements. In addition, we discovered a temperature-driven phase transition at approximately 250 K. Detailed analyses demonstrate that the system has a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior, accompanied by spin-charge separation effects. Our work unveils new prospects for investigating strongly correlated electron behaviors and topological properties in the 1D limit.</description>

      <title>First-principles Hubbard parameters with automated and reproducible workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an automated, flexible framework (aiida-hubbard) to self-consistently calculate Hubbard $U$ and $V$ parameters from first-principles. By leveraging density-functional perturbation theory, the computation of the Hubbard parameters is efficiently parallelized using multiple concurrent and inexpensive primitive cell calculations. Furthermore, the intersite $V$ parameters are defined on-the-fly during the iterative procedure to account for atomic relaxations and diverse coordination environments. We demonstrate the scalability and reliability of the framework by computing in high-throughput fashion the self-consistent onsite $U$ and intersite $V$ parameters for 115 Li-containing bulk solids. Our analysis of the Hubbard parameters calculated reveals a significant correlation of the onsite $U$ values on the oxidation state and coordination environment of the atom on which the Hubbard manifold is centered, while intersite $V$ values exhibit a general decay with increasing interatomic distance. We find, e.g., that the numerical values of $U$ for Fe and Mn 3d orbitals can vary up to 3 eV and 6 eV, respectively; their distribution is characterized by typical shifts of about 0.5 eV and 1.0 eV upon change in oxidation state, or local coordination environment. For the intersite $V$ a narrower spread is found, with values ranging between 0.2 eV and 1.6 eV when considering transition metal and oxygen interactions. This framework paves the way for the exploration of redox materials chemistry and high-throughput screening of $d$ and $f$ compounds across diverse research areas, including the discovery and design of novel energy storage materials, as well as other technologically-relevant applications.</description>

Abstract: Constructing fast and accurate surrogate models is a key ingredient for making robust predictions in many topics. We introduce a new model, the Multiparameter Eigenvalue Problem (MEP) emulator. The new method connects emulators and can make predictions directly from observables to observables. We present that the MEP emulator can be trained with data from Eigenvector Continuation (EC) and Parametric Matrix Model (PMM) emulators. A simple simulation on a one-dimensional lattice confirms the performance of the MEP emulator. Using $^{28}$O as an example, we also demonstrate that the predictive probability distribution of the target observables can be easily obtained through the new emulator.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of single Au nanoparticles on graphene simultaneously in real- and diffraction space by time-series convergent beam electron diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) on two-dimensional materials allows simultaneous recording of the real-space image (tens of nanometers in size) and diffraction pattern of the same sample in one single-shot intensity measurement. In this study, we employ time-series CBED to visualize single Au nanoparticles deposited on graphene. The real-space image of the probed region, with the amount, size, and positions of single Au nanoparticles, is directly observed in the zero-order CBED disk, while the atomic arrangement of the Au nanoparticles is available from the intensity distributions in the higher-order CBED disks. From the time-series CBED patterns, the movement of a single Au nanoparticle with rotation up to 4{\deg} was recorded. We also observed facet diffraction lines - intense bright lines formed between the CBED disks of the Au nanoparticle, which we explain by diffraction at the Au nanoparticle's facets. This work showcases CBED as a useful technique for studying adsorbates on graphene using Au nanoparticles as a model platform, and paves the way for future studies of different objects deposited on graphene.</description>

      <title>Investigation of O interstitial diffusion in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$: direct approach via master diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, a promising wide band gap semiconducting material, exhibits complex, anisotropic diffusional characteristics and mass transport behavior as a results of its low symmetry crystal structure. From first-principles calculations combined with master diffusion equations, we determine three-dimensional diffusion tensors for neutral ($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$) and 2- charged oxygen interstitials ($\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$). Systematic exploration of the configurational space identifies stable configurations in these two dominant charge states and their corresponding formation energies. By connecting every pair of low-energy configurations considering both interstitial or interstitialcy hops, we construct three-dimensional diffusion networks and evaluate hopping barriers of all transition pathways in networks. Combining the collection of (i) defect configurations and their formation energies and (ii) the hopping barriers that link them, we construct and solve the master diffusion equations for $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ separately through the Onsager approach, resulting in respective three-dimensional diffusion tensors D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{0}$ and D$_{\text{O}_{\text{i}}}^{2-}$. Both $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{0}$ and $\text{O}_{\text{i}}^{2-}$ present the fastest diffusion along the $b$-axis, demonstrating significant anisotropy. The predicted self-diffusivities along [100] and [$\overline{2}01$] align well with previously reported values from isotopically labeled oxygen tracer experiments, highlighting the reliability of the approach in capturing complex diffusion mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating strongly correlated fermionic systems remains a fundamental challenge in quantum physics, largely due to the sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods. We present a neural network-based variational Monte Carlo (NN-VMC) approach, leveraging a flexible neural network ansatz to represent the many-body wavefunction. Focusing on quantum dots with up to 30 electrons, we demonstrate that NN-VMC significantly reduces variational bias and achieves ground-state energies surpassing those of fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC). A key feature is that the neural network adaptively learns and optimizes nodal structures during energy minimization. We provide qualitative insights into the nodal structure of fermionic wavefunctions by comparing the nodal structures generated by NN-VMC with those obtained from traditional trial functions. Additionally, we reveal spin-resolved radial distributions and electron density profiles, highlighting the versatility and accuracy of NN-VMC. This work underscores the potential of machine learning to advance quantum simulations and deepen our understanding of strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing shows great potential, but errors pose a significant challenge. This study explores new strategies for mitigating quantum errors using artificial neural networks (ANN) and the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE). Unlike traditional error mitigation methods, which are computationally intensive, we investigate artificial error mitigation. We developed a novel method that combines ANN for noise mitigation combined with the YBE to generate noisy data. This approach effectively reduces noise in quantum simulations, enhancing the accuracy of the results. The YBE rigorously preserves quantum correlations and symmetries in spin chain simulations in certain classes of integrable lattice models, enabling effective compression of quantum circuits while retaining linear scalability with the number of qubits. This compression facilitates both full and partial implementations, allowing the generation of noisy quantum data on hardware alongside noiseless simulations using classical platforms. By introducing controlled noise through the YBE, we enhance the dataset for error mitigation. We train an ANN model on partial data from quantum simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating errors in time-evolving quantum states, providing a scalable framework to enhance quantum computation fidelity, particularly in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by performing quantum time dynamics simulations using the Heisenberg XY Hamiltonian on real quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Renormalized Internally-Contracted Multireference Coupled Cluster with Perturbative Triples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we combine the many-body formulation of the internally contracted multireference coupled cluster (ic-MRCC) method with Evangelista's multireference formulation of the driven similarity renormalization group (DSRG). The DSRG method can be viewed as a unitary multireference coupled cluster theory, which renormalizes the amplitudes based on a flow equation approach to eliminate numerical instabilities. We extend this approach by demonstrating that the unitary flow equation approach can be adapted for nonunitary transformations, rationalizing the renormalization of ic-MRCC amplitudes. We denote the new approach, the renormalized ic-MRCC (ric-MRCC) method. To achieve high accuracy with a reasonable computational cost, we introduce a new approximation to the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff expansion. We fully consider the linear commutator while approximating the quadratic commutator, for which we neglect specific contractions involving amplitudes with active indices. Moreover, we introduce approximate perturbative triples to obtain the ric-MRCCSD[T] method. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approaches in comparison to advanced multireference methods for the potential energy curves of H8, F2, H2O, N2, and Cr2. Additionally, we show that ric-MRCCSD and ric-MRCSSD[T] match the accuracy of CCSD(T) for evaluating spectroscopic constants and of full configuration interaction energies for a set of small molecules.</description>

Abstract: Automated and high-throughput quantum chemical investigations into chemical processes have become feasible in great detail and broad scope. This results in an increase in complexity of the tasks and in the amount of generated data. An efficient and intuitive way for an operator to interact with these data and to steer virtual experiments is required. Here, we introduce Heron, a graphical user interface that allows for advanced human-machine interactions with quantum chemical exploration campaigns into molecular structure and reactivity. Heron offers access to interactive and automated explorations of chemical reactions with standard electronic structure modules, haptic force feedback, microkinetic modeling, and refinement of data by automated correlated calculations including black-box complete active space calculations. It is tailored to the exploration and analysis of vast chemical reaction networks. We show how interoperable modules enable advanced workflows and pave the way for routine low-entrance-barrier access to advanced modeling techniques.</description>

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) in deep learning. KANs have already been integrated into various architectures, such as convolutional neural networks, graph neural networks, and transformers, and their potential has been assessed for predicting physical quantities. However, the combination of KANs with point-cloud-based neural networks (e.g., PointNet) for computational physics has not yet been explored. To address this, we present Kolmogorov-Arnold PointNet (KA-PointNet) as a novel supervised deep learning framework for the prediction of incompressible steady-state fluid flow fields in irregular domains, where the predicted fields are a function of the geometry of the domains. In KA-PointNet, we implement shared KANs in the segmentation branch of the PointNet architecture. We utilize Jacobi polynomials to construct shared KANs. As a benchmark test case, we consider incompressible laminar steady-state flow over a cylinder, where the geometry of its cross-section varies over the data set. We investigate the performance of Jacobi polynomials with different degrees as well as special cases of Jacobi polynomials such as Legendre polynomials, Chebyshev polynomials of the first and second kinds, and Gegenbauer polynomials, in terms of the computational cost of training and accuracy of prediction of the test set. Additionally, we compare the performance of PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) and PointNet with shared MLPs. It is observed that when the number of trainable parameters is approximately equal, PointNet with shared KANs (i.e., KA-PointNet) outperforms PointNet with shared MLPs. Moreover, KA-PointNet predicts the pressure and velocity distributions along the surface of cylinders more accurately, resulting in more precise computations of lift and drag.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stochastic Closure Modeling via Conditional Diffusion Model and Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Closure models are widely used in simulating complex multiscale dynamical systems such as turbulence and the earth system, for which direct numerical simulation that resolves all scales is often too expensive. For those systems without a clear scale separation, deterministic and local closure models often lack enough generalization capability, which limits their performance in many real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling framework for constructing stochastic and non-local closure models via conditional diffusion model and neural operator. Specifically, the Fourier neural operator is incorporated into a score-based diffusion model, which serves as a data-driven stochastic closure model for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We also demonstrate how accelerated sampling methods can improve the efficiency of the data-driven stochastic closure model. The results show that the proposed methodology provides a systematic approach via generative machine learning techniques to construct data-driven stochastic closure models for multiscale dynamical systems with continuous spatiotemporal fields.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds for Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Fokker-Planck PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations are commonly used to describe the evolution of stochastic processes. The state uncertainty of such processes is best represented by the probability density function (PDF), whose evolution is governed by the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation (FP-PDE). However, it is generally infeasible to solve the FP-PDE in closed form. In this work, we show that physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be trained to approximate the solution PDF. Our main contribution is the analysis of PINN approximation error: we develop a theoretical framework to construct tight error bounds using PINNs. In addition, we derive a practical error bound that can be efficiently constructed with standard training methods. We discuss that this error-bound framework generalizes to approximate solutions of other linear PDEs. Empirical results on nonlinear, high-dimensional, and chaotic systems validate the correctness of our error bounds while demonstrating the scalability of PINNs and their significant computational speedup in obtaining accurate PDF solutions compared to the Monte Carlo approach.</description>

      <title>Re-anchoring Quantum Monte Carlo with Tensor-Train Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for calculating the ground-state energy of quantum many-body systems by combining auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) with tensor-train sketching. In AFQMC, having a good trial wavefunction to guide the random walk is crucial for avoiding sign problems. Typically, this trial wavefunction is fixed throughout the simulation. Our proposed method iterates between determining a new trial wavefunction in the form of a tensor train, derived from the current walkers, and using this updated trial wavefunction to anchor the next phase of AFQMC. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm is highly accurate for large spin systems, achieving a relative error of \(10^{-5}\) in estimating ground-state energies. Additionally, the overlap between our estimated trial wavefunction and the ground-state wavefunction achieves a high-fidelity. Our algorithm exhibits advantages over density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We also provide a convergence proof, highlighting how an effective trial wavefunction can reduce the variance in the AFQMC energy estimation.</description>

      <title>Variational formulation based on duality to solve partial differential equations: Use of B-splines and machine learning approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many partial differential equations (PDEs) such as Navier--Stokes equations in fluid mechanics, inelastic deformation in solids, and transient parabolic and hyperbolic equations do not have an exact, primal variational structure. Recently, a variational principle based on the dual (Lagrange multiplier) field was proposed. The essential idea in this approach is to treat the given PDEs as constraints, and to invoke an arbitrarily chosen auxiliary potential with strong convexity properties to be optimized. On requiring the vanishing of the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to the primal variables, a mapping from the dual to the primal fields is obtained. This leads to requiring a convex dual functional to be minimized subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions on dual variables, with the guarantee that even PDEs that do not possess a variational structure in primal form can be solved via a variational principle. The vanishing of the first variation of the dual functional is, up to Dirichlet boundary conditions on dual fields, the weak form of the primal PDE problem with the dual-to-primal change of variables incorporated. We derive the dual weak form for the linear, one-dimensional, transient convection-diffusion equation. A Galerkin discretization is used, with the trial and test functions chosen as linear combination of either shallow neural networks with RePU activation functions or B-splines; the corresponding stiffness matrix is symmetric. For transient problems, a space-time Galerkin implementation is used with tensor-product B-splines as approximating functions. Numerical results are presented for the steady-state and transient convection-diffusion equation, and transient heat conduction. The proposed method delivers sound accuracy for ODEs and PDEs and rates of convergence are established in the $L^2$ norm and $H^1$ seminorm for the steady-state convection-diffusion problem.</description>

      <title>Scalable freeform optimization of wide-aperture 3D metalenses by zoned discrete axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07979v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for design and optimization of 3D freeform metalenses that attains nearly linear scaling of computational cost with diameter, by breaking the lens into a sequence of radial "zones" with $n$-fold discrete axisymmetry, where $n$ increases with radius. This allows vastly more design freedom than imposing continuous axisymmetry, while avoiding the compromises of the locally periodic approximation (LPA) or scalar diffraction theory. Using a GPU-accelerated finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver in cylindrical coordinates, we perform full-wave simulation and topology optimization within each supra-wavelength zone. We validate our approach by designing millimeter and centimeter-scale, poly-achromatic, 3D freeform metalenses which outperform the state of the art. By demonstrating the scalability and resulting optical performance enabled by our "zoned discrete axisymmetry" (ZDA) and supra-wavelength domain decomposition, we highlight the potential of our framework to advance large-scale meta-optics and next-generation photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</description>

      <title>Dendrite suppression in fast-charging high-energy metal-ion batteries: a Bayesian optimization approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal anodes provide the highest possible energy density in batteries. However, challenges associated with electrode/electrolyte interface side reactions and dendrite growth remain unsolved, especially under fast-charging conditions. In this paper, we consider a phase-field model of electrodeposition and optimize its parameters for suppressing dendrite growth and accelerating charging speed under constant voltage. We identify interfacial mobility as a key parameter, which should be maximized to inhibit dendrites without compromising the charging speed. The proposed approach provides a versatile tool for designing battery cells by optimizing an arbitrary objective function using an arbitrary set of parameters. This approach is based on Bayesian optimization and explores the parameters space with a high sample efficiency and a low computation complexity. The results are verified using extended simulations of dendrite evolution in charging half cells with lithium-metal anodes.</description>
