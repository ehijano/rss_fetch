      <title>Electron-beam-controlled volatile nanomechanical bistability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bistability in nanomechanical resonators can be exploited for sensing, signal processing, and memory applications due to its potential for switching and high sensitivity to external stimuli. External vibration can be used to drive a doubly-clamped nanowire into the nonlinear regime of bistable oscillation. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the bistable oscillation of such a nonlinear nanomechanical resonator can be controlled, switched and read by an electron beam.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis Measurements as a Diagnostic Tool: A Systematic Approach for Stability Benchmarking and Performance Projection of 2D-Materials-Based MOSFETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Judging by its omnipresence in the literature, the hysteresis observed in the transfer characteristics of emerging transistors based on 2D-materials is widely accepted as an important metric related to the device quality. The hysteresis is often reported with attributes like "negligible" or "small" without giving any specifics as to how this was determined and against what reference the measured values were compared to. Quite surprisingly, there appears to be only a fragmentary understanding of the mechanisms actually contributing to hysteresis and the sensitivity of the actual measurement on various experimental parameters. We attempt to close this gap by first providing a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the dominant mechanisms contributing to hysteresis: charge trapping by defects from the channel or the gate, the drift of mobile charges, and eventually ferroelectricity. We continue by suggesting methods to experimentally distinguishing between these phenomena. Based on these discussions it becomes clear that previously reported hysteresis values have little meaning as they have been non-systematically recorded under arbitrary conditions. In order to resolve this predicament, we propose a standardized hysteresis measurement scheme to establish the hysteresis as a comparable metric for the assessment of device stability. Our standardized scheme ensures that hysteresis data can be effectively compared across different technologies and, most importantly, provide a means to extrapolate data obtained on thicker prototypes to subnanometer equivalent oxide thicknesses. This facilitates the systematic benchmarking of insulator/channel combinations in terms of stability, which thereby enables the screening of material systems for more stable and reliable 2D-material-based MOSFETs.</description>

      <title>Comb-Driven Coherent Optical Transmitter for Scalable DWDM Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by the growing demand for large-scale artificial intelligence applications, disaggregated compute nodes and high-radix switches in next-generation computing clusters are set to surpass the capacity of current optical interconnect technologies. Such a surge turns several aspects of transmitters into critical bottlenecks: shoreline bandwidth density and energy efficiency are effectively limiting the scalability. We present a comb-driven coherent optical transmitter architecture on a Si/SiN platform that provides the bandwidth density, energy efficiency, and compact footprint required for such co-packaged-enabled optical interconnects. We evaluate scalability through critical building blocks, including ultra-compact microring-assisted Mach--Zehnder modulators (MRA-MZMs) and dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) interleavers. Single-tone experiments demonstrate a net line rate of 400 Gbps per polarization (16-QAM, 120 GBd) in silicon within the O-band, achieving a record shoreline density of 4 Tbps/mm while consuming only 10 fJ/bit for modulation. We also demonstrate transmission rates of up to 160 GBd QPSK in back-to-back and 100 GBd over 7 km of fiber without dispersion compensation. Using a quantum-dot frequency comb, six 100 GHz-spaced WDM channels transmit 1.08 Tbps over 5 km. System-level analyses show that by leveraging advanced modulation formats through the integration of wavelength and polarization multiplexing, our proposed architecture can realistically support combined transmission rates exceeding 10 Tbps per fiber within practical limits of power consumption and packaging, outlining a clear path toward future petabit-scale interconnects.</description>

      <title>Nanoimprinted topological laser in the visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is a widely used high-throughput fabrication technique for photonic devices, yet its reliability is often compromised by the inevitable imperfections that arise during the demolding process. Topological photonics, which harnesses topologically nontrivial structures to support defect-robust photonic states, offers a promising solution to this challenge. Here, we demonstrate a topological laser that is one-step nanoimprinted upon colloidal perovskite nanocrystals. This laser features multiple higher-order topological corner states, with topological protection provided by the structure effectively mitigating imperfections caused by the nanoimprinting process. This property enables the reliable detection of these states, which is particularly challenging to achieve in the visible spectrum. Our work establishes topological photonics as a viable pathway to enhance the reliability of NIL-based manufacturing, providing a scalable and practical route for mass-producing topological lasers with low-index materials.</description>

      <title>BIC slow light waveguides based on interband coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing bound states in the continuum (BICs) for guiding light in leaky environments has unlocked new possibilities in photonic integrated circuits. BIC confinement enables low-loss waveguiding of leaky transverse-magnetic (TM) modes in etchless waveguides based on dielectric wires loaded on plane slabs. We have recently reported BIC slow light waveguides by introducing one-dimensional photonic crystals into such etchless waveguides. However, they were restricted to a high-symmetry point ($X$ point), limiting their applicability. In this Letter, we propose and numerically demonstrate BIC slow light waveguides at off-high-symmetry points by exploiting Friedrich-Wintgen BICs, arising from the interband coupling of two guided modes sharing a radiation continuum. We identified a systematic approach for tuning the loss minimum position in momentum space and simultaneously achieved a high group index over $100$ and a low propagation loss of less than $5 \times 10^{-2}~\mathrm{dB/cm}$ at an off-high-symmetry point. Our findings pave the way for advanced control of light-matter interactions in non-Hermitian photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Distillation of supersinglet states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an entanglement distillation (purification) protocol for supersinglet states composed of N qubits. The supersinglet state we target is a total spin zero state with zero spin variance, and has a fully entangled structure involving all qubits. In our distillation protocol, three copies of an initial spin zero state are measured in the local total spin basis such that a higher fidelity supersinglet state is generated upon postselection. The initial state can be prepared using conventional Bell state distillation methods distributed in a way to target the supersinglet symmetries. The protocol uses only local operations and classical communications, and is suitable for long-distance applications such as quantum clock synchronization and cryptography, and avoids a high dimensional Schur transform such that it can be used for tasks such as quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Dynamically stable optical trapping of thermophoretically active Janus colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to optically trap and manipulate artificial microswimmers such as active Janus particles (JPs) provides a breakthrough in active matter research and applications. However, it presents significant challenges because of the asymmetry in the optical properties of JPs and remains incomprehensible. Illustrating the interplay between optical and thermophoretic forces, we demonstrate dynamically stable optical trapping of Pt-silica JPs, where the force-balanced position evolves spontaneously within a localized volume around the focal point and in a vertically shifted annular confinement at low and high laser powers, respectively. Intriguingly, the orientational and orbital dynamics of JP remain strongly coupled in the delocalized confinement. Furthermore, we demonstrate simultaneous optical trapping of multiple JPs. This first report on thermophoresis of Pt-silica JPs and localized-to-delocalized crossover in the position distributions of an optically trapped active JP, verifying theoretical predictions, advances our understanding on confined active matter and their experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Peak separation methods for inverse photoelectron spectra: Comparing second derivative, curve fitting, and deconvolution analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (IPES) is a powerful technique for probing the unoccupied electronic states of materials. It can be regarded as the inversion process of photoelectron spectroscopy (PES), which examines the occupied states. Recently developed low-energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (LEIPS) can significantly advance the study of unoccupied states, owing to an improved signal-to-noise ratio and minimal sample damage compared to conventional IPES. However, the instrumental resolution remains at 0.2 eV, which is one order of magnitude lower than that of PES. Spectral broadening caused by the low instrumental resolution often results in overlapping peaks. Peak separation is therefore crucial in the analysis of LEIPS spectra. In this study, we compared three peak separation methods: second derivative, curve fitting, and deconvolution. These methods were applied to modeled and experimental LEIPS spectra of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital-derived band of pentacene, which consists of two splitting peaks due to the two inequivalent molecules in the unit cell. We systematically and quantitatively evaluated the performance of each method in terms of analysis parameters and discussed its robustness to noise as well as its peak separation capability. This work offers a practical framework for peak separation in LEIPS, with extensions to PES and a wide range of spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Performances of far and near-field thermophotonic refrigeration devices from the detailed-balance approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a near-field thermophotonic (NF-TPX) refrigerating device, consisting of a lightemitting diode and a photovoltaic cell in close proximity. Calculations are performed in the frame of the detailed-balance approach. We study how thermal radiation, separation distance and LED temperature can affect both cooling power and coefficient of performance. More specifically, we assess the impact of bandgap energy and external quantum efficiency for an artificial material on those cooling performances. For a particular device made of GaAs and/or AlGaAs we show that, in the near-field regime, the cooling power can be increased by one order of magnitude compared to far field. However, a 10% reduction of the external quantum efficiency can lead to a decrease of the cooling power by two orders of magnitude. Finally, we compare existing literature data on electroluminescent, TPX and thermoelectric cooling with our detailed balance prediction, which highlights design-rule requirements for NF-TPX cooling devices.</description>

      <title>High-Precision and Wafer-Scale Transfer Lithography of Commercial Photoresists via Reversible Adhesion for Sustainable Microfabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photolithography conventionally requires flat, rigid and stable substrates, limiting its applications in flexible, curved, and transient electronics. In this study, a breakthrough approach is reported that employs a reversibly adhesion-switchable phase-changing polymer to universally transfer commercial photoresists onto previously inaccessible substrates, overcoming fundamental limitations of conventional photolithography. Remarkably, it achieves wafer-scale (4-inch) transfer with global registration error below 60 microns and support precise patterning on solvent-sensitive, curved, microtextured or delicate surfaces. Combined with dry etching, this study demonstrates a novel route for high-resolution patterning of susceptible materials (e.g. quantum dots and organic semiconductors). The transfer method also supports a sustainable "dry lift-off" for patterning functional materials. The reusability of both the transfer carrier and photoresist introduces a new level of sustainability and scalability, establishing a significant advancement in microfabrication. Additionally, this unprecedented capability is further demonstrated by fabricating a micro-sized UV-photodetector array with wide-angle perception directly on a curved glass bottle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phononic circuits constructed from high tensile stress membranes offer a range of desirable features such as high acoustic confinement, controllable nonlinearities, low mass, compact footprint, and ease of fabrication. This tutorial presents a systematic approach to modelling and designing phononic integrated circuits on this platform, beginning with acoustic confinement, wave propagation and dispersion, mechanical and actuation nonlinearities, as well as resonator dynamics. By adapting coupled mode theory from optoelectronics to suspended membranes, and validating this theory with several numerical techniques (finite element modelling, finite difference time domain simulations, and the transfer matrix method), we then provide a comprehensive framework to engineer a broad variety of phononic circuit building blocks. As illustrative examples, we describe the implementation of several acoustic circuit elements including resonant and non-resonant variable-ratio power splitters, mode converters, mode (de)multiplexers, and in-line Fabry-Perot cavities based on evanescent tunnel barriers. These building blocks lay the foundation for phononic integrated circuits with applications in sensing, acoustic signal processing, and power-efficient and radiation-hard computing.</description>

      <title>Efficient, inverse large-scale optimization of diffractive lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable photonic optimization holds the promise of significantly enhancing the performance of diffractive lenses across a wide range of photonic applications. However, the high computational cost of conventional full three-dimensional electromagnetic solvers has thus far been a major obstacle to large-scale-domain optimization. Here, we address this limitation by integrating the convergent Born series with the adjoint-field optimization framework, enabling inverse design with its domain size up to a $110 \times 110 \times 46\ \mu\text{m}^3$ volume$-$corresponding to 0.1 gigavoxels$-$using a single, cost-effective graphics card. The optimized lens achieves a 9% improvement in axial resolution and a 20% increase in focusing efficiency compared to a standard Fresnel lens of identical diameter and numerical aperture. These gains point to immediate application opportunities for optimizing high-performance microscopy, photolithography, and optical trapping systems using modest computational resources.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Physical Unclonable Function based on SOT-MRAM Chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hardware-based security primitives have become critical to enhancing information security in the Internet of Things (IoT) era. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) utilize the inherent variations in the manufacturing process to generate cryptographic keys unique to a device. Reconfigurable PUFs (rPUFs) can update cryptographic keys for enhanced security in dynamic operational scenarios involving huge amounts of data, which makes them suitable for implementation in CMOS-integrated spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) chips. However, a key challenge is achieving real-time reconfiguration independent of the environmental conditions, particularly the operating temperature. We propose a dual-pulse reconfiguration strategy for rPUFs in CMOS-integrated SOT-MRAM chips that effectively widens the operating window and achieves resilience across a wide range of operating temperatures without the need for dynamic feedback that overly complicates circuit design. The proposed strategy lays a solid foundation for the next generation of hardware-based security primitives to protect IoT architectures.</description>
