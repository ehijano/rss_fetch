      <title>Extended-variable probabilistic computing with p-dits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ising machines can solve combinatorial optimization problems by representing them as energy minimization problems. A common implementation is the probabilistic Ising machine (PIM), which uses probabilistic (p-) bits to represent coupled binary spins. However, many real-world problems have complex data representations that do not map naturally into a binary encoding, leading to a significant increase in hardware resources and time-to-solution. Here, we describe a generalized spin model that supports an arbitrary number of spin dimensions, each with an arbitrary real component. We define the probabilistic d-dimensional bit (p-dit) as the base unit of a p-computing implementation of this model. We further describe two restricted forms of p-dits for specific classes of common problems and implement them experimentally on an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC): (A) isotropic p-dits, which simplify the implementation of categorical variables resulting in ~34x performance improvement compared to a p-bit implementation on an example 3-partition problem. (B) Probabilistic integers (p-ints), which simplify the representation of numeric values and provide ~5x improvement compared to a p-bit implementation of an example integer linear programming (ILP) problem. Additionally, we report a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) p-int-based integer quadratic programming (IQP) solver which shows ~64x faster time-to-solution compared to the best of a series of state-of-the-art software solvers. The generalized formulation of probabilistic variables presented here provides a path to solving large-scale optimization problems on various hardware platforms including digital CMOS.</description>

      <title>Discretely structured magnetic flux concentrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional magnetic flux concentrators (MFCs) are typically designed with solid structures, which may not be optimal for applications requiring lightweight design or material efficiency. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of spatially discretized MFCs in guiding and concentrating magnetic flux, through finite element simulations. Our results demonstrate that discretely structured MFCs can achieve performance comparable to that of solid counterparts while significantly reducing material usage. For instance, even with a non-optimized discretized design, discretization along a single dimension can reduce material usage by an order of magnitude. Moreover, for three-dimensional structural devices, discretization along two dimensions has the potential to reduce material consumption by two orders of magnitude. This may offer a notable advantage in applications where weight reduction and cost efficiency are of primary concern.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Noise Cancellation of Microwave Tones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrier noise in coherent tones limits sensitivity and causes heating in many experimental systems, such as force sensors, time-keeping, and studies of macroscopic quantum phenomena. Much progress has been made to reduce carrier noise using phase noise cancellation techniques, however, in systems where amplitude noise dominates, these methods are ineffective. Here, we present a technique to reduce amplitude noise from microwave generators using feedback cancellation. The method uses a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to reproduce noise with a tunable gain and time delay, resulting in destructive interference when combined with the original tone. The FPGA additionally allows for tuning of the frequency offset and bandwidth in which the noise is canceled. By employing the cancellation we observe 13 dB of noise power reduction at a 2 MHz offset from a 4 GHz microwave tone, lowering the total noise to the phase noise level. To verify its applicability we utilize the setup in a microwave optomechanics experiment to investigate the effect of generator noise on the sideband cooling of a 0.5 mm silicon nitride membrane resonator. We observe that with our technique the rate of externally induced cavity heating is reduced by a factor of 3.5 and the minimum oscillator occupation is lowered by a factor of 2. This method broadens the field of noise cancellation techniques, where amplitude noise is becoming an increasingly important consideration in microwave systems as phase noise performances improve over time.</description>

      <title>Toward Memristor-like Resonant Sensors: Observation of Pinched Hysteresis within MEMS Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memristors, uniquely characterized by their pinched hysteresis loop fingerprints, have attracted significant research interest over the past decade, due to their enormous potential for novel computation and artificial intelligence applications. Memristors are widely regarded as the fourth fundamental electrical component, with voltage and current being their input and output signals. In broader terms, similar pinched hysteresis behavior should also exist in other physical systems across domains (e.g., physical input and electrical output), hence linking the real physical world with the digital domain (e.g., in the form of a physical sensor). In this work, we report the first observation of pinched hysteresis behavior in a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) resonator device, showing that it is viable to create resonant MEMS sensors incorporating memristor-like properties, i.e., MemReSensor. We envisage that this will lay the foundations for a new way of fusing MEMS with artificial intelligence (AI), such as creating in-physical-sensor computing, as well as in-sensor AI, e.g., multi-mode in-sensor matrix multiplication across domains.</description>

      <title>How important is the dielectric constant in water modeling? Evaluation of the performance of the TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ force field and its compatibility with the Joung-Cheetham NaCl model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient large scale computer simulations of complex aqueous solutions require the use of accurate but simple empirical force fields for water. However, the growing complexity of these systems is evidencing the difficulties to describe solution properties without due account of polarization. Conflicting strategies to remedy this problem are parametrizing water force fields to the dielectric constant or charge scaling of the solvated ions.
  In this work we compare results from TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ and OPC models, which are parametrized with an emphasis in the prediction of the dielectric constant, with results from TIP4P/2005, which is closer in spirit to the charge scaling strategy. The overall performance of the models is rated according to the Vega-Abascal benchmark. Our results show that TIP4P$/\varepsilon$ and TIP4P/2005 perform equally good, with the OPC model lying significantly behind. TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ can predict bulk phase properties (transport properties, thermal expansion coefficients, densities) of both liquid water and ice polymorphs, as well as surface tensions, with an accuracy very similar to TIP4P/2005, while performing very well for dielectric constants over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. On the other hand, TIP4P/2005 provides a better description of phase boundaries, including liquid-vapor and freezing transitions. However, the accurate prediction of dielectric constants allows TIP4P/$\varepsilon$ to describe solution densities for model ions targeted to their crystal and melt properties. This is achieved without the need to rescale charges, modify the Lorentz-Berthelot rule or tune the ion's Lennard-Jones parameters. Our findings hinge on the significance of dielectric constants as a target property and cast some doubt on the need for the appealing concept of charge scaling.</description>

      <title>Self-ion implantation and structural relaxation in amorphous silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-ion implantation amorphization is an established approach to study the structure and properties of amorphous silicon (a-Si). Fluctuation Electron Microscopy (FEM) has consistently observed Medium-Range Order (MRO) in this system that is not consistent with the Continuous Random Network (CRN) model. Using this technique we find that the degree of MRO first increases on thermal annealing and then decreases before finally recrystallizing. We discuss this new result in the light of previous experimental studies and recent theoretical observations on the favorability of the paracrystalline (PC) model over the CRN in a-Si. At ion doses far above the minimum required to amorphize, a high defect density is found in the PC phase, which anneals out at 500oC. The PC structure after 500oC annealing is independent of the initial implantation conditions and appears to represent a metastable and highly-ordered structure. Higher-temperature annealing causes a reduction in the degree of MRO and the structure approaches but does not reach a fully continuous random network before eventually crystallizing above 600oC. The effect of high dose implantation is to increase the defect density in the as-implanted state and the annealing of these defects is likely responsible for the large characteristic heat evolution at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Theory of terahertz pulse transmission through ferroelectric nanomembranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytical model is developed to predict the temporal evolution of the lattice polarization in ferroelectric nanomembranes upon the excitation by a terahertz (THz) electromagnetic pulse of an arbitrary waveform, and the concurrent transmission of the THz pulse in both the linear and the nonlinear regimes. It involves the use of the perturbation method to solve the equation of motion for the lattice polarization in both unclamped and strained ferroelectric nanomembranes within the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory. The model is applicable to perovskite oxides such as BaTiO3 and SrTiO3, wurtzite Al1-xScxN, and trigonal LiNbO3. Our analytical model provides a theoretical basis for determining the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of ferroelectric materials through THz transmission experiment. The calculation results also suggest an approach to reversing the chirality of a circularly polarized THz pulse by harnessing the resonant polarization-photon coupling in ferroelectrics. This capability of chirality reversal, along with the high tunability from a strain applied along any arbitrarily oriented in-plane axis, provides new opportunities for THz wave modulation without relying on complex metasurface designs.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Higher-Order Analysis of Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying patterns of relations among the units of a complex system from measurements of their activities in time is a fundamental problem with many practical applications. Here, we introduce a method that detects dependencies of any order in multivariate time series data. The method first transforms a multivariate time series into a symbolic sequence, and then extract statistically significant strings of symbols through a Bayesian approach. Such motifs are finally modelled as the hyperedges of a hypergraph, allowing us to use network theory to study higher-order interactions in the original data. When applied to neural and social systems, our method reveals meaningful higher-order dependencies, highlighting their importance in both brain function and social behaviour.</description>

      <title>Review of Blockchain-Based Approaches to Spent Fuel Management in Nuclear Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses critical challenges in managing the transportation of spent nuclear fuel, including inadequate data transparency, stringent confidentiality requirements, and a lack of trust among collaborating parties, issues prevalent in traditional centralized management systems. Given the high risks involved, balancing data confidentiality with regulatory transparency is imperative. To overcome these limitations, a prototype system integrating blockchain technology and the Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed, featuring a multi-tiered consortium chain architecture. This system utilizes IoT sensors for real-time data collection, which is immutably recorded on the blockchain, while a hierarchical data structure (operational, supervisory, and public layers) manages access for diverse stakeholders. The results demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances data immutability, enables real-time multi-sensor data integration, improves decentralized transparency, and increases resilience compared to traditional systems. Ultimately, this blockchain-IoT framework improves the safety, transparency, and efficiency of spent fuel transportation, effectively resolving the conflict between confidentiality and transparency in nuclear data management and offering significant practical implications.</description>

      <title>A network of parametrically driven silicon nitride mechanical membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of nonlinear resonators offer a promising platform for analog computing and the emulation of complex systems. However, realizing such networks remains challenging, as it requires resonators with high quality factors, individual frequency tunability, and strong inter-resonator coupling. In this work, we present a system that meets all these criteria. Our system is based on metallized silicon nitride membranes that are coupled via their common substrate and controlled capacitively via electrodes. We demonstrate individual frequency tuning and strong parametric driving of each membrane. Notably, we tune membrane frequencies through avoided crossings and demonstrate tunability of the coupled membrane's parametric response. This platform provides a scalable and controllable setting for exploring collective phenomena, dynamical phase transitions, nonlinear topology, and analog computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface figure of x-ray mirrors can be improved by differential deposition of thin films. To achieve the required corrections, WSi2 layers of variable thickness were deposited through beam-defining apertures of different openings. The substrates were moved in front of the particle source with specific velocity profiles that were calculated with a deconvolution algorithm. Two different DC magnetron sputter systems were used to investigate the correction process. Height errors were evaluated before and after each iteration using off-line visible light surface metrology. Four 300 mm long flat Si mirrors were used to study the impact of the initial shape errors on the performance of the correction approach. The shape errors were routinely reduced by a factor of 20-30 down to levels below 0.5 nm RMS.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the hybrid piezo and pyroelectric nanogenerators performance by SiO2 nanowires confinement in poly(vinylidene fluoride)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of a novel flexible piezo/pyro-electric nanogenerator (PPNG) that combines a uniform film of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) infiltrated over vertically supported SiO2 nanowires (NWs) to enhance both piezoelectric and pyroelectric energy harvesting capabilities. The synthetic procedure involves a low-temperature multi-step approach, including the soft-template formation of SiO2 NWs on a flexible substrate, followed by the infiltration of a PVDF thin film (TF). The plasma-enabled fabrication of SiO2 NWs facilitated vertical alignment and precise control over the surface microstructure, density, and thickness of the confined nanostructures. These strategic structural systems promote the development of the most favourable electroactive \b{eta}- and {\gamma}-phases in the PVDF matrix. Notably, the electrical poling plays a major role in aligning the random dipoles of the PVDF macromolecular chain in a more ordered fashion to nucleate the amplified electroactive phases. As a proof-of-concept, the fabricated PPNG exhibited a significant improvement in the instantaneous piezoelectric output power density (P), ~ 9-fold amplification relative to its bare PVDF TF counterpart. Analogously, the pyroelectric coefficient (p) demonstrated a 4-fold superior performance with referenced PVDF TF based PPNG. Thus, the engineered system of SiO2 NWs@PVDF comprising PPNG offers a promising pathway toward multisource energy harvesting capabilities through efficient energy transduction at mechanical excitation frequencies of 10-12 Hz and across a temperature difference ({\Delta}T) of 9 to 22 K.</description>

      <title>Flux Trapping Characterization for Superconducting Electronics Using a Cryogenic Widefield NV-Diamond Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic flux trapping is a significant hurdle limiting reliability and scalability of superconducting electronics, yet tools for imaging flux vortices remain slow or insensitive. We present a cryogenic widefield NV-diamond magnetic microscope capable of rapid, micron-scale imaging of flux trapping in superconducting devices. Using this technique, we measure vortex expulsion fields in Nb thin films and patterned strips, revealing a crossover in expulsion behavior between $10$ and $20~\mu$m strip widths. The observed scaling agrees with theoretical models and suggests the influence of film defects on vortex expulsion dynamics. This instrument enables high-throughput magnetic characterization of superconducting materials and circuits, providing new insight for flux mitigation strategies in scalable superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>A proposal of a concept for a balanced internal combustion engine configuration</title>

Abstract: Conventional internal combustion engines (ICEs) inherently suffer from imbalances due to the reciprocating motion of their components, leading to vibrations, wear, and mechanical inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel engine configuration based on four interconnected hypocycloidal straight-line mechanisms, designed to eliminate both translational force imbalances and torque fluctuations. We present the mechanical concept as a physics problem, followed by theoretical calculations showing that the proposed system results in zero net force and torque due to its symmetric design. An experimental prototype was constructed using CAD modeling and manufactured from acrylic glass. Measurements performed with an accelerometer confirm the theoretical predictions: the engine remains stable during operation, and imbalances arise only when the piston synchrony is disrupted. Our results demonstrate that such a configuration offers a mechanically balanced alternative to conventional ICE layouts, with potential applications in vibration-free piston-based engine designs.</description>

      <title>Spin-Splitting Magnetoresistance in Altermagnetic RuO2 Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently discovered altermagnets, featured by the exotic correlation of magnetic exchange interaction and alternating crystal environments, have offered exciting cutting-edge opportunities for spintronics. Nevertheless, the altermagnetism of RuO2, one of the earliest-discovered altermagnets, is currently under intense debate. Here we try to resolve this controversy by demonstrating an altermagnetic spin-splitting magnetoresistance (SSMR) effect that is driven by a spin current associated with the giant nonrelativistic spin splitting of an altermagnet. Compared to the spin Hall magnetoresistance induced by a conventional relativistic spin current, the SSMR is characterized by unusual angular dependence with a phase-shift feature underpinned by the Neel-vector orientation and pronounced temperature dependence caused by its susceptibility to electron scattering. Through systematical investigations on the magnetoresistance of (101)-RuO2/Co bilayers, we disentangle a sizable SSMR and hence unveil a Neel vector along [001] direction. Our work not only demonstrates a simple electric avenue to probing the Neel vector of altermagnets, but also indicates long-range magnetic order in thin films of RuO2.</description>

      <title>Integrated thin film lithium niobate mid-infrared modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mid-infrared spectral range holds great promise for applications such as molecular spectroscopy and telecommunications. Many key molecules exhibit strong absorption features in this range, and free-space optical communication benefits from reduced atmospheric attenuation and low transmission losses in specific wavelength bands spanning from 3 to 14 $\mu m$. Recent progress in MIR photonics has been fuelled by the rapid development of efficient light sources and detectors. However, further advancement is hindered by the lack of low-loss, high-performance integrated photonic platforms and modulators. Lithium niobate on sapphire is a promising candidate, operating across a broad spectral range from 0.4 $\mu m$ to 4.5 $\mu m$. We demonstrate a broadband, high-speed lithium niobate on sapphire Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulator operating from 3.95 to 4.3 $\mu m$. The device achieves a 3 dB bandwidth exceeding 20 GHz, an extinction ratio of 34 dB, and a half-wave voltage of 22 V$\cdot$cm, delivering optical output power at the half-milliwatt level. These properties are leveraged to demonstrate data transmission at 10 Gbit/s. The modulator is also used to generate a frequency comb with a width of 80 GHz. Furthermore, we demonstrate full $\pi$-phase modulation in the MIR, representing a key milestone for integrated MIR photonics. These results establish a pathway toward high-speed, energy-efficient MIR photonic systems for applications in telecommunications, sensing, and quantum technologies.</description>
