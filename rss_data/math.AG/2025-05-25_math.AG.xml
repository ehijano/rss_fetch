      <title>Algebraic Varieties in Second Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop algebraic geometry for coupled cluster theory in second quantization. In quantum chemistry, electronic systems are represented by elements in the exterior algebra. The creation and annihilation operators of particles generate a Clifford algebra known as the Fermi-Dirac algebra. We present a non-commutative Gr\"obner basis giving an alternative proof of Wick's theorem, a foundational result in quantum chemistry. In coupled cluster theory, the Schr\"odinger equation is approximated through a hierarchy of polynomial equations at various levels of truncation. The exponential parameterization gives rise to the Fock space truncation varieties. This reveals well-known varieties, such as the Grassmannian, flag varieties and spinor varieties. We offer a detailed study of the truncation varieties and their CC degrees. We classify all cases for when the CC degree is equal to the degree of a graph of the exponential parametrization.</description>

      <title>On 2-categories of extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is essentially an illustration for the general technology of homotopical enhancements developed recently in arxiv:2409.17489. We take the derived category of an abelian category, and we look at the full subcategory spanned by complexes of length 2. This has a natural refinement to a 2-category that we call "the 2-category of extensions". However, just using the triangulated structure on the derived category is not enough to obtain this refinement. In this short note, we first construct the 2-category of extensions by hand -- that is, using abelian category techniques -- and then show how it can be recovered very easily and naturally in the enhanced formalism of arxiv:2409.17489.</description>

      <title>A Vafa-Intriligator formula for semi-positive quotients of linear spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider genus zero quasimap invariants of smooth projective targets of the form $V/\!/G$, where $V$ is a representation of a reductive group $G$. In particular we consider integrals of cohomology classes arising as characteristic classes of the universal quasimap. In this setting, we provide a way to express the invariants of $V/\!/G$ in terms of invariants of $V/\!/T$, where $T$ is a maximal subtorus of $G$. Using this, we obtain residue formulae for such invariants as conjectured by Kim, Oh, Yoshida and Ueda. Finally, under some positivity assumptions on $V/\!/G$, we prove a Vafa-Intriligator formula for the generating series of such invariants, expressing them as finite sums of explicit contributions.</description>

      <title>Zeta functions of K3 categories over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the zeta function of a noncommutative K3 surface over a finite field, an invariant under Fourier-Mukai equivalence that can be used to define point counts in this noncommutative setting. These point counts can be negative, and can be used as an obstruction to geometricity. In particular, we study the K3 category associated to a cubic fourfold over a finite field, and show that point counts can also fail to detect nongeometricity. We also study an analogue of Honda-Tate for K3 surfaces and for K3 categories, and provide a nontrivial restriction on the possible Weil polynomials of the K3 category of a cubic fourfold.</description>

      <title>Tropical Attention: Neural Algorithmic Reasoning for Combinatorial Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic programming (DP) algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems work with taking maximization, minimization, and classical addition in their recursion algorithms. The associated value functions correspond to convex polyhedra in the max plus semiring. Existing Neural Algorithmic Reasoning models, however, rely on softmax-normalized dot-product attention where the smooth exponential weighting blurs these sharp polyhedral structures and collapses when evaluated on out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. We introduce Tropical attention, a novel attention function that operates natively in the max-plus semiring of tropical geometry. We prove that Tropical attention can approximate tropical circuits of DP-type combinatorial algorithms. We then propose that using Tropical transformers enhances empirical OOD performance in both length generalization and value generalization, on algorithmic reasoning tasks, surpassing softmax baselines while remaining stable under adversarial attacks. We also present adversarial-attack generalization as a third axis for Neural Algorithmic Reasoning benchmarking. Our results demonstrate that Tropical attention restores the sharp, scale-invariant reasoning absent from softmax.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To each nodal hypersurface one can associate a binary linear code. Here we show that the binary linear code associated to sextics in $\mathbb{P}^3$ with the maximum number of $65$ nodes, as e.g. the Barth sextic, is unique. We also state possible candidates for codes that might be associated with a hypothetical septic attaining the currently best known upper bound for the maximum number of nodes.</description>

      <title>Counting quadratic points on Fano varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper initiates the systematic study of the number of points of bounded height on symmetric squares of weak Fano varieties. We provide a general framework for establishing the point count on $\text{Sym}^2 X$. In the specific case of surfaces, we relate this to the Manin--Peyre conjecture for $\text{Hilb}^2 X$, and prove the conjecture for an infinite family of non-split quadric surfaces. In order to achieve the predicted asymptotic, we show that a type II thin set of a new flavour must be removed.
  To establish our counting result for the specific family of surfaces, we generalise existing lattice point counting techniques to lattices defined over rings of integers. This reduces the dimension of the problem and yields improved error terms. Another key tool we develop is a collection of results for summing Euler products over quadratic extensions. We use this to show moments of $L$-functions at $s=1$ are constant on average in quadratic twist families.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of tautological bundles over Quot schemes of curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03901v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider tautological bundles and their exterior and symmetric powers on the Quot scheme over the projective line. We prove and conjecture several statements regarding the vanishing of their higher cohomology, and we describe their spaces of global sections via tautological constructions. To this end, we make use of the embedding of the Quot scheme as an explicit local complete intersection in the product of two Grassmannians, studied by Str{\o}mme. This allows us to construct resolutions with vanishing cohomology for the tautological bundles and their exterior and symmetric powers. We further illustrate our approach with a few additional cohomological calculations.</description>

      <title>Unipotent homotopy theory of schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on To\"en's work on affine stacks, we develop a certain homotopy theory for schemes, which we call "unipotent homotopy theory." Over a field of characteristic $p&gt;0$, we prove that the unipotent homotopy group schemes $\pi_i^{\mathrm{U}}(\,\cdot\,)$ introduced in our paper recover the unipotent Nori fundamental group scheme, the $p$-adic \'etale homotopy groups, as well as certain formal groups introduced by Artin and Mazur. We prove a version of the classical Freudenthal suspension theorem as well as a profiniteness theorem for unipotent homotopy group schemes. We also introduce the notion of a formal sphere and use it to show that for Calabi-Yau varieties of dimension $n$, the group schemes $\pi_i^{\mathrm{U}}(\,\cdot\,)$ are derived invariants for all $i \ge 0$; the case $i=n$ is related to recent work of Antieau and Bragg involving topological Hochschild homology. Using the unipotent homotopy group schemes, we establish a correspondence between formal Lie groups and certain higher algebraic structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12501v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a flat morphism $\pi \colon X \to T$ between smooth quasi-projective varieties and its fiber $X_0$, we prove that spherical objects on $D^b(X)$ pushed-forward from $D^b(X_0)$ induce autoequivalences of $D^b(X_0)$ itself. Our construction provides new derived symmetries for some singular varieties, which include singular fibers of elliptic surfaces (commonly referred to as Kodaira fibers) and type $III$ degenerations of K3 surfaces. In the case of Kodaira fibers of type $I_n$, we also show the induced autoequivalences of $D^b(X_0)$ correspond to the half twists on the $n$-punctured $2$-torus via homological mirror symmetry. As an application, we describe the autoequivalence groups of elliptic surfaces in terms of mapping class groups of punctured tori.</description>

      <title>Universal families of twisted cotangent bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a complex algebraic group $G$ and complex $G$-variety $X$, one can study the affine Hamiltonian Lagrangian (AHL) $G$-bundles over $X$. Lisiecki indexes the isomorphism classes of such bundles in the case of a homogeneous $G$-variety $X=G/H$; the indexing set is the set of $H$-fixed points $(\mathfrak{h}^*)^H\subset\mathfrak{h}^*$, where $\mathfrak{h}$ is the Lie algebra of $H$. In very rough terms, one may regard $\psi\in(\mathfrak{h}^*)^H$ as labeling the isomorphism class of a $\psi$-twisted cotangent bundle of $G/H$. These twisted cotangent bundles feature prominently in geometric representation theory and symplectic geometry.
  We introduce and examine the notion of a universal family of AHL $G$-bundles over a $G$-variety $X$, as part of a broader program on Lie-theoretic and incidence-theoretic constructions of regular Poisson varieties. This family is defined to be a flat family $\pi:\mathcal{U}\longrightarrow Y$, in which $\mathcal{U}$ is a Poisson variety, the fibers of $\pi$ form a complete list of representatives of the isomorphism classes of AHL $G$-bundles over $X$, and other pertinent properties are satisfied. Our first main result is the construction of a universal family of AHL $G$-bundles over a homogeneous base $X=G/H$, for connected $H$. In our second main result, we take $X$ to be a conjugacy class $\mathcal{C}$ of self-normalizing closed subgroups of $G$. We associate to $\mathcal{C}$ a regular Poisson variety $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{C}}$, defined in incidence-theoretic terms. Attention is paid to the case of conjugacy classes of normalizers of symmetric subgroups. In the case of a connected semisimple group $G$ and conjugacy class $\mathcal{C}$ of parabolic subgroups, our third main result relates $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{C}}$ to the partial Grothendieck-Springer resolution for $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <title>The affine closure of cotangent bundles of horospherical spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a smooth quasi-affine variety $X$, the affine closure $\overline{T^*X} := \text{Spec}(k[T^*X])$ contains $T^*X$ as an open subset, and its smooth locus carries a symplectic structure. A natural question is whether $\overline{T^*X}$ itself is a symplectic variety. A notable example is the conjecture of Ginzburg and Kazhdan, which predicts that $\overline{T^*(G/U)}$ is symplectic for a maximal unipotent subgroup $U$ in a reductive linear algebraic group $G$. This conjecture was recently proved by Gannon using representation-theoretic methods.
  In this paper, we provide a new geometric approach to this conjecture. Our method allows us to prove a more general result: $\overline{T^*(G/H)}$ is symplectic for any horospherical subgroup $H$ in $G$ such that $G/H$ is quasi-affine. In particular, this implies that the affine closure $\overline{T^*(G/[P,P])}$ is a symplectic variety for any parabolic subgroup $P$ in $G$.</description>

      <title>Smooth locus of twisted affine Schubert varieties and twisted affine Demazure modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.11357v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{G}$ be a special parahoric group scheme of twisted type over the ring of formal power series over $\mathbb{C}$, excluding the absolutely special case of $A_{2\ell}^{(2)}$. Using the methods and results of Zhu, we prove a duality theorem for general $\mathscr{G}$ : there is a duality between the level one twisted affine Demazure modules and the function rings of certain torus fixed point subschemes in affine Schubert varieties for $\mathscr{G}$. Along the way, we also establish the duality theorem for $E_6$. As a consequence, we determine the smooth locus of any affine Schubert variety in the affine Grassmannian of $\mathscr{G}$. In particular, this confirms a conjecture of Haines and Richarz.</description>
