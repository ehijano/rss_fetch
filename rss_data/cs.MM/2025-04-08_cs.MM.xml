      <title>Unsupervised Ego- and Exo-centric Dense Procedural Activity Captioning via Gaze Consensus Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even from an early age, humans naturally adapt between exocentric (Exo) and egocentric (Ego) perspectives to understand daily procedural activities. Inspired by this cognitive ability, in this paper, we propose a novel Unsupervised Ego-Exo Adaptation for Dense Video Captioning (UEA-DVC) task, which aims to predict the time segments and descriptions for target view videos, while only the source view data are labeled during training. Despite previous works endeavoring to address the fully-supervised single-view or cross-view dense video captioning, they lapse in the proposed unsupervised task due to the significant inter-view gap caused by temporal misalignment and irrelevant object interference. Hence, we propose a Gaze Consensus-guided Ego-Exo Adaptation Network (GCEAN) that injects the gaze information into the learned representations for the fine-grained alignment between the Ego and Exo views. Specifically, the Score-based Adversarial Learning Module (SALM) incorporates a discriminative scoring network to learn unified view-invariant representations for bridging distinct views from a global level. Then, the Gaze Consensus Construction Module (GCCM) utilizes gaze representations to progressively calibrate the learned global view-invariant representations for extracting the video temporal contexts based on focusing regions. Moreover, the gaze consensus is constructed via hierarchical gaze-guided consistency losses to spatially and temporally align the source and target views. To support our research, we propose a new EgoMe-UEA-DVC benchmark and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms many related methods by a large margin. The code will be released.</description>

      <title>The Dream Within Huang Long Cave: AI-Driven Interactive Narrative for Family Storytelling and Emotional Reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the art project The Dream Within Huang Long Cave, an AI-driven interactive and immersive narrative experience. The project offers new insights into AI technology, artistic practice, and psychoanalysis. Inspired by actual geographical landscapes and familial archetypes, the work combines psychoanalytic theory and computational technology, providing an artistic response to the concept of the non-existence of the Big Other. The narrative is driven by a combination of a large language model (LLM) and a realistic digital character, forming a virtual agent named YELL. Through dialogue and exploration within a cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE), the audience is invited to unravel the language puzzles presented by YELL and help him overcome his life challenges. YELL is a fictional embodiment of the Big Other, modeled after the artist's real father. Through a cross-temporal interaction with this digital father, the project seeks to deconstruct complex familial relationships. By demonstrating the non-existence of the Big Other, we aim to underscore the authenticity of interpersonal emotions, positioning art as a bridge for emotional connection and understanding within family dynamics.</description>

      <title>UniRVQA: A Unified Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Vision Question Answering via Self-Reflective Joint Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge-based Vision Question Answering (KB-VQA) systems address complex visual-grounded questions requiring external knowledge, such as web-sourced encyclopedia articles. Existing methods often use sequential and separate frameworks for the retriever and the generator with limited parametric knowledge sharing. However, since both retrieval and generation tasks require accurate understanding of contextual and external information, such separation can potentially lead to suboptimal system performance. Another key challenge is the integration of multimodal information. General-purpose multimodal pre-trained models, while adept at multimodal representation learning, struggle with fine-grained retrieval required for knowledge-intensive visual questions. Recent specialized pre-trained models mitigate the issue, but are computationally expensive. To bridge the gap, we propose a Unified Retrieval-Augmented VQA framework (UniRVQA). UniRVQA adapts general multimodal pre-trained models for fine-grained knowledge-intensive tasks within a unified framework, enabling cross-task parametric knowledge sharing and the extension of existing multimodal representation learning capability. We further introduce a reflective-answering mechanism that allows the model to explicitly evaluate and refine its knowledge boundary. Additionally, we integrate late interaction into the retrieval-augmented generation joint training process to enhance fine-grained understanding of queries and documents. Our approach achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art models, delivering a significant 4.7% improvement in answering accuracy, and brings an average 7.5% boost in base MLLMs' VQA performance.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Usability of Microgestures for Text Editing Tasks in Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As virtual reality (VR) continues to evolve, traditional input methods such as handheld controllers and gesture systems often face challenges with precision, social accessibility, and user fatigue. We introduce microGEXT, a lightweight microgesture-based system designed for text editing in VR without external sensors, which utilizes small, subtle hand movements to reduce physical strain compared to standard gestures. We evaluated microGEXT in three user studies. In Study 1 ($N=20$), microGEXT reduced overall edit time and fatigue compared to a baseline system. Study 2 ($N=20$) found that microGEXT performed well in short text selection tasks but was slower for longer text ranges. In Study 3 ($N=10$), participants found microGEXT intuitive for open-ended information-gathering tasks. Across all studies, microGEXT demonstrated enhanced user experience and reduced physical effort, offering a promising alternative to traditional VR text editing techniques.</description>

      <title>Bridging Knowledge Gap Between Image Inpainting and Large-Area Visible Watermark Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visible watermark removal which involves watermark cleaning and background content restoration is pivotal to evaluate the resilience of watermarks. Existing deep neural network (DNN)-based models still struggle with large-area watermarks and are overly dependent on the quality of watermark mask prediction. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel feature adapting framework that leverages the representation modeling capacity of a pre-trained image inpainting model. Our approach bridges the knowledge gap between image inpainting and watermark removal by fusing information of the residual background content beneath watermarks into the inpainting backbone model. We establish a dual-branch system to capture and embed features from the residual background content, which are merged into intermediate features of the inpainting backbone model via gated feature fusion modules. Moreover, for relieving the dependence on high-quality watermark masks, we introduce a new training paradigm by utilizing coarse watermark masks to guide the inference process. This contributes to a visible image removal model which is insensitive to the quality of watermark mask during testing. Extensive experiments on both a large-scale synthesized dataset and a real-world dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available in the supplementary materials.</description>

      <title>AsyReC: A Multimodal Graph-based Framework for Spatio-Temporal Asymmetric Dyadic Relationship Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dyadic social relationships, which refer to relationships between two individuals who know each other through repeated interactions (or not), are shaped by shared spatial and temporal experiences. Current computational methods for modeling these relationships face three major challenges: (1) the failure to model asymmetric relationships, e.g., one individual may perceive the other as a friend while the other perceives them as an acquaintance, (2) the disruption of continuous interactions by discrete frame sampling, which segments the temporal continuity of interaction in real-world scenarios, and (3) the limitation to consider periodic behavioral cues, such as rhythmic vocalizations or recurrent gestures, which are crucial for inferring the evolution of dyadic relationships. To address these challenges, we propose AsyReC, a multimodal graph-based framework for asymmetric dyadic relationship classification, with three core innovations: (i) a triplet graph neural network with node-edge dual attention that dynamically weights multimodal cues to capture interaction asymmetries (addressing challenge 1); (ii) a clip-level relationship learning architecture that preserves temporal continuity, enabling fine-grained modeling of real-world interaction dynamics (addressing challenge 2); and (iii) a periodic temporal encoder that projects time indices onto sine/cosine waveforms to model recurrent behavioral patterns (addressing challenge 3). Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, while ablation studies validate the critical role of asymmetric interaction modeling and periodic temporal encoding in improving the robustness of dyadic relationship classification in real-world scenarios. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tw-repository/AsyReC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14778v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Audio-visual speaker tracking has drawn increasing attention over the past few years due to its academic values and wide applications. Audio and visual modalities can provide complementary information for localization and tracking. With audio and visual information, the Bayesian-based filter and deep learning-based methods can solve the problem of data association, audio-visual fusion and track management. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive overview of audio-visual speaker tracking. To our knowledge, this is the first extensive survey over the past five years. We introduce the family of Bayesian filters and summarize the methods for obtaining audio-visual measurements. In addition, the existing trackers and their performance on the AV16.3 dataset are summarized. In the past few years, deep learning techniques have thrived, which also boost the development of audio-visual speaker tracking. The influence of deep learning techniques in terms of measurement extraction and state estimation is also discussed. Finally, we discuss the connections between audio-visual speaker tracking and other areas such as speech separation and distributed speaker tracking.</description>

      <title>Feature Coding in the Era of Large Models: Dataset, Test Conditions, and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large models have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, yet they incur significant computational costs and privacy concerns during both training and inference. Distributed deployment has emerged as a potential solution, but it necessitates the exchange of intermediate information between model segments, with feature representations serving as crucial information carriers. To optimize information exchange, feature coding methods are applied to reduce transmission and storage overhead. Despite its importance, feature coding for large models remains an under-explored area. In this paper, we draw attention to large model feature coding and make three contributions to this field. First, we introduce a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse features generated by three representative types of large models. Second, we establish unified test conditions, enabling standardized evaluation pipelines and fair comparisons across future feature coding studies. Third, we introduce two baseline methods derived from widely used image coding techniques and benchmark their performance on the proposed dataset. These contributions aim to advance the field of feature coding, facilitating more efficient large model deployment.

      <title>Construction of Hyperchaotic Maps Based on 3D-CCC and its Applications in Image Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The security performance of chaos-based image encryption algorithms heavily depends on the complexity of the underlying chaotic system. To enhance encryption effectiveness, it is crucial to design chaotic systems with improved dynamic properties. This paper proposes a novel approach, the 3D Cascaded Cross-Coupling Method (3D-CCC), for constructing 3D hyperchaotic systems by combining three one-dimensional chaotic systems, which can be identical or different. Using this method, we develop a new 3D hyperchaotic map, 3D-ICCCLS, which exhibits superior chaotic characteristics, including good ergodicity, randomness, positive Lyapunov exponents, and high spectral entropy. Furthermore, we introduce a color image encryption algorithm based on 3D-ICCCLS. The proposed scheme treats the three color channels as an integrated unit, employing cross-channel bit mixing followed by simultaneous permutation and diffusion. This approach achieves a strong encryption effect in a single round. Experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm provides a large key space, high key sensitivity, and strong resistance against common attacks,</description>

      <title>Do LLMs Understand Visual Anomalies? Uncovering LLM's Capabilities in Zero-shot Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are markedly proficient in deriving visual representations guided by natural language. Recent explorations have utilized LVLMs to tackle zero-shot visual anomaly detection (VAD) challenges by pairing images with textual descriptions indicative of normal and abnormal conditions, referred to as anomaly prompts. However, existing approaches depend on static anomaly prompts that are prone to cross-semantic ambiguity, and prioritize global image-level representations over crucial local pixel-level image-to-text alignment that is necessary for accurate anomaly localization. In this paper, we present ALFA, a training-free approach designed to address these challenges via a unified model. We propose a run-time prompt adaptation strategy, which first generates informative anomaly prompts to leverage the capabilities of a large language model (LLM). This strategy is enhanced by a contextual scoring mechanism for per-image anomaly prompt adaptation and cross-semantic ambiguity mitigation. We further introduce a novel fine-grained aligner to fuse local pixel-level semantics for precise anomaly localization, by projecting the image-text alignment from global to local semantic spaces. Extensive evaluations on MVTec and VisA datasets confirm ALFA's effectiveness in harnessing the language potential for zero-shot VAD, achieving significant PRO improvements of 12.1% on MVTec and 8.9% on VisA compared to state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Agent Journey Beyond RGB: Unveiling Hybrid Semantic-Spatial Environmental Representations for Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06465v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigating unseen environments based on natural language instructions remains difficult for egocentric agents in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). Existing approaches primarily rely on RGB images for environmental representation, underutilizing latent textual semantic and spatial cues and leaving the modality gap between instructions and scarce environmental representations unresolved. Intuitively, humans inherently ground semantic knowledge within spatial layouts during indoor navigation. Inspired by this, we propose a versatile Semantic Understanding and Spatial Awareness (SUSA) architecture to encourage agents to ground environment from diverse perspectives. SUSA includes a Textual Semantic Understanding (TSU) module, which narrows the modality gap between instructions and environments by generating and associating the descriptions of environmental landmarks in agent's immediate surroundings. Additionally, a Depth-enhanced Spatial Perception (DSP) module incrementally constructs a depth exploration map, enabling a more nuanced comprehension of environmental layouts. Experiments demonstrate that SUSA's hybrid semantic-spatial representations effectively enhance navigation performance, setting new state-of-the-art performance across three VLN benchmarks (REVERIE, R2R, and SOON). The source code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>VidCtx: Context-aware Video Question Answering with Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address computational and memory limitations of Large Multimodal Models in the Video Question-Answering task, several recent methods extract textual representations per frame (e.g., by captioning) and feed them to a Large Language Model (LLM) that processes them to produce the final response. However, in this way, the LLM does not have access to visual information and often has to process repetitive textual descriptions of nearby frames. To address those shortcomings, in this paper, we introduce VidCtx, a novel training-free VideoQA framework which integrates both modalities, i.e. both visual information from input frames and textual descriptions of others frames that give the appropriate context. More specifically, in the proposed framework a pre-trained Large Multimodal Model (LMM) is prompted to extract at regular intervals, question-aware textual descriptions (captions) of video frames. Those will be used as context when the same LMM will be prompted to answer the question at hand given as input a) a certain frame, b) the question and c) the context/caption of an appropriate frame. To avoid redundant information, we chose as context the descriptions of distant frames. Finally, a simple yet effective max pooling mechanism is used to aggregate the frame-level decisions. This methodology enables the model to focus on the relevant segments of the video and scale to a high number of frames. Experiments show that VidCtx achieves competitive performance among approaches that rely on open models on three public Video QA benchmarks, NExT-QA, IntentQA and STAR. Our code is available at https://github.com/IDT-ITI/VidCtx.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Video Scene Graph Generation via Visual and Semantic Dual Debiasing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to capture dynamic relationships among entities by sequentially analyzing video frames and integrating visual and semantic information. However, VidSGG is challenged by significant biases that skew predictions. To mitigate these biases, we propose a VIsual and Semantic Awareness (VISA) framework for unbiased VidSGG. VISA addresses visual bias through memory-enhanced temporal integration that enhances object representations and concurrently reduces semantic bias by iteratively integrating object features with comprehensive semantic information derived from triplet relationships. This visual-semantics dual debiasing approach results in more unbiased representations of complex scene dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where VISA outperforms existing unbiased VidSGG approaches by a substantial margin (e.g., +13.1% improvement in mR@20 and mR@50 for the SGCLS task under Semi Constraint).</description>
