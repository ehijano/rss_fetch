      <title>Modular connectivity in neural networks emerges from Poisson noise-motivated regularisation, and promotes robustness and compositional generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuits in the brain commonly exhibit modular architectures that factorise complex tasks, resulting in the ability to compositionally generalise and reduce catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) appear to mix all processing, because modular solutions are difficult to find as they are vanishing subspaces in the space of possible solutions. Here, we draw inspiration from fault-tolerant computation and the Poisson-like firing of real neurons to show that activity-dependent neural noise, combined with nonlinear neural responses, drives the emergence of solutions that reflect an accurate understanding of modular tasks, corresponding to acquisition of a correct world model. We find that noise-driven modularisation can be recapitulated by a deterministic regulariser that multiplicatively combines weights and activations, revealing rich phenomenology not captured in linear networks or by standard regularisation methods. Though the emergence of modular structure requires sufficiently many training samples (exponential in the number of modular task dimensions), we show that pre-modularised ANNs exhibit superior noise-robustness and the ability to generalise and extrapolate well beyond training data, compared to ANNs without such inductive biases. Together, our work demonstrates a regulariser and architectures that could encourage modularity emergence to yield functional benefits.</description>

      <title>Absement: Quantitative Assessment of Metabolic Cost during Quasi-Isometric Muscle Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate quantitative assessment of metabolic cost during static posture holding is a strategically important problem in biomechanics and physiology. Traditional metrics such as ``time under tension'' are fundamentally insufficient, because they are scalar quantities that ignore the temporal history of deviations, that is, the microdynamics of posture, which has nontrivial energetic consequences. In this work, we propose a theoretically grounded methodology to address this problem by introducing the concept of the \textbf{deviation absement} ($\Delta\mathcal{A}_\ell$), defined as the time integral of the deviation of the muscle--tendon unit length from a reference value.
  We rigorously prove that, for a broad class of quasi-static models, absement appears as the leading first-order state variable. For small deviations in a neighbourhood of a reference posture, the total metabolic cost $\mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{met}}(\ell)$ admits a universal asymptotic expansion of the form \begin{equation*} \mathcal{E}_{\mathrm{met}}(\ell) = P_0 T + C_1 \Delta\mathcal{A}_\ell + C_2 \int_0^T(\ell(t)-\ell_0)^2\,dt + O(\|\ell-\ell_0\|_{L^\infty}^3), \end{equation*} where $T$ is the duration of loading, and $P_0, C_1, C_2$ are constants determined by local properties of the system.
  Thus, the deviation absement ($\Delta\mathcal{A}_\ell$) is the \textbf{unique first-order sufficient statistic} that allows one to quantify and separate the energetic contribution of systematic drift of the mean posture from the contribution of micro-oscillations (tremor), which is described by the quadratic term. This result has direct consequences for parameter identification: the proposed formalism makes it possible to recover physically meaningful coefficients $(P_0, C_1, C_2)$ by means of linear regression of experimental data obtained from standard kinematic measurements and indirect calorimetry.</description>

      <title>Encounter Times of Intermittently Running Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracellular processes often rely on the timely encounter of mobile reaction partners, including intermittently motor-driven organelles. The underlying cytoskeletal network presents a complex landscape that both directs particle movement and introduces quenched disorder through filament organization. We investigate the mean first encounter times for pairs of intermittently processive and diffusive particles, moving in two dimensions with and without a fixed filament network. In unstructured domains, increasing particle run-length enhances exploration of the domain, but tends to slow down the encounter times compared to equivalent diffusing particles. Encounters for long-running particles occur preferentially near the periphery, contrasting with bulk encounters for the purely diffusive case. When particles are unbiased in their runs along dense filament networks, encounters are shown to be well approximated by a continuum run-and-tumble model. For biased particles, regions of convergent filament orientation can serve as traps that slow the overall spatial exploration but can allow for faster encounter rates by funneling particles into regions of reduced dimensionality. These findings provide a framework for estimating intracellular encounter kinetics, highlighting the role of key physical features such as the effective diffusivity, run times, and network architecture.</description>

      <title>Traveling chimeras and collective coordination in beta-cell networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pancreatic $\beta$-cells play a central role in maintaining glucose homeostasis through the pulsatile secretion of insulin. This essential function relies not only on intracellular regulatory mechanisms but also on coordinated interactions among $\beta$-cells within the islets of Langerhans. Disruptions in this intercellular coordination are increasingly implicated in metabolic disorders such as type~I and type~II diabetes. In this work, we employ a computational framework to investigate the collective dynamics of a network of coupled $\beta$-cells interacting through a nonlocally coupled ring topology that incorporates both electrical and metabolic coupling pathways. This topology captures short- and long-range interactions known to shape islet communication. Numerical simulations reveal a variety of emergent behaviors, including synchronization, traveling waves, and traveling chimera states, in which coherent and incoherent domains coexist and propagate across the network. These findings provide new insight into the mechanisms governing coordinated $\beta$-cell activity and the regulation of pulsatile insulin secretion. By clarifying how coupling structure and intercellular communication shape islet-wide dynamics, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the dysfunctions underlying diabetes.</description>

      <title>When many noisy genes optimize information flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It often is emphasized that gene expression is noisy. A seemingly contradictory view is that control mechanisms have been optimized to squeeze as much information as possible out of a limited number of molecules. Here we revisit these issues in a simple model where a single transcription factor (TF) controls a large number of target genes. We include only the physically required noise sources: random arrival of TFs at their targets and counting noise in the synthesis and degradation of mRNA. If the cell has a limited total number of mRNA molecules, then the capacity to transmit information about TF concentration is maximized when these resources are distributed across the largest possible number of target genes. To realize this capacity the distribution of TF concentrations must be biased toward smaller values. Thus, in some limits, information transmission is optimized when individual expression levels are noisy. In addition, the dependence of information transmission on the parameters of this multi-gene system has a "sloppy" spectrum, so that optimal performance can co-exist with substantial variability.</description>

      <title>Error Bound Analysis of Physics-Informed Neural Networks-Driven T2 Quantification in Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are emerging as a promising approach for quantitative parameter estimation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). While existing deep learning methods can provide an accurate quantitative estimation of the T2 parameter, they still require large amounts of training data and lack theoretical support and a recognized gold standard. Thus, given the absence of PINN-based approaches for T2 estimation, we propose embedding the fundamental physics of MRI, the Bloch equation, in the loss of PINN, which is solely based on target scan data and does not require a pre-defined training database. Furthermore, by deriving rigorous upper bounds for both the T2 estimation error and the generalization error of the Bloch equation solution, we establish a theoretical foundation for evaluating the PINN's quantitative accuracy. Even without access to the ground truth or a gold standard, this theory enables us to estimate the error with respect to the real quantitative parameter T2. The accuracy of T2 mapping and the validity of the theoretical analysis are demonstrated on a numerical cardiac model and a water phantom, where our method exhibits excellent quantitative precision in the myocardial T2 range. Clinical applicability is confirmed in 94 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients, achieving low-error quantitative T2 estimation under the theoretical error bound, highlighting the robustness and potential of PINN.</description>

      <title>CTransformer: Deep-transformer-based 3D cell membrane tracking with subcellular-resolved molecular quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning segmentation and fluorescence imaging techniques allow the cellular morphology of living embryos to be constructed spatiotemporally. These development processes involve numerous molecules distributed at the subcellular scale, such as cell adhesion (E-cadherin), which accumulate at cell-cell interfaces to regulate intercellular connection. However, quantifying molecular distributions within specific subcellular regions across the entire embryo, where cell movement and molecular redistribution occur rapidly, is challenging due to the need for simultaneous cell morphology reconstruction and lineage tracing due to photobleaching and phototoxicity. We report a transformer-based pipeline, CTransformer, that establishes a 4D cellular morphology map before the 550-cell (late) stage. CTransformer constructed 4D cellular morphology atlases, reaching 80% accuracy at the 550-cell stage. Through this advanced architecture, we use only one channel to reconstruct cell morphology and achieve cell tracing. With each cell's morphology as a reference, the distribution of specific molecules throughout the cell body and at cell interfaces can be quantitatively measured in another fluorescence channel. We apply this methodology to track E-cadherin during embryonic development of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, from fertilization to gastrulation. Our results reveal that E-cadherin is tightly regulated across individual embryos, both within single cells and at cell-cell interfaces, displaying an anterior-posterior gradient and cell- and lineage-specific patterns. Furthermore, its spatiotemporal heterogeneity influences cell mechanics and embryonic morphogenesis, helping explain how C. elegans achieves stereotypical developmental patterns at cellular resolution.</description>

      <title>A Compact Incubation Platform for Long-Term Cultivation of Biological Samples for Nitrogen-Vacancy Center Widefield Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond provide a versatile quantum sensing platform for biological imaging through magnetic field detection, offering unlimited photostability and the ability to perform long-term observations without photobleaching or phototoxicity. However, conventional stage-top incubators are incompatible with the unique requirements for NV widefield magnetometry to study cellular dynamics. Here, we present a purpose-built compact incubation platform that maintains precise environmental control of temperature, CO$_2$ atmosphere, and humidity while accommodating the complex constraints of NV widefield microscopy. The system employs a 3D-printed biocompatible chamber with integrated heating elements, temperature control, and humidified gas flow to create a stable physiological environment directly on the diamond sensing surface. We demonstrate sustained viability and proliferation of HT29 colorectal cancer cells over 90 hours of continuous incubation, with successful magnetic field imaging of immunomagnetically labeled cells after extended cultivation periods. This incubation platform enables long-term cultivation and real-time monitoring of biological samples on NV widefield magnetometry platforms, opening new possibilities for studying dynamic cellular processes using quantum sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Non-Markovian History Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Markovian stochastic processes are ubiquitous in biology. Nevertheless, we lack a general framework for quantifying historical dependencies. In this Letter, we propose an information-theoretic approach to decompose history dependence in systems with non-Markovian dynamics, quantifying the information encoded in dependencies of each order. In minimal models of non-Markovian dynamics, we show that this framework correctly captures the underlying historical dependencies, even when autocorrelations do not. In prolonged recordings of fly behavior, we find that the scaling of non-Markovian dependencies is invariant across timescales from fractions of a second to minutes. Despite this invariance, the overall amount of non-Markovian information is non-monotonic, suggesting a unique timescale on which historical dependencies are strongest.</description>

      <title>Super-Resolution Posterior Ocular Microvascular Imaging Using 3-D Ultrasound Localization Microscopy With a 32X32 Matrix Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this study is to enable in-vivo three-dimensional (3-D) ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) of posterior ocular microvasculature using a 256-channel system and a 1024-element matrix array, and to overcome limitations of restricted transmit angles, sound speed mismatch caused by the crystalline lens and surrounding tissues, and the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of microbubble signals. To address phase distortions from the crystalline lens, which has a higher speed of sound (SOS) than surrounding tissues, a region-dependent SOS beamforming approach was implemented to improve microbubble resolution. A 4-D non-local means filter was subsequently applied to suppress background noise and enhance microbubble contrast. The proposed method improved localization accuracy and image quality, achieving a spatial resolution of 63 um, while Fourier shell correlation (1/2-bit threshold) confirmed a global resolution of approximately 59 um. Higher mean normalized cross-correlation coefficients between the microbubbles and the system point-spread function, obtained with the proposed method (approximately 0.67), compared with those without the proposed method (approximately 0.60), indicate enhanced microbubble signal quality. Furthermore, the 3-D bi-directional vessel density and flow-velocity maps were reconstructed, capturing detailed choroidal vascular and hemodynamic patterns. These results demonstrate that region-dependent SOS beamforming combined with spatiotemporal denoising enables high-resolution posterior ocular ULM and provides a practical pathway toward quantitative 3-D assessment of retinal and choroidal microvasculature for potential clinical use.</description>

      <title>Measurement of tissue viscosity to relate force and motion in collective cell migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In tissue development, wound healing, and cancer invasion, coordinated cell motion arises from active forces produced by the cells. The relationship between force and motion remains unclear, however, because the forces result from a sum of contributions from activity and the constitutive response of the cell collective. Here, we develop a method to decouple the forces due to activity from those due to constitutive response. As a model of an epithelial tissue, we use a monolayer of epithelial cells in the fluid state, for which the constitutive behavior is that of a viscous fluid. By careful study of the distribution of the ratio between shear stress and strain rate, we show that the order of magnitude of viscosity within the epithelial tissue is 100 Pa-hr and that increasing (decreasing) the actomyosin cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesions increase (decrease) the magnitude of tissue viscosity. These results establish tissue viscosity as a meaningful way to describe the mechanical behavior of epithelial tissues, and demonstrate a direct relationship between tissue microstructure and material properties. By providing the first experimental measurement of tissue viscosity, our study is a step toward separating the active and constitutive components of stress, in turn clarifying the relationship between force and motion and providing a new means of identifying how active cell forces evolve in space and time.</description>

      <title>Adsorption Barrier Limits the Ice Inhibition Activity of Glycan-Rich Antifreeze Glycoproteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) are among the most potent ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) agents, yet the molecular basis for their counterintuitive decline in activity with increasing glycosylated threonine (T*) content remains unresolved. Through molecular dynamics simulations of model glycoproteins with increasing T* content, we show that potent IRI activity arises not only from the thermodynamic stability of strong ice-binding states, but also from their kinetic accessibility. Specifically, the free energy barrier for forming strong ice-binding states from the unbound state constitutes a critical kinetic bottleneck. Increasing T* content enhances the overall hydration capacity due to the additional glycan moieties, thereby imposing a greater desolvation penalty and elevating the adsorption barrier. This kinetic limitation, rather than the absence of strong ice-binding states, accounts for the experimentally observed decline in IRI activity. To quantify the structural basis of this behavior, we introduce a facial amphiphilicity index that integrates both spatial segregation and compositional ratio of hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues, and show that it correlates well with IRI activity. These findings highlight that facial amphiphilicity mediates a critical balance between binding stability and kinetic accessibility, providing a rational design principle for advanced IRI materials.</description>
