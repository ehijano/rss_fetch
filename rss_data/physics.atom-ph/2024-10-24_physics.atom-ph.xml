      <title>Generation of non-classical and entangled light states using intense laser-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-classical and entangled light states are of fundamental interest in quantum mechanics and they are a powerful tool for the emergence of new quantum technologies. The development of methods that can lead to the generation of such light states is therefore of high importance. Recently, we have demonstrated that intense laser-matter interactions can serve towards this direction. Specifically, we have shown how the use of fully quantized approaches in intense laser-matter interactions and the process of high harmonic generation, can lead to the generation high photon-number non-classical (optical Schr\"{o}dinger's "cat" or squeezed) and entangled states from the far-infrared (IR) to the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV). Here, after a brief introduction on the fundamentals, we summarize the operation principles of these approaches and we discuss the future directions of non-classical light engineering using strong laser fields, and the potential applications in ultrafast and quantum information science. Our findings open the way to a novel quantum nonlinear spectroscopy method, based on the interplay between the quantum properties of light with that of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Universal Gate Set for Optical Lattice Based Atom Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for atom interferometry and demonstrate that there exists a universal set of atom optic components for inertial sensing. These components constitute gates with which we carry out quantum operations and represent input-output matterwave transformations between lattice eigenstates. Each gate is associated with a modulation pattern of the position of the optical lattice according to machine-designed protocols. In this methodology, a sensor can be reprogrammed to respond to an evolving set of design priorities without modifying the hardware. We assert that such a gate set is metrologically universal, in analogy to universal gate sets for quantum computing. Experimental confirmation of the designed operation is demonstrated via in situ imaging of the spatial evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice, and by measurement of the momentum probabilities following time-of-flight expansion. The representation of several basic quantum sensing circuits is presented for the measurement of inertial forces, rotating reference frames, and gravity gradients.</description>

      <title>Remote Detection Optical Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensitive magnetometers have been applied in a wide range of research fields, including geophysical exploration, bio-magnetic field detection, ultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance, etc. Commonly, magnetometers are directly placed at the position where the magnetic field is to be measured. However, in some situations, for example in near space or harsh environments, near nuclear reactors or particle accelerators, it is hard to place a magnetometer directly there. If the magnetic field can be detected remotely, i.e., via stand-off detection, this problem can be solved. As optical magnetometers are based on optical readout, they are naturally promising for stand-off detection. We review various approaches to optical stand-off magnetometry proposed and developed over the years, culminating in recent results on measuring magnetic fields in the mesosphere using laser guide stars, magnetometry with mirrorless-lasing readout, and proposals for satellite-assisted interrogation of atmospheric sodium.</description>

      <title>Ultratight confinement of atoms in a Rydberg empowered optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical lattices serve as fundamental building blocks for atomic quantum technology. However, the scale and resolution of these lattices are diffraction-limited to the light wavelength. In conventional lattices, achieving tight confinement of single sites requires high laser intensity, which unfortunately leads to reduced coherence due to increased scattering. This article presents a novel approach for creating an atomic optical lattice with a sub-wavelength spatial structure. The potential is generated by leveraging the nonlinear optical response of three-level Rydberg-dressed atoms, which allows us to overcome the diffraction limit of the driving fields. The resulting lattice comprises a three-dimensional array of ultra-narrow Lorentzian wells over nanometer scales. These unprecedented scales can now be accessed through a hybrid scheme that combines the dipolar interaction and optical twist of atomic eigenstates. The interaction-induced two-body resonance that forms the trapping potential, only occurs at a peculiar laser intensity, localizing the trap sites to ultra-narrow regions over the standing-wave driving field. The feasibility study shows that single-atom confinement in Lorentzian sites with 3nm width, and 37MHz depth are realizable with available lasers. The development of these ultra-narrow trapping techniques holds great promise for applications such as Rydberg-Fermi gates, atomtronics, quantum walks, Hubbard models, and neutral-atom quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>SU(N) magnetism with ultracold molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry are paradigmatic settings for quantum many-body physics. They have been studied for the insights they provide into complex materials and their ability to stabilize exotic ground states. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms were predicted to exhibit SU($N$) symmetry for $N=2I+1=1,2,\ldots,10$, where $I$ is the nuclear spin. Subsequent experiments have revealed rich many-body physics. However, alkaline-earth atoms realize this symmetry only for fermions with repulsive interactions. In this paper, we predict that ultracold molecules shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields or microwaves exhibit SU($N$) symmetry, which holds because deviations of the s-wave scattering length from the spin-free values are only about 3\% for CaF with static-field shielding and are estimated to be even smaller for bialkali molecules. They open the door to $N$ as large as $32$ for bosons and $36$ for fermions. They offer important features unachievable with atoms, including bosonic systems and attractive interactions.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the Migdal transition probabilities in electron-atom inelastic cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Migdal transition probabilities for dark matter scattering are compared to the total single-electron inelastic cross sections of electron-atom scattering for isolated Ar and Xe. The comparison is done by expressing the electron-atom scattering cross section by connecting the Migdal probability. The resultant errors are around $20 \ \%$ for Ar but can be factors for Xe in $\sim$ 1 keV of incoming electron energy. The calculation is also compared with the cases of Coulomb potential and screened Coulomb potential.</description>
