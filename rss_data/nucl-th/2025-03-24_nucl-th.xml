      <title>Decays of $N^*$ and $\Delta^*$ resonances into $N\rho$, $\Delta\pi$, and $N\sigma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decays of $N^*$ and $\Delta^*$ resonances into $N\rho$, $\Delta\pi$ and $N\sigma$ final states are studied in a coupled-channel analysis of data on pion- and photo-induced reactions. Improvements in the fit were observed when new resonance contributions were introduced. Frequencies for the intermediate isobars $\Delta(1232)\pi$, $N\rho$, $N\sigma$ are reported.</description>

      <title>Bayesian reconstruction of anisotropic flow fluctuations at fixed impact parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cumulants of the distribution of anisotropic flow are measured accurately in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC as a function of centrality classifiers (charged multiplicity and/or transverse energy). Using Bayesian inference, we reconstruct from these measurements the probability distribution of anisotropic flow in the ``theorists' frame'' where the impact parameter has a fixed magnitude and orientation, up to $\sim 70\%$ centrality. The variation of flow fluctuations with impact parameter displays direct evidence of viscous damping, which is larger for higher Fourier harmonics, in line with expectations from hydrodynamics. We use intensive measures of non-Gaussian flow fluctuations, which have reduced dependence on centrality. We infer from ATLAS data the magnitude of these intensive non-Gaussianities in each Fourier harmonic. They provide data-driven estimates of response coefficients to initial anisotropies, without resorting to any specific microscopic model of initial conditions. These estimates agree with viscous hydrodynamic calculations.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Effects on Nuclear Short Range Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal nuclear many-body effects on short range correlations by {\it ab initio} no-core shell model calculations of the scaling factor $a_2$. The factor $a_2$ characterizes the abundance of SRC pairs and is linearly related to the EMC effect. By calculating $a_2$ in light nuclei using the chiral N$^4$LO nuclear force, including the ground state and excited states, and isobaric analog states in neighboring nuclei, we find that $a_2$ is close in isobaric analog states, while it varies in excited or isomeric states. This is explained as specific nuclear states suppress the formation of deuteron-like component, impacting elaborate understandings of SRC pairs in exotic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Dipole Polarizability of Finite Nuclei as a Probe of Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear ground state and collective excitation properties provide a means to probe the nuclear matter equation of state and establish connections between observables in finite nuclei and neutron stars. Specifically, the electric dipole polarizability, measured with high precision in various neutron-rich nuclei, serves as a robust constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In this Letter, we employ a class of relativistic energy density functionals in a twofold process: first, to link the electric dipole polarizability from recent experiments to the slope of the symmetry energy, and second, to translate this information into constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, in connection with multimessenger astrophysical observations from pulsars and binary neutron stars. We provide compelling evidence that the electric dipole polarizability represents a key nuclear observable to probe the neutron star properties. By significantly reducing the uncertainties in the mass-radius plane, our findings also align with recent multimessenger observations.</description>

      <title>$\beta$-Decay Properties of Neutron-rich Yttrium Isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we have reported key nuclear properties of weak $\beta$-decay processes on Yttrium isotopes for the mass number range $A = 101 - 108$. This mass region is important in astrophysical $r$-process abundances. Our study might be helpful in $r$-process simulations. We have computed charge-changing strength distributions, $\beta$-decay half-lives, $\beta$-delayed neutron emission probabilities, and $\beta^{-}$ (EC) weak rates under stellar conditions. We have performed microscopic calculations based on deformed proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA) over a wide temperature ($10^7 - 3 \times 10^{10}$) K and density ($10 - 10^{11}$) g/cm$^3$ domain. Unique first-forbidden (U1F) transitions have been included in the calculations in addition to the allowed transitions. A significant decrease in calculated half-lives in certain cases, e.g., in $^{107}$Y ($^{108}$Y) by about 67\% (42\%), has been observed because of the contribution from U1F transitions. We have compared present results with measured and theoretical works. A good agreement of our half-lives with experimental data is observed.</description>

      <title>Investigation of pairing correlations on computed Gamow-Teller strength distributions and associated $\beta$-decay half-lives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of pairing correlations on the computed Gamow-Teller (GT) strength distributions and corresponding $\beta$-decay half-lives. The calculations are performed for a total of 47 sd-shell nuclei, for $20 &lt; A &lt; 30$, employing the pn-QRPA model. Our calculations use three different values of pairing gaps computed using three different empirical formulae. The GT strength distribution and centroid values change considerably with a change in the pairing gap values. This, in turn, leads to differences in computed half-lives. The pairing gaps computed using the mass-dependent formula result in the calculated half-lives being in better agreement with the measured data.</description>

      <title>Effect of nuclear deformation on Gamow-Teller strength distributions of Hg isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies \cite{1,2} predicted the sensitivity of the Gamow-Teller (GT) strength distributions to nuclear deformation in neutron-deficient Hg isotopes. Motivated by this work, we investigate nuclear ground-state properties and GT strength distributions for neutron-deficient Hg isotopes ($^{177\hbox{-}193}$Hg).
  The nuclear deformation ($\beta(E2)$) values were calculated using the **Relativistic Mean Field (RMF)** model. The RMF approach, with different density-dependent interactions (**DD-ME2** and **DD-PC1**), was employed to compute nuclear shape parameters. These computed deformation values were then used within the framework of the **deformed proton-neutron quasi-particle random phase approximation (pn-QRPA)** model, with a separable interaction, to calculate the allowed GT strength distributions for these Hg isotopes.
  Our calculations validate the findings of \cite{1} and confirm the effect of deformation on GT strength distributions. This study may further provide a complementary signature for nuclear shape isomers. Noticeable differences are highlighted between our results and previous calculations. The study of \cite{1} suggests that $^{177\hbox{-}182}$Hg possess prolate shapes, while $^{184\hbox{-}196}$Hg exhibit oblate shapes. In contrast, our calculations predict **prolate** shapes for $^{177\hbox{-}188}$Hg and **oblate** shapes for $^{189\hbox{-}193}$Hg isotopes.</description>

      <title>Linear sigma model with quarks and Polyakov loop in rotation: phase diagrams, Tolman-Ehrenfest law and mechanical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of rotation on the confining and chiral properties of QCD using the Polyakov-enhanced linear sigma model coupled to quarks. Working in the homogeneous approximation, we obtain the phase diagram at finite temperature, baryon density and angular frequency, taking into account the causality constraint enforced by the spectral boundary conditions at a cylindrical surface. We explicitly address various limits with respect to system size, angular frequency and chemical potential. We demonstrate that, in this model, the critical temperatures of both transitions diminish in response to the increasing rotation, being in contradiction with the first-principle lattice results. In the limit of large volume, the thermodynamics of the model is consistent with the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also compute the mechanical characteristics of rotating plasma such as the moment of inertia and the $K_4$ shape coefficient.</description>

      <title>Virtual Majorana Neutrinos and the Minimum Neutrino Mass Scale in Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual Majorana neutrinos are indispensable for neutrinoless double-beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay. In this study, we demonstrate that the overlap of the virtual Majorana neutrino wavefunction, predominantly composed of a right-handed antineutrino component with a strongly suppressed left-handed component (with amplitude proportional to the effective Majorana neutrino mass, $|m_{\beta\beta}|$, is crucial for triggering this decay process. This effective mass, derived from the minimum neutrino mass, offers valuable insights into the absolute neutrino mass scale. Using best-fit parameters from neutrino oscillation experiments, the minimum neutrino mass is determined from the sum of the three neutrino mass eigenstates, $\Sigma = m_1 + m_2 + m_3,$ which is represented by two narrow bands centered at approximately 0.06 eV/c$^2$ for the normal hierarchy (NH) and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for the inverted hierarchy (IH). Under these constraints, the minimum neutrino mass is found to be 0.001186 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.002646 eV/c$^2$ for IH, thereby establishing a potential absolute neutrino mass scale for both scenarios. From these values, we calculate $|m_{\beta\beta}|$, which plays a central role in $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. By combining $|m_{\beta\beta}|$ with decay phase-space factors, nuclear matrix elements, and the absorption probability of the virtual Majorana neutrino, we estimate the $0\nu\beta\beta$ half-life for key isotopes, namely, $^{76}$Ge, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe, using two independent methods. The results are in good agreement, and we also discuss the uncertainties in the nuclear matrix elements that may affect these calculations.</description>

      <title>Shear and bulk viscous coefficients of a hot and chirally imbalanced quark matter using NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shear $\eta$ and bulk $\zeta$ viscous coefficients have been calculated in a hot and chirally asymmetric quark matter quantified in terms of a chiral chemical potential (CCP) using the two-flavor Nambu-Jona--Lasinio (NJL) model. This is done by employing the one-loop Green-Kubo formalism where the viscous coefficients have been extracted from the long-wavelength limit of the in-medium spectral function corresponding to the energy momentum tensor (EMT) current correlator calculated using the real time formalism of finite temperature field theory. The momentum dependent thermal width of the quark/antiquark that enters into the expression of the viscosities as a dynamical input containing interactions, has been obtained from the $2\to2$ scattering processes mediated via the collective mesonic modes in scalar and pseudoscalar chanels encoded in respective in-medium polarization functions having explicit temperature and CCP dependence. Several thermodynamic quantities such as pressure, energy density, entropy density $(s)$, specific heat and isentropic speed of sound have also been calculated at finite CCP. The temperature and CCP dependence of the viscosity to entropy density ratios $\eta/s$ and $\zeta/s$ have also been studied.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flows of identified hadrons in the equal-velocity quark combination model at RHIC energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ an equal-velocity quark combination model to study anisotropic flows $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC energies. Under the equal-velocity combination mechanism of constituent quarks at hadronization, we build analytical formulas of anisotropic flows of hadrons in terms of those of quarks just before hadronization. We systematically analyze the contribution of higher order flows of quarks, and show how simple formulas of $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons with the desired precision can be obtained by neglecting the small contribution of higher order flows of quarks. We systematically test these simple formulas of hadronic flows by the experimental data of $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons $\phi$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi^{-}$, $\Omega^{-}$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, $\bar{\Xi}^{+}$, $\bar{\Omega}^{+}$, $p$ and $\bar{p}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 19.6, 54.4 and 200 GeV, and we find that the equal-velocity quark combination model can well describe the measured $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons in Au+Au collisions at those collision energies. We further study the obtained anisotropic flows of quarks and find two scaling properties\textcolor{red}{{} }which can be qualitatively understood by the hydrodynamic evolution of thermal quark medium produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Glueballonia as Hopfions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We work out the Hopfion description of glueballs by inclusively comparing the energy spectra obtained by quantizing Hopfions with experimental data and lattice QCD. Identifying a Hopfion carrying a unit topological charge as $f_0(1500)$, the Hopfions with the topological charge two are classified as glueballonia, i.e., two glueballs are bound together. We find a tightly and a loosely bound glueballonia complying with $f_0 (2470)$ and a novel scalar particle carrying the mass around 2814 MeV, respectively, and calculate their binding energies. By the rigid body quantization of Hopfions, we predict a characteristic multiplet structure of tensor glueball states. Some of them are missing in the current experimental data and can be verified in future measurements.</description>

      <title>Investigation of $\Delta(1232)$ resonance substructure in $p\gamma^*\to \Delta(1232)$ process through helicity amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the substructure of the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance in the $p\gamma^*\to \Delta(1232)$ process through helicity transition amplitudes within the quark model framework. We consider the involved baryons composed of three quarks, and both the quark core and meson cloud contribute to the transition amplitudes. The comparison of theoretical results with experimental data reveals that, rather than the $L=0$ component of the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance, it is the $L=2$ component that significantly affects its $S_{1/2}$ amplitude. These findings indicate that the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance likely contains a substantial $L=2$ component, challenging the conventional view of the $\Delta(1232)$ resonance as an $L=0$ baryon.</description>

      <title>QCD Phase Diagram for Large $N_f$ : Analysis from Contact Interaction Effective Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the impact of a higher number of light quark flavors, $N_f$, on the QCD phase diagram under extreme conditions. Our formalism is based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation, employing a specific symmetry-preserving vector-vector flavor-dressed contact interaction model of quarks in Landau gauge, utilizing the rainbow-Ladder truncation. We derive expressions for the dressed quark mass $M_f$ and effective potential $\Omega^{f}$ at zero, at finite temperature $T$ and the quark chemical potential $\mu$. The transition between chiral symmetry breaking and restoration is triggered by the effective potential of the contact interaction, whereas the confinement and deconfinement transition is approximated from the confinement length scale $\tilde{\tau}_{ir}$. Our analysis reveals that at $(T = \mu = 0)$, increasing $N_f$ leads to the restoration of chiral symmetry and the deconfinement of quarks when $N_f$ reaches its critical value, $N^{c}_{f} \approx 8$. At this critical value, In the chiral limit ($m_f = 0$), the global minimum of the effective potential occurs at the point where the dressed quark mass approaches zero ($M_f \rightarrow 0$). However, when a bare quark mass of $m_f = 7$ MeV is introduced, the global minimum shifts slightly to a nonzero value, approaching $M_f \rightarrow m_f$. At finite $T$ and $\mu$, we illustrate the QCD phase diagram in the $(T^{\chi,C}_{c} -\mu)$ plane, for various numbers of light quark flavors, noting that both the critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical chemical potential $\mu_c $ for chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement decrease as $ N_f $ increases. Moreover, the critical endpoint $(T_{EP}, \mu_{EP})$ also shifts to lower values with increasing $N_f $. Our findings are consistent with other low-energy QCD approaches.</description>

      <title>On the extraction of fission mode properties from fragment mass distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Fission modes are typically characterised by fragment mass and total kinetic energy centroids, around which a distribution of these variables is observed. These distributions are usually fitted with Gaussian functions.
  Purpose: To investigate how the properties of these ``Gaussian fission modes'' compare with underlying ``theoretical fission modes'' defined from the potential energy surface of the fissioning nuclei.
  Methods: A simple approach, inspired by the scission point model, is introduced to investigate the impact of anharmonicity of the potential along the scission line on Gaussian mode properties. This approach is also used to evaluated an ``effective potential'' from the yields.
  Results: Several Gaussian functions are usually required to fit yields from non-harmonic potentials associated with a unique theoretical mode. Similarly, ``effective fission modes'', defined from the wells of the effective potentials, are sometime very different to the Gaussian modes. For instance, the S1 and S2 Brosa modes contribute to the same effective potential well at scission.
  Conclusions: Gaussian fits are useful to identify the role of shell effects in fission. However, comparisons with theoretical potential energy surfaces are better carried with effective potentials extracted from the yields, assuming that a broad range of excitation energies is available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first direct ab-initio computation of unequal-time correlation functions in non-Abelian lattice gauge theory. We demonstrate non-trivial consistency relations among correlators, time-translation invariance, and agreement with Monte-Carlo results for thermal equilibrium in 3+1 dimensions by employing our stabilized complex Langevin method. Our work sets the stage to extract real-time observables, relevant to quark-gluon plasma physics within a first-principles real-time framework.</description>

      <title>Signature of hadron-quark crossover in binary-neutron-star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study observational signatures of the hadron-quark crossover in binary-neutron-star mergers by numerical-relativity simulations with various mass configurations. We employ two equations of state (EoSs) for matter consistent with inference from the observational data. In the crossover scenario the EoS is softened in a density realized in binary-neutron-star mergers and is smoothly continued to quark matter. In the phase transition scenario without crossover, the EoS remains stiff and a first-order phase transition takes place in a density out of reach of mergers. A GW170817-like system forms a remnant massive neutron star in both scenarios, and it collapses into a black hole only in the crossover scenario due to the softening while gravitational-wave emission is strong. This difference is clearly reflected in the sudden shutdown of gravitational waves. For a given EoS, the lifetime of the merger remnant is determined primarily by the total mass of the system. Identifying these features in a variety of future events with the next generation of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors will enable us to clarify details of hadron-quark transition. The mass of the accretion disk surrounding the remnant black hole is affected not only by the lifetime of the remnant but also by the mass ratio of the system. Electromagnetic emission associated with the disk outflow will also be useful for detailed investigation of the hadron-quark transition.</description>

      <title>Two-pion exchange for coupled-channel scattering of two heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To improve the theoretical understanding of multiquark states like $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$, we calculate the heavy-meson heavy-(anti)meson scattering potential up to next-to-leading order, $O(Q^2)$, within chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) employing a power counting scheme that explicitly keeps track with the large momentum scale $Q \sim \sqrt{2\mu \delta}$ (where $\delta = m_V - m_P$ is the vector-pseudoscalar mass difference and $\mu$ their reduced mass) introduced by the coupled channel dynamics. We provide expressions for the two-pion exchange (TPE) terms up to $O(Q^2)$ and their partial-wave decomposition. We show that these potentials are well-approximated by contact terms at $O(Q^2)$, with minor residual non-analytic TPE contributions, supporting $\chi$EFT convergence in the theoretical predictions for $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$, as well as their spin partners. These findings are also relevant for $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}$ scattering, especially for the $T_{cc}$ state, for both physical and lattice QCD data with moderately larger pion masses. We further demonstrate that the differences between isovector and isoscalar potentials for heavy mesons are naturally explained by the TPE contributions.</description>

      <title>Chiral Representation of the Nucleon Mass at Leading Two-loop Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the nucleon mass in a manifestly relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory up to the leading two-loop order. Through dimensional counting analysis, we perform the chiral expansion and verify the validity of the extended-on-mass-shell scheme at the two-loop level. As a result, we obtain the complete chiral representation of the nucleon mass up to $\mathcal{O}(p^5)$, which preserves the original analytic properties and satisfies the correct power counting. The obtained chiral result is well-suited for chiral extrapolation and provides an excellent description of lattice QCD data across a broad range of pion masses. We find that the $\mathcal{O}(p^5)$ contribution is small, approximately $10$ MeV, and varies only mildly with increasing pion mass, demonstrating good convergence of the nucleon mass up to pion masses of about 350 MeV at two-loop order.</description>

      <title>NuPECC Long Range Plan 2024 for European Nuclear Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nuclear Physics European Collaboration Committee ( NuPECC, http://nupecc.org/ ) hosted by the European Science Foundation represents today a large nuclear physics community from 23 countries, 3 ESFRI (European Strategy Forum for Research Infrastructures) nuclear physics infrastructures and ECT* (European Centre for Theoretical Studies in Nuclear Physics and Related Areas), as well as from 4 associated members and 10 observers.
  As stated in the NuPECC Terms of Reference one of the major objectives of the Committee is: "on a regular basis, the Committee shall organise a consultation of the community leading to the definition and publication of a Long Range Plan (LRP) of European nuclear physics". To this end, NuPECC has in the past produced five LRPs: in November 1991, December 1997, April 2004, December 2010, and November 2017.
  The LRP, being the unique document covering the whole nuclear physics landscape in Europe, identifies opportunities and priorities for nuclear science in Europe and provides national funding agencies, ESFRI, and the European Commission with a framework for coordinated advances in nuclear science. It serves also as a reference document for the strategic plans for nuclear physics in the European countries.</description>
