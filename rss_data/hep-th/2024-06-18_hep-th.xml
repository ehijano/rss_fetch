      <title>Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity: unifying the strong CP and hierarchy puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the minimal Weyl-invariant Einstein-Cartan gravity in combination with the Standard Model of particle physics contains just one extra scalar degree of freedom (in addition to the graviton and the Standard Model fields) with the properties of an axion-like particle which can solve the strong CP-problem. The smallness of this particle's mass as well as of the cosmological constant is ensured by tiny values of the gauge coupling constants of the local Lorentz group. The tree value of the Higgs boson mass and that of Majorana leptons (if added to the Standard Model to solve the neutrino mass, baryogenesis and dark matter problems) are very small or vanishing, opening the possibility of their computability in terms of the fundamental parameters of the theory due to nonperturbative effects.</description>

      <title>Gauging C on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss general aspects of charge conjugation symmetry in Euclidean lattice field theories, including its dynamical gauging. Our main focus is $O(2) = U(1)\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2 $ gauge theory, which we construct using a non-abelian generalization of the Villain formulation via gauging the charge conjugation symmetry of pure $U(1)$ gauge theory. We describe how to construct gauge-invariant non-local operators in a theory with gauged charge conjugation symmetry, and use it to define Wilson and 't Hooft lines as well as non-invertible symmetry operators. Our lattice discretization preserves the higher-group and non-invertible symmetries of $O(2)$ gauge theory, which we explore in detail. In particular, these symmetries give rise to selection rules for extended operators and their junctions, and constrain the properties of the worldvolume degrees of freedom on twist vortices (also known as Alice or Cheshire strings). We propose a phase diagram of the theory coupled to dynamical magnetic monopoles and twist vortices, where the various generalized symmetries are typically only emergent.</description>

      <title>Exploring $G$-ality defects in 2-dim QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion category symmetry $\text{TY}(\mathbb{A},\chi,\epsilon)$ describes the enhanced non-invertible self-duality symmetry of a $2$-dim QFT under gauging a finite Abelian group $\mathbb{A}$. We generalize the enhanced non-invertible symmetries by considering twisted gauging which allows stacking $\mathbb{A}$-SPT before and after the gauging. Such non-invertible symmetries correspond to invertible anyon permutation symmetries of the $3$-dim SymTFT. Consider a finite group $G$ formed by (un)twisted gaugings of $\mathbb{A}$, a $2$-dim QFT invariant under topological manipulations in $G$ admits non-invertible $\textit{$G$-ality defects}$. We study the classification and the physical implication of the $G$-ality defects using SymTFT and the group-theoretical fusion categories, with three concrete examples. 1) Triality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$ where $N$ is coprime with $3$. The classification is acquired previously by Jordan and Larson where the data is similar to the $\text{TY}$ fusion categories, and we determine the anomaly of these fusion categories. 2) $p$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p$ where $p$ is an odd prime. We consider two such categories $\mathcal{P}_{\pm,m}$ which are distinguished by different choices of the symmetry fractionalization, a new data that does not appear in the TY classification, and show that they have distinct anomaly structures and spin selection rules. 3) $S_3$-ality with $\mathbb{A} = \mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_N$. We study their classification explicitly for $N &lt; 20$ via SymTFT, and provide a group-theoretical construction for certain $N$. We find $N=5$ is the minimal $N$ to admit an $S_3$-ality and $N=11$ is the minimal $N$ to admit a group-theoretical $S_3$-ality.</description>

      <title>The modulated soliton fields in the Goldstone boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that massless Goldstone bosons have not yet been observed. In the Goldstone boson model, after the spontaneous symmetry breaking under $U(1)$, two coupled nonlinear equations are obtained for which we present the exact solitonic solutions. These solutions completely localize the energy density of the model and show the existence of two boson fields, one massive and the other massless. Also, it is seen that the solitonic waves are modulated and the massless wave rides on the massive wave. Finally, we calculate the charge density of the model, which again confirms the neutrality of these boson fields. Since massive bosons can be observed in the laboratory, these solitonic waves may be useful in tracking and detecting Goldstone bosons.</description>

      <title>Conformal `anomalies' and renormalized stress-tensor correlators for non-conformal theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the proposal of defining the Weyl anomaly for classically non-conformal theories as $g^{mn} \langle T_{mn}\rangle - \langle g^{mn} T_{mn} \rangle$, originally put forward by M. Duff, in the case of a scalar field with quartic self-interaction in 4d. We work in the context of dimensional regularization in curved background to two-loops (first order in the coupling). We review the original regularized but not renormalized prescription and its ambiguities; we argue that it cannot be extended to the interacting theory as it fails to provide a finite result. We then propose an alternative prescription via renormalized expectation values. At one-loop our candidate reproduces the local heat kernel result, while its extension to interacting theories contains non-local contributions.</description>

      <title>Heat Equation from Exact Renormalization Group Equation (ERGE) at Local Potential Approximation (LPA)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By simply applying the Local Potential Approximation (LPA) on the Polchinski's Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) flow equation for single Bosonic and spinless Fermionic fields, and initially considering only the coarse-graining (blocking) aspect of Wilson's Renormalization Group program. Within the LPA limit the Polchinski's ERG flow equation simplifies into a heat differential equation for both Bosonic and Fermionic fields. Solving the differential equations leads to logarithmic interactions (logarithmic vertex function) in both Bosonic and Fermionic fields at their fixed points.</description>

      <title>Quantum Kerr Black Hole from Matrix Theory of Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a quantum mechanical theory of quantum spaces described by a large $N$ non-commutative coordinates is proposed as a theory for quantum gravity [1]. In this paper, we construct Kerr black hole as a rotating noncommutative geometry solution of this theory. Due to rotation, the fuzzy sphere is deformed into a fuzzy ellipsoid, which matches exactly the outer horizon of the Kerr black hole in the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. Together with a half-filled Fermi sea, the fuzzy solution reproduces the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy as well as the mass of the Kerr black hole. These results provide further support that the proposed theory of quantum spaces is a plausible candidate for the theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Structure of Massive Gauge/Gravity Scattering Amplitudes, Equivalence Theorems, and Extended Double-Copy with Compactified Warped Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of scattering amplitudes of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in the compactified 5-dimensional warped gauge and gravity theories. We present systematic formulations of the gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence theorem (GRET) for warped KK theories in $R_\xi^{}$ gauge, where the GAET connects the scattering amplitudes of longitudinal KK gauge bosons to that of the corresponding KK Goldstone bosons and the GRET connects the scattering amplitudes of KK gravitons of helicity-zero (helicity-one) to that of the corresponding gravitational KK Goldstone bosons. We analyze the structure of 3-point and 4-point scattering amplitudes of massive KK gauge bosons and of massive KK gravitons as well as their corresponding Goldstone bosons. We first prove the GAET and GRET explicitly for the fundamental 3-point KK gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes. We then demonstrate that the validity of the GAET and GRET for 4-point gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes can be reduced to the validity of GAET and GRET for 3-point gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes at tree level. With these, we study the double-copy construction of KK scattering amplitudes in the warped gauge/gravity theories. We newly realize the double-copy for massive 3-point full gauge/gravity amplitudes at tree level under proper correspondences of color-kinematics and of gauge/gravity couplings, whereas we can construct the double-copy for 4-point KK gauge/gravity amplitudes to the leading order (LO) of high energy expansion. We also conjecture that this LO double-copy construction can be extended to $N$-point scattering amplitudes with $N\!\geqslant\!5$.</description>

      <title>QCD Phase Diagram at finite Magnetic Field and Chemical Potential: A Holographic Approach Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By leveraging neural networks, we address the inverse problem of constructing a quantitative 2+1-flavor holographic QCD model based on state-of-the-art lattice QCD data. Our model demonstrates quantitative agreement with the latest lattice QCD results. We construct the full phase diagram at finite magnetic field $B$, baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ and temperature $T$. We uncover rich phase structure with a first-order phase transition surface and a critical endpoint line within the 3-dimensional phase diagram. The critical endpoint at vanishing chemical potential aligns with current speculations in the lattice QCD literature. In particular, for large magnetic field, we find two critical endpoints in the $T$-$\mu_B$ plane. The critical exponents of the critical endpoints adhere to scaling relations and depend on the background magnetic field. Moreover, they are exhibit deviations from mean-field theory, highlighting the distinctive features of our holographic approach.</description>

      <title>Every Poincar\'e gauge theory is conformal: a compelling case for dynamical vector torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Poincar\'e gauge theory (PGT) of gravity provides a viable formulation of general relativity (Einstein-Cartan theory), and a popular model-building framework for modified gravity with torsion. Notoriously, however, the PGT terms which propagate vector torsion lead to strongly-coupled ghosts: the modern view is that only scalar torsion can propagate. To fix this, we revisit the concept of embedding explicit mass scales in scale-invariant theories, showing how the Klein-Gordon theory naturally leads to a slowly-rolling inflaton. We then show that the unique scale-invariant embedding of PGT leads to two new terms, one of which is the Maxwell term for vector torsion. We provide the full spectrum of quantum particles in the resulting theory. Our result means that every PGT is conformal and - after a two-decade hiatus - vector torsion is back on the menu.</description>

      <title>Generalized entropy of photons in AdS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyzes the quantum corrections to holographic entanglement entropy at first subleading order in $G_{N}$ due to photon excited states in AdS. We compute the vacuum-subtracted von Neumann entropy of a $U(1)$ current excited state for a polar cap region on the cylinder in any large-$N$, strongly-coupled CFT$_{d}$ holographically dual to weakly-coupled Einstein gravity for any dimension $d&gt;2$. We then quantize a Maxwell field in AdS$_{d+1}$ dual to the $U(1)$ current and consider a photon excited state whose vacuum-subtracted generalized entropy for the entanglement wedge is calculated. In order to factorise the Maxwell Hilbert space in AdS, we construct an extended Hilbert space and the corresponding electromagnetic edge modes. We find exact agreement between the CFT entanglement entropy and AdS generalized entropy without the inclusion of entropy of the edge modes. Finally, we show via explicit calculation that the contribution to the vacuum-subtracted von Neumann entropy from electromagnetic edge modes indeed vanishes, which is crucial for consistency with known holographic entropy formulas.</description>

      <title>Recursions and ODEs for correlations in integrable systems and random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An integrable system is often formulated as a flat connection, satisfying a Lax equation. It is given in terms of compatible systems having a common solution called the ``wave function" $\Psi$ living in a Lie group $G$, which satisfies some differential equations with rational coefficients. From this wave function, it is usual to define a sequence of ``correlators" $W_n$, that play an important role in many applications in mathematical physics. Here, we show how to systematically obtain ordinary differential equations (ODE) with polynomial coefficients for the correlators. An application is random matrix theory, where the wave functions are the expectation value of the characteristic polynomial, they form a family of orthogonal polynomials, and are known to satisfy an integrable system. The correlators are then the correlation functions of resolvents or of eigenvalue densities. We give the ODE and recursion on the matrix size that they satisfy.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Suppression of Cosmic Rays' Flux in $\boldsymbol{f(R)}$ and $\boldsymbol{f(Q)}$ Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of magnetic diffusion on the spectrum of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) from a cosmological perspective. To this end, we consider two modified theories of gravity (MTGs), namely, the $f(R)$ gravity and a symmetric teleparallel gravity, also known as $f(Q)$ gravity. Utilizing these two MTGs, we calculate the suppression in the flux of UHECRs for a collection of sources. Non-evolution (NE) and cosmic star formation rate (SFR) scenarios have been considered in our calculation of the suppression factor. This study also includes a mixed composition scenario involving the nuclei upto iron (Fe). Furthermore, we provide a parameterization of the suppression factor for the proton and also for the mixed compositions within the $f(R)$ and $f(Q)$ theories, considering both NE and SFR scenarios. The influence of the turbulent magnetic field on the suppression factor is also incorporated in our work. Comparative analysis of all our results with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model reveals significant effects of MTGs on the suppression factor that the $f(R)$ power-law model predicts the lowest suppression factor, while the $f(Q)$ model predicts the highest, and interestingly the results from the standard model fall within the range predicted by these two cosmological models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a consistent derivation of the complete Wess-Zumino-Witten interactions of axions, including the counter-term necessary to guarantee the gauge invariance of the Standard Model. By treating the derivative of the axion field as a background gauge field and incorporating auxiliary chiral rotation phases, we ensure consistency in the axion-interaction Lagrangian. This approach allows us to derive basis-independent physical interactions of axions with gauge bosons and vector mesons. As an example, we explore the interaction of $a$-$\omega$-$\gamma$ to illustrate the potential for searching for axion-like particles at colliders.</description>

      <title>Probing quantum chaos through singular-value correlations in sparse non-Hermitian SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing singular value decomposition, our investigation focuses on the spectrum of the singular values within a sparse non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Unlike the complex eigenvalues typical of non-Hermitian systems, singular values are inherently real and positive. Our findings reveal a congruence between the statistics of singular values and those of the analogous Hermitian Gaussian ensembles. An increase in sparsity results in the non-Hermitian SYK model deviating from its chaotic behavior, a phenomenon precisely captured by the singular value ratios. Our analysis of the singular form factor ({\upsigma}FF), analogous to the spectral form factor (SFF) indicates the disappearance of the linear ramp with increased sparsity. Additionally, we define singular complexity, inspired by the spectral complexity in Hermitian systems, whose saturation provides a critical threshold of sparseness. Such disintegration is likely associated with the breakdown of the existing holographic dual for non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Reflection Positivity and Chern-Simons Functional Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a mathematical version of the formal Chern-Simons functional integral of Witten for manifolds equipped with a reflection may be constructed in terms of a reflection positive functional, associated to the quadratic term in the Chern-Simons Lagrangian, on an algebra of functions on a Banach space ${\bf A}$ of connections on the underlying 3-manifold. This construction yields a Hilbert space associated to a surface preserved by the reflection. A version of the cubic Bosonic interaction term in the Chern-Simons Lagrangian gives a self-adjoint operator on this Hilbert space, and by exponentiation, a unitary one parameter subgroup of operators. The vacuum expectation value of this one parameter subgroup is combined with an additional term associated to the ghost fields and their interaction, and an appropriate weak limit gives a partition function for the quantum field theory. This construction is nonperturbative. The theory is finite and does not require renormalization, as may be expected from perturbation theory. It is natural to ask whether the resulting partition function is related to the manifold invariants of Witten and Reshetikhin-Turaev, or whether a more elaborate construction may be needed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the signatures of a non-commutative black hole solution. Initially, we calculate the thermodynamic properties of the system, including entropy, heat capacity, and Hawking radiation. For the latter quantity, we employ two distinct methods: surface gravity and the topological approach. Additionally, we examine the emission rate and remnant mass within this context. Remarkably, the lifetime of the black hole, after reaching its final state due to the evaporation process, is expressed analytically up to a grey-body factor. We estimate the lifetime for specific initial and final mass configurations. Also, we analyze the tensorial quasinormal modes using the 6th-order WKB method. Finally, we study the deflection angle, i.e., gravitational lensing, in both the weak and strong deflection limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feynman integrals can be expanded asymptotically with respect to some small parameters at the integrand level, a technique known as the expansion by regions. A naive expansion by regions may break down due to divergences not regulated by the spacetime dimension, exemplified by the rapidity divergences. A criterion to identify unregulated divergences is provided in this article. The analysis is conducted using both parametric and Mellin-Barnes representations, leading to a consistent conclusion. Based on this analysis, it is proven that {\it the presence of unregulated divergences implies the degeneracies of regions}, which may help to explain phenomena like the collinear anomaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotically nonlocal field theories approximate ghost-free nonlocal theories at low energies, yet are theories of finite order in the number of derivatives. These theories have an emergent nonlocal scale that regulates loop diagrams and can provide a solution to the hierarchy problem. Asymptotic nonlocality has been studied previously in scalar theories, Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories with complex scalars, and linearized gravity. Here we extend that work by considering an asymptotically nonlocal generalization of QCD, which can be used for realistic phenomenological investigations. In particular, we derive Feynman rules relevant for the study of the production of dijets at hadron colliders and compute the parton-level cross sections at leading order. We use these to determine a bound on the scale of new physics from Large Hadron Collider data, both for a typical choice of model parameters, and in the nonlocal limit.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of the ground state Bethe roots for the inhomogeneous XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that for the Heisenberg XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain in the critical regime, the scaling limit of the vacuum Bethe roots yields an infinite set of numbers that coincide with the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical 3D anharmonic oscillator. The discovery of this curious relation, among others, gave rise to the approach referred to as the ODE/IQFT (or ODE/IM) correspondence. Here we consider a multiparametric generalization of the Heisenberg spin chain, which is associated with the inhomogeneous six-vertex model. When quasi-periodic boundary conditions are imposed the lattice system may be explored within the Bethe Ansatz technique. We argue that for the critical spin chain, with a properly formulated scaling limit, the scaled Bethe roots for the ground state are described by second order differential equations, which are multi-parametric generalizations of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the anharmonic oscillator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the scalar-tensor modification of the gravitational field of an ultrarelativistic particle beam and its effect on a test particle that is used as sensor. To do so, we solve the linearized scalar-tensor gravity field equations sourced by an energy-momentum tensor of a moving point particle. The geodesic equation and the geodesic deviation equation then predict the acceleration of the test particle as well as the momentum transfer due to a passing source. Comparing the momentum transfer predicted by general relativity and scalar tensor gravity, we find that there exists a relevant parameter regime where this difference increases significantly with the velocity of the source particle. Since ultrarelativistic particles are available at accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider, ultra-precise acceleration sensors in the vicinity of the particle beam could potentially detect deviations from general relativity or constrain modified gravity models.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the characteristics of a gravastar in $f(\mathcal{Q})$ gravity, which is upheld by Krori-Barua (KB) metric. We have used Krori-Barua (KB) metric for the interior and shell regions of the gravastar. We deduced our field equations by using Krori-Barua metric. In the outside regions of the gravastar, we have taken two regular black hole metrics. Additionally, we have applied the Israel junction condition to calculate the potential difference across the thin shell concerning different types of regular black holes, such as Bardeen and Hayward. We have also discussed the physical properties like proper length, entropy, energy, EoS and stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to recent measurements, dark matter magnetic dipole moment is strongly constrained. In the composite Higgs models the magnetic dipole moment of the Dirac dark matter fermion and its mass can be suppressed by the approximate U(1) symmetry. We consider E_6 inspired composite Higgs model (E_6CHM) with U(1) symmetry violating operators, which give rise to dark matter's mass and coupling constant to Higgs boson. The dependence of the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section on the E_6CHM parameters is explored. We argue that there are regions of the parameter space which are still safe from all current constraints and may lead to spectacular LHC signatures.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Homotopy Transfer for $A_\infty$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach to the homotopy transfer procedure starting from a set of homotopy data such that the first differential complex is a differential graded module over the second one. We show that the module structure may be used to induce an $A_\infty$-algebra on the second differential complex, constructed in a similar fashion to the homotopy transfer $A_\infty$-algebra. We prove that, under certain conditions, the $A_\infty$-algebras obtained with this procedure are quasi-isomorphic to the homotopy transfer one. On the other hand, when the side conditions do not hold, we find that there are cases where the existence of an $A_\infty$-quasi-isomorphism with the homotopy transfer $A_\infty$-algebra is obstructed. In other words, we obtain a new $A_\infty$-algebra on the second complex, inequivalent to the homotopy transfer one. Lastly, we prove that these $A_\infty$-algebras are not infinitesimal Hochschild deformations of the homotopy transfer $A_\infty$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings from Tribrid Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tribrid inflation is a class of supersymmetric inflation models where the scalar component of a matter superfield, or a $D$-flat direction of matter fields, drives inflation. Similar to Hybrid inflation, the end of inflation is reached when a "waterfall field", which was stabilized during inflation at a field value where the scalar potential features a large vacuum energy, starts rapidly rolling towards its minimum where a symmetry group $G$ is spontaneously broken. In contrast to standard supersymmetric Hybrid inflation, where the inflaton is a gauge singlet, in Tribrid inflation it can be a gauge non-singlet, which, via its vacuum expectation value, already breaks the gauge symmetry. This raises the question whether topological defects can still form after inflation in this class of models, and if so, which types of defects are generated. We investigate this question systematically in realisations of Tribrid inflation where $G = U(1)$ and we analyse under which conditions cosmic strings form. We find that in the considered cases where domain walls form, these are only temporary and do not invalidate the model realisations. We also discuss how our results can be used to analyse models of Tribrid inflation associated with the final step of $SO(10)$ breaking, where cosmic strings can be metastable and provide a promising explanation of the recent PTA results hinting at a stochastic gravitational wave background at nanohertz frequencies.</description>

      <title>$F(Q)$ gravity with Gauss-Bonnet corrections: from early-time inflation to late-time acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in the $f(Q)$ gravity with a non-metricity scalar $Q$, the curvatures in Einstein's gravity, that is, the Riemann curvature constructed from the standard Levi-Civita connection, could not be excluded or naturally appear. The first observation is that even in $f(Q)$ gravity, the conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor is not described by the covariant derivatives in the non-metricity gravity but that is given by the Levi-Civita connection. The commutator of the covariant derivatives in Einstein's gravity inevitably induces the Riemann curvature. There is no symmetry nor principle which prohibits the Riemann curvature in non-metricity gravity. Based on this observation, we propose and investigate $f\left(Q, \mathcal{G} \right)$ gravity with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant $\mathcal{G}$ and its generalisations. We show how $f\left(Q, \mathcal{G} \right)$ models realising any given the Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime can be reconstructed. We apply the reconstruction formalism to cosmology. Explicitly, the gravity models which realise slow roll or constant roll inflation, dark energy epoch as well as the unification of the inflation and dark energy are found. The dynamical autonomous system and the gravitational wave in the theory under investigation are discussed. It is found the condition that the de Sitter spacetime becomes the (stable) fixed point of the system.</description>

      <title>Dark energy with a shift-symmetric scalar field: obstacles, loophole hunting and dead ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the possibility of a scalar field being the fundamental description of dark energy without the need of self-tuning any parameter. Thereby, we focus on shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories satisfying also that the propagation speed of gravitational waves is equal to the speed of light. Analysing the stability of scalar linear perturbations, we discuss the conditions that seems to be necessary to describe (super) accelerated cosmic expansion without introducing instabilities. It has been established, however, that this stability can be ruined when taking into account the interaction with tensor perturbations (essentially gravitational waves). Indeed, although we shall point out that the standard proof of absence of dark energy stable braiding models due to this interaction has a possible way-out, we find general arguments suggesting that there are no dark energy stable solutions that can exploit this loophole. Thus, we discuss future research directions for finding viable fundamental descriptions of dark energy. We also provide a dictionary between the covariant version of the scalar field theory and that of the Effective Field Theory approach, explicitly computing the parameters in the latter formalism in terms of the functions appearing in the covariant version, and its derivatives. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time these expressions are explicitly obtained up-to arbitrary order in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Percolating Cosmic String Networks from Kination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a new mechanism, whose ingredients are realised in string compactifications, for the formation of cosmic (super)string networks. Oscillating string loops grow when their tension $\mu$ decreases with time. If $2H + \dot{\mu}/\mu &lt; 0$, where $H$ is the Hubble parameter, loops grow faster than the scale factor and an initial population of isolated small loops (for example, produced by nucleation) can grow, percolate and form a network. This condition is satisfied for fundamental strings in the background of a kinating volume modulus rolling towards the asymptotic large volume region of moduli space. Such long kination epochs are motivated in string cosmology by both the electroweak hierarchy problem and the need to solve the overshoot problem. The tension of such a network today is set by the final vacuum; for phenomenologically appealing Large Volume Scenario (LVS) vacua, this would lead to a fundamental string network with $G \mu \sim 10^{-10}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points (DQCPs) are putative phase transitions beyond the Landau paradigm with emergent fractionalized degrees of freedom. The original example of a DQCP is the spin-1/2 quantum antiferromagnet on the square lattice which features a second order transition between valence bond solid (VBS) and N\'eel order. The VBS order breaks a lattice symmetry, and the corresponding VBS order parameter may couple to lattice distortion modes (phonons) at appropriate momenta. We investigate a field-theoretic description of the DQCP in the presence of such a spin-lattice coupling. We show that treating phonons as classical lattice distortions leads to a relevant monopole-phonon interaction inducing an instability towards a distorted lattice by an analogous mechanism to the spin-Peierls instability in one dimension. Consequently, there is a breakdown of the DQCP which generally becomes a strong first-order transition. Taking into account the full quantum nature of the phonons, we argue that the continuous DQCP persists above a critical phonon frequency. Lastly, we comment on the connection to general gapless, deconfined gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to construct the cohomological Hall algebras for $3$-Calabi--Yau categories admitting a strong orientation data. This can be regarded as a mathematical definition of the algebra of BPS states, whose existence was first mathematically conjectured by Kontsevich and Soibelman. Along the way, we prove Joyce's conjecture on the functorial behaviour of the Donaldson--Thomas perverse sheaves for the attractor Lagrangian correspondence of $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks. This result allows us to construct a parabolic induction map for cohomological Donaldson--Thomas invariants of $G$-local systems on $3$-manifolds for a reductive group $G$, which can be regarded as a $3$-manifold analogue of the Eisenstein series functor in the geometric Langlands program.</description>

      <title>All holographic systems have scar states</title>

Abstract: Scar states are special finite-energy density, but non-thermal states of chaotic Hamiltonians. We argue that all holographic quantum field theories, including $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang--Mills, have scar states. Their presence is tied to the existence of non-topological, horizonless soliton solutions in gravity: oscillons and a novel family of excited boson stars. We demonstrate that these solutions have periodic oscillations in the correlation functions and posses low-entanglement entropy as expected for scar states. Also we find that they can be very easily prepared with Euclidean path integral.</description>

      <title>Cyclic products of higher-genus Szeg\"o kernels, modular tensors and polylogarithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wealth of information on multiloop string amplitudes is encoded in fermionic two-point functions known as Szeg\"o kernels. In this paper we show that cyclic products of any number of Szeg\"o kernels on a Riemann surface of arbitrary genus may be decomposed into linear combinations of modular tensors on moduli space that carry all the dependence on the spin structure $\delta$. The $\delta$-independent coefficients in these combinations carry all the dependence on the marked points and are composed of the integration kernels of higher-genus polylogarithms. We determine the antiholomorphic moduli derivatives of the $\delta$-dependent modular tensors.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we calculate matrix of modular transformations of the one-point toric conformal blocks in the Neveu-Schwarz sector of $N=1$ super Liouville field theory. For this purpose we use explicit expression for this matrix as integral of product of certain elements of fusion matrix. This integral is computed using the chain of integral identities for supersymmetric hyperbolic gamma functions derived by the degeneration of the integrals of parafermionic elliptic gamma functions.</description>

      <title>The $g$-function and Defect Changing Operators from Wavefunction Overlap on a Fuzzy Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00039v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Defects are common in physical systems with boundaries, impurities or extensive measurements. The interaction between bulk and defect can lead to rich physical phenomena. Defects in gapless phases of matter with conformal symmetry usually flow to a defect conformal field theory (dCFT). Understanding the universal properties of dCFTs is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a computational strategy applicable to a line defect in arbitrary dimensions. Our main assumption is that the defect has a UV description in terms of a local modification of the Hamiltonian so that we can compute the overlap between low-energy eigenstates of a system with or without the defect insertion. We argue that these overlaps contain a wealth of conformal data, including the $g$-function, which is an RG monotonic quantity that distinguishes different dCFTs, the scaling dimensions of defect creation operators $\Delta^{+0}_\alpha$ and changing operators $\Delta^{+-}_\alpha$ that live on the intersection of different types of line defects, and various OPE coefficients. We apply this method to the fuzzy sphere regularization of 3D CFTs and study the magnetic line defect of the 3D Ising CFT. Using exact diagonalization and DMRG, we report the non-perturbative results $g=0.602(2),\Delta^{+0}_0=0.108(5)$ and $\Delta^{+-}_0=0.84(5)$ for the first time. We also obtain other OPE coefficients and scaling dimensions. Our results have significant physical implications. For example, they constrain the possible occurrence of spontaneous symmetry breaking at line defects of the 3D Ising CFT. Our method can be potentially applied to various other dCFTs, such as plane defects and Wilson lines in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Neural ODEs for holographic transport models without translation symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the data-driven holographic transport models without translation symmetry. Our data are the real part of the frequency-dependent shear viscosity, denoted as $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega )$. We develop a radial flow equation of the shear response and establish its relation to $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega )$ for a wide class of holographic models. This allows us to determine $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega )$ of a strongly coupled field theory by the black hole metric and the graviton mass. The latter serves as the bulk dual to the translation symmetry breaking on the boundary. We convert the flow equation to a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE), which is a neural network with continuous depth and produces output through a black-box ODE solver. We test the Neural ODE in three well-known holographic models without translation symmetry. Given either the metric or the mass, we display that the Neural ODE can learn the other with high accuracy. We also illustrate that the learned metric can be used to predict the derivative of entanglement entropy $S$ with respect to the size of entangling region $l$, which suggests an intriguing relationship between $S^{\prime }(l)$ and $\eta _{\mathrm{re}}(\omega )$.</description>

      <title>Spinning Particle Geometries in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study spinning particle/defect geometries in the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. These solutions lie below the BTZ threshold, and can be obtained from identifications of AdS$_3$. We construct the Feynman propagator by solving the bulk equation of motion in the spinning particle geometry, summing over the modes of the fields and passing to the boundary. The quantization of the scalar fields becomes challenging when confined to the regions that are causally well-behaved. If the region containing closed timelike curves (CTCs) is included, the normalization of the scalar fields enjoys an analytical simplification and the propagator can be expressed as an infinite sum over image geodesics. In the dual CFT$_2$, the propagator can be recast as the HHLL four-point function, where by taking into account the $PSL (2,\mathbb{Z})$ modular images, we recover the bulk computation. We comment on the casual behavior of bulk geometries associated with single-trace operators of spin scaling with the central charge below the BTZ threshold.</description>

      <title>Exact Flux Vacua, Symmetries, and the Structure of the Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying flux vacua in string theory with stabilized complex structure moduli presents a significant challenge, necessitating the minimization of a scalar potential complicated by infinitely many exponential corrections. In order to obtain exact results we connect three central topics: transcendentality or algebraicity of coupling functions, emergent symmetries, and the distribution of vacua. Beginning with explicit examples, we determine the first exact landscape of flux vacua with a vanishing superpotential within F-theory compactifications on a genuine Calabi-Yau fourfold. We find that along certain symmetry loci in moduli space the generically transcendental vacuum conditions become algebraic and can be described using the periods of a K3 surface. On such loci the vacua become dense when we do not bound the flux tadpole, while imposing the tadpole bound yields a small finite landscape of distinct vacua. Away from these symmetry loci, the transcendentality of the fourfold periods ensures that there are only a finite number of vacua with a vanishing superpotential, even when the tadpole constraint is removed. These observations exemplify the general patterns emerging in the bulk of moduli space that we expose in this work. They are deeply tied to the arithmetic structure underlying flux vacua and generalize the finiteness claims about rational CFTs and rank-two attractors. From a mathematical perspective, our study is linked with the recent landmark results by Baldi, Klingler, and Ullmo about the Hodge locus that arose from connecting tame geometry and Hodge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hybrid model is a fibration of a Landau-Ginzburg orbifold over a geometric base. We study B-type D-branes in hybrid models. Imposing B-type supersymmetry on the boundary action, we show that D-branes are specified by matrix factorisations in the fibre direction, together with some geometric data associated to the base. We also deduce conditions for the compatibility of these branes with the bulk orbifold actions and R-symmetry. We construct examples of hybrid B-branes which are generalisations of well-studied branes in geometric and Landau-Ginzburg models. Hybrid models can arise at limiting points of the stringy Kahler moduli space of Calabi-Yaus, and can be realised as phases of the corresponding gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs). Using GLSM techniques, we establish connections between geometric branes and hybrid branes. As explicit examples, we consider one- and two-parameter Calabi-Yau hybrids with a $\mathbb{P}^1$-base.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We scrutinize the conserved energy of an accelerating AdS black hole by employing the off-shell quasilocal formalism, which amalgamates the ADT formalism with the covariant phase space approach. In the presence of conical singularities in the accelerating black hole, the energy expression is articulated through the surface term derived from our formalism. The essence of our analysis of the quasilocal energy resides in the surface contributions coming from the conical singularities as well as the conventional radial boundary. Consequently, the resultant conserved quasilocal energy naturally conforms the thermodynamic first law for the black hole without necessitating any augmentation of thermodynamic variables. Additionally, we obtain the Smarr relation for the black hole using the differential operator method and the scaling argument of the relevant thermodynamic quantities.</description>

Abstract: The natural existence of crystalline symmetry in real materials manifests the importance of understanding crystalline symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases, especially for interacting systems. In this paper, we systematically construct and classify all the crystalline topological superconductors and insulators in three-dimensional (3D) interacting fermion systems using the novel concept of topological crystal. The corresponding higher-order topological surface theory can also be systematically studied via higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence. In particular, we discover an intriguing fact that almost all topological crystals with nontrivial 2D block states are intrinsically interacting topological phases that cannot be realized in any free-fermion systems. Moreover, the crystalline equivalence principle for 3D interacting fermionic systems is also verified, with an additional subtle "twist" on the spin of fermions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the no black hole theorem in three dimensional (3D) gravity in the Newman-Penrose formalism in a generalized Newman-Unti gauge. After adapting the well established 4D NP formalism and its gauge and coordinates system to 3D gravity, we show that the no black hole theorem is manifest in the NP equations. We further study in detail the horizon properties of the 3D charged rotating solutions and confirm that a black hole solution requires a negative cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the resonance contributions to the generalized Baldin sum rule, namely the sum of the generalized electric and magnetic nucleon polarizabilities $\alpha_E(Q^2)$ and $\beta_M(Q^2)$, within the Holographic QCD model by Witten, Sakai, and Sugimoto (WSS). In particular, we account for the contributions from the first low-lying nucleon resonances with spin 1/2 and 3/2 and both parities. After having extrapolated the WSS model parameters to fit experimental data on baryonic observables, we compare our findings with alternative predictions in literature, finding a qualitative agreement with all of them. Moreover, at least for the proton case, where data are available, our results are in qualitative accordance with resonance contributions extracted from experimental nucleon-resonance helicity amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impact of instrument noise and astrophysical fluctuations on measurements of the first black hole photon ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currently envisioned extensions of the Event Horizon Telescope to space will soon target the black hole photon ring: a narrow ring-shaped imprint of a black hole's strong gravity produced in its images by highly bent photon trajectories. In principle, the shape of the photon ring encodes information about the geometry of the underlying black hole spacetime. In practice, however, whether or not this information can be extracted from the ring shape depends on several factors, ranging from the astrophysical details of the emitting source (such as the magnitude of its plasma fluctuations) to the specific configuration of the interferometric array (such as the separation between its telescopes, or the level of noise in its instruments). Here, we employ a phenomenological model to assess the impact of astrophysical fluctuations and instrument noise on the inferred shape of the photon ring. Our systematic study of several astrophysical profiles suggests that this shape can be measured even in the presence of instrument noise across a wide range of baselines. The measurement accuracy and precision appear relatively insensitive to the noise level, up to a sharp threshold beyond which any measurement becomes incredibly challenging (at least without recourse to more sophisticated data analysis methods). Encouragingly, we find that only a few snapshot images are generally needed to overcome the impact of astrophysical fluctuations and correctly infer the ring diameter. Inference becomes more challenging when analyzing the visibility amplitude in a baseline window that is not entirely dominated by a single photon ring. Nevertheless, in most cases, it is still possible to fit a ring shape with the correct fractional asymmetry. These results provide excellent prospects for future precision measurements of black hole spin and fundamental astrophysics via black hole imaging.</description>

Abstract: The Riemann-Hilbert approach, in conjunction with the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of certain matrix functions called monodromy matrices, enables one to obtain explicit solutions to the non-linear field equations of some gravitational theories. These solutions are encoded in the elements of a matrix $M$ depending on the Weyl coordinates $\rho$ and $v$, determined by that factorisation. We address here, for the first time, the underlying question of what happens when a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation does not exist, using the close connection of Wiener-Hopf factorisation with Toeplitz operators to study this question. For the case of rational monodromy matrices, we prove that the non-existence of a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation determines curves in the $(\rho,v)$ plane on which some elements of $M(\rho,v)$ tend to infinity, but where the space-time metric may still be well behaved. In the case of uncharged rotating black holes in four space-time dimensions and, for certain choices of coordinates, in five space-time dimensions, we show that these curves correspond to their ergosurfaces.</description>

Abstract: The most promising mechanism of generating PBHs is by the enhancement of power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation, which is usually accompanied by the the enhancement of non-Gaussianity that crucially changes the abundance of PBHs. In this review I will discuss how non-Gaussianity is generated in single field inflation as well as in the curvaton scenario, and then discuss how to calculate PBH mass function and induced gravitational waves (GWs) with such non-Gaussianities. When the PBH abundance is fixed, non-Gaussianity only has mild impact on the spectral shape of the induced GWs, which gives relatively robust predictions in the mHz and nHz GW experiments.</description>

      <title>Fermionic quantum criticality through the lens of topological holography</title>

Abstract: We utilize the topological holographic framework to characterize and gain insights into the nature of quantum critical points and gapless phases in fermionic quantum systems. Topological holography is a general framework that describes the generalized global symmetry and the symmetry charges of a local quantum system in terms of a slab of a topological order, termed as the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), in one higher dimension. In this work, we consider a generalization of the topological holographic picture for $(1+1)d$ fermionic quantum phases of matter. We discuss how spin structures are encoded in the SymTFT and establish the connection between the formal fermionization formula in quantum field theory and the choice of fermionic gapped boundary conditions of the SymTFT. We demonstrate the identification and the characterization of the fermionic gapped phases and phase transitions through detailed analysis of various examples, including the fermionic systems with $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{F}$, $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{F}$, $\mathbb{Z}_{4}^{F}$, and the fermionic version of the non-invertible $\text{Rep}(S_{3})$ symmetry. Our work uncovers many exotic fermionic quantum critical points and gapless phases, including two kinds of fermionic symmetry enriched quantum critical points, a fermionic gapless symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, and a fermionic gapless spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase that breaks the fermionic non-invertible symmetry.</description>
