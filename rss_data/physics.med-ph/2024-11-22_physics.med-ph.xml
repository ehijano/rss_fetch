      <title>Smartphone tristimulus colorimetry for skin-tone analysis at common pulse oximetry anatomical sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significance: Smartphones hold great potential in point-of-care settings due to their accessibility and computational capabilities. This is critical as clinicians increasingly seek to quantify skin-tone, a characteristic which has been shown to impact the accuracy of pulse oximetry readings, particularly for dark skin tones, and hence, disproportionately affect patient outcomes. Aim: This study presents a smartphone-based imaging technique for determining individual typology angle (ITA) and compares these results to those obtained using an industry-standard tristimulus colorimeter, particularly for the finger, a common site for pulse oximetry measurements. Approach: We employ a smartphone-based imaging method to extract ITA values from four volunteers with diverse skin-tones. The study provides recommendations for minimizing errors caused by ambient light scattering, which can affect skin-tone readings. Results: The smartphone-based ITA (SITA) measurements with camera flash disabled and minimal ambient lighting correlates well with the industry-standard colorimeter without the need for auxiliary adapters and complex calibration. The method presented enables wide-field ITA mapping for skin-tone quantification that is accessible to clinicians. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that smartphone-based imaging provides an effective alternative for assessing skin-tone in clinical settings. The reduced complexity of the approach presented makes it highly accessible to the clinical community and others interested in carrying out pulse oximetry across a diversity of skin-tones in a manner that standardizes skin-tone assessment.</description>

      <title>Exploring Methods for Integrating and Augmenting Multimodal Data to Improve Prognostic Accuracy in Imbalanced Datasets for Intraoperative Aneurysm Occlusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates a multimodal machine learning framework for predicting treatment outcomes in intracranial aneurysms (IAs). Combining angiographic parametric imaging (API), patient biomarkers, and disease morphology, the framework aims to enhance prognostic accuracy. Data from 340 patients were analyzed, with separate deep neural networks processing quantitative and categorical data. These networks' pre decision layers were concatenated and inputted into a final predictive network. Various data augmentation strategies, including Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Nominal and Continuous data (SMOTE NC), addressed dataset imbalances. Performance metrics, evaluated through Monte Carlo cross validation, showed significant improvements with augmentation, particularly in intermediate fusion models. This study validates the framework's efficacy in accurately predicting IA treatment outcomes, demonstrating that data augmentation techniques can substantially enhance model performance.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks for 3D Quantitative Angiography Reconstructions from Sparse Cone Beam CT Projections Utilizing CFD Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study leverages convolutional neural networks to enhance the temporal resolution of 3D angiography in intracranial aneurysms focusing on the reconstruction of volumetric contrast data from sparse and limited projections. Three patient-specific IA geometries were segmented and converted into stereolithography files to facilitate computational fluid dynamics simulations. These simulations first modeled blood flow under steady conditions with varying inlet velocities: 0.25 m/s, 0.35 m/s, and 0.45 m/s. Subsequently, 3D angiograms were simulated by labeling inlet particles to represent contrast bolus injections over durations of 0.5s, 1.0s, 1.5s, and 2.0s. The angiographic simulations were then used within a simulated cone beam C arm CT system to generate in-silico rotational DSAs, capturing projections every 10 ms over a 220-degree arc at 27 frames per second. From these simulations, both fully sampled (108 projections) and truncated projection datasets were generated the latter using a maximum of 49 projections. High fidelity volumetric images were reconstructed using a Parker weighted Feldkamp Davis Kress algorithm. A modified U Net CNN was subsequently trained on these datasets to reconstruct 3D angiographic volumes from the truncated projections. The network incorporated multiple convolutional layers with ReLU activations and Max pooling, complemented by upsampling and concatenation to preserve spatial detail. Model performance was evaluated using mean squared error (MSE). Evaluating our U net model across the test set yielded a MSE of 0.0001, indicating good agreement with ground truth reconstructions and demonstrating acceptable capabilities in capturing relevant transient angiographic features. This study confirms the feasibility of using CNNs for reconstructing 3D angiographic images from truncated projections.</description>
