      <title>Towards a semantic characterisation of global type well-formedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the question of characterising the well-formedness properties of multiparty session types semantically, i.e., as properties of the semantic model used to interpret types. Choosing Prime Event Structures (PESs) as our semantic model, we present semantic counterparts for the two properties that underpin global type well-formedness, namely projectability and boundedness, in this model. As a first step towards a characterisation of the class of PESs corresponding to well-formed global types, we identify some simple structural properties satisfied by such PESs.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between Composite Theories and Distributive Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composite theories are the algebraic equivalent of distributive laws. In this paper, we delve into the details of this correspondence and concretely show how to construct a composite theory from a distributive law and vice versa. Using term rewriting methods, we also describe when a minimal set of equations axiomatises the composite theory.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Tutorial on over 100 Years of Diagrammatic Representations of Logical Statements and Relational Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Query formulation is increasingly performed by systems that need to guess a user's intent (e.g. via spoken word interfaces). But how can a user know that the computational agent is returning answers to the "right" query? More generally, given that relational queries can become pretty complicated, how can we help users understand relational queries, whether human-generated or automatically generated? Now seems the right moment to revisit a topic that predates the birth of the relational model: developing visual metaphors that help users understand relational queries.
  This lecture-style tutorial surveys the key visual metaphors developed for diagrammatic representations of logical statements and relational expressions, across both the relational database and the much older diagrammatic reasoning communities. We survey the history and state-of-the-art of relationally-complete diagrammatic representations of relational queries, discuss the key visual metaphors developed in over a century of investigations into diagrammatic languages, and organize the landscape by mapping the visual alphabets of diagrammatic representation systems to the syntax and semantics of Relational Algebra (RA) and Relational Calculus (RC).

      <title>Deep Learning with Parametric Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a categorical semantics for machine learning algorithms in terms of lenses, parametric maps, and reverse derivative categories. This foundation provides a powerful explanatory and unifying framework: it encompasses a variety of gradient descent algorithms such as ADAM, AdaGrad, and Nesterov momentum, as well as a variety of loss functions such as MSE and Softmax cross-entropy, and different architectures, shedding new light on their similarities and differences. Furthermore, our approach to learning has examples generalising beyond the familiar continuous domains (modelled in categories of smooth maps) and can be realised in the discrete setting of Boolean and polynomial circuits. We demonstrate the practical significance of our framework with an implementation in Python.</description>

      <title>Recover: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Failure Detection and Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recognizing failures during task execution and implementing recovery procedures is challenging in robotics. Traditional approaches rely on the availability of extensive data or a tight set of constraints, while more recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to verify task steps and replan accordingly. However, these methods often operate offline, necessitating scene resets and incurring in high costs. This paper introduces Recover, a neuro-symbolic framework for online failure identification and recovery. By integrating ontologies, logical rules, and LLM-based planners, Recover exploits symbolic information to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate recovery plans and also to decrease the associated costs. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of our method in a simulated kitchen environment, we introduce OntoThor, an ontology describing the AI2Thor simulator setting. Empirical evaluation shows that OntoThor's logical rules accurately detect all failures in the analyzed tasks, and that Recover considerably outperforms, for both failure detection and recovery, a baseline method reliant solely on LLMs.</description>

      <title>Primitive Recursive Dependent Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that restricting the elimination principle of the natural numbers type in Martin-L\"of Type Theory (MLTT) to a universe of types not containing $\Pi$-types ensures that all definable functions are primitive recursive. This extends the concept of primitive recursiveness to general types. We discuss extensions to univalent type theories and other notions of computability. We are inspired by earlier work by Martin Hofmann, work on Joyal's arithmetic universes, and Hugo Herbelin and Ludovic Patey's sketched Calculus of Primitive Recursive Constructions.
  We define a theory Tpr that is a subtheory of MLTT with two universes, such that all inductive types are finitary and the lowest universe is restricted to not contain $\Pi$-types. We prove soundness such that all functions $\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ are primitive recursive. The proof requires that Tpr satisfies canonicity, which we easily prove using synthetic Tait computability.</description>

      <title>A simplified proof of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture and XY-symmetric operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new theory of strong subalgebras and linear congruences that are defined globally. Using this theory we provide a new proof of the correctness of Zhuk's algorithm for all tractable CSPs on a finite domain, and therefore a new simplified proof of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture. Additionally, using the new theory we prove that composing a weak near-unanimity operation of an odd arity $n$ we can derive an $n$-ary operation that is symmetric on all two-element sets. Thus, CSP over a constraint language $\Gamma$ on a finite domain is tractable if and only if there exist infinitely many polymorphisms of $\Gamma$ that are symmetric on all two-element sets.</description>

      <title>Branch-Well-Structured Transition Systems and Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a relaxation to the definition of well-structured transition systems (\WSTS) while retaining the decidability of boundedness and non-termination. In this class, the well-quasi-ordered (wqo) condition is relaxed such that it is applicable only between states that are reachable one from another. Furthermore, the monotony condition is relaxed in the same way. While this retains the decidability of non-termination and boundedness, it appears that the coverability problem is undecidable. To this end, we define a new notion of monotony, called cover-monotony, which is strictly more general than the usual monotony and still allows us to decide a restricted form of the coverability problem.</description>

      <title>Complex Logical Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reasoning over knowledge graphs (KGs) is a challenging task that requires a deep understanding of the complex relationships between entities and the underlying logic of their relations. Current approaches rely on learning geometries to embed entities in vector space for logical query operations, but they suffer from subpar performance on complex queries and dataset-specific representations. In this paper, we propose a novel decoupled approach, Language-guided Abstract Reasoning over Knowledge graphs (LARK), that formulates complex KG reasoning as a combination of contextual KG search and logical query reasoning, to leverage the strengths of graph extraction algorithms and large language models (LLM), respectively. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art KG reasoning methods on standard benchmark datasets across several logical query constructs, with significant performance gain for queries of higher complexity. Furthermore, we show that the performance of our approach improves proportionally to the increase in size of the underlying LLM, enabling the integration of the latest advancements in LLMs for logical reasoning over KGs. Our work presents a new direction for addressing the challenges of complex KG reasoning and paves the way for future research in this area.</description>

      <title>Alignment complete relational Hoare logics for some and all</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10045v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In relational verification, judicious alignment of computational steps facilitates proof of relations between programs using simple relational assertions. Relational Hoare logics (RHL) provide compositional rules that embody various alignments of executions. Seemingly more flexible alignments can be expressed in terms of product automata based on program transition relations. A single degenerate alignment rule (self-composition), atop a complete Hoare logic, comprises a RHL for $\forall\forall$ properties that is complete in the ordinary logical sense (Cook'78). The notion of alignment completeness was previously proposed as a more satisfactory measure, and some rules were shown to be alignment complete with respect to a few ad hoc forms of alignment automata. This paper proves alignment completeness with respect to a general class of $\forall\forall$ alignment automata, for a RHL comprised of standard rules together with a rule of semantics-preserving rewrites based on Kleene algebra with tests. A new logic for $\forall\exists$ properties is introduced and shown to be alignment complete. The $\forall\forall$ and $\forall\exists$ automata are shown to be semantically complete. Thus the logics are both complete in the ordinary sense. Recent work by D'Osualdo et al highlights the importance of completeness relative to assumptions (which we term entailment completeness), and presents $\forall\forall$ examples seemingly beyond the scope of RHLs. Additional rules enable these examples to be proved in our RHL, shedding light on the open problem of entailment completeness.</description>

      <title>Coalgebraic Modal Logic for Dynamic Systems with Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we define a class of polynomial functors suited for constructing coalgebras representing processes in which uncertainty plays an important role. In these polynomial functors we include upper and lower probability measures, finitely additive probability measures, plausibilty measures (and their duals, belief functions), and possibility measures. We give axioms and inference rules for the associated system of coalgebraic modal logic, and construct the canonical coalgebras to prove a completeness result.</description>

      <title>Multi-Step Deductive Reasoning Over Natural Language: An Empirical Study on Out-of-Distribution Generalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining deep learning with symbolic logic reasoning aims to capitalize on the success of both fields and is drawing increasing attention. Inspired by DeepLogic, an end-to-end model trained to perform inference on logic programs, we introduce IMA-GloVe-GA, an iterative neural inference network for multi-step reasoning expressed in natural language. In our model, reasoning is performed using an iterative memory neural network based on RNN with a gated attention mechanism. We evaluate IMA-GloVe-GA on three datasets: PARARULES, CONCEPTRULES V1 and CONCEPTRULES V2. Experimental results show DeepLogic with gated attention can achieve higher test accuracy than DeepLogic and other RNN baseline models. Our model achieves better out-of-distribution generalisation than RoBERTa-Large when the rules have been shuffled. Furthermore, to address the issue of unbalanced distribution of reasoning depths in the current multi-step reasoning datasets, we develop PARARULE-Plus, a large dataset with more examples that require deeper reasoning steps. Experimental results show that the addition of PARARULE-Plus can increase the model's performance on examples requiring deeper reasoning depths. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/Strong-AI-Lab/Multi-Step-Deductive-Reasoning-Over-Natural-Language.</description>

      <title>Free Doubly-Infinitary Distributive Categories are Cartesian Closed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10447v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We delve into the concept of categories with products that distribute over coproducts, which we call doubly-infinitary distributive categories. We show various instances of doubly-infinitary distributive categories aiming for a comparative analysis with established notions such as extensivity, infinitary distributiveness, and cartesian closedness. Our exploration reveals that this condition represents a substantial extension beyond the classical understanding of infinitary distributive categories. Our main theorem establishes that free doubly-infinitary distributive categories are cartesian closed. We end the paper with remarks on non-canonical isomorphisms, open questions, and future work.</description>
