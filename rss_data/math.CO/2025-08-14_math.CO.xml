      <title>K-promotion on m-packed labelings of posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schutzenberger's promotion operator, pro, is a fundamental map in dynamical algebraic combinatorics. At first, its action was mainly considered on standard Young tableaux. But pro was subsequently shown to have interesting properties when applied to natural labelings of other posets. Pechenik defined a K-theoretic version of promotion, pro_K, on m-packed labelings of tableaux. The operator pro was then extended to increasing labelings of other posets. The purpose of the current work is to show that the original action of pro_K on m-packed labelings yields interesting results when applied to partially ordered sets in general, and to rooted trees in particular. We show that under certain conditions, the sizes of the orbits and order of pro_K exhibit nice divisibility properties. We also completely determine, for certain values of m, the orbit sizes for the action on various types of rooted trees such as extended stars, combs, zippers, and a type of three-leaved tree.</description>

      <title>The connectivity dimension of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the connectivity dimension of a graph. We introduce this concept in analogy to the metric dimension of a graph, providing a graph parameter that measures the heterogeneity of the connectivity structure of a graph. We fully characterize extremal examples and present explicit constructions of infinitely many graphs realizing any prescribed non-extremal connectivity dimension. We also establish a general lower bound in terms of the graph's block structure, linking the parameter to classical notions from graph theory. Finally, we prove that the problem of computing the connectivity dimension is NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Lights Out On Nearly Complete Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalization of the game Lights Out in which the standard square grid board is replaced by a graph. We examine the probability that, when a graph is chosen uniformly at random from the set of graphs with $n$ vertices and $e$ edges, the resulting game of Lights Out is universally solvable. Our work focuses on nearly complete graphs, graphs for which $e$ is close to $\binom{n}{2}$. For large values of $n$, we prove that, among nearly complete graphs, the probability of selecting a graph that gives a universally solvable game of Lights Out is maximized when $e = \binom{n}{2} - \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor$. More specifically, we prove that for any fixed integer $m &gt; 0$, as $n$ approaches $\infty$, this value of $e$ maximizes the probability over all values of $e$ from $\binom{n}{2} - \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor - m$ to $\binom{n}{2}$.</description>

      <title>All Type-2 isomorphic circulant graphs of $C_{16}(R)$ and $C_{24}(S)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circulant graphs $C_n(R)$ and $C_n(S)$ are said to be \emph{Adam's isomorphic} or {\em Type-1 isomorphic} if there exist some $a\in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$ such that $S = a R$ under arithmetic reflexive modulo $n$ \cite{ad67}. In 1970, Elspas and Turner \cite{eltu} raised a question on the isomorphism of $C_{16}(1,2,7)$ and $C_{16}(2,3,5)$ and in 1996, Vilfred \cite{v96} gave its answer by defining Type-2 isomorphism of $C_n(R)$ w.r.t. $m$ $\ni$ $m$ = $\gcd(n, r) &gt; 1$, $r\in R$ and $r,n\in\mathbb{N}$ and studied such graphs for $m$ = 2 in \cite{v13,v20}. Vilfred and Wilson \cite{vw1} - \cite{vw3} obtained families of Type-2 isomorphic circulant graphs for $m$ = 3,5,7. In this paper, the author modifies the definition of Type-2 isomorphism of circulant graphs $C_n(R)$ w.r.t. $m$ by considering $m &gt; 1$ is a divisor of $\gcd(n, r)$ and $r\in R$ and study Type-2 isomorphic circulant graphs of orders 16 and 24. We show that the number of pairs of Type-2 isomorphic circulant graphs of orders 16 and 24 are 8 and 32, respectively and list them all.</description>

      <title>Equality in the linear algebra bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some examples when there is actually an equality in the linear algebra bound. When the vectors considered span in fact the entire space. We would like to point out that in some cases this provides some interesting extra information about the extremal configuration. We obtain results on set families satisfying conditions on pairwise intersections, or Hamming distances. Also, we have an application to 2-distance sets in Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Pretty good state transfer in Grover walks on abelian Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study pretty good state transfer (PGST) in Grover walks on graphs. We consider transfer of quantum states that are localized at the vertices of a graph and we use Chebyshev polynomials to analyze PGST between such states. In general, we find a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of PGST on graphs. We then focus our analysis on abelian Cayley graphs and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of PGST on such graphs. Consequently, we obtain a complete characterization of PGST on unitary Cayley graphs. Our results yield infinite families of graphs that exhibit PGST but fail to exhibit perfect state transfer.</description>

      <title>Parking functions and chip-firing on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a connected graph $G$ with sink vertex $q$, a $G$-parking function is a vector of nonnegative integers whose entries are determined by cut-sets in $G$. Such objects also arise as the superstable configurations in the context of chip-firing. The set of all $G$-parking functions have various algebraic and combinatorial properties; for instance they relate to evaluations of the Tutte polynomial and in particular are counted by spanning trees of $G$. We extend these constructions to the setting of hypergraphs, where edges can have multiple vertices. For a hypergraph $H$ with sink $q$, we define $H$-parking functions in terms of cuts in $H$ and prove that the maximal such sequences are characterized by certain acyclic orientations of $H$. We introduce a notion of a $q$-rooted spanning tree for $H$, and prove that the set of all such objects are counted by $H$-parking functions. We also show how $H$-parking functions can be recovered as the superstable configurations in a version of chip-firing on $H$, where chips have a choice of where to go when fired. We prove that one can recover such configurations via chip-firing on a family of digraphs associated to $H$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing $A_\sigma$-minimizer graphs: given order and independence number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given graph $G$, let $A(G)$, $Q(G)$, and $D(G)$ denote the adjacency matrix, signless Laplacian matrix, and diagonal degree matrix of $G$, respectively. The $A_\sigma(G)$ matrix, proposed by Nikiforov, is defined as $A_\sigma(G)=\sigma D(G)+(1 - \sigma)A(G)$, where $\sigma\in[0,1]$. This matrix captures the gradual transition from $A(G)$ to $Q(G)$. Let $\mathcal{G}_{n,\alpha}$ denote the family of all connected graphs with $n$ vertices and independence number $\alpha$. A graph in $\mathcal{G}_{n,\alpha}$ is referred to as an $A_\sigma$-minimizer graph if it achieves the minimum $A_\sigma$ spectral radius. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the $A_\sigma$-minimizer graph in $\mathcal{G}_{n,\alpha}$ must be a tree when $\alpha\geq\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$, and we provide several characterizations of such $A_\sigma$-minimizer graphs. We then specifically characterize the $A_\sigma$-minimizer graphs for the case $\alpha = \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil + 1$. Furthermore, we obtain a structural characterization for the $A_\sigma$-minimizer graph when $\alpha=n - c$, where $c\geq4$ is an integer. Finally, we identify 17 potential $A_\sigma$-minimizer graphs within $\mathcal{G}_{n,n - 4}$, thereby extending the results of Liu and Wang [9].</description>

Abstract: Tame SL$_2$-tilings are related to Farey graph and friezes; much less is known about wild (not tame) SL$_2$-tilings. In this note, we demonstrate SL$_2$-tilings that are maximally wild: we prove that the maximum wild density of an integer SL$_2$-tiling is $\tfrac25$ and present SL$_2$-tilings over $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ with wild density 1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Brown-Erd\H{o}s-S\'os conjecture from 1973 states, in an equivalent form, that for any fixed $\delta&gt;0$ and integer $k\geq 3$ every sufficiently large linear $3$-uniform hypergraph of size $\delta n^2$ contains some $k$ edges spanning at most $k+3$ vertices. We prove it to hold for $\delta&gt;4/5$, establishing the first bound of this kind.</description>

      <title>The zero blocking numbers of grid graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a zero forcing process, vertices of a graph are colored black and white initially, and if there exists a black vertex adjacent to exactly one white vertex, then the white vertex is forced to be black. A zero blocking set is an initial set of white vertices in a zero forcing process such that ultimately there exists a white vertex. The zero blocking number is the minimum size of a zero blocking set. This paper gives the exact value of the zero blocking number of grid graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the group algebras of the symmetric and hyperoctahedral groups, one has their descent algebras and families of Eulerian idempotents. These idempotents are known to generate group representations with topological interpretations, as the cohomology of configuration spaces of types A and B. We provide an analogous cohomological interpretation for the representations generated by idempotents in the peak algebra, called the peak representations. We describe the peak representations as sums of Thrall's higher Lie characters, give Hilbert series and branching rule recursions for them, and discuss a connection to Jordan brackets.</description>

      <title>On finiteness of spectral radius order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of spectral radius order plays an crucial role in the breakthrough work on equiangular lines due to Jiang, Tidor, Yao, Zhang, and Zhao [Ann. of Math. (2) 194 (2021), no. 3, 729-743]. However, it is difficult to calculate the spectral radius order explicitly in general, or even to characterize numbers with finite spectral radius order. In this paper, we characterize numbers with finite spectral radius orders in two special classes: quadratic algebraic integers and the numbers no larger than 2. Additionally, we derive precise values of the spectral radius order of two infinite families of quadratic algebraic integers.</description>

      <title>Regularity for hypergraphs with bounded VC$_2$ dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Szemer\'edi's graph regularity lemma is an indispensable tool for studying extremal problems in graph theory, using it comes with a hefty price, since a worst-case graph may only have regular partitions of tower-type size. It is thus sensible to ask if there is some natural restriction which forces graphs to have much smaller regular partitions. A celebrated result of this type, due to Alon-Fischer-Newman and Lov\'asz-Szegedy, states that for graphs of bounded VC dimension, one can reduce the tower-type bounds to polynomial.
  The graph regularity lemma has been extended to the setting of $k$-graphs by Gowers, Nagle-R\"odl-Schacht-Skokan, and Tao. Unfortunately, these lemmas come with even larger Ackermann-type bounds. Chernikov-Starchenko and Fox-Pach-Suk considered a strong notion of $k$-graph VC dimension and proved that $k$-graphs of bounded VC dimension have regular partitions of polynomial size. Shelah introduced a weaker and combinatorially natural notion of dimension, called VC$_2$ dimension, which has since been extensively studied. In particular, Chernikov, Towsner, Terry, and Wolf asked if one can improve the worst case bounds for 3-graph regularity when the 3-graph has bounded VC$_2$ dimension. Our main result in this paper answers this question positively in the following strong sense: in the setting of bounded VC$_2$ dimension, one can reduce the bounds for 3-graph regularity by one level in Ackermann hierarchy. Furthermore, our new bound is best possible.
  Our proof has two key steps. We first introduce a new method for designing regularity lemmas for graphs of bounded VC dimension, based on the cylinder regularity lemma. We then prove a hypergraph version of the cylinder regularity lemma, which allows us to extend this method to hypergraphs. We also highlight a few other applications of this cylinder regularity lemma, which we expect to find many other uses.</description>

      <title>Planar graphs embedded in generic ways and realizing them as Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with long-time interest of us, especially, the author, in realizing graphs as Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions of certain nice classes.
  The Reeb graph of a differentiable function is the set consisting of all components of preimages of all single points and endowed with the quotient topology canonically. In tame cases, such objects are graphs. The Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere of dimension at least $2$ is a graph with exactly one edge and homeomorphic to a closed interval. These graphs have been fundamental and strong tools in geometry since theory of Morse functions has been established in the former half of the last century.
  We present a new answer to the problem, saying that generically embedded planar graphs are homeomorphic to the Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions obtained by elementary polynomials and elementary procedures.</description>

      <title>The partition function and elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recast congruences for the partition function through the geometry of supersingular elliptic curves. For primes $\ell\ge5$ inert in $K_n=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{1-24n})$ (equivalently $\big(\tfrac{1-24n}{\ell}\big)=-1$), we show that $p(n)\pmod{\ell}$ is a "supersingular trace'' on $X_0(6)$: a computable dot product on the level-$6$ Brandt module that is a twisted analogue of the Deuring--Eichler formula for class numbers. In the ramified case $\ell\in\{5,7,11\}$ (i.e. $\ell\mid(1-24n)$), a geometric "bonus valuation'' along supersingular fibers forces Ramanujan's congruences \[ p(5n+4)\equiv0\pmod5,\qquad p(7n+5)\equiv0\pmod7,\qquad p(11n+6)\equiv0\pmod{11}. \] This phenomenon occurs because the supersingular $j$-invariants on $X_0(6)_{\mathbb{F}_\ell}$ for these primes lie over $\{0,1728\}$, allowing a certain Serre-Tate pullback to be regular at every supersingular point.</description>

      <title>Congruences modulo powers of $7$ for $k$-elongated plane partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enumeration $d_k(n)$ of $k$-elongated plane partition diamonds has emerged as a generalization of the classical integer partition function $p(n)$. Congruences for $d_k(n)$ modulo certain powers of primes have been proven via elementary means and modular forms by many authors. Recently, Banerjee and Smoot established an infinite family of congruences for $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of 5. In this paper we have discovered an infinite congruence family for $d_3(n)$ and $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of 7.</description>

      <title>Quivers and BPS states in 3d and 4d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a symmetrization relation between BPS quivers encoding 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories and symmetric quivers associated to 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories. We analyse in detail the symmetrization of BPS quivers for a series of $A_m$ Argyres-Douglas theories by engineering 3d-4d systems in geometric backgrounds involving appropriate 3-manifolds and Riemann surfaces. We discuss properties of these geometric backgrounds and derive the corresponding quiver partition functions from the perspective of skein modules, which forms the foundation of the symmetrization map for the minimal chamber. We also prove that the structure of wall-crossing in 4d $A_m$ Argyres-Douglas theories is isomorphic to the structure of unlinking of symmetric quivers encoding their partner 3d theories, which allows for a proper definition of the symmetrization map outside the minimal chamber. Finally, we show that the Schur indices of 4d theories are captured by symmetric quivers that include symmetrization of 4d BPS quivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish multiple recurrence results for pretentious measure-preserving multiplicative actions along generalized Pythagorean triples, that is, solutions to the equation $ax^2 + b y^2 = c z^2$. This confirms the ergodic-theoretic form of the generalized Pythagorean partition regularity conjecture in this critical case of structured measure-preserving actions. As a consequence of our main theorem, any finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ generated by the level sets of finitely many pretentious completely multiplicative functions, must contain a monochromatic generalized Pythagorean triple.</description>

      <title>New examples of $M\setminus L$: intruder sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit new examples of regions of $M\setminus L$ where $M$ and $L$ denote the Markov and Lagrange spectra, respectively. These regions have a different nature from all known regions studied so far: they contain \emph{intruder sets} associated with distinct combinatorics that trespass the region where self-replication holds. Our construction follows the usual self-replication method but replaces the standard local uniqueness condition with a more flexible and weaker property. These examples emerged from a large-scale computational search for regions of $M\setminus L$, which indicates that many such regions with intruder sets exist. We conclude with some open problems about these new regions.</description>

      <title>On the evolution of structure in triangle-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the typical structure and the number of triangle-free graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges where $m$ is large enough so that a typical triangle-free graph has a cut containing nearly all of its edges, but may not be bipartite.
  Erd\H{o}s, Kleitman, and Rothschild showed that almost every triangle-free graph is bipartite. Osthus, Pr\"omel, and Taraz later showed that for $m \ge (1+\epsilon)\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}n^{3/2}\sqrt{\log n}$, almost every triangle-free graph on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges is bipartite. Here we give a precise characterization of the distribution of edges within each part of the max cut of a uniformly chosen triangle-free graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, for a larger range of densities with $m=\Theta(n^{3/2} \sqrt{\log n})$. Using this characterization, we describe the evolution of the structure of typical triangle-free graphs as the density changes. We show that as the number of edges decreases below $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} n^{3/2}\sqrt{\log n}$, the following structural changes occur in $G$:
  -Isolated edges, then trees, then more complex subgraphs emerge as `defect edges', edges within parts of a max cut of $G$. The distribution of defect edges is first that of independent Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs, then that of independent exponential random graphs, conditioned on a small maximum degree and no triangles.
  -There is a sharp threshold for $3$-colorability at $m \sim \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} n^{3/2}\sqrt{\log n}$ and a sharp threshold between $4$-colorability and unbounded chromatic number at $m\sim\frac{1}{4}n^{3/2}\sqrt{\log n}$.
  -Giant components emerge in the defect edges at $m\sim\frac{1}{4} n^{3/2}\sqrt{\log n}$. We use these results to prove asymptotic formulas for the number of triangle-free graphs at these densities. We likewise prove analogous results for the random graph $G(n,p)$ conditioned on triangle-freeness.</description>

      <title>The polytope of all matroids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is possible to write the indicator function of any matroid polytope as an integer combination of indicator functions of Schubert matroid polytopes. In this way, every matroid on $n$ elements of rank $r$ can be thought of as a lattice point in the space having a coordinate for each Schubert matroid on $n$ elements of rank $r$.
  We study the convex hull of all these lattice points, with particular focus on the vertices, which come from the matroids we call extremal matroids. We show that several famous classes of matroids arise as faces of the polytopes, and in many cases we determine the dimension of this face explicitly. As an application, we show that there exist valuative invariants that attain non-negative values at all representable matroids, but fail to be non-negative in general.</description>

      <title>A Tutte-type canonical decomposition of 3- and 4-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a unique decomposition of every 4-connected graph into parts that are either quasi-5-connected, cycles of triangle-torsos and 3-connected torsos on $\leq 5$ vertices, generalised double-wheels, or thickened $K_{4,m}$'s. The decomposition can be described in terms of a tree-decomposition but with edges allowed in the adhesion-sets. Our construction is explicit, canonical, and exhibits a defining property of the Tutte-decomposition.
  As a corollary, we obtain a new Tutte-type canonical decomposition of 3-connected graphs into parts that are either quasi-4-connected, generalised wheels or thickened $K_{3,m}$'s. This decomposition is similar yet different from the tri-separation decomposition.
  As an application of the decomposition for 4-connectivity, we obtain a new theorem characterising all quasi-4-connected vertex-transitive finite graphs as essentially quasi-5-connected or on a short explicit list of graphs.</description>

Abstract: We give a uniform and self-contained proof that if $G$ is a connected graph with $\chi(G) = \Delta(G)$ and $G\neq \overline{C_7}$, then $G$ contains either $K_{\Delta(G)}$ or an odd hole where every vertex has degree at least $\Delta(G)-1$ in $G$. This was previously proved in series of two papers by Chen, Lan, Lin, and Zhou, who used the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem for the cases $\Delta(G)=4, 5, 6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture of Simon (1994) states that any pure $d$-dimensional shellable complex on $n$ vertices can be extended to $\Delta_{n-1}^{(d)}$, the $d$-skeleton of the $(n-1)$-dimensional simplex, by attaching one facet at a time while maintaining shellability.
  The notion of $k$-decomposability for simplicial complexes, which generalizes shellability, was introduced by Provan and Billera (1980). Coleman, Dochtermann, Geist, and Oh (2022) showed that any pure $d$-dimensional $0$-decomposable complex on $n$ vertices can similarly be extended to $\Delta_{n-1}^{(d)}$, attaching one facet at a time while preserving $0$-decomposability.
  In this paper, we investigate the analogous question for $1$-decomposable complexes. We prove a slightly relaxed version: any pure $d$-dimensional $1$-decomposable complex on $n$ vertices can be extended to $\Delta_{n + d - 3}^{(d)}$, attaching one facet at a time while maintaining $1$-decomposability.</description>

Abstract: The Brouwer conjecture (BC) in spectral graph theory claims that the sum of the largest k Kirchhoff eigenvalues of a graph are bounded above by the number m of edges plus k(k+1)/2. We show that (BC) holds for all graphs with n vertices if n is larger or equal than 4 times the square of the maximal vertex degree. We also note that (BC) for graphs implies (BC) for quivers.</description>

Our formula implies that the homogenization of $\mathfrak G_w$ has M-convex support. We also show that for any fireworks permutation $w\in S_n$, there exists a layered permutation $\pi(w)\in S_n$ so that $\mathrm{supp}(\mathfrak G_{\pi(w)})\supseteq \mathrm{supp}(\mathfrak G_w)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.14052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of probability measures in terms of moments by applying operators to their Bessel generating functions. We consider a general setting of applying operators such as the Dunkl operator to formal power series that are symmetric or symmetric in all but one variable. Afterwards, we apply the results from this setting by considering Bessel generating functions as the formal power series to obtain a Law of Large Numbers as $N$, the number of variables, increases to infinity and $N^c\beta$ converges to a constant, where $c\in (-\infty, 1)$. In contrast with previous results, we consider when the scaled partial derivatives of the logarithms of the Bessel generating functions evaluated at the origin can have nonzero $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit when any number of variables is involved. Then, the free cumulant of order $k$ is a linear combination of the limits of the order $k$ partial derivatives.</description>

      <title>Circle Squaring with Pieces of Small Boundary and Low Borel Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tarski's Circle Squaring Problem from 1925 asks whether it is possible to partition a disk in the plane into finitely many pieces and reassemble them via isometries to yield a partition of a square of the same area. It was finally resolved by Laczkovich in 1990 in the affirmative. Recently, several new proofs have emerged which achieve circle squaring with better structured pieces: namely, pieces which are Lebesgue measurable and have the property of Baire (Grabowski-M\'ath\'e-Pikhurko) or even are Borel (Marks-Unger).
  In this paper, we show that circle squaring is possible with Borel pieces of positive Lebesgue measure whose boundaries have upper Minkowski dimension less than 2 (in particular, each piece is Jordan measurable). We also improve the Borel complexity of the pieces: namely, we show that each piece can be taken to be a Boolean combination of $F_\sigma$ sets. This is a consequence of our more general result that applies to any two bounded subsets of $R^k$, $k\ge 1$, of equal positive measure whose boundaries have upper Minkowski dimension smaller than $k$.</description>

Abstract: Let $(W,S)$ be an affine Coxeter system of type $\widetilde{B}$ or $\widetilde{D}$ and ${\rm TL}(W)$ the corresponding generalized Temperley-Lieb algebra. In this paper we define an infinite dimensional associative algebra made of decorated diagrams that is isomorphic to ${\rm TL}(W)$. Moreover, we describe an explicit basis for such an algebra consisting of special decorated diagrams that we call admissible. Such basis is in bijective correspondence with the classical monomial basis of the generalized Temperley-Lieb algebra indexed by the fully commutative elements of $W$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a non-negative integer. Combining algebraic and combinatorial techniques, we investigate for which pairs $(G,\rho)$ of a subgroup $G$ of the symmetric group $S_n$ and an irreducible character $\rho$ of $G$ the induced character $\rho\!\uparrow^{S_n}$ is multiplicity-free. As a result, for $n\geq 66$, we classify all subgroups $G\leq S_n$ which give rise to such a pair. Moreover, for the majority of these groups $G$ we identify all the possible choices of the irreducible character $\rho$, assuming $n\geq 73$.</description>

      <title>Transformation representations of diagram monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain formulae for the minimum transformation degrees of the most well-studied families of finite diagram monoids, including the partition, Brauer, Temperley--Lieb and Motzkin monoids. For example, the partition monoid $P_n$ has degree $1 + \frac{B(n+2)-B(n+1)+B(n)}2$ for $n\geq2$, where these are Bell numbers. The proofs involve constructing explicit faithful representations of the minimum degree, many of which can be realised as (partial) actions on projections.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative marked surfaces II: tagged triangulations, clusters, and their symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20393v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to define noncommutative cluster structure on several algebras ${\mathcal A}$ related to marked surfaces possibly with orbifold points of various orders, which includes noncommutative clusters, i.e., embeddings of a given group $G$ into the multiplicative monoid ${\mathcal A}^\times$ and an action of a certain braid-like group $Br_{\mathcal A}$ by automorphisms of each cluster group in a compatible way. For punctured surfaces we construct new symmetries, noncommutative tagged clusters and establish a noncommutative Laurent Phenomenon.</description>
