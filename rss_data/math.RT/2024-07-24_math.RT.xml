      <title>Two proofs of a Jantzen Conjecture for Whittaker Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a filtration of a standard Whittaker module over a complex semisimple Lie algebra and and establish its fundamental properties. Our filtration specialises to the Jantzen filtration of a Verma module for a certain choice of parameter. We prove that embeddings of standard Whittaker modules are strict with respect to our filtration, and that the filtration layers are semisimple. This provides a generalisation of the Jantzen conjectures to Whittaker modules. We prove these statements in two ways. First, we give an algebraic proof which compares Whittaker modules to Verma modules using a functor introduced by Backelin. Second, we give a geometric proof using mixed twistor $\mathcal{D}$-modules.</description>

      <title>Miura operators as R-matrices from M-brane intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that Miura operators are R-matrices of certain infinite-dimensional quantum algebras. We test our proposal by realizing Miura operators of $q$-deformed $W$- and $Y$-algebras in terms of R-matrices of the quantum toroidal algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$. Physically, the representations of this toroidal algebra arise from the algebra of local operators on M2-branes and M5-branes, in M-theory subject to an $\Omega$-background. We associate an R-matrix to each M2-M5 brane crossing, by studying its description as a gauge-invariant intersection of a topological line defect and a holomorphic surface defect in 5-dimensional non-commutative Chern-Simons theory. The Miura transformation is engineered using multiple M2-M5 intersections, relying crucially on the properties of the underlying R-matrices. We thereby identify each R-matrix with a Miura operator. In a dual Type IIB frame, the components of the Miura transformation are shown to coincide with the half-index of a 3d supersymmetric gauge theory on a Hanany-Witten system of D3-NS5 branes. As a further application, we demonstrate that $qq$-characters can be algebraically constructed from the Miura transformation.</description>

      <title>Resolutions of symmetric ideals via stratifications of derived categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to unify various stability results about symmetric ideals in polynomial rings by stratifying related derived categories. We execute this idea for chains of $GL_n$-equivariant modules over an infinite field $k$ of positive characteristic. We prove the Le--Nagel--Nguyen--R\"omer conjectures for such sequences and obtain stability patterns in their resolutions as corollaries of our main result, which is a semiorthogonal decomposition for the bounded derived category of $GL_{\infty}$-equivariant modules over $S = k[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n, \ldots]$. Our method relies on finite generation results for certain local cohomology modules. We also outline approaches (i) to investigate Koszul duality for $S$-modules taking the Frobenius homomorphism (of $GL_{\infty}$) into account, and (ii) to recover and extend Murai's results about free resolutions of symmetric monomial ideals.</description>

      <title>A higher index on finite-volume locally symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected, real semisimple Lie group. Let $K&lt;G$ be maximal compact, and let $\Gamma &lt; G$ be discrete and such that $\Gamma \backslash G$ has finite volume. If the real rank of $G$ is $1$ and $\Gamma$ is torsion-free, then Barbasch and Moscovici obtained an index theorem for Dirac operators on the locally symmetric space $\Gamma \backslash G/K$. We obtain a higher version of this, by constructing an index of Dirac operators on $G/K$ in the $K$-theory of an algebra on which the conjugation-invariant terms in Barbasch and Moscovici's index theorem define continuous traces. The resulting index theorems also apply when $\Gamma$ has torsion. The cases of these index theorems for traces defined by semisimple orbital integrals extend to Song and Tang's higher orbital integrals, and yield nonzero and computable results even when $\operatorname{rank}(G)&gt; \operatorname{rank}(K)$, or the real rank of $G$ is larger than $1$.</description>

      <title>Partially wrapped Fukaya categories of orbifold surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a complete description of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of graded orbifold surfaces with stops. We show that a construction via global sections of a natural cosheaf of A$_\infty$ categories on a Lagrangian core of the surface is equivalent to a global construction via the (equivariant) orbit category of a smooth cover. We therefore establish the local-to-global properties of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of orbifold surfaces closely paralleling a proposal by Kontsevich for Fukaya categories of smooth Weinstein manifolds.
  From the viewpoint of Weinstein sectorial descent in the sense of Ganatra, Pardon and Shende, our results show that orbifold surfaces also have Weinstein sectors of type $\mathrm D$ besides the type $\mathrm A$ or type $\widetilde{\mathrm A}$ sectors on smooth surfaces.
  We describe the global sections of the cosheaf explicitly for any generator given by an admissible dissection of the orbifold surface and we give a full classification of the formal generators which arise in this way. This shows in particular that the partially wrapped Fukaya category of an orbifold surface can always be described as the perfect derived category of a graded associative algebra. We conjecture that associative algebras obtained from dissections of orbifold surfaces form a new class of associative algebras closed under derived equivalence.</description>

      <title>On overgroups of distinguished unipotent elements in reductive groups and finite groups of Lie type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose $G$ is a simple algebraic group defined over an algebraically closed field of good characteristic $p$. In 2018 Korhonen showed that if $H$ is a connected reductive subgroup of $G$ which contains a distinguished unipotent element $u$ of $G$ of order $p$, then $H$ is $G$-irreducible in the sense of Serre. We present a short and uniform proof of this result using so-called good $A_1$ subgroups of $G$, introduced by Seitz. We also formulate a counterpart of Korhonen's theorem for overgroups of $u$ which are finite groups of Lie type. Moreover, we generalize both results above by removing the restriction on the order of $u$ under a mild condition on $p$ depending on the rank of $G$, and we present an analogue of Korhonen's theorem for Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Schubert calculus and geometric Satake</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00855v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main classical result of Schubert calculus is that multiplication rules for the basis of Schubert cycles inside the cohomology ring of the Grassmannian $G(n,m)$ are the same as multiplication rules for the basis of Schur polynomials in the ring of symmetric polynomials. In this paper, we explain how to recover this somewhat mysterious connection by using the geometric Satake correspondence to put the structure of a representation of $GL_m$ on $H^\bullet(G(n,m))$ and comparing it to the Fock space representation on symmetric polynomials. This proof also extends to equivariant Schubert calculus, and gives an explanation of the relationship between torus-equivariant cohomology of Grassmannians and double Schur polynomials.</description>

      <title>Generalised spherical minors and their relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let H be a spherical subgroup of minimal rank of the semisimple simply connected complex algebraic group G. We define some functions on the homogeneous space G/H that we call generalised spherical minors. When G = H x H, we recover Fomin-Zelevinsky generalised minors. We prove that generalised spherical minors satisfy some integer coefficients polynomial relations, that extend the identities of classical generalised minors due to Fomin and Zelevinsky, and that have the shape of exchange relations of LP-algebras.</description>

      <title>Remarks on symmetric fusion categories of low rank in positive characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give lower bounds for the rank of a symmetric fusion category in characteristic $p\geq 5$ in terms of $p$. We prove that the second Adams operation $\psi_2$ is not the identity for any non-trivial symmetric fusion category, and that symmetric fusion categories satisfying $\psi_2^a=\psi_2^{a-1}$ for some positive integer $a$ are super Tannakian. As an application, we classify all symmetric fusion categories of rank 3 and those of rank 4 with exactly two self dual simple objects.</description>

Abstract: We construct a family of unoriented 2-dimensional cobordism theories parametrized by certain triples of sequences. We also prove that some specializations of these sequences yield equivalences with an exterior product of Deligne categories. In particular, one of these specializations recovers the generalized Deligne category $\operatorname{Rep}(S_t\wr \mathbb Z_2)$.</description>

      <title>Moduli spaces of quadratic differentials: Abel-Jacobi map and deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the moduli space of framed quadratic differentials with prescribed singularities parameterized by a decorated marked surface with punctures (DMSp), where simple zeros, double poles and higher order poles respectively correspond to decorations, punctures and boundary components. We show that the fundamental group of this space equals the kernel of the Abel-Jacobi (AJ) map from the surface mapping class group of DMSp to the first homology group of the marked surface (without decorations/punctures). Moreover, a universal cover of this space is given by the space of stability conditions on the associated 3-Calabi-Yau category.
  Furthermore, when we partially compactify and orbifold this moduli space by allowing the collision of simple zeros and some of the double poles, the resulting moduli space is isomorphic to a quotient of the space of stability conditions on the deformed (with respect to those collidable double poles) 3-Calabi-Yau category.
  Finally, we show that the fundamental group of this partially compactified orbifold equals the quotient group of the kernel of the AJ map by the square of any point-pushing diffeomorphism around any collidable double pole. This construction can produces any non-exceptional spherical/Euclidean Artin braid groups.</description>
