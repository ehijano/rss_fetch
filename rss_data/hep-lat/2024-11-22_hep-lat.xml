      <title>Determining the Quark Mass with the Gradient Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method to determine the quark mass by using bilinear operators of the flowed quark field defined within the gradient-flow formalism. This method enables the quark mass determination through a comparison of perturbative calculations with lattice data. The gauge-invariant nature of the observable should allow clear control over perturbative errors. At the same time, the gradient flow suppresses the noise in the lattice measurements of the observable, which simply consists of one-point functions. Concerning the perturbative input in this framework, we study the mass dependence of the flowed quark condensate $\langle \bar{\chi}(t,x) \chi(t,x) \rangle$ at the two-loop level. For this purpose, we develop a novel approach for expanding massive gradient-flow integrals in the limit of small and large $(m^2t)$. We also present a fully numerical result which includes the full mass dependence.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD study of color correlations between static quarks with gluonic excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the color correlation between static quark and antiquark ($q\bar q$) that is accompanied by gluonic excitations in the confined phase at $T=0$ by constructing reduced density matrices $\rho$ in color space. We perform quenched lattice QCD calculations with the Coulomb gauge adopting the standard Wilson gauge action, and the spatial volume is $L^3 = 32^3$ at $\beta = 5.8$, which corresponds to the lattice spacing $a=0.14$ fm and the system volume $L^3=4.5^3$ fm$^3$. We evaluate the color density matrix $\rho$ of static $q\bar q$ pairs in 6 channels (${\Sigma_g^+}$, ${{\Sigma_g^+}'}$, ${\Pi_u}$, ${\Pi_u'}$, ${\Delta_g}$, ${\Delta_g'}$), and investigate the interquark-distance dependence of color correlations. We find that as the interquark distance increases, the color correlation quenches because of color leak into the gluon field and finally approaches the random color configuration in the $q\bar q$ systems with and without gluonic excitations. For this color screening effect, we evaluate the "screening mass" to discuss its dependence on channels, the quantum number of the gluonic excitations.</description>

      <title>The imaginary-$\theta$ dependence of the SU($N$) spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk we will report on a study of the $\theta$-dependence of the string tension and of the mass gap of four-dimensional SU($N$) Yang--Mills theories. The spectrum at $N=3$ and $N=6$ was obtained on the lattice at various imaginary values of the $\theta$-parameter, using Parallel Tempering on Boundary Conditions to avoid topological freezing at fine lattice spacings. The coefficient of the $\mathcal{O}(\theta^2)$ term in the Taylor expansion of the spectrum around $\theta=0$ could be obtained in the continuum limit for $N=3$, and on two fairly fine lattices for $N=6$.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative thermal QCD at very high temperatures: computational strategy and hadronic screening masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a recently introduced strategy to study non-perturbatively thermal QCD up to temperatures of the order of the electro-weak scale, combining step scaling techniques and shifted boundary conditions. The former allow to renormalize the theory for a range of scales which spans several orders of magnitude with a moderate computational cost. Shifted boundary conditions remove the need for the zero temperature subtraction in the Equation of State. As a consequence, the simulated lattices do not have to accommodate two very different scales, the pion mass and the temperature, at the very same spacing. Effective field theory arguments guarantee that finite volume effects can be kept under control safely. With this strategy the first computation of the hadronic screening spectrum has been carried out over more than two orders of magnitude in the temperature, from $T\sim 1$ GeV up to $\sim 160$ GeV. This study is complemented with the first quantitative computation of the baryonic screening mass at next-to-leading order in the three-dimensional effective theory describing QCD at high temperatures. Both for the mesonic and the baryonic screening masses, the known leading behaviour in the coupling constant is found to be not sufficient to explain the non-perturbative data over the entire range of temperatures. These findings shed further light on the limited applicability of the perturbative approach at finite temperature, even at the electro-weak scale.</description>

      <title>Toward inclusive observables with staggered quarks: the smeared $R$~ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inclusive hadronic observables are ubiquitous in particle and nuclear physics. Computation of these observables using lattice QCD is challenging due the presence of a difficult inverse problem. As a stepping stone to more complicated observables, we report on progress to compute the smeared $R$~ratio with staggered quarks using the spectral reconstruction algorithm of Hansen, Lupo, and Tantalo. We compare staggered-quark results on two ensembles to domain-wall results on a single ensemble and to the Bernecker-Meyer parameterization. This work utilizes two ensembles generated by the MILC collaboration using highly improved staggered quarks and one ensemble generated by the RBC/UKQCD collaboration using domain-wall quarks. Possible strategies for controlling opposite-parity effects associated with staggered quarks are discussed.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Scattering in Ising Field Theory using Matrix Product States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study scattering in Ising Field Theory (IFT) using matrix product states and the time-dependent variational principle. IFT is a one-parameter family of strongly coupled non-integrable quantum field theories in 1+1 dimensions, interpolating between massive free fermion theory and Zamolodchikov's integrable massive $E_8$ theory. Particles in IFT may scatter either elastically or inelastically. In the post-collision wavefunction, particle tracks from all final-state channels occur in superposition; processes of interest can be isolated by projecting the wavefunction onto definite particle sectors, or by evaluating energy density correlation functions. Using numerical simulations we determine the time delay of elastic scattering and the probability of inelastic particle production as a function of collision energy. We also study the mass and width of the lightest resonance near the $E_8$ point in detail. Close to both the free fermion and $E_8$ theories, our results for both elastic and inelastic scattering are in good agreement with expectations from form-factor perturbation theory. Using numerical computations to go beyond the regime accessible by perturbation theory, we find that the high energy behavior of the two-to-two particle scattering probability in IFT is consistent with a conjecture of Zamolodchikov. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of tensor-network methods for simulating the real-time dynamics of strongly coupled quantum field theories in 1+1 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Multi-impurity method for the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-impurity method for the bond-weighted tensor renormalization group (BWTRG) to compute the higher-order moment of physical quantities in a two-dimensional system. The replacement of the bond weight with an impurity matrix in a bond-weighted triad tensor network represents a physical quantity such as the magnetization and the energy. We demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed method is much higher than the conventional tensor renormalization group for the Ising model and the 5-state Potts model. Furthermore, we perform the finite-size scaling analysis and observe that the dimensionless quantity characterizing the structure of the fixed point tensor satisfies the same scaling relation in the critical region as the Binder parameter. The estimated critical temperature dependence on the bond dimension indicates that the exponent relating the correlation length to the bond dimension varies continuously with respect to the BWTRG hyperparameter. We find that BWTRG with the optimal hyperparameter is more efficient in terms of computational time than alternative approaches based on the matrix product state in estimating the critical temperature.</description>

      <title>The nature of $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ and $T_{cc}^+\left(3875\right)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two decades ago the $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ was discovered in the hadron spectrum with two heavy quarks. The discovery fueled a surge in experimental research, uncovering dozens of so called XYZ exotics states lying outside the conventional quark model, as well as theoretical investigations into new forms of matter, such as quark-gluon hybrids, mesonic molecules, and tetraquarks, with the potential of disclosing new information about the fundamental strong force. Among the XYZs, the $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ and $T_{cc}^+\left(3875\right)$ stand out for their striking characteristics and unlashed many discussions about their nature. Here, we address this question using the Born--Oppenheimer Effective Field Theory (BOEFT) and show how QCD settles the issue of their composition. Not only we describe well the main features of the $\chi_{c1}\left(3872\right)$ and $T_{cc}^+\left(3875\right)$ but obtain also model independent predictions in the bottomonium sector. This opens the way to systematic applications of BOEFT to all XYZs.</description>

      <title>Lanczos, the transfer matrix, and the signal-to-noise problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.20009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a method for determining the energy spectrum of lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD) by applying the Lanczos algorithm to the transfer matrix and using a bootstrap generalization of the Cullum-Willoughby method to filter out spurious eigenvalues. Proof-of-principle analyses of the simple harmonic oscillator and the LQCD proton mass demonstrate that this method provides faster ground-state convergence than the "effective mass," which is related to the power-iteration algorithm. Lanczos provides more accurate energy estimates than multi-state fits to correlation functions with small imaginary times while achieving comparable statistical precision. Two-sided error bounds are computed for Lanczos results and guarantee that excited-state effects cannot shift Lanczos results far outside their statistical uncertainties. Further, Lanczos results avoid the exponential signal-to-noise degradation present in he power-iteration method / effective mass.</description>

      <title>On Holographic Vacuum Misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a bottom-up holographic model that provides the dual description of a strongly coupled field theory, in which the spontaneous breaking of an approximate global symmetry yields the SO(5)/SO(4) coset relevant to minimal composite-Higgs models. The gravity background is completely regular and smooth, and has an end of space that mimics confinement on the field theory side. We add to the gravity description a set of localised boundary terms, that introduce additional symmetry-breaking effects, capturing those that would result from coupling the dual strongly coupled field theory to an external, weakly coupled sector. Such terms encapsulate the gauging of a subgroup of the global $SO(5)$ symmetry of the dual field theory, as well as additional explicit symmetry-breaking effects. We show how to combine spurions and gauge fixing and how to take the appropriate limits, so as to respect gauge principles and avoid violations of unitarity.
  The interplay of bulk and boundary-localised couplings leads to the breaking of the SO(5) symmetry to either its SO(4) or SO(3) subgroup, via vacuum misalignment. In field theory terms, the model describes the spontaneous breaking of a SO(4) gauge symmetry to its SO(3) subgroup. We expose the implications of the higgsing phenomenon by computing the spectrum of fluctuations of the model, which we interpret in four-dimensional field-theory terms, for a few interesting choices of parameters. We conclude by commenting on the additional steps needed to build a realistic composite Higgs model.</description>

      <title>Fully heavy tetraquark resonant states with different flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the quark potential model to calculate the mass spectrum of the S-wave fully heavy tetraquark systems with different flavors, including the $ bc\bar b\bar c, bb\bar c\bar c, cc\bar c\bar b $ and $ bb\bar b\bar c $ systems. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation, and the complex scaling method to identify resonant states. The $ bc\bar b\bar c, bb\bar c\bar c, cc\bar c\bar b $ and $ bb\bar b\bar c $ resonant states are obtained in the mass regions of $ (13.2,13.5) $, $ (13.3,13.6) $, $ (10.0,10.3) $, $ (16.5,16.7) $ GeV, respectively. Among these states, the $ bc\bar b\bar c $ tetraquark states are the most promising ones to be discovered in the near future. We recommend the experimental exploration of the $ 1^{++} $ and $ 2^{++} $ $ bc\bar b\bar c $ states with masses near $ 13.3 $ GeV in the $ J/\psi\Upsilon $ channel. From the root-mean-square radii, we find that all the resonant states we have identified are compact tetraquark states.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the semileptonic decay $ \Xi^{++}_{cc}\rightarrow \Xi^+_{c} \bar{\ell}\nu_{\ell}$ within QCD sum rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00241v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the semileptonic decay of the doubly heavy baryon $ \Xi^{++}_{cc} $ into the singly heavy baryon $ \Xi^+_{c}$ within the three-point QCD sum rule approach in two possible lepton channels. Our analysis includes perturbative as well as nonperturbative condensation contributions up to dimension 5. We evaluate the form factors of this semileptonic decay entering the amplitude described by the vector and axial vector transition currents. The fit functions of the form factors with respect to the transferred momentum squared are utilized to predict the decay widths and branching ratios of the $ \Xi^{++}_{cc}\rightarrow \Xi^+_{c} \bar{\ell}\nu_{\ell}$ channels. We compare our findings with other predictions in the literature. Our outcomes can be useful for experimental groups in their search for the weak decays of doubly heavy baryons and may be checked via future experiments such as LHCb.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquark bound and resonant states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the energy spectrum of the S-wave doubly heavy tetraquark systems, including the $ QQ^{(\prime)}\bar q\bar q$, $QQ^{(\prime)}\bar s\bar q$, and $ QQ^{(\prime)}\bar s\bar s$ ($Q^{(\prime)}=b,c$ and $q=u,d$) systems within the constituent quark model. We use the complex scaling method to obtain bound states and resonant states simultaneously, and the Gaussian expansion method to solve the complex-scaled four-body Schr\"odinger equation. With a novel definition of the root-mean-square radii, we are able to distinguish between meson molecules and compact tetraquark states. The compact tetraquarks are further classified into three different types with distinct spatial configurations: compact even tetraquarks, compact diquark-antidiquark tetraquarks and compact diquark-centered tetraquarks. In the $ I(J^P)=0(1^+) $ $QQ\bar q\bar q$ system, there exists the $ D^*D $ molecular bound state with a binding energy of $ -14 $ MeV, which is the candidate for $ T_{cc}(3875)^+ $. The shallow $\bar B^*\bar B$ molecular bound state is the bottom analog of $T_{cc}(3875)^+$. Moreover, we identify two resonant states near the $D^*D^*$ and $\bar B^*\bar B^*$ thresholds. In the $ J^P=1^+ $ $bb\bar q\bar q\,(I=0)$ and $bb\bar s\bar q$ systems, we obtain deeply bound states with a compact diquark-centered tetraquark configuration and a dominant $\chi_{\bar 3_c\otimes 3_c}$ component, along with resonant states with similar configurations as their radial excitations. These states are the QCD analog of the helium atom. We also obtain some other bound states and resonant states with ``QCD hydrogen molecule" configurations. Moreover, we investigate the heavy quark mass dependence of the $ I(J^P)=0(1^+) $ $ QQ\bar q\bar q $ bound states. We strongly urge the experimental search for the predicted states.</description>
