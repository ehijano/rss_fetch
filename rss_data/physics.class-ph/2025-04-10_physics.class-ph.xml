      <title>Artificial intelligence in creating, representing or expressing an immersive soundscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In today's tech-driven world, significant advancements in artificial intelligence and virtual reality have emerged. These developments drive research into exploring their intersection in the realm of soundscape. Not only do these technologies raise questions about how they will revolutionize the way we design and create soundscapes, but they also draw significant inquiries into their impact on human perception, understanding, and expression of auditory environments. This paper aims to review and discuss the latest applications of artificial intelligence in this domain. It explores how artificial intelligence can be utilized to create a virtual reality immersive soundscape, exploiting its ability to recognize complex patterns in various forms of data. This includes translating between different modalities such as text, sounds, and animations as well as predicting and generating data across these domains. It addresses questions surrounding artificial intelligence's capacity to predict, detect, and comprehend soundscape data, ultimately aiming to bridge the gap between sound and other forms of human-readable data.  1.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-Drude dipoles in the radiative limit and their modeling in finite-difference time-domain methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lorentz-Drude model for electric dipoles is a classical framework widely used in the study of dipole dynamics and light-matter interactions. Here we focus on the behaviors of Lorentz-Drude dipoles when their radiative rate dominates their energy loss. We show that dipole radiation losses do not count toward phenomenological dipole losses if the driving field is interpreted as the total field at the dipole. In particular, if the dipole does not contain non-radiative losses, then the Lorentz-Drude damping term should be removed. This is verified by self-consistent implementations of point dipoles in finite-difference time-domain simulations, which also provide a method to directly compute the transport properties of light when dipoles are present.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained entropy balance of the Szilard engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to reconcile the entropy reduction of a system through external interventions that are linked to a measurement with the second law of thermodynamics, there are two main proposals: (i) The entropy reduction is compensated by the entropy increase as a result of the measurement on the system (``Szilard principle"). (ii) The entropy reduction is compensated by the entropy increase as a result of the erasure of the measurement results (``Landauer/Bennett principle"). It seems that the LB principle is widely accepted in the scientific debate. In contrast, in this paper we argue for a modified S principle and criticize the LB principle with regard to various points. Our approach is based on the concept of ``conditional action", which is developed in detail. To illustrate our theses, we consider the entropy balance of a variant of the well-known Szilard engine, understood as a classical mechanical system.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Helicity in Twisted Cavity Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through left- or right-handed twisting, we investigate the impact of mirror-asymmetry (chirality) of the conducting boundary conditions of an equilaterial triangular cross-section electromagnetic resonator. We observe the generation of eigenmodes with non-zero electromagnetic helicity as a result of the coupling of near degenerate TE$_{11(p+1)}$ and TM$_{11p}$ modes. This can be interpreted as an emergence of magneto-electric coupling, which in turn produces a measurable shift in resonant mode frequency as a function of twist angle. We show that this coupling mechanism is equivalent to introducing a non-zero chirality material parameter $\kappa_\text{eff}$ or axion field $\theta_{\text{eff}}$ to the medium. Our findings demonstrate the potential for real-time, macroscopic manipulation of electromagnetic helicity.</description>
