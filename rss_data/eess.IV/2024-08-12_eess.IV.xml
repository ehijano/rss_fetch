      <title>Survey: Transformer-based Models in Data Modality Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have made significant strides across various artificial intelligence domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. This success has naturally garnered considerable interest from both academic and industry researchers. Consequently, numerous Transformer variants (often referred to as X-formers) have been developed for these fields. However, a thorough and systematic review of these modality-specific conversions remains lacking. Modality Conversion involves the transformation of data from one form of representation to another, mimicking the way humans integrate and interpret sensory information. This paper provides a comprehensive review of transformer-based models applied to the primary modalities of text, vision, and speech, discussing their architectures, conversion methodologies, and applications. By synthesizing the literature on modality conversion, this survey aims to underline the versatility and scalability of transformers in advancing AI-driven content generation and understanding.</description>

      <title>Segmentation of Mental Foramen in Orthopantomographs: A Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise identification and detection of the Mental Foramen are crucial in dentistry, impacting procedures such as impacted tooth removal, cyst surgeries, and implants. Accurately identifying this anatomical feature facilitates post-surgery issues and improves patient outcomes. Moreover, this study aims to accelerate dental procedures, elevating patient care and healthcare efficiency in dentistry. This research used Deep Learning methods to accurately detect and segment the Mental Foramen from panoramic radiograph images. Two mask types, circular and square, were used during model training. Multiple segmentation models were employed to identify and segment the Mental Foramen, and their effectiveness was evaluated using diverse metrics. An in-house dataset comprising 1000 panoramic radiographs was created for this study. Our experiments demonstrated that the Classical UNet model performed exceptionally well on the test data, achieving a Dice Coefficient of 0.79 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.67. Moreover, ResUNet++ and UNet Attention models showed competitive performance, with Dice scores of 0.675 and 0.676, and IoU values of 0.683 and 0.671, respectively. We also investigated transfer learning models with varied backbone architectures, finding LinkNet to produce the best outcomes. In conclusion, our research highlights the efficacy of the classical Unet model in accurately identifying and outlining the Mental Foramen in panoramic radiographs. While vital, this task is comparatively simpler than segmenting complex medical datasets such as brain tumours or skin cancer, given their diverse sizes and shapes. This research also holds value in optimizing dental practice, benefiting practitioners and patients.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via a Unified Model for Prostate Lesion Detection Using Multisite Bi-parametric MRI Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our hypothesis is that UDA using diffusion-weighted images, generated with a unified model, offers a promising and reliable strategy for enhancing the performance of supervised learning models in multi-site prostate lesion detection, especially when various b-values are present. This retrospective study included data from 5,150 patients (14,191 samples) collected across nine different imaging centers. A novel UDA method using a unified generative model was developed for multi-site PCa detection. This method translates diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) acquisitions, including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and individual DW images acquired using various b-values, to align with the style of images acquired using b-values recommended by Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) guidelines. The generated ADC and DW images replace the original images for PCa detection. An independent set of 1,692 test cases (2,393 samples) was used for evaluation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used as the primary metric, and statistical analysis was performed via bootstrapping. For all test cases, the AUC values for baseline SL and UDA methods were 0.73 and 0.79 (p&lt;.001), respectively, for PI-RADS&gt;=3, and 0.77 and 0.80 (p&lt;.001) for PI-RADS&gt;=4 PCa lesions. In the 361 test cases under the most unfavorable image acquisition setting, the AUC values for baseline SL and UDA were 0.49 and 0.76 (p&lt;.001) for PI-RADS&gt;=3, and 0.50 and 0.77 (p&lt;.001) for PI-RADS&gt;=4 PCa lesions. The results indicate the proposed UDA with generated images improved the performance of SL methods in multi-site PCa lesion detection across datasets with various b values, especially for images acquired with significant deviations from the PI-RADS recommended DWI protocol (e.g. with an extremely high b-value).</description>

      <title>Improved Robustness for Deep Learning-based Segmentation of Multi-Center Myocardial Perfusion MRI Datasets Using Data Adaptive Uncertainty-guided Space-time Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background. Fully automatic analysis of myocardial perfusion MRI datasets enables rapid and objective reporting of stress/rest studies in patients with suspected ischemic heart disease. Developing deep learning techniques that can analyze multi-center datasets despite limited training data and variations in software and hardware is an ongoing challenge.
  Methods. Datasets from 3 medical centers acquired at 3T (n = 150 subjects) were included: an internal dataset (inD; n = 95) and two external datasets (exDs; n = 55) used for evaluating the robustness of the trained deep neural network (DNN) models against differences in pulse sequence (exD-1) and scanner vendor (exD-2). A subset of inD (n = 85) was used for training/validation of a pool of DNNs for segmentation, all using the same spatiotemporal U-Net architecture and hyperparameters but with different parameter initializations. We employed a space-time sliding-patch analysis approach that automatically yields a pixel-wise "uncertainty map" as a byproduct of the segmentation process. In our approach, a given test case is segmented by all members of the DNN pool and the resulting uncertainty maps are leveraged to automatically select the "best" one among the pool of solutions.
  Results. The proposed DAUGS analysis approach performed similarly to the established approach on the internal dataset (p = n.s.) whereas it significantly outperformed on the external datasets (p &lt; 0.005 for exD-1 and exD-2). Moreover, the number of image series with "failed" segmentation was significantly lower for the proposed vs. the established approach (4.3% vs. 17.1%, p &lt; 0.0005).
  Conclusions. The proposed DAUGS analysis approach has the potential to improve the robustness of deep learning methods for segmentation of multi-center stress perfusion datasets with variations in the choice of pulse sequence, site location or scanner vendor.</description>

      <title>Geo-UNet: A Geometrically Constrained Neural Framework for Clinical-Grade Lumen Segmentation in Intravascular Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precisely estimating lumen boundaries in intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is needed for sizing interventional stents to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Unfortunately, current segmentation networks like the UNet lack the precision needed for clinical adoption in IVUS workflows. This arises due to the difficulty of automatically learning accurate lumen contour from limited training data while accounting for the radial geometry of IVUS imaging. We propose the Geo-UNet framework to address these issues via a design informed by the geometry of the lumen contour segmentation task. We first convert the input data and segmentation targets from Cartesian to polar coordinates. Starting from a convUNet feature extractor, we propose a two-task setup, one for conventional pixel-wise labeling and the other for single boundary lumen-contour localization. We directly combine the two predictions by passing the predicted lumen contour through a new activation (named CDFeLU) to filter out spurious pixel-wise predictions. Our unified loss function carefully balances area-based, distance-based, and contour-based penalties to provide near clinical-grade generalization in unseen patient data. We also introduce a lightweight, inference-time technique to enhance segmentation smoothness. The efficacy of our framework on a venous IVUS dataset is shown against state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>CROCODILE: Causality aids RObustness via COntrastive DIsentangled LEarning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to domain shift, deep learning image classifiers perform poorly when applied to a domain different from the training one. For instance, a classifier trained on chest X-ray (CXR) images from one hospital may not generalize to images from another hospital due to variations in scanner settings or patient characteristics. In this paper, we introduce our CROCODILE framework, showing how tools from causality can foster a model's robustness to domain shift via feature disentanglement, contrastive learning losses, and the injection of prior knowledge. This way, the model relies less on spurious correlations, learns the mechanism bringing from images to prediction better, and outperforms baselines on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We apply our method to multi-label lung disease classification from CXRs, utilizing over 750000 images from four datasets. Our bias-mitigation method improves domain generalization and fairness, broadening the applicability and reliability of deep learning models for a safer medical image analysis.

      <title>Integrating Edge Information into Ground Truth for the Segmentation of the Optic Disc and Cup from Fundus Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optic disc and cup segmentation helps in the diagnosis of glaucoma, myocardial infarction, and diabetic retinopathy. Most deep learning methods developed to perform segmentation tasks are built on top of a U-Net-based model architecture. Nevertheless, U-Net and its variants have a tendency to over-segment/ under-segment the required regions of interest. Since the most important outcome is the value of cup-to-disc ratio and not the segmented regions themselves, we are more concerned about the boundaries rather than the regions under the boundaries. This makes learning edges important as compared to learning the regions. In the proposed work, the authors aim to extract both edges of the optic disc and cup from the ground truth using a Laplacian filter. Next, edges are reconstructed to obtain an edge ground truth in addition to the optic disc-cup ground truth. Utilizing both ground truths, the authors study several U-Net and its variant architectures with and without optic disc and cup edges as target, along with the optic disc-cup ground truth for segmentation. The authors have used the REFUGE benchmark dataset and the Drishti-GS dataset to perform the study, and the results are tabulated for the dice and the Hausdorff distance metrics. In the case of the REFUGE dataset, the optic disc mean dice score has improved from 0.7425 to 0.8859 while the mean Hausdorff distance has reduced from 6.5810 to 3.0540 for the baseline U-Net model. Similarly, the optic cup mean dice score has improved from 0.6970 to 0.8639 while the mean Hausdorff distance has reduced from 5.2340 to 2.6323 for the same model. Similar improvement has been observed for the Drishti-GS dataset as well. Compared to the baseline U-Net and its variants (i.e) the Attention U-Net and the U-Net++, the models that learn integrated edges along with the optic disc and cup regions performed well in both validation and testing datasets.</description>

      <title>Multi-dimensional Parameter Space Exploration for Streamline-specific Tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the unspoken challenges of tractography is choosing the right parameters for a given dataset or bundle. In order to tackle this challenge, we explore the multi-dimensional parameter space of tractography using streamline-specific parameters (SSP). We 1) validate a state-of-the-art probabilistic tracking method using per-streamline parameters on synthetic data, and 2) show how we can gain insights into the parameter space by focusing on streamline acceptance using real-world data. We demonstrate the potential added value of SSP to the current state of tractography by showing how SSP can be used to reveal patterns in the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Eye: A Relational Model for Early Dementia Detection Using Retinal OCTA Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), is essential to enable timely intervention and potential treatment. Accurate detection of AD/MCI is challenging due to the high complexity, cost, and often invasive nature of current diagnostic techniques, which limit their suitability for large-scale population screening. Given the shared embryological origins and physiological characteristics of the retina and brain, retinal imaging is emerging as a potentially rapid and cost-effective alternative for the identification of individuals with or at high risk of AD. In this paper, we present a novel PolarNet+ that uses retinal optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to discriminate early-onset AD (EOAD) and MCI subjects from controls. Our method first maps OCTA images from Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates, allowing approximate sub-region calculation to implement the clinician-friendly early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) grid analysis. We then introduce a multi-view module to serialize and analyze the images along three dimensions for comprehensive, clinically useful information extraction. Finally, we abstract the sequence embedding into a graph, transforming the detection task into a general graph classification problem. A regional relationship module is applied after the multi-view module to excavate the relationship between the sub-regions. Such regional relationship analyses validate known eye-brain links and reveal new discriminative patterns.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Conventional and Learned Video Codecs with a Low-Delay Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in video compression have seen significant coding performance improvements with the development of new standards and learning-based video codecs. However, most of these works focus on application scenarios that allow a certain amount of system delay (e.g., Random Access mode in MPEG codecs), which is not always acceptable for live delivery. This paper conducts a comparative study of state-of-the-art conventional and learned video coding methods based on a low delay configuration. Specifically, this study includes two MPEG standard codecs (H.266/VVC VTM and JVET ECM), two AOM codecs (AV1 libaom and AVM), and two recent neural video coding models (DCVC-DC and DCVC-FM). To allow a fair and meaningful comparison, the evaluation was performed on test sequences defined in the AOM and MPEG common test conditions in the YCbCr 4:2:0 color space. The evaluation results show that the JVET ECM codecs offer the best overall coding performance among all codecs tested, with a 16.1% (based on PSNR) average BD-rate saving over AOM AVM, and 11.0% over DCVC-FM. We also observed inconsistent performance with the learned video codecs, DCVC-DC and DCVC-FM, for test content with large background motions.</description>

      <title>PriPHiT: Privacy-Preserving Hierarchical Training of Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training phase of deep neural networks requires substantial resources and as such is often performed on cloud servers. However, this raises privacy concerns when the training dataset contains sensitive content, e.g., face images. In this work, we propose a method to perform the training phase of a deep learning model on both an edge device and a cloud server that prevents sensitive content being transmitted to the cloud while retaining the desired information. The proposed privacy-preserving method uses adversarial early exits to suppress the sensitive content at the edge and transmits the task-relevant information to the cloud. This approach incorporates noise addition during the training phase to provide a differential privacy guarantee. We extensively test our method on different facial datasets with diverse face attributes using various deep learning architectures, showcasing its outstanding performance. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of privacy preservation through successful defenses against different white-box and deep reconstruction attacks.</description>

      <title>Semantic Successive Refinement: A Generative AI-aided Semantic Communication Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic Communication (SC) is an emerging technology aiming to surpass the Shannon limit. Traditional SC strategies often minimize signal distortion between the original and reconstructed data, neglecting perceptual quality, especially in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) environments. To address this issue, we introduce a novel Generative AI Semantic Communication (GSC) system for single-user scenarios. This system leverages deep generative models to establish a new paradigm in SC. Specifically, At the transmitter end, it employs a joint source-channel coding mechanism based on the Swin Transformer for efficient semantic feature extraction and compression. At the receiver end, an advanced Diffusion Model (DM) reconstructs high-quality images from degraded signals, enhancing perceptual details. Additionally, we present a Multi-User Generative Semantic Communication (MU-GSC) system utilizing an asynchronous processing model. This model effectively manages multiple user requests and optimally utilizes system resources for parallel processing. Simulation results on public datasets demonstrate that our generative AI semantic communication systems achieve superior transmission efficiency and enhanced communication content quality across various channel conditions. Compared to CNN-based DeepJSCC, our methods improve the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by 17.75% in Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channels and by 20.86% in Rayleigh channels.</description>

      <title>Efficient automatic segmentation for multi-level pulmonary arteries: The PARSE challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient automatic segmentation of multi-level (i.e. main and branch) pulmonary arteries (PA) in CTPA images plays a significant role in clinical applications. However, most existing methods concentrate only on main PA or branch PA segmentation separately and ignore segmentation efficiency. Besides, there is no public large-scale dataset focused on PA segmentation, which makes it highly challenging to compare the different methods. To benchmark multi-level PA segmentation algorithms, we organized the first \textbf{P}ulmonary \textbf{AR}tery \textbf{SE}gmentation (PARSE) challenge. On the one hand, we focus on both the main PA and the branch PA segmentation. On the other hand, for better clinical application, we assign the same score weight to segmentation efficiency (mainly running time and GPU memory consumption during inference) while ensuring PA segmentation accuracy. We present a summary of the top algorithms and offer some suggestions for efficient and accurate multi-level PA automatic segmentation. We provide the PARSE challenge as open-access for the community to benchmark future algorithm developments at \url{https://parse2022.grand-challenge.org/Parse2022/}.</description>

Abstract: The online shopping behavior has the characteristics of rich granularity dimension and data sparsity and previous researches on user behavior prediction did not seriously discuss feature selection and ensemble design. In this paper, we proposed a SE-Stacking model based on information fusion and ensemble learning for user purchase behavior prediction. After successfully utilizing the ensemble feature selection method to screen purchase-related factors, we used the Stacking algorithm for user purchase behavior prediction. In our efforts to avoid the deviation of prediction results, we optimized the model by selecting ten different kinds of models as base learners and modifying relevant parameters specifically for them. The experiments conducted on a publicly-available dataset shows that the SE-Stacking model can achieve a 98.40% F1-score, about 0.09% higher than the optimal base models. The SE-Stacking model not only has a good application in the prediction of user purchase behavior but also has practical value combining with the actual e-commerce scene. At the same time, it has important significance for academic research and the development of this field.</description>

      <title>MS-Twins: Multi-Scale Deep Self-Attention Networks for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07128v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chest X-ray is one of the most common radiological examination types for the diagnosis of chest diseases. Nowadays, the automatic classification technology of radiological images has been widely used in clinical diagnosis and treatment plans. However, each disease has its own different response characteristic receptive field region, which is the main challenge for chest disease classification tasks. Besides, the imbalance of sample data categories further increases the difficulty of tasks. To solve these problems, we propose a new multi-label chest disease image classification scheme based on a multi-scale attention network. In this scheme, multi-scale information is iteratively fused to focus on regions with a high probability of disease, to effectively mine more meaningful information from data, and the classification performance can be improved only by image level annotation. We also designed a new loss function to improve the rationality of visual perception and the performance of multi-label image classification by forcing the consistency of attention regions before and after image transformation. A comprehensive experiment was carried out on the public Chest X-Ray14 and CheXpert datasets to achieve state of the art results, which verified the effectiveness of this method in chest X-ray image classification.</description>

      <title>NuLite -- Lightweight and Fast Model for Nuclei Instance Segmentation and Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In pathology, accurate and efficient analysis of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&amp;E) slides is crucial for timely and effective cancer diagnosis. Although many deep learning solutions for nuclei instance segmentation and classification exist in the literature, they often entail high computational costs and resource requirements, thus limiting their practical usage in medical applications. To address this issue, we introduce a novel convolutional neural network, NuLite, a U-Net-like architecture designed explicitly on Fast-ViT, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight CNN. We obtained three versions of our model, NuLite-S, NuLite-M, and NuLite-H, trained on the PanNuke dataset. The experimental results prove that our models equal CellViT (SOTA) in terms of panoptic quality and detection. However, our lightest model, NuLite-S, is 40 times smaller in terms of parameters and about 8 times smaller in terms of GFlops, while our heaviest model is 17 times smaller in terms of parameters and about 7 times smaller in terms of GFlops. Moreover, our model is up to about 8 times faster than CellViT. Lastly, to prove the effectiveness of our solution, we provide a robust comparison of external datasets, namely CoNseP, MoNuSeg, and GlySAC. Our model is publicly available at https://github.com/CosmoIknosLab/NuLite</description>

      <title>GMAI-MMBench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Evaluation Benchmark Towards General Medical AI</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are capable of handling diverse data types such as imaging, text, and physiological signals, and can be applied in various fields. In the medical field, LVLMs have a high potential to offer substantial assistance for diagnosis and treatment. Before that, it is crucial to develop benchmarks to evaluate LVLMs' effectiveness in various medical applications. Current benchmarks are often built upon specific academic literature, mainly focusing on a single domain, and lacking varying perceptual granularities. Thus, they face specific challenges, including limited clinical relevance, incomplete evaluations, and insufficient guidance for interactive LVLMs. To address these limitations, we developed the GMAI-MMBench, the most comprehensive general medical AI benchmark with well-categorized data structure and multi-perceptual granularity to date. It is constructed from 285 datasets across 39 medical image modalities, 18 clinical-related tasks, 18 departments, and 4 perceptual granularities in a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. Additionally, we implemented a lexical tree structure that allows users to customize evaluation tasks, accommodating various assessment needs and substantially supporting medical AI research and applications. We evaluated 50 LVLMs, and the results show that even the advanced GPT-4o only achieves an accuracy of 52%, indicating significant room for improvement. Moreover, we identified five key insufficiencies in current cutting-edge LVLMs that need to be addressed to advance the development of better medical applications. We believe that GMAI-MMBench will stimulate the community to build the next generation of LVLMs toward GMAI.</description>

      <title>Mapping "Brain Terrain" Regions on Mars using Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: One of the main objectives of the Mars Exploration Program is to search for evidence of past or current life on the planet. To achieve this, Mars exploration has been focusing on regions that may have liquid or frozen water. A set of critical areas may have seen cycles of ice thawing in the relatively recent past in response to periodic changes in the obliquity of Mars. In this work, we use convolutional neural networks to detect surface regions containing "Brain Coral" terrain, a landform on Mars whose similarity in morphology and scale to sorted stone circles on Earth suggests that it may have formed as a consequence of freeze/thaw cycles. We use large images (~100-1000 megapixels) from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to search for these landforms at resolutions close to a few tens of centimeters per pixel (~25--50 cm). Over 52,000 images (~28 TB) were searched (~5% of the Martian surface) where we found detections in over 200 images. To expedite the processing we leverage a classifier network (prior to segmentation) in the Fourier domain that can take advantage of JPEG compression by leveraging blocks of coefficients from a discrete cosine transform in lieu of decoding the entire image at the full spatial resolution. The hybrid pipeline approach maintains ~93% accuracy while cutting down on ~95% of the total processing time compared to running the segmentation network at the full resolution on every image. The timely processing of big data sets helps inform mission operations, geologic surveys to prioritize candidate landing sites, avoid hazardous areas, or map the spatial extent of certain terrain. The segmentation masks and source code are available on Github for the community to explore and build upon.</description>

      <title>Sub-Rayleigh Ghost Imaging via Structured Speckle Illumination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structured illumination is adopted widely in the super-resolution microscopy imaging. Here, we studied the ghost imaging scheme with sinusoidal structured speckle illumination, whose spatial resolution can surpass the Rayleigh-resolution limit by a factor of 2. In addition, ghost image with a higher spatial resolution can be realized by a pseudo-modulation structured illumination, whose modulation frequency breaks the upper limit of imaging system. Finally, our research verifies that the structural speckle illumination, a free-standing sub-Rayleigh technology, can be grafted with a variety of sub-Rayleigh ghost imaging schemes to further improve the spatial resolution of ghost image, such as the pseudo-inverse ghost imaging.</description>

      <title>ORBIT: Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth system predictability is challenged by the complexity of environmental dynamics and the multitude of variables involved. Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 684 petaFLOPS to 1.6 exaFLOPS sustained throughput, with scaling efficiency maintained at 41% to 85% across 49,152 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</description>

      <title>Towards Consistent Object Detection via LiDAR-Camera Synergy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As human-machine interaction continues to evolve, the capacity for environmental perception is becoming increasingly crucial. Integrating the two most common types of sensory data, images, and point clouds, can enhance detection accuracy. Currently, there is no existing model capable of detecting an object's position in both point clouds and images while also determining their corresponding relationship. This information is invaluable for human-machine interactions, offering new possibilities for their enhancement. In light of this, this paper introduces an end-to-end Consistency Object Detection (COD) algorithm framework that requires only a single forward inference to simultaneously obtain an object's position in both point clouds and images and establish their correlation. Furthermore, to assess the accuracy of the object correlation between point clouds and images, this paper proposes a new evaluation metric, Consistency Precision (CP). To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, an extensive set of experiments has been conducted on the KITTI and DAIR-V2X datasets. The study also explored how the proposed consistency detection method performs on images when the calibration parameters between images and point clouds are disturbed, compared to existing post-processing methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits excellent detection performance and robustness, achieving end-to-end consistency detection. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/xifen523/COD.</description>

      <title>Efficient Radiation Treatment Planning based on Voxel Importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation treatment planning involves optimization over a large number of voxels, many of which carry limited information about the clinical problem. We propose an approach to reduce the large optimization problem by only using a representative subset of informative voxels. This way, we drastically improve planning efficiency while maintaining the plan quality. Within an initial probing step, we pre-solve an easier optimization problem involving a simplified objective from which we derive an importance score per voxel. This importance score is then turned into a sampling distribution, which allows us to subsample a small set of informative voxels using importance sampling. By solving a - now reduced - version of the original optimization problem using this subset, we effectively reduce the problem's size and computational demands while accounting for regions where satisfactory dose deliveries are challenging. In contrast to other stochastic (sub-)sampling methods, our technique only requires a single probing and sampling step to define a reduced optimization problem. This problem can be efficiently solved using established solvers without the need of modifying or adapting them. Empirical experiments on open benchmark data highlight substantially reduced optimization times, up to 50 times faster than the original ones, for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), all while upholding plan quality comparable to traditional methods. Our novel approach has the potential to significantly accelerate radiation treatment planning by addressing its inherent computational challenges. We reduce the treatment planning time by reducing the size of the optimization problem rather than modifying and improving the optimization method. Our efforts are thus complementary to many previous developments.</description>
