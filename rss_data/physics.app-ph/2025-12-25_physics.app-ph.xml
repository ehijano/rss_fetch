      <title>Amino Acid Translocation Through a Dual Nanopore Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a dual nanopore platform (DNP) containing a top 2D MoS2 pore in series with a 3 to 5 nm thick SiN pore, vertically separated by 30 nm, with diameters of 1.0 and 3.0 nm, respectively. This platform enables independent probing of analytes by each pore, thereby providing complementary information. We measure translocations of single amino acids (AA) and evaluate current blockades recorded across the two pores upon applying voltage. Small diameters ensured tight passage of individual AAs through the nanopores and provided a good signal-tonoise ratio (RMS current noise of 16 pA_RMS and SNR = 6). We focus on measurements of O-Phospho-L-tyrosine at 400 mV, demonstrating single amino acid detection and a good quantitative agreement with the calculated open pore and blocked currents. Based on these results, future device performance can benefit from slightly smaller pores, specifically the SiN pore, higher voltages and electrolyte concentration, and lower system noise.</description>

      <title>Tutorial on Superconducting Quantum Circuits: From Basics to Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As superconducting circuits emerge as a leading platform for scalable quantum information processing, building comprehensive bridges from the foundational principles of macroscopic quantum phenomena to the architecture of modern quantum devices is increasingly essential for introducing new researchers to the field. This tutorial provides a self-contained, pedagogical introduction to superconducting quantum circuits at the undergraduate level. Beginning with an overview of superconductivity and the Josephson effect, the tutorial systematically develops the quantization of microwave circuits into the framework of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). The transmon qubit is then introduced as a state-of-the-art application, with a detailed derivation of its Hamiltonian and its interaction with control and readout circuitry. The theoretical formalism is consolidated through a numerical simulation of vacuum Rabi oscillations in a driven transmon-resonator system, a canonical experiment that demonstrates the coherent energy exchange characteristic of the strong coupling regime. This work serves as a foundational guide and first point of contact, equipping students and researchers with the conceptual and mathematical tools necessary to understand and engineer superconducting quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Realization of Insulating Buffer Layers via MOCVD-Grown Nitrogen-Doped (010) \b{eta}-Ga2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MOCVD-grown, nitrogen-doped \b{eta}-Ga2O3 films as an insulating buffer layer on Fe-doped (010) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 substrates in lieu of 49% HF treatment to remove unintentional silicon at the substrate-epitaxial layer growth interface. N-doped layer thickness and NH3 flow were systematically varied to experimentally determine the lowest nitrogen concentration and thickness of the buffer layer needed to fully compensate the interfacial silicon peak. The NH3 molar flow rate was varied from 200 sccm to 1800 sccm. Results showed fully insulating N-doped layers for samples with NH3 flow rates greater than or equal to 1200 sccm and a thickness of 50 nm. This study demonstrates the efficacy of in-situ, controllably doped nitrogen buffer layers as a mitigation method for unintentional interfacial silicon at the substrate-epitaxial layer growth interface.</description>

      <title>Complex Refractive Index Extraction for Spintronic Terahertz Emitter Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spintronic terahertz emitters (STEs) generate broadband terahertz (THz) radiation, which is essential for spectroscopy, imaging, and communication. The performances and the essential physical parameters of STE devices are linked to the dielectric properties of the constituent materials. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is an effective tool to measure these properties, but conventional analysis struggles with thin or complex multilayered systems due to simplifying approximations or complex transfer functions. In this work, we present a practical method to extract dielectric properties of STE multilayers using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM). By comparing the THz pulse calculated using the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) with the experimentally measured pulse transmitted through the sample, we can extract the dielectric properties of STEs, enhancing THz-TDS analysis and facilitating STE design and optimization. This method avoids constructing complex transfer functions, accommodates diverse sample geometries, and is designed to be accessible, with a publicly available codebase, making it a useful tool for STE research.</description>

      <title>Quantum Homotopy Algorithm for Solving Nonlinear PDEs and Flow Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms to integrate nonlinear PDEs governing flow problems are challenging to discover but critical to enhancing the practical usefulness of quantum computing. We present here a near-optimal, robust, and end-to-end quantum algorithm to solve time-dependent, dissipative, and nonlinear PDEs. We embed the PDEs in a truncated, high dimensional linear space on the basis of quantum homotopy analysis. The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity. A physically motivated measure of nonlinearity is connected to a parameter that is similar to the flow Reynolds number $Re_{\textrm{H}}$, whose inverse marks the allowed integration window, for given accuracy and complexity. We illustrate the embedding scheme with numerical simulations of a one-dimensional Burgers problem. This work shows the potential of the hybrid quantum algorithm for simulating practical and nonlinear phenomena on near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Constant-Amplitude $2\pi$ Phase Modulation from Topological Pole--Zero Winding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant phase shifters inevitably mix phase and amplitude. We present a topological synthesis that guarantees a full $2\pi$ phase swing at a prescribed constant scattering magnitude $|S_{ij}|=C$ by winding a scattering zero around the operating point in the complex-frequency plane while avoiding pole windings. We realize this either by complex-frequency waveform excitation on an iso-$|S_{ij}|$ (Apollonius) loop or by adiabatic co-modulation of detuning and decay at fixed carrier, suppressing AM--PM conversion and quantizing $\Delta\phi$ by the Argument Principle. The approach targets integrated resonant modulators, programmable photonic circuits, and quantum/beam-steering interferometers that require amplitude-flat phase shifts.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Uncertainty Quantification for Computational Point-of-care Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational point-of-care (POC) sensors enable rapid, low-cost, and accessible diagnostics in emergency, remote and resource-limited areas that lack access to centralized medical facilities. These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are subject to hallucinations and can produce erroneous predictions, posing a risk of misdiagnosis and inaccurate clinical decisions. To address this challenge, here we present an autonomous uncertainty quantification technique developed for POC diagnostics. As our testbed, we used a paper-based, computational vertical flow assay (xVFA) platform developed for rapid POC diagnosis of Lyme disease, the most prevalent tick-borne disease globally. The xVFA platform integrates a disposable paper-based assay, a handheld optical reader and a neural network-based inference algorithm, providing rapid and cost-effective Lyme disease diagnostics in under 20 min using only 20 uL of patient serum. By incorporating a Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO)-based uncertainty quantification approach into the diagnostics pipeline, we identified and excluded erroneous predictions with high uncertainty, significantly improving the sensitivity and reliability of the xVFA in an autonomous manner, without access to the ground truth diagnostic information of patients. Blinded testing using new patient samples demonstrated an increase in diagnostic sensitivity from 88.2% to 95.7%, indicating the effectiveness of MCDO-based uncertainty quantification in enhancing the robustness of neural network-driven computational POC sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable High-Precision Microfabrication on Various Lithography-Incompatible Substrates and Materials Enabled by Wafer-Scale Transfer Lithography of Commercial Photoresists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photolithography conventionally requires flat, rigid and stable substrates, limiting its applications in flexible, curved, and transient electronics. In this study, a breakthrough approach is reported that employs a reversibly adhesion-switchable phase-changing polymer to universally transfer commercial photoresists onto previously inaccessible substrates, overcoming fundamental limitations of conventional photolithography. Remarkably, it achieves wafer-scale (4-inch) transfer with global registration error below 60 microns and support precise patterning on solvent-sensitive, curved, microtextured or delicate surfaces. Combined with dry etching, this study demonstrates a novel route for high-resolution patterning of susceptible materials (e.g. quantum dots and organic semiconductors). The transfer method also supports a sustainable "dry lift-off" for patterning functional materials, demonstrating high-resolution microfabrication of paper-based electronics. The reusability of both the transfer carrier and photoresist introduces a new level of sustainability and scalability, establishing a significant advancement in microfabrication. Additionally, this unprecedented capability is further demonstrated by fabricating a micro-sized UV-photodetector array with wide-angle perception directly on a curved glass bottle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The depletion of energy sources, worsening environmental issues, and the quantum limitations of integrated circuits for information storage in the post-Moore era, are pressing global concerns. Fortunately, two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials, possessing broken spatial symmetry, with emerging pressure-dependent and non-linear optical response, piezoelectricity, valley polarization, Rashba spin splitting and more, have established a substantial platform for exploring and applying modifiable physical, chemical and biological properties in material science and offered a promising solution for these energy and information issues. To furnish researchers with a comprehensive repository of 2D Janus family, this review systematically summarizes their theoretical predictions, experimental preparations, and modulation strategies. It also retrospectively outlines the recent advances in modifiable properties, applications, and inherent mechanisms in optics, catalysis, piezoelectricity, electrochemistry, thermoelectricity, magnetism, and electronics, with a focus on experimentally realized hexagonal and trigonal Janus structures. Additionally, their current research state is summarized, and potential opportunities and challenges that may arise are highlighted. Overall, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for designing, fabricating, regulating, and applying 2D Janus systems, both theoretically and experimentally. This review will strongly promote the advanced academic investigations and industrial applications of 2D Janus materials in energy and information fields.</description>

      <title>A Wideband Tri-Band Shared-Aperture Antenna Array for 5G and 6G Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a wideband tri-band shared-aperture antenna array covering the 5G mid-band and 6G centimetric band. The challenge of scattering and coupling suppression is holistically addressed across the wide bands. Guided by characteristic mode analysis (CMA), a segmented spiral radiator is developed to mitigate high-frequency scattering and coupling while maintaining low-frequency radiation performance. Compared with a conventional tube radiator, the proposed spiral achieves a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) over 4.7-21.5 GHz (128.2%). With the aid of serial resonators, the segmented-spiral dipole achieves impedance matching in the low band (LB, 3.05-4.68 GHz, 42.2%), covering the 5G band (3.3-4.2 GHz), while additional suppressors further reduce cross-band coupling. The middle band (MB) and high band (HB) antennas operate at 6.2-10.0 GHz (46.9%) and 10.0-15.6 GHz (43.8%), respectively, collectively covering the anticipated 5G-Advanced and 6G bands (6.425-15.35 GHz). Both the MB and HB antennas employ a planar magnetoelectric (ME) dipole structure to avoid common-mode resonances within the LB and MB and to minimize cross-band scattering in the HB. The proposed array maintains undistorted radiation patterns and better than 20 dB port isolation between any two ports across all three bands.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes a tri-band shared-aperture antenna array with three wide bands, covering the 5G mid-band and the 6G centimetric band, which is a promising candidate for future 6G base station antennas. The challenge of suppressing interferences, including scattering and coupling, in the tri-band array is holistically addressed across wide bands. Guided by characteristic mode analysis (CMA), a segmented spiral radiator is efficiently developed to mitigate scattering and coupling at high frequencies while preserving radiation performance at low frequencies. Compared to a conventional tube radiator, the proposed spiral exhibits a reduced radar cross-section (RCS) over an ultra-wide range of 4.7-21.5 GHz (128.2%). With the aid of serial resonators, impedance matching of the segmented-spiral-based dipole antenna is achieved across the low band (LB) of 3.05-4.68 GHz (42.2%), spanning the 5G band 3.3-4.2 GHz. Moreover, suppressors are placed near the LB ports to further reduce the cross-band coupling. Middle band (MB) and high band (HB) antennas operate in 6.2-10.0 GHz (46.9%) and 10.0-15.6 GHz (43.8%), respectively, collectively covering the anticipated 5G-Advanced and 6G centimetric band of 6.425-15.35 GHz. Both the MB and HB antennas employ a planar magnetoelectric (ME) dipole structure, which prevents common-mode resonances in the LB and MB, and mitigates the scattering from the MB antenna in the HB. In this tri-band array, radiation patterns remain undistorted across the LB, MB, and HB, and the isolation between any two ports exceeds 20 dB over all three bands.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Cavity from Tunable Coupling between Anapole and Fabry-Perot Resonance or Anti-resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enhancing light-matter interactions depends critically on the ability to tailor photonic modes at subwavelength scales, and combining distinct resonant modes has shown remarkable potential unattainable by individual resonances alone. Despite recent advances in anapole metasurfaces for energy confinement and Fabry-Perot (FP) cavities for spectral control, their synergistic coupling and resulting opportunities remain largely unexplored due to challenges such as precise nanoscale assembly. Here, we demonstrate that embedding a terahertz (THz) anapole metasurface within a tunable FP cavity results in a hybrid cavity that demonstrates exotic properties as the anapole transitions between coupling to FP resonances and anti-resonances via cavity-length tuning. At room temperature, we observe ultrastrong coupling (&gt; 30% of the anapole frequency) between anapoles and FP resonances, generating tunable-dispersion polaritons that blend favorable properties of both modes. Meanwhile, anapole spectrally aligns with FP anti-resonances, leading to weak coupling that narrows the linewidth of the anapole's transmission peak by two orders of magnitude and enhances its local density of states (LDOS) near the metasurface correspondingly. With exceptional capabilities including formation of polaritons and significant enhancement of LDOS, the hybrid cavity enables strong interaction with functional materials, paving the way for exploration of quantum optics, molecular sensing, and ultrafast nonlinear photonics.</description>

      <title>Kirigami-based Flexible Metasurface with Reconfigurable Intrinsic Chirality from Zero to Near-unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral responses in electromagnetic metasurfaces are typically categorized as extrinsic, resulting from asymmetric interactions between the structure and incident waves, and intrinsic, arising from three-dimensional symmetry breaking of the unit cell. However, most existing metasurface designs target only one type of chirality and lack a unified, continuously tunable platform for broader chiroptical control. To address this limitation, the designed kirigami-based flexible metasurface is proposed for dynamic, continuous modulation of chirality, which expands the control scope to both extrinsic and intrinsic chiral responses within a single, reconfigurable platform. Initially, the unfolded metasurface exhibits extrinsic chirality under oblique incidence. By introducing well-designed kirigami-based cuts and folds, the metasurface transitions from a planar and achiral configuration to a three-dimensional chiral geometry that breaks the mirror symmetry, thereby exhibiting tunable intrinsic chirality and asymmetric extrinsic chirality. As the folding angle increases, the resulting deformation enables continuous tuning of the chiral response, with circular dichroism and its asymmetry under oblique incidences progressively increasing and reaching pronounced levels across the X-band. Our work provides a lightweight, easy-fabricated, and mechanically reconfigurable metasurface, which offers strong potential for future development in adaptive photonic systems and advanced chiroptical technologies.</description>
