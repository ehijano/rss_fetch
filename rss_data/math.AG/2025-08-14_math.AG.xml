      <title>Genus stabilization for the homology of moduli spaces of orbit-framed curves with symmetries-I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, arXiv:1301.4409, we showed that the moduli space of curves C with a G-symmetry (that is, with a faithful action of a finite group G), having a fixed generalized homological invariant, is irreducible if the genus g' of the quotient curve C' : = C/G satisfies g'&gt;&gt;0.
  Interpreting this result as stabilization for the 0-th homology group of the moduli space of curves with G-symmetry, we begin here a program for showing stabilization for all the homology groups of these spaces, in similarity to the results of Harer for the moduli space of curves.
  In this first paper we prove homology stabilization for a variant of the moduli space where one G-orbit is tangentially framed, settling in particular homology stabilization for the case of at most one branch point.</description>

      <title>Indices of holomorphic foliations and the bifurcation conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit local invariants (G\'omez-Mont-Seade-Verjovsky, variation, Camacho-Sad and Baum-Bott indices) associated with singular holomorphic foliations on $(\mathbb{C}^2 , 0)$ and we provide semi-global formulas for them in terms of the reduction of singularities of the foliation. A key technical ingredient is the Cholesky-type factorization of the intersection matrix of the exceptional divisor, which allows for an explicit control of multiplicities and indices along the resolution process. Using this factorization, we express the Milnor number and other indices as quadratic forms in intersection vectors associated to balanced divisors introduced by Y. Genzmer. As a main application, we address a conjecture posed by A. Szawlowski concerning pencils of plane holomorphic germs. We prove that the excess of Milnor numbers along the pencil is precisely captured by the invariants derived from our formulas, thereby confirming the conjecture in full generality. This also yields a new expression for the dimension of the parameter space of universal unfoldings of meromorphic functions in the sense of T. Suwa.</description>

      <title>Quasi-perfect blowups detect regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work gives a new characterization of regular Noetherian schemes (more generally algebraic spaces) as those for which blowups at closed points are quasi-perfect. In particular, regularity is controlled by the property that alterations or modifications of the scheme (or algebraic space) are quasi-perfect. Additionally, we study the local behavior of quasi-perfect morphisms, showing that for proper morphisms this property can be detected via stalks, and completions and (strict) Henselizations of those. Furthermore, we show that the locus of points where a proper morphism is quasi-perfect forms a Zariski open set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note we give some corollaries of the polynomial inverse function theorem for large fields. We prove inverse and implicit function theorems for Nash maps over large fields, characterize large fields as fields satisfying inverse or implicit function theorems, give inverse and implicit function theorems for gt-henselian field topologies, and show that definable functions in various logically tame fields of characteristic zero are generically Nash. We prove a version of Krasner's lemma for large fields and describe how Nash functions give a natural proof of the well-known fact that a large field $K$ is existentially closed in $K(\!(t)\!)$.</description>

      <title>Large implies henselian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix a field $K$. We show that $K$ is large if and only if some elementary extension of $K$ is the fraction field of a henselian local domain which is not a field. The proof uses a new result about the \'etale-open topology over $K$: if $K$ is not separably closed and $V \to W$ is an \'etale morphism of $K$-varieties then $V(K) \to W(K)$ is a local homeomorphism in the \'etale-open topology. This, in turn, follows from results comparing the \'etale-open topology on $V(K)$ and the finite-closed topology on $V(K)$, newly introduced in this paper. We show that the \'etale-open topology refines the finite-closed topology when $K$ is perfect, and that the finite-closed topology refines the \'etale-open topology when $K$ is bounded. It follows that these two topologies agree in many natural examples. On the other hand, we construct several examples where these two differ, which allows us to answer a question of Lampe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.14438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify the topological types of surfaces in the 3-dimensional unit sphere that contain both a great and a small circle through each point. In particular, these surfaces are homeomorphic to one of five normal forms and are either the pointwise product of circles in the unit quaternions or contain five concurrent circles. We classify the real singular loci of such surfaces and characterize how circles in the surface meet the self-intersection locus.</description>

      <title>The Spin Gromov-Witten/Hurwitz correspondence for $\mathbb{P}^1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03259v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spin Gromov-Witten (GW) theory of $\mathbb{P}^1$. Using the standard torus action on $\mathbb{P}^1$, we prove that the associated equivariant potential can be expressed by means of operator formalism and satisfies the 2-BKP hierarchy. As a consequence of this result, we prove the spin analogue of the GW/Hurwitz correspondence of Okounkov-Pandharipande for $\mathbb{P}^1$, which was conjectured by J. Lee. Finally, we prove that this correspondence for a general target spin curve follows from a conjectural degeneration formula for spin GW invariants that holds in virtual dimension 0.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for the action of a finite constant group scheme, equivariant algebraic $K$-theory is represented by a colimit of Grassmannians in the equivariant motivic homotopy category. Using this result we show that the set of endomorphisms of the equivariant motivic space defined by $K_0(G,-)$ coincides with the set of endomorphisms of infinite Grassmannians in the equivariant motivic homotopy category by explicitly computing the equivariant $K$-theory of Grassmannians.</description>

      <title>The Logarithmic Quot space: foundations and tropicalisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a logarithmic version of the Hilbert scheme, and more generally the Quot scheme, of a simple normal crossings pair. The logarithmic Quot space admits a natural tropicalisation called the space of tropical supports, which is a functor on the category of cone complexes. The fibers of the map to the space of tropical supports are algebraic. The space of tropical supports is representable by ``piecewise linear spaces'', which are introduced here to generalise fans and cone complexes to allow non--convex geometries. The space of tropical supports can be seen as a polyhedral analogue of the Hilbert scheme. The logarithmic Quot space parameterises quotient sheaves on logarithmic modifications that satisfy a natural transversality condition. We prove that our moduli space is a separated and universally closed logarithmic algebraic space. The logarithmic Hilbert space parameterizes families of proper monomorphisms, and in this way is exactly analogous to the classical Hilbert scheme. The new complexity of the space can then be viewed as stemming from the complexity of proper monomorphisms in logarithmic geometry. Our construction generalises the logarithmic Donaldson--Thomas space studied by Maulik--Ranganathan to arbitrary rank and dimension, and the good degenerations of Quot schemes of Li--Wu to simple normal crossings geometries.</description>

Abstract: We apply the better-behaved GKZ hypergeometric systems to study toric Calabi-Yau Deligne-Mumford stacks and their Hori-Vafa mirrors given by affine hypersurfaces in algebraic tori. We show that the integral structures of A-branes and B-branes coincide. This confirms a local version of a conjecture of Hosono and can be seen as a generalization of the Gamma conjecture for local mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>Weighted surfaces with maximal Picard number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An algorithm due to Shioda computes the Picard number for certain surfaces which are defined by a single equation with exactly four monomials, called Delsarte surfaces. We consider this method for surfaces in weighted projective $3$-space with quotient singularities. We give a criterion for such a weighted Delsarte surface $X$ to have maximal Picard number. This condition is surprisingly related to the automorphism group of $X$. For every positive integer $s$, we find a weighted Delsarte surface with geometric genus $s$ and maximal Picard number. We show that these examples are elliptic surfaces, proving that elliptic surfaces of maximal Picard number and arbitrary geometric genus may be embedded as quasismooth hypersurfaces in weighted projective space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a geometric and categorical approach to the Hodge Conjecture for all smooth projective complex varieties. By embedding any such variety into a flat family with general fibers smooth complete intersections, we prove the conjecture unconditionally in the complete intersection case using derived category methods. Through deformation arguments, we reduce the general case to the algebraicity of limits. While this remains an assumption, our framework unifies Hodge theory, deformation, and derived techniques, offering a concrete path toward resolving the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Lifting Deligne-Lusztig Reduction and Geometric Coxeter Type Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cases of Shimura varieties where the special fibre of a Rapoport-Zink space is simply the union of classical Deligne-Lusztig varieties are known as fully Hodge-Newton decomposable ones, and have been studied with great interest in the past. In recent times, the focus has shifted to identify tractable cases beyond the fully Hodge-Newton decomposable ones, and several instances have been identified where only products of classical Deligne-Lusztig varities with simpler spaces occur.
  In our paper, we provide a uniform framework to capture these phenomena. By studying liftings from the affine flag variety to the loop group and combining them with the Deligne-Lusztig reduction method, our main result is a powerful criterion to show that an affine Deligne-Lusztig variety is the product of a classical Deligne-Lusztig variety with affine spaces and pointed affine spaces.
  We introduce the class of elements that we call having geometric Coxeter type, strictly including previously studied notions such as positive Coxeter type or finite Coxeter type. These elements of geometric Coxeter type satisfy the conditions for our main result and also a condition on the Newton stratification introduced by Mili\'cevi\'c-Viehmann.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth irreducible quasi-projective algebraic variety over a number field $K$. Suppose $X$ is equipped with a $p$-adic \'{e}tale local system compatible with an admissible graded-polarized variation of mixed Hodge structures on the complex analytification of $X_{\mathbb{C}}$. We prove that the $S$-integral points in $X$ are covered by subpolynomially many geometrically irreducible $K$-subvarieties, each lying in a fiber of the mixed period mapping arising from the variation of mixed Hodge structures. This is based on recent works by Brunebarbe-Maculan and Ellenberg-Lawrence-Venkatesh. As an application, we prove that there are subpolynomially many $S$-integral Laurent polynomials with fixed reflexive Newton polyhedron $\Delta$ and fixed non-zero principal $\Delta$-determinant. Our results answer a question asked by Ellenberg-Lawrence-Venkatesh.</description>

      <title>Eilenberg-Moore categories and quiver representations of monads and comonads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13201v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider representations of quivers taking values in monads or comonads over a Grothendieck category $\mathcal C$. We treat these as scheme like objects whose ``structure sheaf'' consists of monads or comonads. By using systems of adjoint functors between Eilenberg-Moore categories, we obtain a categorical framework of modules over monad quivers, and of comodules over comonad quivers. Our main objective is to give conditions for these to be Grothendieck categories, which play the role of noncommutative spaces. As with usual ringed spaces, we have to study two kinds of module categories over a monad quiver. The first behaves like a sheaf of modules over a ringed space. The second consists of modules that are cartesian, which resemble quasi-coherent sheaves. We also obtain an extension of the classical quasi-coherator construction to modules over a monad quiver with values in Eilenberg-Moore categories. We establish similar results for comodules over a comonad quiver. One of our key steps is finding a modulus like bound for an endofunctor $U:\mathcal C\longrightarrow \mathcal C$ in terms of $\kappa(G)$, where $G$ is a generator for $\mathcal C$ and $\kappa(G)$ is a cardinal such that $G$ is $\kappa(G)$-presentable. Another feature of our paper is that we study modules over a monad quiver in two different orientations, which we refer to as ``cis-modules'' and ``trans-modules.'' We conclude with rational pairings of a monad quiver with a comonad quiver, which relate comodules over a comonad quiver to coreflective subcategories of modules over monad quivers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $L$ be an even indefinite lattice. We show that if $L$ splits off a hyperbolic plane and a scaled hyperbolic plane, then the Kudla-Millson lift of genus $1$ associated to $L$ is injective. Our result includes as special cases all previously known injectivity results on the whole space of elliptic cusp forms available in the literature. In particular, we also consider the Funke-Millson twist of the lift. Further, we provide geometric applications on locally symmetric spaces of orthogonal type.</description>

      <title>Continuity of solutions to complex Monge-Amp\`{e}re equations on compact K\"{a}hler spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the continuity of bounded solutions to complex Monge-Amp\`{e}re equations on reduced, locally irreducible compact K\"{a}hler spaces. This in particular implies that any singular K\"{a}hler-Einstein potentials constructed in \cite{EGZ09} and \cite{Tsuji88, TianZhang06, ST17} are continuous. We also provide an affirmative answer to a conjecture in \cite{EGZ09} by showing that a resolution of any compact normal K\"{a}hler space satisfies the continuous approximation property. Finally, we settle the continuity of the potentials of the weak K\"{a}hler-Ricci flows \cite{ST17, GLZ20} on compact K\"{a}hler varieties with log terminal singularities.</description>

      <title>Wildly ramified unitary local models for special parahorics. The odd dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct local models for wildly ramified unitary similitude groups of odd dimension $n\geq 3$ with special parahoric level structure and signature $(n-1,1)$. We first give a lattice-theoretic description for parahoric subgroups using Bruhat-Tits theory in residue characteristic two, and apply them to define local models following the lead of Rapoport-Zink and Pappas-Rapoport. In our case, there are two conjugacy classes of special parahoric subgroups. We show that the local models are smooth for the one class and normal, Cohen-Macaulay for the other class. We also prove that they represent the v-sheaf local models of Scholze-Weinstein. Under some additional assumptions, we obtain an explicit moduli interpretation of the local models.</description>
