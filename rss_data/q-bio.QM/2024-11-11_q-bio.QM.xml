      <title>EAP4EMSIG -- Experiment Automation Pipeline for Event-Driven Microscopy to Smart Microfluidic Single-Cells Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfluidic Live-Cell Imaging (MLCI) generates high-quality data that allows biotechnologists to study cellular growth dynamics in detail. However, obtaining these continuous data over extended periods is challenging, particularly in achieving accurate and consistent real-time event classification at the intersection of imaging and stochastic biology. To address this issue, we introduce the Experiment Automation Pipeline for Event-Driven Microscopy to Smart Microfluidic Single-Cells Analysis (EAP4EMSIG). In particular, we present initial zero-shot results from the real-time segmentation module of our approach. Our findings indicate that among four State-Of-The- Art (SOTA) segmentation methods evaluated, Omnipose delivers the highest Panoptic Quality (PQ) score of 0.9336, while Contour Proposal Network (CPN) achieves the fastest inference time of 185 ms with the second-highest PQ score of 0.8575. Furthermore, we observed that the vision foundation model Segment Anything is unsuitable for this particular use case.</description>

      <title>Nonperfused Retinal Capillaries -- A New Method Developed on OCT and OCTA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To develop a new method to quantify nonperfused retinal capillaries (NPCs) by using co-registered optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA), and to evaluate NPCs in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR). Multiple consecutive 3x3-mm OCT/OCTA scans were obtained using a commercial device (Solix; Visionix/Optovue, Inc., California, USA). We averaged multiple registered OCT/OCTA scans to create high-definition volumes. The deep capillary plexus slab was defined and segmented. A novel deep learning denoising algorithm removed tissue background noise from capillaries in the en face OCT/OCTA. The algorithm segmented NPCs by identifying capillaries from OCT without corresponding flow signals in the OCTA. We then investigated the relationships between NPCs and known features in AMD and DR. The denoised en face OCT/OCTA revealed the structure and flow of the capillaries. The automatically segmented NPC achieved an accuracy of 88.2% compared to manual grading of DR. Compared to healthy controls, both the mean number and total length (mm) of NPCs were significantly increased in eyes with AMD and eyes with DR (P &lt; 0.001). Compared to early and intermediate AMD, the number and total length of NPCs were significantly higher in advanced AMD (number: P&lt;0.001, P&lt;0.001; total length: P = 0.002, P =0.003). Geography atrophy, macular neovascularization, drusen volume, and extrafoveal avascular area (EAA) significantly correlated with increased NPCs (P&lt;0.05). In eyes with DR, NPCs correlated with the number of microaneurysms and EAA (P&lt;0.05). The presence of fluid did not significantly correlate with NPCs in AMD and DR. Conclusions A deep learning-based algorithm can segment and quantify retinal capillaries that lack flow using colocalized OCT/OCTA. This novel biomarker may be useful in AMD and DR.</description>

      <title>BayesianFitForecast: A User-Friendly R Toolbox for Parameter Estimation and Forecasting with Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Mathematical models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are essential tools across various scientific disciplines, including biology, ecology, and healthcare informatics. They are used to simulate complex dynamic systems and inform decision-making. In this paper, we introduce BayesianFitForecast, an R toolbox specifically developed to streamline Bayesian parameter estimation and forecasting in ODE models, making it particularly relevant to health informatics and public health decision-making. The toolbox is available at https://github.com/gchowell/BayesianFitForecast/.
  Results: This toolbox enables automatic generation of Stan files, allowing users to configure models, define priors, and analyze results with minimal programming expertise. To demonstrate the versatility and robustness of BayesianFitForecast, we apply it to the analysis of the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco, comparing Poisson and negative binomial error structures within the SEIR model. We also test it by fitting multiple time series of state variables using simulated data. BayesianFitForecast provides robust tools for evaluating model performance, including convergence diagnostics, posterior distributions, credible intervals, and performance metrics.
  Conclusion: By improving the accessibility of advanced Bayesian methods, this toolbox significantly broadens the application of Bayesian inference methods to dynamical systems critical for healthcare and epidemiological forecasting. A tutorial video demonstrating the toolbox's functionality is available at https://youtu.be/jnxMjz3V3n8.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Transfer Learning and Multiple Instance Learning for HER2 Automatic Scoring of H\&amp;E Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is an important biomarker in breast cancer patients who can benefit from cost-effective automatic Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&amp;E) HER2 scoring. However, developing such scoring models requires large pixel-level annotated datasets. Transfer learning allows prior knowledge from different datasets to be reused while multiple-instance learning (MIL) allows the lack of detailed annotations to be mitigated. The aim of this work is to examine the potential of transfer learning on the performance of deep learning models pre-trained on (i) Immunohistochemistry (IHC) images, (ii) H\&amp;E images and (iii) non-medical images. A MIL framework with an attention mechanism is developed using pre-trained models as patch-embedding models. It was found that embedding models pre-trained on H\&amp;E images consistently outperformed the others, resulting in an average AUC-ROC value of $0.622$ across the 4 HER2 scores ($0.59-0.80$ per HER2 score). Furthermore, it was found that using multiple-instance learning with an attention layer not only allows for good classification results to be achieved, but it can also help with producing visual indication of HER2-positive areas in the H\&amp;E slide image by utilising the patch-wise attention weights.</description>

      <title>Pruning the Path to Optimal Care: Identifying Systematically Suboptimal Medical Decision-Making with Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In aims to uncover insights into medical decision-making embedded within observational data from clinical settings, we present a novel application of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) that identifies suboptimal clinician actions based on the actions of their peers. This approach centers two stages of IRL with an intermediate step to prune trajectories displaying behavior that deviates significantly from the consensus. This enables us to effectively identify clinical priorities and values from ICU data containing both optimal and suboptimal clinician decisions. We observe that the benefits of removing suboptimal actions vary by disease and differentially impact certain demographic groups.</description>

      <title>Electro-diffusive modeling and the role of spine geometry on action potential propagation in neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical signaling in the brain plays a vital role to our existence but at the same time, the fundamental mechanism of this propagation is undeciphered. Notable advancements have been made in the numerical modeling supplementing the related experimental findings. Cable theory based models provided a significant breakthrough in understanding the mechanism of electrical propagation in the neuronal axons. Cable theory, however, fails for thin geometries such as a spine or a dendrite of a neuron, amongst its other limitations. Recently, the spatiotemporal propagation has been precisely modeled using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) electro-diffusive theory in the neuronal axons as well as the dendritic spines respectively. Patch clamp and voltage imaging experiments have extensively aided the study of action potential propagation exclusively for the neuronal axons but not the dendritic spines because of the challenges linked with their thin geometry. Assisted by the super-resolution microscopes and the voltage dyeing experiments, it has become possible to precisely measure the voltage in the dendritic spines. This has facilitated the requirement of a high fidelity numerical frame that is capable of acting as a digital twin. Here, using the PNP theory, we integrate the dendritic spine, soma and the axon region to numerically model the propagation of excitatory synaptic potential in a complete neuronal geometry with the synaptic input at the spines, potential initiating at the axon hillock and propagating through the neuronal axon. The model outputs the forward propagation of the action potential along the neuronal axons as well as the back propagation into the spines. We point out the significance of the intricate geometry of the dendritic spines, namely the spine neck length and radius, and the ion channel density in the axon hillock to the action potential initiation and propagation.</description>

      <title>Analysing control-theoretic properties of nonlinear synthetic biology circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic biology is a recent area of biological engineering, whose aim is to provide cells with novel functionalities. A number of important results regarding the development of control circuits in synthetic biology have been achieved during the last decade. A differential geometry approach can be used for the analysis of said systems, which are often nonlinear. Here we demonstrate the application of such tools to analyse the structural identifiability, observability, accessibility, and controllability of several biomolecular systems. We focus on a set of synthetic circuits of current interest, which can perform several tasks, both in open loop and closed loop settings. We analyse their properties with our own methods and tools; further, we describe a new open-source implementation of the techniques.</description>

      <title>Topological and Graph Theoretical Analysis of Dynamic Functional Connectivity for Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a prevalent neurological disorder. However, the multi-faceted symptoms and large individual differences among ASD patients are hindering the diagnosis process, which largely relies on subject descriptions and lacks quantitative biomarkers. To remediate such problems, this paper explores the use of graph theory and topological data analysis (TDA) to study brain activity in ASD patients and normal controls. We employ the Mapper algorithm in TDA and the distance correlation graphical model (DCGM) in graph theory to create brain state networks, then innovatively adopt complex network metrics in Graph signal processing (GSP) and physical quantities to analyze brain activities over time. Our findings reveal statistical differences in network characteristics between ASD and control groups. Compared to normal subjects, brain state networks of ASD patients tend to have decreased modularity, higher von Neumann entropy, increased Betti-0 numbers, and decreased Betti-1 numbers. These findings attest to the biological traits of ASD, suggesting less organized and more variable brain dynamics. These findings offer potential biomarkers for ASD diagnosis and deepen our understanding of its neural correlations.</description>

      <title>Lung tumor segmentation in MRI mice scans using 3D nnU-Net with minimum annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In drug discovery, accurate lung tumor segmentation is an important step for assessing tumor size and its progression using \textit{in-vivo} imaging such as MRI. While deep learning models have been developed to automate this process, the focus has predominantly been on human subjects, neglecting the pivotal role of animal models in pre-clinical drug development. In this work, we focus on optimizing lung tumor segmentation in mice. First, we demonstrate that the nnU-Net model outperforms the U-Net, U-Net3+, and DeepMeta models. Most importantly, we achieve better results with nnU-Net 3D models than 2D models, indicating the importance of spatial context for segmentation tasks in MRI mice scans. This study demonstrates the importance of 3D input over 2D input images for lung tumor segmentation in MRI scans. Finally, we outperform the prior state-of-the-art approach that involves the combined segmentation of lungs and tumors within the lungs. Our work achieves comparable results using only lung tumor annotations requiring fewer annotations, saving time and annotation efforts. This work (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/lung-tumour-mice-mri-64BB) is an important step in automating pre-clinical animal studies to quantify the efficacy of experimental drugs, particularly in assessing tumor changes.</description>
