      <title>Synchronization transitions in adaptive simplicial complexes with cooperative and competitive dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive network is a powerful presentation to describe different real-world phenomena. However, current models often neglect higher-order interactions (beyond pairwise interactions) and diverse adaptation types (cooperative and competitive) commonly observed in systems like the human brain and social networks. This work addresses this gap by incorporating these factors into a model that explores their impact on collective properties like synchronization. Through simplified network representations, we investigate how the simultaneous presence of cooperative and competitive adaptations influences phase transitions. Our findings reveal a transition from first-order to second-order synchronization as the strength of higher-order interactions increases under competitive adaptation. We also demonstrate the possibility of synchronization even without pairwise interactions, provided there is strong enough higher-order coupling. When only competitive adaptations are present, the system exhibits second-order-like phase transitions and clustering. Conversely, with a combination of cooperative and competitive adaptations, the system undergoes a first-order-like phase transition, characterized by a sharp transition to the synchronized state without reverting to an incoherent state during backward transitions. The specific nature of these second-order-like transitions varies depending on the coupling strengths and mean degrees. With our model, we can control not only when the system synchronizes but also the way the system goes to synchronization.</description>

      <title>Classifying pedestrian crossing flows: A data-driven approach using fundamental diagrams and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of pedestrian crossing flows with varying crossing angles $\alpha$ to classify different scenarios and derive implications for crowd management. Probability density functions of four key features$-$velocity $v$, density $\rho$, avoidance number $Av$, and intrusion number $In$$-$were analyzed to characterize pedestrian behavior. Velocity-density fundamental diagrams were constructed for each $\alpha$ and fitted with functional forms from existing literature. Classification attempts using $Av$-$In$ and $v$-$\rho$ phase spaces revealed significant overlaps, highlighting the limitations of these metrics alone for scenario differentiation. To address this, machine learning models, including logistic regression and random forest, were employed using all four features. Results showed robust classification performance, with $v$ and $Av$ contributing most significantly. Insights from feature importance metrics and classification accuracy offer practical guidance for managing high-density crowds, optimizing pedestrian flow, and designing safer public spaces. These findings provide a data-driven framework for advancing pedestrian dynamics research.</description>

      <title>Competition between group interactions and nonlinearity in voter dynamics on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social dynamics are often driven by both pairwise (i.e., dyadic) relationships and higher-order (i.e., polyadic) group relationships, which one can describe using hypergraphs. To gain insight into the impact of polyadic relationships on dynamical processes on networks, we formulate and study a polyadic voter process, which we call the group-driven voter model (GVM), that incorporates the effect of group interactions by nonlinear interactions that are subject to a group (i.e., hyperedge) constraint. By examining the competition between nonlinearity and group sizes, we show that the GVM achieves consensus faster than standard voter-model dynamics, with an optimal minimizing exit time. We substantiate this finding by using mean-field theory on annealed uniform hypergraphs with $N$ nodes, for which the exit time scales as ${\cal A}\ln N$, where the prefactor ${\cal A}$ depends both on the nonlinearity and on group-constraint factors. Our results reveal how competition between group interactions and nonlinearity shapes GVM dynamics. We thereby highlight the importance of such competing effects in complex systems with polyadic interactions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical stability of evolutionarily stable strategy in asymmetric games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is the defining concept of evolutionary game theory. It has a fairly unanimously accepted definition for the case of symmetric games which are played in a homogeneous population where all individuals are in same role. However, in asymmetric games, which are played in a population with multiple subpopulations (each of which has individuals in one particular role), situation is not as clear. Various generalizations of ESS defined for such cases differ in how they correspond to fixed points of replicator equation which models evolutionary dynamics of frequencies of strategies in the population. Moreover, some of the definitions may even be equivalent, and hence, redundant in the scheme of things. Along with reporting some new results, this paper is partly indented as a contextual mini-review of some of the most important definitions of ESS in asymmetric games. We present the definitions coherently and scrutinize them closely while establishing equivalences -- some of them hitherto unreported -- between them wherever possible. Since it is desirable that a definition of ESS should correspond to asymptotically stable fixed points of replicator dynamics, we bring forward the connections between various definitions and their dynamical stabilities. Furthermore, we find the use of principle of relative entropy to gain information-theoretic insights into the concept of ESS in asymmetric games, thereby establishing a three-fold connection between game theory, dynamical system theory, and information theory in this context. We discuss our conclusions also in the backdrop of asymmetric hypermatrix games where more than two individuals interact simultaneously in the course of getting payoffs.</description>
