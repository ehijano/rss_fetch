      <title>Equivalent of Non-Trivial Riemann Zeros Condition in Matrix Representation and Particle Anti-Particle Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Hermitian matrix can be formed for a large enough cutoff N on the number of terms in the Riemann zeta function. At zeros, the matrix trace equals the off-diagonal sum. Riemann's hypothesis is true if and only if the condition is satisfied. It suggests a relationship between the diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the matrix formed. By forming a matrix with Riemann non-trivial zero, the quantum field vacuum loop level diagram can be opened exactly by coupling the matrix with an anti-particle annihilation operator, which gives rise to asymmetry between matter and anti-matter.</description>

      <title>Open questions of BSM Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BSM physics, on which the now standard inflationary cosmology with baryosynthesis and dark matter/energy is based, inevitably leads to cosmological scenarios beyond this standard model, involving specific model dependent choice of models and parameters of BSM physics. Such model dependent cosmological predictions may have already found confirmations in the positive results of direct dark matter searches by DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA experiments, interpretation of the results of Gravitational Wave experiments in terms of Primordial Black Hole merging, observation of Stochastic GravitationalWave background by Pulsar Timing Arrays, indications of early galaxy formation in the observations of James Webb Space Telescope and searches for cosmic antihelium in the AMS02 experiment. We discuss the open questions in studies of these signatures of BSM cosmology.</description>

      <title>Indefinitely flat rotation curves from Mpc sized charged cocoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak lensing exhibits that rotation curves of isolated galaxies remain flat up to Mpc scale (Mistele et al, 2024). Recently we proposed that dark matter is a combination of electrostatic and vacuum energy in standard physics. In this theory, isolated galaxies may be embedded in ``charged cocoons'', spheres with $\pm 1/r^2$ charge density. The related circular rotation curves decay at the Mpc scale. The analytic solution is extended to the early Universe. A peak in the cosmic microwave background spectrum is expected at the arcsec scale. The induced nanometer size of the cocoons at the Big Bang makes the initial state inhomogeneous.</description>

      <title>New Weighted Sum of Gray Gases (WSGG) Models for Radiation Calculation in Carbon Capture Simulations: Evaluation and Different Implementation Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply several weighted sum of gray gases models (WSGGMs) to calculate the radiative absorption coefficient for gas mixtures containing H2O and CO2. Our main objectives are to analyze and compare four WSGGMs which have been recently developed for oxy-fuel combustion. The models are compared with the widely-used air-fuel WSGGM of Smith et al. In addition to direct comparison of the absorption coefficients, we compare finite-volume solutions of the radiative equation of transfer in a 2m x 2m x 4m box with a specified inhomogeneous temperature field and a homogeneous mixture of the H2O, CO2 and N2. Calculations using a spectral line-based WSGGM (SLW) are used as a reference solution to estimate the accuracy. For each WSGGM, we apply two interpolation methods for determining the model coefficients at arbitrary H2O-to-CO2 ratios. For wet-recycle oxy-fuel combustion, we found that the deviation of the air-fuel WSGGM was not significantly larger than several of the newer models. However, with dry recycle (90 vol%-CO2) the air-fuel WSGGM model underpredicts the radiative flux and radiative heat source in contrast to the other models which overpredict these fields. Piecewise linear interpolation consistently improves the predictions of the air-fuel WSGGM, but only has a modest effect on the predictions of the oxy-fuel WSGGM's.</description>

      <title>Proof of Riemann hypothesis by topological and analytical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13292v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a differential topological proof and an analytical proof of Riemann hypothesis according to the saddle point method because Riemann calculated the integral representation of zeta function on the critical line by this method. This topological proof of RH proves that the existence of integral representation of zeta functions requires certain differential topological conditions on its integrand according to which the zeta function vanishes on the critical line. The analytical proof of RH is the local implementation of topological proof or its coordinate representation.</description>
