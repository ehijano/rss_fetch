      <title>ATOMMIC: An Advanced Toolbox for Multitask Medical Imaging Consistency to facilitate Artificial Intelligence applications from acquisition to analysis in Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI is revolutionizing MRI along the acquisition and processing chain. Advanced AI frameworks have been developed to apply AI in various successive tasks, such as image reconstruction, quantitative parameter map estimation, and image segmentation. Existing frameworks are often designed to perform tasks independently or are focused on specific models or datasets, limiting generalization. We introduce ATOMMIC, an open-source toolbox that streamlines AI applications for accelerated MRI reconstruction and analysis. ATOMMIC implements several tasks using DL networks and enables MultiTask Learning (MTL) to perform related tasks integrated, targeting generalization in the MRI domain. We first review the current state of AI frameworks for MRI through a comprehensive literature search and by parsing 12,479 GitHub repositories. We benchmark 25 DL models on eight publicly available datasets to present distinct applications of ATOMMIC on accelerated MRI reconstruction, image segmentation, quantitative parameter map estimation, and joint accelerated MRI reconstruction and image segmentation utilizing MTL. Our findings demonstrate that ATOMMIC is the only MTL framework with harmonized complex-valued and real-valued data support. Evaluations on single tasks show that physics-based models, which enforce data consistency by leveraging the physical properties of MRI, outperform other models in reconstructing highly accelerated acquisitions. Physics-based models that produce high reconstruction quality can accurately estimate quantitative parameter maps. When high-performing reconstruction models are combined with robust segmentation networks utilizing MTL, performance is improved in both tasks. ATOMMIC facilitates MRI reconstruction and analysis by standardizing workflows, enhancing data interoperability, integrating unique features like MTL, and effectively benchmarking DL models.</description>

      <title>R-Shiny Applications for Local Clustering to be Included in the growclusters for R Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: growclusters for R is a package that estimates a partition structure for multivariate data. It does this by implementing a hierarchical version of k-means clustering that accounts for possible known dependencies in a collection of datasets, where each set draws its cluster means from a single, global partition. Each component data set in the collection corresponds to a known group in the data. This paper focuses on R Shiny applications that implement the clustering methodology and simulate data sets with known group structures. These Shiny applications implement novel ways of visualizing the results of the clustering. These visualizations include scatterplots of individual data sets in the context of the entire collection and cluster distributions versus component (or sub-domain) datasets. Data obtained from a collection of 2000-2013 articles from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Monthly Labor Review (MLR) will be used to illustrate the R-Shiny applications. Here, the known grouping in the collection is the year of publication.</description>

      <title>AsaPy: A Python Library for Aerospace Simulation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AsaPy is a custom-made Python library designed to simplify and optimize the analysis of aerospace simulation data. Instead of introducing new methodologies, it excels in combining various established techniques, creating a unified, specialized platform. It offers a range of features, including the design of experiment methods, statistical analysis techniques, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization tools. AsaPy's flexibility and customizability make it a viable solution for engineers and researchers who need to quickly gain insights into aerospace simulations. AsaPy is built on top of popular scientific computing libraries, ensuring high performance and scalability. In this work, we provide an overview of the key features and capabilities of AsaPy, followed by an exposition of its architecture and demonstrations of its effectiveness through some use cases applied in military operational simulations. We also evaluate how other simulation tools deal with data science, highlighting AsaPy's strengths and advantages. Finally, we discuss potential use cases and applications of AsaPy and outline future directions for the development and improvement of the library.</description>
