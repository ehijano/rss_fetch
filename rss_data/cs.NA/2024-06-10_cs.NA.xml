      <title>A layer decomposition method for multi-layer elastic contact systems with interlayer Tresca friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing demand for the accuracy of numerical simulation of pavement mechanics, the variational inequality model and its induced finite element method which can simulate the interlayer contact state becomes a potential solution. In this paper, a layer decomposition algorithm for solving variational inequality models of multi-layer elastic contact systems with interlayer Tresca friction conditions is studied. Continuous and discrete versions of the algorithm and their convergence theorems have been proposed and proved successively. Then, the algebraic form of the executable optimization algorithm and the numerical experimental results verify the practicability of the variational inequality model and its algorithm in the pavement mechanics modeling.</description>

      <title>Mixed Finite Element Method for Multi-layer Elastic Contact Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of multi-layer elastic systems in the field of engineering mechanics, the corresponding variational inequality theory and algorithm design have received more attention and research. In this study, a class of equivalent saddle point problems with interlayer Tresca friction conditions and the mixed finite element method are proposed and analyzed. Then, the convergence of the numerical solution of the mixed finite element method is theoretically proven, and the corresponding algebraic dual algorithm is given. Finally, through numerical experiments, the mixed finite element method is not only compared with the layer decomposition method, but also its convergence relationship with respect to the spatial discretization parameter $H$ is verified.</description>

      <title>A general framework for floating point error analysis of simplex derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient approximations are a class of numerical approximation techniques that are of central importance in numerical optimization. In derivative-free optimization, most of the gradient approximations, including the simplex gradient, centred simplex gradient, and adapted centred simplex gradient, are in the form of simplex derivatives. Owing to machine precision, the approximation accuracy of any numerical approximation technique is subject to the influence of floating point errors. In this paper, we provide a general framework for floating point error analysis of simplex derivatives. Our framework is independent of the choice of the simplex derivative as long as it satisfies a general form. We review the definition and approximation accuracy of the generalized simplex gradient and generalized centred simplex gradient. We define and analyze the accuracy of a generalized version of the adapted centred simplex gradient. As examples, we apply our framework to the generalized simplex gradient, generalized centred simplex gradient, and generalized adapted centred simplex gradient. Based on the results, we give suggestions on the minimal choice of approximate diameter of the sample set.</description>

      <title>Interplay between preconditioning and regularization for linear ill-posed problems solved by conjugate gradient. Application to optical flow estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the possibilities offered by combining regularization and preconditioning by the same symmetric positive semi-definite operator when solving ill-posed problems. We study the question of the stopping criterion, and the possibility offered by Ritz eigenelements for the a posteriori filtering of the solution and the tuning of Tikhonov's weight. The method is applied as the linear solver for an optical flow estimator and it is coupled with a subspace recycling strategy.</description>

      <title>Enhanced preprocessed multi-step splitting iterations for computing PageRank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the PageRank algorithm has garnered significant attention due to its crucial role in search engine technologies and its applications across various scientific fields. It is well-known that the power method is a classical method for computing PageRank. However, there is a pressing demand for alternative approaches that can address its limitations and enhance its efficiency. Specifically, the power method converges very slowly when the damping factor is close to 1. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a new multi-step splitting iteration approach for accelerating PageRank computations. Furthermore, we present two new approaches for computating PageRank, which are modifications of the new multi-step splitting iteration approach, specifically utilizing the thick restarted Arnoldi and generalized Arnoldi methods. We provide detailed discussions on the construction and theoretical convergence results of these two approaches. Extensive experiments using large test matrices demonstrate the significant performance improvements achieved by our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Entropy stable finite difference schemes for Chew, Goldberger &amp; Low anisotropic plasma flow equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the Chew, Goldberger \&amp; Low (CGL) plasma flow equations, which is a set of nonlinear, non-conservative hyperbolic PDEs modelling anisotropic plasma flows. These equations incorporate the double adiabatic approximation for the evolution of the pressure, making them very valuable for plasma physics, space physics and astrophysical applications. We first present the entropy analysis for the weak solutions. We then propose entropy-stable finite-difference schemes for the CGL equations. The key idea is to rewrite the CGL equations such that the non-conservative terms do not contribute to the entropy equations. The conservative part of the rewritten equations is very similar to the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. We then symmetrize the conservative part by following Godunov's symmetrization process for MHD. The resulting equations are then discretized by designing entropy conservative numerical flux and entropy diffusion operator based on the entropy scaled eigenvectors of the conservative part. We then prove the semi-discrete entropy stability of the schemes for CGL equations. The schemes are then tested using several test problems derived from the corresponding MHD test cases.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Error Estimation and Adaptivity for Stochastic Collocation FEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a general goal-oriented adaptive strategy for approximating quantities of interest (QoIs) associated with solutions to linear elliptic partial differential equations with random inputs. The QoIs are represented by bounded linear or continuously G\^ateaux differentiable nonlinear goal functionals, and the approximations are computed using the sparse grid stochastic collocation finite element method (SC-FEM). The proposed adaptive strategy relies on novel reliable a posteriori estimates of the errors in approximating QoIs. One of the key features of our error estimation approach is the introduction of a correction term into the approximation of QoIs in order to compensate for the lack of (global) Galerkin orthogonality in the SC-FEM setting. Computational results generated using the proposed adaptive algorithm are presented in the paper for representative elliptic problems with affine and nonaffine parametric coefficient dependence and for a range of linear and nonlinear goal functionals.</description>

      <title>Dynamical mixture modeling with fast, automatic determination of Markov chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov state modeling has gained popularity in various scientific fields due to its ability to reduce complex time series data into transitions between a few states. Yet, current frameworks are limited by assuming a single Markov chain describes the data, and they suffer an inability to discern heterogeneities. As a solution, this paper proposes a variational expectation-maximization algorithm that identifies a mixture of Markov chains in a time-series data set. The method is agnostic to the definition of the Markov states, whether data-driven (e.g. by spectral clustering) or based on domain knowledge. Variational EM efficiently and organically identifies the number of Markov chains and dynamics of each chain without expensive model comparisons or posterior sampling. The approach is supported by a theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, including simulated and observational data sets based on ${\tt Last.fm}$ music listening, ultramarathon running, and gene expression. The results show the new algorithm is competitive with contemporary mixture modeling approaches and powerful in identifying meaningful heterogeneities in time series data.</description>

      <title>Stability of stationary states for mean field models with multichromatic interaction potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider weakly interacting diffusions on the torus, for multichromatic interaction potentials. We consider interaction potentials that are not H-stable, leading to phase transitions in the mean field limit. We show that the mean field dynamics can exhibit multipeak stationary states, where the number of peaks is related to the number of nonzero Fourier modes of the interaction. We also consider the effect of a confining potential on the structure of non-uniform steady states. We approach the problem by means of analysis, perturbation theory and numerical simulations for the interacting particle systems and the PDEs.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of the Apollonian gasket</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Apollonian gasket is a well-studied circle packing. Important properties of the packing, including the distribution of the circle radii, are governed by its Hausdorff dimension. No closed form is currently known for the Hausdorff dimension, and its computation is a special case of a more general and hard problem: effective, rigorous estimates of dimension of a parabolic limit set. In this paper we develop an efficient method for solving this problem which allows us to compute the dimension of the gasket to 128 decimal places and rigorously justify the error bounds. We expect our approach to generalise easily to other parabolic fractals.</description>

      <title>Scaling up Probabilistic PDE Simulators with Structured Volumetric Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling real-world problems with partial differential equations (PDEs) is a prominent topic in scientific machine learning. Classic solvers for this task continue to play a central role, e.g. to generate training data for deep learning analogues. Any such numerical solution is subject to multiple sources of uncertainty, both from limited computational resources and limited data (including unknown parameters). Gaussian process analogues to classic PDE simulation methods have recently emerged as a framework to construct fully probabilistic estimates of all these types of uncertainty. So far, much of this work focused on theoretical foundations, and as such is not particularly data efficient or scalable. Here we propose a framework combining a discretization scheme based on the popular Finite Volume Method with complementary numerical linear algebra techniques. Practical experiments, including a spatiotemporal tsunami simulation, demonstrate substantially improved scaling behavior of this approach over previous collocation-based techniques.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper, we examine a Crouzeix-Raviart approximation for non-linear partial differential equations having a $(p,\delta)$-structure for some $p\in (1,\infty)$ and $\delta\ge 0$. We establish a priori error estimates, which are optimal for all $p\in (1,\infty)$ and $\delta\ge 0$, medius error estimates, i.e., best-approximation results, and a primal-dual a posteriori error estimate, which is both reliable and efficient. The theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.16609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boundary element methods for elliptic partial differential equations typically lead to boundary integral operators with translation-invariant kernel functions. Taking advantage of this property is fairly simple for particle methods, e.g., Nystrom-type discretizations, but more challenging if the supports of basis functions have to be taken into account.
  In this article, we present a modified construction for $\mathcal{H}^2$-matrices that uses translation-invariance to significantly reduce the storage requirements. Due to the uniformity of the boxes used for the construction, we need only a few uncomplicated assumptions to prove estimates for the resulting storage complexity.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-based Edge Multiscale Finite Element Methods for Singularly Perturbed Convection-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel efficient and robust Wavelet-based Edge Multiscale Finite Element Method (WEMsFEM) motivated by \cite{MR3980476,GL18} to solve the singularly perturbed convection-diffusion equations. The main idea is to first establish a local splitting of the solution over a local region by a local bubble part and local Harmonic extension part, and then derive a global splitting by means of Partition of Unity. This facilitates a representation of the solution as a summation of a global bubble part and a global Harmonic extension part, where the first part can be computed locally in parallel. To approximate the second part, we construct an edge multiscale ansatz space locally with hierarchical bases as the local boundary data that has a guaranteed approximation rate \noteLg{both inside and outside of the layers}. The key innovation of this proposed WEMsFEM lies in a provable convergence rate with little restriction on the mesh size. Its convergence rate with respect to the computational degree of freedom is rigorously analyzed, which is verified by extensive 2-d and 3-d numerical tests.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a bilinear optimal control problem for the Stokes--Brinkman equations: the control variable enters the state equations as a coefficient. In two- and three-dimensional Lipschitz domains, we perform a complete continuous analysis that includes the existence of solutions and first- and second-order optimality conditions. We also develop two finite element methods that differ fundamentally in whether the admissible control set is discretized or not. For each of the proposed methods, we perform a convergence analysis and derive a priori error estimates; the latter under the assumption that the domain is convex. Finally, assuming that the domain is Lipschitz, we develop an a posteriori error estimator for each discretization scheme, obtain a global reliability bound, and investigate local efficiency estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard photoacoustic tomography (PAT) provides data that consist of time-dependent signals governed by the wave equation, which are measured on an observation surface. In contrast, the measured data from the recently invented full-field PAT is the Radon transform of the solution of the wave equation on a spatial domain at a single instant in time. While reconstruction using classical PAT data has been extensively studied, not much is known about the full-field PAT problem. In this paper, we study full-field photoacoustic tomography with spatially variable sound speed and spatially variable damping. In particular, we prove the uniqueness and stability of the associated single-time full-field wave inversion problem and develop algorithms for its numerical inversion using iterative and variational regularization methods. Numerical simulations are presented for both full-angle and limited-angle data cases</description>

Abstract: We introduce a method for inferring an explicit PDE from a data sample generated by previously unseen dynamics, based on a learned context. The training phase integrates knowledge of the form of the equation with a differential scheme, while the inference phase yields a PDE that fits the data sample and enables both signal prediction and data explanation. We include results of extensive experimentation, comparing our method to SOTA approaches, together with ablation studies that examine different flavors of our solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a deterministic algorithm for the efficient evaluation of imaginary time diagrams based on the recently introduced discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) of imaginary time Green's functions. In addition to the efficient discretization of diagrammatic integrals afforded by its approximation properties, the DLR basis is separable in imaginary time, allowing us to decompose diagrams into linear combinations of nested sequences of one-dimensional products and convolutions. Focusing on the strong coupling bold-line expansion of generalized Anderson impurity models, we show that our strategy reduces the computational complexity of evaluating an $M$th-order diagram at inverse temperature $\beta$ and spectral width $\omega_{\max}$ from $\mathcal{O}((\beta \omega_{\max})^{2M-1})$ for a direct quadrature to $\mathcal{O}(M (\log (\beta \omega_{\max}))^{M+1})$, with controllable high-order accuracy. We benchmark our algorithm using third-order expansions for multi-band impurity problems with off-diagonal hybridization and spin-orbit coupling, presenting comparisons with exact diagonalization and quantum Monte Carlo approaches. In particular, we perform a self-consistent dynamical mean-field theory calculation for a three-band Hubbard model with strong spin-orbit coupling representing a minimal model of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, demonstrating the promise of the method for modeling realistic strongly correlated multi-band materials. For both strong and weak coupling expansions of low and intermediate order, in which diagrams can be enumerated, our method provides an efficient, straightforward, and robust black-box evaluation procedure. In this sense, it fills a gap between diagrammatic approximations of the lowest order, which are simple and inexpensive but inaccurate, and those based on Monte Carlo sampling of high-order diagrams.</description>

      <title>Solving Dense Linear Systems Faster Than via Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a stochastic optimization algorithm that solves a dense $n\times n$ real-valued linear system $Ax=b$, returning $\tilde x$ such that $\|A\tilde x-b\|\leq \epsilon\|b\|$ in time: $$\tilde O((n^2+nk^{\omega-1})\log1/\epsilon),$$ where $k$ is the number of singular values of $A$ larger than $O(1)$ times its smallest positive singular value, $\omega &lt; 2.372$ is the matrix multiplication exponent, and $\tilde O$ hides a poly-logarithmic in $n$ factor. When $k=O(n^{1-\theta})$ (namely, $A$ has a flat-tailed spectrum, e.g., due to noisy data or regularization), this improves on both the cost of solving the system directly, as well as on the cost of preconditioning an iterative method such as conjugate gradient. In particular, our algorithm has an $\tilde O(n^2)$ runtime when $k=O(n^{0.729})$. We further adapt this result to sparse positive semidefinite matrices and least squares regression.
  Our main algorithm can be viewed as a randomized block coordinate descent method, where the key challenge is simultaneously ensuring good convergence and fast per-iteration time. In our analysis, we use theory of majorization for elementary symmetric polynomials to establish a sharp convergence guarantee when coordinate blocks are sampled using a determinantal point process. We then use a Markov chain coupling argument to show that similar convergence can be attained with a cheaper sampling scheme, and accelerate the block coordinate descent update via matrix sketching.</description>

      <title>Multi-indices coproducts from ODEs to singular SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce explicit formulae for the coproducts at play for multi-indices in ODEs and in singular SPDEs. The two coproducts described correspond to versions of the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer and extraction/contraction coproducts with multi-indices. The main idea is to use the fact that these coproducts are the adjoints of dual products for which one has explicit simple formulae. We are able to derive the explicit formulae via an inner product defined from a symmetry factor easily computable for multi-indices.</description>
