      <title>Partially hyperbolic dynamics in the 3-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct symplectic blenders for two classical Hamiltonian systems: the 3-body problem and its restricted version. We use these objects to show that both models exhibit a robust, strong form of topological instability. We do not assume any smallness conditions on the masses but require only that at least two of them are distinct.
  Our construction is based on two abstract results which might be of independent interest. The first one gives an explicit condition under which a given pair of twist maps of the cylinder generates a locally transitive iterated function system. The second one extends this result to certain cylinder skew-products.</description>

      <title>Snell meets Fagnano. Path optimization through an imperfect mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renowned Fagnano problem asks for the inscribed triangle of minimal perimeter within a given reference triangle. Equivalently, it seeks a billiard trajectory inside the triangle that closes after three reflections. In this note, we consider a modification of this classical problem: finding the inscribed triangle of minimal weighted perimeter -- or, equivalently, the periodic trajectory of a Snell billiard.</description>

      <title>From two-dimensional continuous maps to one-dimensional discontinuous maps: a novel reduction explaining complex bifurcation structures in piecewise-linear families of maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piecewise-linear maps describe dynamical phenomena that switch between distinct states and readily generate complex bifurcation structures due to their strong nonlinearity. We show that two-dimensional continuous piecewise-linear maps near certain codimension-two homoclinic bifurcations are well approximated by a three-parameter family of one-dimensional maps. Each member of the one-dimensional family is discontinuous, because the family is constructed from the first return of iterates to a subset of phase space, and comprised of infinitely many linear pieces, where each piece corresponds to a fixed number of iterations near the saddle associated with the homoclinic bifurcation. The one-dimensional family exhibits period-incrementing, period-adding, bandcount-incrementing, and bandcount-adding structures (all typical for two-piece maps), as well as unique features caused by orbits repeatedly visiting more than two pieces of the map. These structures carry through to the two-dimensional maps with only minor differences in the arrangement of the bifurcations developing with the distance from the codimension-two bifurcations. This leads to a novel and vivid elucidation of the dynamics of the two-dimensional border-collision normal form.</description>

      <title>Entropy rigidity of $u$-Gibbs measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain new entropy rigidity results for $u$-Gibbs measures by showing that whenever a $u$-Gibbs measure of a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism admits an unstable Margulis family, the unstable Jacobian data of the system must to be constant. We apply our result to center isometries and flow type diffeomorphisms showing that if a measure of maximal entropy is also $u$-Gibbs then Jacobian periodic data along the unstable bundle are constant. In the case of smooth jointly integrable partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb{T}^3$, assuming that there exists some $u$-Gibbs measure which is also a measure of maximal unstable entropy, we obtain smooth conjugacy along the center-unstable foliation and uniqueness of $u$-Gibbs measures in this case.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension for the weighted products of multiple digits in d-decaying Gauss like systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Hausdorff dimension of sets defined by the growth of weighted products of multiple digits at arbitrary positions in $d$-decaying Gauss-like iterated function systems. We provide the complete Hausdorff dimensional result for product of more than two digits, which was an open problem even for consecutive digits in the classical Gauss map and L\"{u}roth map. In our approach we do not need to assume the Bounded Distortion Property (BDP).</description>

      <title>On the intersection of Cantor sets and products of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kenyon and Peres (1991) showed that the Hausdorff dimension of intersections of randomly translated Cantor sets can be expressed in terms of the top Lyapunov exponent of a product of random matrices, and this exponent can be written as an integral with respect to stationary measures on the projective line. Although explicit computations are available when stationary measures are discrete, the continuous case has remained challenging.
  In this paper we introduce new combinatorial and analytic tools that allow us to compute the Lyapunov exponent, and hence the Hausdorff dimension, in a broad class of examples where stationary measures are continuous. As an application, we complete the dimension computation in the setting where a single digit is forbidden; for example, we determine the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection of the middle-seventh Cantor set with a random translate of itself.</description>

      <title>Stability and Hopf bifurcation analysis of an age-structured SVIRS epidemic model with temporary immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an SVIRS epidemic model that incorporates both temporary immunity and an age-structured recovery process. By reformulating the system as a non-densely defined abstract Cauchy problem, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions and derive the basic reproduction number $ \mathcal{R}_0 $. The stability of the equilibria is analyzed through the associated characteristic equations, and the occurrence of Hopf bifurcation near the endemic equilibrium is rigorously demonstrated. Our theoretical results reveal that temporary immunity plays a crucial role in shaping the stability of the endemic state. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to verify and illustrate the analytical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a non-elementary, non-convex-cocompact Kleinian group acting on $\mathbb{H}^{d}$. We show that the Hausdorff dimension of the sublinearly conical Myrberg limit set of $\Gamma$ is equal to the critical exponent of $\Gamma$. This gives a different proof of a theorem by M. Mj and W. Yang. Along the way, we construct subsemigroups of $\Gamma$ of divergence type and develop the Patterson--Sullivan theory.</description>

      <title>Transient rebellions in the Kuramoto oscillator: Morse-Smale structural stability and connection graphs of finite 2-shift type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated 1975 Kuramoto model of $N$ identical oscillators with phase angle vector $\boldsymbol{\vartheta}=(\vartheta_1,\ldots,\vartheta_N)$ and all-to-all coupling reads \begin{equation} \label{*} \dot\vartheta_j\,=\tfrac{1}{N}\sum_{k=1}^N \sin(\vartheta_k-\vartheta_j). \tag{*} \end{equation} Here we have passed to co-rotating coordinates in normalized time scale. The model is highly accessible to rigorous mathematical analysis, and has been studied as a paradigm for effects like total and partial synchronization.
  Most initial conditions $\boldsymbol{\vartheta}$ lead to total synchronization. The plethora of $2^N-1$ (circles of) partially synchronized states, however, is unstable. The precise behavior of transitions to synchrony seems to have eluded description. In the present paper, we address this gap.
  By the gradient structure of (*), the global dynamics decompose into equilibria and heteroclinic orbits between them. Except for the extremes of total instability and total synchrony, all equilibria are 2-cluster solutions: their phase angles $\vartheta_j$ attain only two values, with a phase difference of $\pi$ between them.
  Any heteroclinic orbit between 2-cluster equilibria, or towards synchrony, can be realized as a 3-cluster rebellion. Cluster rebellions split the smaller, "slim", minority cluster of the source equilibrium and send the rebellious part to join the bigger, "fat", majority cluster.
  Heteroclinic transversality identifies the Kuramoto model as a structurally stable Morse-Smale system. In particular, heteroclinic orbits can be concatenated in finite time. The options involved in successive cluster rebellions amount to finite symbol sequences of 2-shift type.
  The paper is dedicated to Professor Yoshiki Kuramoto, with admiration.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Synchronization States in the Hybrid Kuramoto Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a unified synchronization framework for the all-to-all hybrid Kuramoto model that couples first- and second-order oscillators within a single dynamical system. Although the Kuramoto model has become one of the most widely used paradigms for describing synchronization phenomena-appearing in more than 100,000 scientific studies-the fundamental relationships among distinct synchronization states remain unresolved. In this work, we rigorously prove that full phase-locking, phase-locking, frequency synchronization, and order-parameter synchronization are equivalent for arbitrary hybrid ensembles. The proof combines dissipative energy methods, LaSalle-type compactness arguments, the Poincar\'e-Bendixson theorem, and Thieme's asymptotically autonomous theory to demonstrate that synchronization equivalence is topological, determined solely by the finite equilibrium structure of the all-to-all network. This result provides a mathematically complete characterization of synchronization in finite oscillator systems and clarifies its geometric invariance across first-, second-, and hybrid-order models.</description>

Abstract: Let $K$ be a number field, $X$ a smooth projective variety over $K$ and $f: X \to X$ a polarized endomorphism of degree $d \geq 2$. We prove an exponential lower bound on $[K(\Per_n):K]$, where $\Per_n$ is the set of $n$-periodic points, extending results of [Yap24] to higher dimensions. We also prove a quantitative rate of equidistribution for $\Per_n$ to the equilibrium measure.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order Smith predictor for state feedback control with guaranteed stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article deals with the implementation of the Smith Predictor for state feedback control in state space representation. The desired control law, obtained using partial differential equations and backstepping control, contains an integral term that has to be approximated for implementation. In this article, we propose a new way to implement this control law using a dynamic controller. The control law is composed of a state feedback term and a dynamic term that approaches the integral term that has to be estimated for implementation. Using a Lyapunov functional, we provide sufficient conditions, in terms of a linear matrix inequality, to guarantee that the closed-loop system is stable when the proposed control law is applied. We use three examples, taken from the literature, to show the benefits of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen's growing role in the transition towards climate-neutral energy systems necessitates structured modeling frameworks. Existing gas network models, largely developed for natural gas, fail to capture hydrogen systems distinct properties, particularly the coupling of hydrogen pipes with electrolyzers, fuel cells, and electrically driven compressors. In this work, we present a unified systematic port-Hamiltonian (pH) framework for modeling hydrogen systems, which inherently provides a passive input-output map of the overall interconnected system and, thus, a promising foundation for structured analysis, control and optimization of this type of newly emerging energy systems.</description>

      <title>Convergence to stationary points in the Weisbuch-Kirman-Herreiner model for buyers' preferences in fish markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a paper published in The Economic Journal in 2000, Weisbuch et al.\ introduce a model for buyers' preferences to the various sellers in over-the-counter (OTC) fish markets. While this model has become an archetype of economic conceptualization that combines bounded rationality and myopic reasoning, the literature on its asymptotic behaviours has remained scarce. In this paper, we proceed to a mathematical analysis of the dynamics and its full characterization in the simplest case of homogeneous buyer populations. By using elements of the theory of cooperative dynamical systems, we prove that, independently of the number of sellers and parameters, for almost every initial condition, the subsequent trajectory must asymptotically approach a stationary state. Moreover, for simple enough distributions of the sellers' attractiveness, we determine all stationary states and their parameter-dependent stability. This analysis shows that in most cases, the asymptotic preferences are ordered as the attractiveness are. However, depending on the parameters, there also exist robust functioning modes in which those sellers with highest preference are not the ones that provide highest profit.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides a unified framework connecting dynamical systems with tools from topological data analysis and geometric topology and inspires new interactions among dynamical systems, topology, and nonlinear analysis. To this end, we introduce a one-parameter family of ``chain recurrences'' that generalizes chain recurrence and induces a natural filtration on the underlying metric space of a dynamical system. In particular, the forward directions of the filtrations characterize the level of control required to return to the original position, and the backward directions capture the robustness of the recurrence. The resulting filtrations yield potentials and bifurcation diagrams of dynamical systems that encode the evolution of recurrent sets under bounded total or stepwise perturbations. In addition, we extend Morse graphs to one-parameter families of ``coarse Morse graphs,'' which evolve through vertex collapses reflecting coarse recurrence transitions. These constructions not only refine Conley's decomposition but also reveal singular limit behaviors as the perturbation level vanishes. Furthermore, we establish analogous filtrations for difference equations to bridge the theoretical framework with numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Stability of Synchronized Motion in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.2297</link>
      <description>arXiv:1112.2297v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a succinct and self-contained description of the synchronized motion on networks of mutually coupled oscillators. Usually, the stability criterion for the stability of synchronized motion is obtained in terms of Lyapunov exponents. We consider the fully diffusive case which is amenable to treatment in terms of uniform contractions. This approach provides a rigorous, yet clear and concise, way to the important results.</description>

      <title>Stability of travelling wave solutions to reaction-diffusion equations driven by additive noise with H\"older continuous paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12944v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate stability of travelling wave solutions to a class of reaction-diffusion equations perturbed by infinite-dimensional additive noise with H\"older continuous paths, covering in particular fractional Brownian motion with general Hurst index. We obtain long- and short time asymptotic error bounds on the maximal distance from the solution of the stochastic reaction-diffusion equation to the orbit of travelling wave fronts. These bounds, in terms of Hurst index and H\"older exponent, apply to a large class of infinite-dimensional self-similar drivers with H\"older continuous paths, such as linear fractional stable motion. We find that for short times, higher Hurst indices imply higher stability, while for large times, a smaller gap between Hurst index and H\"older exponent implies stability for larger noise amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Feedback stabilization for a spatial-dependent Sterile Insect Technique model with Allee Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on feedback control strategies for applying the sterile insect technique (SIT) to eliminate pest populations. The presentation is centered on the case of mosquito populations, but most of the results can be extended to other species by adapting the model and selecting appropriate parameter values to describe the reproduction and movement dynamics of the species under consideration. In our study, we address the spatial distribution of the population in a two dimensional bounded domain by extending the temporal SIT model analyzed in [2], thereby obtaining a reaction-diffusion SIT model. After the analysis of the existence and the uniqueness of the solution of this problem, we construct a feedback law that globally asymptotically stabilizes the extinction equilibrium thus yielding a robust strategy to keep the pest population at very low levels in the long term.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of sets of continued fractions with unbounded partial quotients along subsequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $x=[a_1(x),a_2(x),\ldots]$ be the continued fraction expansion of $x\in[0,1)$. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension of \begin{equation*}E_{even}=\{x\in[0,1)\colon a_{2n}(x)\to\infty\ (n\to\infty)\}.\end{equation*} is 1/2. In general, we study the set of continued fractions with unbounded partial quotients along subsequence \begin{equation*}E_{\{k_n\}}=\{x\in[0,1)\colon a_{k_n}(x)\to\infty\ (n\to\infty)\},\end{equation*} where $\{k_n\}\subset\mathbb{N}$ is a subsequence. We show that $E_{\{k_n\}}$ has Hausdorff dimension 1/2 or 1 according to whether the set of indices $\{k_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ has positive or zero upper density respectively.</description>

      <title>$2$-large sets are sets of Bohr recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_d$ be real numbers, and let $S$ be the set of integers $s$ so that $||\alpha_i s||_{\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}&gt;\delta$ for some $i$ and some fixed $\delta&gt;0$. We prove $S$ is not \enquote{$2$-large}, i.e. there is a $2$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ that avoids arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$.</description>
