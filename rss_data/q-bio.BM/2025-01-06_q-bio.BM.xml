      <title>A Survey of Deep Learning Methods in Protein Bioinformatics and its Impact on Protein Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins are sequences of amino acids that serve as the basic building blocks of living organisms. Despite rapidly growing databases documenting structural and functional information for various protein sequences, our understanding of proteins remains limited because of the large possible sequence space and the complex inter- and intra-molecular forces. Deep learning, which is characterized by its ability to learn relevant features directly from large datasets, has demonstrated remarkable performance in fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. It has also been increasingly applied in recent years to the data-rich domain of protein sequences with great success, most notably with Alphafold2's breakout performance in the protein structure prediction. The performance improvements achieved by deep learning unlocks new possibilities in the field of protein bioinformatics, including protein design, one of the most difficult but useful tasks. In this paper, we broadly categorize problems in protein bioinformatics into three main categories: 1) structural prediction, 2) functional prediction, and 3) protein design, and review the progress achieved from using deep learning methodologies in each of them. We expand on the main challenges of the protein design problem and highlight how advances in structural and functional prediction have directly contributed to design tasks. Finally, we conclude by identifying important topics and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Remodeling Peptide-MHC-TCR Triad Binding as Sequence Fusion for Immunogenicity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex nature of tripartite peptide-MHC-TCR interactions is a critical yet underexplored area in immunogenicity prediction. Traditional studies on TCR-antigen binding have not fully addressed the complex dependencies in triad binding. In this paper, we propose new modeling approaches for these tripartite interactions, utilizing sequence information from MHCs, peptides, and TCRs. Our methods adhere to native sequence forms and align with biological processes to enhance prediction accuracy. By incorporating representation learning techniques, we introduce a fusion mechanism to integrate the three sequences effectively. Empirical experiments show that our models outperform traditional methods, achieving a 2.8 to 13.3 percent improvement in prediction accuracy across existing benchmarks. We further validate our approach with extensive ablation studies, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model components. The model implementation, code, and supplementary materials, including a manuscript with colored hyperlinks and a technical appendix for digital viewing, will be open-sourced upon publication.</description>

      <title>CoPRA: Bridging Cross-domain Pretrained Sequence Models with Complex Structures for Protein-RNA Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately measuring protein-RNA binding affinity is crucial in many biological processes and drug design. Previous computational methods for protein-RNA binding affinity prediction rely on either sequence or structure features, unable to capture the binding mechanisms comprehensively. The recent emerging pre-trained language models trained on massive unsupervised sequences of protein and RNA have shown strong representation ability for various in-domain downstream tasks, including binding site prediction. However, applying different-domain language models collaboratively for complex-level tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose CoPRA to bridge pre-trained language models from different biological domains via Complex structure for Protein-RNA binding Affinity prediction. We demonstrate for the first time that cross-biological modal language models can collaborate to improve binding affinity prediction. We propose a Co-Former to combine the cross-modal sequence and structure information and a bi-scope pre-training strategy for improving Co-Former's interaction understanding. Meanwhile, we build the largest protein-RNA binding affinity dataset PRA310 for performance evaluation. We also test our model on a public dataset for mutation effect prediction. CoPRA reaches state-of-the-art performance on all the datasets. We provide extensive analyses and verify that CoPRA can (1) accurately predict the protein-RNA binding affinity; (2) understand the binding affinity change caused by mutations; and (3) benefit from scaling data and model size.</description>
