      <title>Quantum Direct Steganography Scheme Based on Modified Generator Projection Directions of Steane Code over a Single-Type Pauli Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, measurements of a quantum state in various directions yield distinct outcomes, a principle that forms the foundation of quantum communication theory. This paper expands upon this concept by introducing a method to modify generator projection directions (MGPD) within quantum stabilizer codes. Employing the Steane code ($(7,1,3)$ code), as a fundamental carrier, we develop a novel scheme for direct quantum steganography across a single-type Pauli channel. The infeasibility of eavesdropping decoding under MGPD is proven. We detail the steganographic encoding and decoding schemes, corresponding quantum circuits, and eavesdropping detection principles. We also use a 'Sudoku'-style strategy to balance steganographic error probabilities and provide the complete steganography protocol. Relative to existing studies, the MGPD method achieves embedding rates approaching and attaining the upper limit of the information capacity for the $(n,k,d)=(7,1,3)$ code within a noise probability range of approximately $1/(n+1)=12.5\%$. It also reduces the consumption of auxiliary keys from $O(\log{(N)})$ to $O(1)$, while enabling eavesdropping detection and steganography of arbitrary quantum states. We investigate its potential applications in quantum communication and assess its benefits in the context of secret information transmission and eavesdropping detection in noisy channels. Although the MGPD method incorporates certain idealized assumptions and limitations, it provides novel perspectives on the concealment of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Enhanced Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing and quantum sensing represent two distinct frontiers of quantum information science. In this work, we harness quantum computing to solve a fundamental and practically important sensing problem: the detection of weak oscillating fields with unknown strength and frequency. We present a quantum computing enhanced sensing protocol that outperforms all existing approaches. Furthermore, we prove our approach is optimal by establishing the Grover-Heisenberg limit -- a fundamental lower bound on the minimum sensing time. The key idea is to robustly digitize the continuous, analog signal into a discrete operation, which is then integrated into a quantum algorithm. Our metrological gain originates from quantum computation, distinguishing our protocol from conventional sensing approaches. Indeed, we prove that broad classes of protocols based on quantum Fisher information, finite-lifetime quantum memory, or classical signal processing are strictly less powerful. Our protocol is compatible with multiple experimental platforms. We propose and analyze a proof-of-principle experiment using nitrogen-vacancy centers, where meaningful improvements are achievable using current technology. This work establishes quantum computation as a powerful new resource for advancing sensing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Vacuum fluctuations induced decoherence of a diamagnetic nanosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a simple derivation of the decoherence rate for a diamagnetic nanoparticle in the presence of vacuum fluctuations of the magnetic field. Diamagnetic levitation is one of the key techniques for trapping, cooling, and creating a macroscopic quantum spatial superposition in many experiments. It is widely applied in many theoretical and experimental endeavors to test fundamental physics in matter-wave interferometers. To estimate the decoherence rate originating from magnetic-field fluctuations, we use the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We show that our resulting decoherence rate expression is analogous to that of dielectric material in the presence of vacuum fluctuations due to the electric background field component; however, it is often relatively suppressed due to the material properties.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian two-time correlation functions for optomechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the two-time correlation function (TTCF) of the cavity optomechanical system, which serves as the most popular tool in precision detection technologies. We utilize the stochastic Schrodinger equation approach to study TTCF for the cavity optomechanical system in the long-time steady state TTCF and time-dependent case. Our numerical simulations support two major conclusions: (1) long-time steady states in Markovian and non-Markovian regimes are different, resulting in the distinct TTCF, and (2) the time-dependent TTCF can reveal more information about the environment, rather than the traditional spectral function method.</description>

      <title>Masking Countermeasures Against Side-Channel Attacks on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modification to the transpiler of a quantum computer to safeguard against side-channel attacks aimed at learning information about a quantum circuit. We demonstrate that if it is feasible to shield a specific subset of gates from side-channel attacks, then it is possible to conceal all information in a quantum circuit by transpiling it into a new circuit whose depth grows linearly, depending on the quantum computer's architecture. We provide concrete examples of implementing this protection on IBM's quantum computers, utilizing their virtual gates and editing their transpiler.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the imaginarity via different distance measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently introduced resource theory of imaginarity facilitates a systematic investigation into the role of complex numbers in quantum mechanics and quantum information theory. In this work, we propose well-defined measures of imaginarity using various distance metrics, drawing inspiration from recent advancements in quantum entanglement and coherence. Specifically, we focus on quantitatively evaluating imaginarity through measures such as Tsallis relative $\alpha$-entropy, Sandwiched R\'{e}nyi relative entropy, and Tsallis relative operator entropy. Additionally, we analyze the decay rates of these measures. Our findings reveal that the Tsallis relative $\alpha$-entropy of imaginarity exhibits higher decay rate under quantum channels compared to other measures. Finally, we examine the ordering of single-qubit states under these imaginarity measures, demonstrating that the order remains invariant under the bit-flip channel for specific parameter ranges. This study enhances our understanding of imaginarity as a quantum resource and its potential applications in quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Exact amplitudes of parametric processes in driven Josephson circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general approach for analyzing arbitrary parametric processes in Josephson circuits within a single degree of freedom approximation. Introducing a systematic normal-ordered expansion for the Hamiltonian of parametrically driven superconducting circuits we present a flexible procedure to describe parametric processes and to compare different circuit designs for particular applications. We obtain formally exact amplitudes (`supercoefficients') of these parametric processes for driven SNAIL-based and SQUID-based circuits. The corresponding amplitudes contain complete information about the circuit topology, the form of the nonlinearity, and the parametric drive, making them, in particular, well-suited for the study of the strong drive regime. We present a closed-form expression for supercoefficients describing circuits without stray inductors and a tractable formulation for those with it. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by applying it to the estimation of Kerr-cat qubit Hamiltonian parameters and by examining the criterion for the emergence of chaos in Kerr-cat qubits. Additionally, we extend the approach to multi-degree-of-freedom circuits comprising multiple linear modes weakly coupled to a single nonlinear mode. We apply this generalized framework to study the activation of a beam-splitter interaction between two cavities coupled via driven nonlinear elements. Finally, utilizing the flexibility of the proposed approach, we separately derive supercoefficients for the higher-harmonics model of Josephson junctions, circuits with multiple drives, and the expansion of the Hamiltonian in the exact eigenstate basis for Josephson circuits with specific symmetries.</description>

      <title>The Klein-Gordon equation with relativistic mass: a relativistic Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Klein-Gordon equation describes the wave-like behavior of spinless particles since it is Lorentz invariant. While it seemed initially ripe for explaining the electronic structure of the hydrogen atom, the disagreement with experimental results and the lack of a positive probability density really limited its applications. Yet, it is intimately connected with fermions. Any solution of the Dirac equation is automatically a solution of the Klein-Gordon equation. What is even more surprising, the Klein-Gordon equation for a free particle turns into the Schr\"odinger equation in the non-relativistic limit. However, when we replace the rest mass of a particle with its relativistic mass, the Klein-Gordon equation losses its Lorentz invariance and cannot describe spinless particles anymore. Instead, it gains most of the features present the Schr\"odinger equation, including the unconditional positivity of probability density, while keeping most of its relativistic characteristics intact, including the matter-wave dispersion relation. What is even more surprising, the non-relativistic, quasi-static limit of the Klein-Gordon equation with relativistic mass is simply the Schr\"odinger equation. It can be argued that this Klein-Gordon equation is a sort of relativistic Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

Abstract: This document contains a guide on how to use the Qudit Cirq library, an extension of Google's Cirq library for qudits. While Cirq provides necessary building blocks for quantum computation on qudits, the gates, curcuits and simulation of qudit systems need to be developed from scratch. Our extension to the Cirq library has built-in methods for creating qudits, applying common qudit gates, building circuits and simulating quantum computation on these circuits. This is ideal for researchers who want to use an off-the-shelf library to simulate qudit systems.</description>

      <title>Towards A Hybrid Quantum Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07844v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers unparalleled processing power but raises significant data privacy challenges. Quantum Differential Privacy (QDP) leverages inherent quantum noise to safeguard privacy, surpassing traditional DP. This paper develops comprehensive noise profiles, identifies noise types beneficial for QDP, and highlights teh need for practical implementations beyond theoretical models. Existing QDP mechanisms, limited to single noise sources, fail to reflect teh multi-source noise reality of quantum systems. We propose a resilient hybrid QDP mechanism utilizing channel and measurement noise, optimizing privacy budgets to balance privacy and utility. Additionally, we introduce Lifted Quantum Differential Privacy, offering enhanced randomness for improved privacy audits and quantum algorithm evaluation.</description>

      <title>New Quantum Algorithm for Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum principal component analysis (QPCA) ignited a new development toward quantum machine learning algorithms. Initially showcasing as an active way for analyzing a quantum system using the quantum state itself, QPCA also found potential application in analyzing a large-scale dataset, represented by the so-called covariance matrix. Inspired by recent advancement in quantum algorithms, we give an alternatively new quantum framework for performing principal component analysis. By analyzing the performance in detail, we shall identify the regime in which our proposal performs better than the original QPCA. In addition, we also provide a new approach for preparing the covariance matrix, given classical dataset, on a quantum computer. Thus, our work provides an efficient complementary framework for revealing features of the quantum state, while keeping the philosophy of original QPCA, as the state could play an active role in analyzing itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigations show that a time-varying $\delta-\delta'$ mirror gives rise to asymmetrical vacuum radiation on its two sides, enabling one to extract propelling forces from the vacuum fluctuation. In this work, we propose a design of Casimir device to gain propulsions out of vacuum with conventional $\delta$ mirrors. We call this device a ``vacuum propellion'', which is experimentally feasible. It consists of a cavity made up of a perfectly reflective left mirror and a right mirror with time dependent transparency. All particles generated from this propellion are preferentially right-moving, so the cavity obtains a left-pointing propelling force.</description>

      <title>The Clifford hierarchy for one qubit or qudit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Clifford hierarchy is a nested sequence of sets of quantum gates that can be fault-tolerantly performed using gate teleportation within standard quantum error correction schemes. The groups of Pauli and Clifford gates constitute the first and second 'levels', respectively. Non-Clifford gates from the third level or higher, such as the $T$ gate, are necessary for achieving fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. Since it was defined twenty-five years ago by Gottesman-Chuang, two questions have been studied by numerous researchers. First, precisely which gates constitute the Clifford hierarchy? Second, which subset of the hierarchy gates admit efficient gate teleportation protocols?
  We completely solve both questions in the practically-relevant case of the Clifford hierarchy for gates of one qubit or one qudit of prime dimension. We express every such hierarchy gate uniquely as a product of three simple gates, yielding also a formula for the size of every level. These results are a consequence of our finding that all such hierarchy gates can be expressed in a certain form that guarantees efficient gate teleportation. Our decomposition of Clifford gates as a unique product of three elementary Clifford gates is of broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Retrieving Lost Atomic Information: Monte Carlo-based Parameter Reconstruction of an Optical Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In regimes of low signal strengths and therefore a small signal-to-noise ratio, standard data analysis methods often fail to accurately estimate system properties. We present a method based on Monte Carlo simulations to effectively restore robust parameter estimates from large sets of undersampled data. This approach is illustrated through the analysis of photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy data for optical linewidth characterization of a nitrogen-vacancy color center in diamond. We evaluate the quality of parameter prediction using standard statistical data analysis methods, such as the median, and the Monte Carlo method. Depending on the signal strength, we find that the median can be precise (narrow confidence intervals) but very inaccurate. A detailed analysis across a broad range of parameters allows to identify the experimental conditions under which the median provides a reliable predictor of the quantum emitter's linewidth. We also explore machine learning to perform the same task, forming a promising addition to the parameter estimation toolkit. Finally, the developed method offers a broadly applicable tool for accurate parameter prediction from low signal data, opening new experimental regimes previously deemed inaccessible.</description>

      <title>QGHNN: A quantum graph Hamiltonian neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representing and learning from graphs is essential for developing effective machine learning models tailored to non-Euclidean data. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) strive to address the challenges posed by complex, high-dimensional graph data, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) present a compelling alternative due to their potential for quantum parallelism. However, much of the current QNN research tends to overlook the vital connection between quantum state encoding and graph structures, which limits the full exploitation of quantum computational advantages. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a quantum graph Hamiltonian neural network (QGHNN) to enhance graph representation and learning on noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers. Concretely, a quantum graph Hamiltonian learning method (QGHL) is first created by mapping graphs to the Hamiltonian of the topological quantum system. Then, QGHNN based on QGHL is presented, which trains parameters by minimizing the loss function and uses the gradient descent method to learn the graph. Experiments on the PennyLane quantum platform reveal that QGHNN outperforms all assessment metrics, achieving the lowest mean squared error of \textbf{$0.004$} and the maximum cosine similarity of \textbf{$99.8\%$}, which shows that QGHNN not only excels in representing and learning graph information, but it also has high robustness ability. QGHNN can reduce the impact of quantum noise and has significant potential application in future research of quantum knowledge graphs and recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Noise-resistant adaptive Hamiltonian learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitigating and reducing noise influence is crucial for obtaining precise experimental results from noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, an adaptive Hamiltonian learning (AHL) model for data analysis and quantum state simulation is proposed to overcome problems such as low efficiency and the noise influence of quantum machine learning algorithms. First, an adaptive parameterized quantum circuit with noise resistant ability is constructed by decomposing the unitary operators that include penalty Hamiltonian in the topological quantum system. Then, a noise-resistant quantum neural network (RQNN) based on AHL is developed, which improves the noise robustness of the quantum neural network by updating iterative parameters. Finally, the experiments on Paddle Quantum demonstrate that RQNN can simulate the mathematical function and get accurate classification results on NISQ devices. Compared with the quantum neural network, RQNN ensures high accuracy with the same non-linear discrete data classification under the impact of amplitude damping noise, with an accuracy of 98.00 $\%$. It provides new possibilities for solving practical issues on NISQ devices and also benefits in the resolution of increasingly complicated problems, which will expand the range of potential applications for quantum machine learning models in the future.</description>

      <title>Decoding Quantum LDPC Codes using Collaborative Check Node Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fault tolerance of quantum devices requires on-par contributions from error-correcting codes and suitable decoders.
  One of the most explored error-correcting codes is the family of Quantum Low-Density Parity Check (QLDPC) codes.
  Although faster than many of the reported decoders for QLDPC codes, iterative decoders fail due to the colossal degeneracy and short cycles intrinsic to these codes.
  We present a strategy to improve the performance of the iterative decoders based on a collaborative way to use the message passing of the iterative decoders and check node removal from the code's Tanner graph.
  We use the concept of bit separation and generalize it to qubit separation.
  This gives us a metric to analyze and improve the decoder's performance towards harmful configurations of QLDPC codes.
  We present a simple decoding architecture to overcome iterative decoding failures by increasing the separation of trapped qubits without incurring any significant overhead.</description>

      <title>Decoherence time of the ground state spin of $V_{B}$ centers in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground-state spin of optically active defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) offers a promising platform for quantum information applications, such as qubits for quantum computing and nanoscale sensing. A key characteristic of a qubit is its decoherence time, as its duration and controllability are critical for practical applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we investigate the electron spin decoherence time of the negatively charged boron vacancies, $V_{B}$ centers, in the hBN lattice by considering the dipolar hyperfine as well as spin-phonon interactions. We employ an approximate method based on the Holstein-Primakoff transformation to take into account a large number of nuclear spins and Debye model to consider the effect of lattice phonons. We show that, in the presence of the dipolar hyperfine interactions, Hahn-echo coherence time of the $V_{B}$ electron spin is approximately $30\: \mathrm{\mu s}$ at room temperature, close to the previously reported results. Our findings suggest that the major source of decoherence is the noise caused by nuclear spins in the lattice. Our results provide a step forward in understanding the $V_{B}$ defect decoherence in the hBN, which might be used for quantum information applications.</description>

      <title>Is genuine nonlocality in the triangle network exclusive to pure states?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genuine network non-locality (GNN) refers to the existence of quantum correlations in a network with independent sources that cannot be explained by local hidden-variables (LHV) models. Even in the simplest scenario, determining whether these quantum correlations remain genuinely network non-local when derived from entangled states that deviate from their ideal forms is highly challenging due to the non-convex nature of local correlations. Understanding the boundary of these correlations thus becomes a hard problem, but one that raises academic interest specifically its robustness to noise. To address this problem, we introduce a causal domain-informed learning algorithm called the LHV k-rank neural network, which assesses the rank parameter of the non-ideal combined state produced by sources. Applied to the triangle network scenario with the three sources generating a class of quantum states known as X states, the neural network reveals that non-locality persists only if the states remain pure. Remarkably, we find that even slight deviations from ideal Bell states due to noise cause GNN to vanish, exhibiting a discrete behavior that hasn't been witnessed in the standard bell scenario. This finding thus raises a fundamental question as to whether GNN in the triangle network is exclusive to pure states or not. Additionally, we explore the case of the three sources producing dissimilar states, indicating that GNN requires all its sources to send pure entangled states with joint entangled measurements as resources. Apart from these results, this work succeeds in showing that machine learning approaches with domain-specific constraints can greatly benefit the field of quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Interfacing superconducting nanowire single photon detectors with cryogenic opto-electronics for quantum photonic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacing single-photon detectors with active photonic components is a cornerstone photonic quantum technology. We describe how the output signal of commercial superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors can be used in situ to drive photonic components such as lasers and electro-optic modulators, co-located in the cryostat. This is enabled by developing custom circuitry using cryogenic-compatible discrete components in the SiGe-BiCMOS platform. We have demonstrated this with a number of experiments, in particular optical readout of an SNSPD and low-latency feed-forward modulation based on single-photon measurement events, all at or below 4 K. This manuscript is an abridged version of the Master thesis of the primary author N. Lamberty.</description>

      <title>Optical information encryption using general temporal ghost imaging with practical experimental condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08136v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Ghost Imaging (TGI), which reconstructs fast temporal signals using a slow detector, holds significant potential in optical communication, high-speed imaging, and quantum information processing. However, achieving high-quality information reconstruction has been a major challenge for the practical application of TGI. A theoretical model [\emph{ Applied Optics}, 62(5): 1175-1182 (2023)] was proposed to investigate the influence of experimental parameters of the slow detector on image quality; however, its experimental verification was hitherto lacking. In this study, we implemented a multi-bit information transmission scheme based on both quantum and classical TGI methods. Experimental validation confirmed the accuracy of the theoretical model and demonstrated its application in encrypting noisy multi-bit information. The experimental results demonstrate that as the information coding density increases, the decoding accuracy becomes highly sensitive to the detection accuracy and threshold of the slow detector. When these parameters degrade, the decoding quality deteriorates significantly. Additionally, our system shows notable robustness against detection noise, but loses the ability to accurately decode when the noise amplitude becomes too high. Our work endows TGI with optical information encryption capabilities in practical systems and furnishes comprehensive guidelines for the further application of TGI.</description>

      <title>Optimal spatial searches with long-range tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum walk on a lattice is a paradigm of a quantum search in a database. The database qubit strings are the lattice sites, qubit rotations are tunneling events, and the target site is tagged by an energy shift. For quantum walks on a continuous time, the walker diffuses across the lattice and the search ends when it localizes at the target site. The search time $T$ can exhibit Grover's optimal scaling with the lattice size $N$, namely, $T\sim \sqrt{N}$, on an all-connected, complete lattice. For finite-range tunneling between sites, instead, Grover's optimal scaling is warranted when the lattice is a hypercube of $d&gt;4$ dimensions. Here, we show that Grover's optimum can be reached in lower dimensions on lattices of long-range interacting particles, when the interaction strength scales algebraically with the distance $r$ as $1/r^{\alpha}$ and $0&lt;\alpha&lt;3d/2$. For $\alpha&lt;d$ the dynamics mimics the one of a globally connected graph. For $d&lt;\alpha&lt;d+2$, the quantum search on the graph can be mapped to a short-range model on a hypercube with spatial dimension $d_s=2d/(\alpha-d)$, indicating that the search is optimal for $d_s&gt;4$. Our work identifies an exact relation between criticality of long-range and short-range systems, it provides a quantitative demonstration of the resources that long-range interactions provide for quantum technologies, and indicates when existing experimental platforms can implement efficient analog quantum search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Gapless higher-order topology and corner states in Floquet systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order topological phases (HOTPs) possess localized and symmetry-protected eigenmodes at corners and along hinges in two and three dimensional lattices. The numbers of these topological boundary modes will undergo quantized changes at the critical points between different HOTPs. In this work, we reveal unique higher-order topology induced by time-periodic driving at the critical points of topological phase transitions, which has no equilibrium counterparts and also goes beyond the description of gapped topological matter. Using an alternately coupled Creutz ladder and its Floquet-driven descendants as illustrative examples, we analytically characterize and numerically demonstrate the zero and $\pi$ corner modes that could emerge at the critical points between different Floquet HOTPs. Moreover, we propose a unified scheme of bulk-corner correspondence for both gapless and gapped Floquet HOTPs protected by chiral symmetry in two dimensions. Our work reveals the possibility of corner modes surviving topological transitions in Floquet systems and initializes the study of higher-order Floquet topology at quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid Behavior in a Rydberg-encoded Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations can disrupt long-range order in one-dimensional systems, and replace it with the universal paradigm of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), a critical phase of matter characterized by power-law decaying correlations and linearly dispersing excitations. Using a Rydberg quantum simulator, we study how TLL physics manifests in the low-energy properties of a spin chain, interacting under either the ferromagnetic or the antiferromagnetic dipolar XY Hamiltonian. Following quasi-adiabatic preparation, we directly observe the power-law decay of spin-spin correlations in real-space, allowing us to extract the Luttinger parameter. In the presence of an impurity, the chain exhibits tunable Friedel oscillations of the local magnetization. Moreover, by utilizing a quantum quench, we directly probe the propagation of correlations, which exhibit a light-cone structure related to the linear sound mode of the underlying TLL. Our measurements demonstrate the influence of the long-range dipolar interactions, renormalizing the parameters of TLL with respect to the case of nearest-neighbor interactions. Finally, comparison to numerical simulations exposes the high sensitivity of TLLs to doping and finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>Quantum Noise Suppression in Non-Hermitian Resonators at Exceptional Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of quantum noise on non-Hermitian resonators at an exceptional point (EP). The system's irreversible Markovian dynamics is modeled using the Lindblad master equation, which accounts for the incoherent pump, radiative losses, and external monochromatic field. An exact analytic solution is derived in the form of the characteristic function of the Husimi distribution, enabling the calculation of all quantum mechanical observables associated with the bosonic degrees of freedom. Our analysis reveals that quantum noise strongly influences the system's response when the system exhibits $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetry. Out of the $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric regime, however, the system demonstrates stability within a specific parametric domain, where the effects of quantum noise on the signal-to-noise ratio can be mitigated by increasing the external field.</description>

      <title>Realization of a doped quantum antiferromagnet with dipolar tunnelings in a Rydberg tweezer array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doping an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly-correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors. To describe the competition between tunneling $t$ of hole dopants and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin interactions $J$, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic $t$-$J$ model, and the direct analog quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought. Here, we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest neighbour (NNN) tunnelings $t'$ and hard-core bosonic holes using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We utilize coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes, to implement a tunable bosonic $t$-$J$-$V$ model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for $|t/J|\ll 1$, and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnelings $t'$ and perturbative pair tunneling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of $t$. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets. The model we implement extends the toolbox of Rydberg tweezer experiments beyond spin-1/2 models to a larger class of $t$-$J$ and spin-$1$ models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network method for approximating thermal equilibrium states of quantum many-body systems at low temperatures. In contrast to standard (thermofield double matrix product state) algorithms, our ansatz is constructed from the zero-temperature limit, the ground state, which can be simply found with a standard tensor network approach. This method allows us to efficiently compute thermodynamic quantities and entanglement properties. We demonstrate our approach within a tree tensor network ansatz, although it can be extended to other tensor networks, and present results illustrating its effectiveness in capturing the finite-temperature properties in the $1\mathrm{D}$ and $2\mathrm{D}$ scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) in magnetic topological insulators offers great potential to revolutionize quantum electrical metrology by establishing primary resistance standards operating at zero external magnetic field and realizing a universal "quantum electrical metrology toolbox" that can perform quantum resistance, voltage and current metrology in a single instrument. To realize such promise, significant progress is still required to address materials and metrological challenges -- among which, one main challenge is to make the bulk of the topological insulator sufficiently insulating to improve the robustness of resistance quantization. In this Perspective, we present an overview of the QAHE; discuss the aspects of topological material growth and characterization; and present a path towards an QAHE resistance standard realized in magnetically doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ systems. We also present guidelines and methodologies for QAHE resistance metrology, its main limitations and challenges as well as modern strategies to overcome them.</description>

      <title>Thermal Annealing and Radiation Effects on Structural and Electrical Properties of NbN/GaN Superconductor/Semiconductor Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, niobium nitride (NbN) superconductors have emerged as integral components due to their unique structural properties, including a high superconducting transition temperature (Tc), exceptional electrical conductivity, and compatibility with advanced device architectures. This study investigates the impact of high-temperature annealing and high-dose gamma irradiation on the structural and superconducting properties of NbN films grown on GaN via reactive DC magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited cubic {\delta}-NbN (111) films exhibited a high-intensity XRD peak, high Tc of 12.82K, and an atomically flat surface. Annealing at 500 and 950 {\deg}C for varying durations revealed notable structural and surface changes. High-resolution STEM indicated improved local ordering, while AFM showed reduced surface roughness after annealing. XPS revealed a gradual increase in the Nb/N ratio with higher annealing temperatures and durations. High-resolution XRD and STEM analyses showed lattice constant modifications in {\delta}-NbN films, attributed to residual stress changes following annealing. Additionally, XRD phi-scans revealed sixfold symmetry in NbN films due to rotational domains relative to GaN. While Tc remained stable after annealing at 500 {\deg}C, increasing the annealing temperature to 950 {\deg}C degraded Tc to ~8K and reduced the residual resistivity ratio from 0.85 in as-deposited films to 0.29 after 30 minutes. The effects of gamma radiation (5 Mrad (Si)) were also studied, demonstrating minimal changes to crystallinity and superconducting performance, indicating excellent radiation resilience. These findings highlight the potential of NbN superconductors for integration into advanced quantum devices and their suitability for applications in radiation-intensive environments such as space, satellites, and nuclear power plants.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Axion Mediated Dipole-Dipole Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for axions sits at the intersection of solving critical problems in fundamental physics, including the strong CP problem in QCD, uncovering the nature of dark matter, and understanding the origin of the universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry. The measurement of axion-mediated spin-dependent interactions offers a powerful approach for axion detection. However, it has long been restricted to regions outside the 'axion window' due to a significant trade-off: the need to effectively suppress the magnetic leakage from highly polarized spin sources while simultaneously detecting sub-femtotesla level exotic physics signals at sub-decimeter-scale distances. In this work, we report new experimental results on axion-mediated exotic spin-spin interactions using an iron-shielded SmCo$_5$ spin source in combination with a specially designed self-compensation comagnetometer. Employing a composite shielding structure, we achieved a suppression of the magnetic field by up to $10^{11}$. This enabled us to establish new constraints on the coupling between electrons and neutrons, surpassing previous experimental limits by more than 10000 times within the axion window. Furthermore, we also set strongest constraints on the coupling between electrons and protons. The proposed method holds substantial potential not only for advancing the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model but also for enabling transformative applications in biological and chemical research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of exactly solvable flat-band quasiperiodic lattice models that encompass a variety of multifractal-enriched mobility edges and multi-state coexisting quantum phases. Utilizing Avila's global theory, we derive exact expressions of the Lyapunov exponents in both lattice and dual spaces, providing an analytical expression and phase diagram for the multifractal-enriched mobility edges. Additionally, we numerically compute the inverse participation ratios of the eigenstates in both real and dual spaces to further characterize these phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models can be realized using Rydberg atomic arrays, enabling the observation of Lyapunov exponents and inverse participation ratios through a powerful spectroscopy approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a non-quadratic generalization of the quantum mechanical optimal transport problem introduced in [De Palma and Trevisan, Ann. Henri Poincar\'e, {\bf 22} (2021), 3199-3234] where quantum channels realize the transport. Relying on this general machinery, we introduce $p$-Wasserstein distances and divergences and study their fundamental geometric properties. Finally, we prove triangle inequality for quadratic Wasserstein divergences under the sole assumption that an arbitrary one of the states involved is pure, which is a generalization of our previous result in this direction.</description>

      <title>Double Microwave Shielding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop double microwave shielding, which has recently enabled evaporative cooling to the first Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Two microwave fields of different frequency and polarization are employed to effectively shield polar molecules from inelastic collisions and three-body recombination. Here, we describe in detail the theory of double microwave shielding. We demonstrate that double microwave shielding effectively suppresses two- and three-body losses. Simultaneously, dipolar interactions and the scattering length can be flexibly tuned, enabling comprehensive control over interactions in ultracold gases of polar molecules. We show that this approach works for a wide range of molecules. This opens the door to studying many-body physics with strongly interacting dipolar quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Experimentally Probing Non-Hermitian Spectral Transition and Eigenstate Skewness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems exhibit intricate spectral topology arising from complex-valued eigenenergies, with positive/negative imaginary parts representing gain/loss. Unlike the orthogonal eigenstates of Hermitian systems, NH systems feature left and right eigenstates that form a biorthogonal basis and can differ significantly, showcasing pronounced skewness between them. These characteristics give rise to unique properties absent in Hermitian systems, such as the NH skin effect and ultra spectral sensitivity. However, conventional experimental techniques are inadequate for directly measuring the complex-valued spectra and left and right eigenstates -- key elements for enhancing our knowledge of NH physics. This challenge is particularly acute in higher-dimensional NH systems, where the spectra and eigenstates are highly sensitive to macroscopic shapes, lattice geometry, and boundary conditions, posing greater experimental demands compared to one-dimensional systems. Here, we present a Green's function-based method that enables the direct measurement and characterization of both complex-valued energy spectra and the left and right eigenstates in arbitrary NH lattices. Using active acoustic crystals as the experimental platform, we observe spectral transitions and eigenstate skewness in two-dimensional NH lattices under both nonreciprocal and reciprocal conditions, with varied geometries and boundary conditions. Our approach renders complex spectral topology and left eigenstates experimentally accessible and practically meaningful, providing new insights into these quantities. The results not only confirm recent theoretical predictions of higher-dimensional NH systems but also establish a universal and versatile framework for investigating complex spectral properties and NH dynamics across a wide range of physical platforms.</description>

      <title>A modular quantum gas platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the development of a modular platform for programmable quantum simulation with atomic quantum gases. The platform is centered around exchangeable optical modules with versatile functionalities. The performance of each module is disentangled from all others, enabling individual validation and maintenance of its outputs. The relative spatial positioning of the modules with respect to the position of the atomic sample is set by a global reference frame. In this way, the platform simplifies re-configuration and upgrading of existing setups and accelerates the design of new machines in a time- and cost-efficient manner. Furthermore, it facilitates collaboration among different experimental groups. This standardized hardware design framework, which we call Heidelberg Quantum Architecture, paves the way towards a new generation of on-demand and highly adaptable quantum simulation experiments.</description>

      <title>Frequency Fluctuations in Nanomechanical Resonators due to Quantum Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators promise diverse applications ranging from mass spectrometry to quantum information processing, requiring long phonon lifetimes and frequency stability. Although two-level system (TLS) defects govern dissipation at millikelvin temperatures, the nature of frequency fluctuations remains poorly understood. In nanoscale devices, where acoustic fields are confined to sub-wavelength volumes, strong coupling to individual TLS should dominate over weak coupling to defect ensembles. In this work, we monitor fast frequency fluctuations of phononic crystal nanomechanical resonators, while varying temperature ($10$ mK$-1$ K), drive power ($10^2-10^5$ phonons), and the phononic band structure. We consistently observe random telegraph signals (RTS) which we attribute to state transitions of individual TLS. The frequency noise is well-explained by mechanical coupling to individual far off-resonant TLS, which are either thermally excited or strongly coupled to thermal fluctuators. Understanding this fundamental decoherence process, particularly its RTS structure, opens a clear path towards noise suppression for quantum and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Surface and Bulk Two-Level System Losses in Lithium Niobate Acoustic Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LN) is a promising material for building acoustic resonators used in quantum applications, but its performance is limited by poorly understood material defects called two-level systems (TLS). In this work, we fabricate high-performance acoustic resonators from LN with quality factors up to $6\times10^7$ and use them to separate bulk and surface contributions to TLS loss. By comparing these bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators with previous surface acoustic wave and phononic crystal studies, we show that devices with high surface participation ratios are limited by surface TLS, while our BAW devices reveal an intrinsic bulk TLS limit. Through systematic surface treatments and microscopy, we demonstrate that BAW resonator performance remains unchanged despite surface modifications, confirming operation in a bulk-limited regime. Our work establishes quantitative bounds on both surface and bulk TLS losses in LN, within the context of material growth and fabrication approaches we have pursued, and provides guidance for future device engineering and materials development.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortices leave a macroscopic signature in the normal fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has highlighted the remarkable properties of quantum turbulence in superfluid helium II, consisting of a disordered tangle of quantised vortex lines which interact with each other and reconnect when they collide. According to Landau's two-fluid theory, these vortex lines move in a surrounding of thermal excitations called the normal fluid. Until now, the normal fluid has often been considered a passive background which simply provides the vortex lines with a mechanism for dissipating their kinetic energy into heat. Using a model which fully takes into account the two-way interaction between the vortex lines and the normal fluid, here we show that each vortex line creates a macroscopic wake in the normal fluid that can be larger than the average distance between vortex lines; this is surprising, given the microscopic size of the superfluid vortex cores which induce these wakes. We show that in heat transfer experiments, the flow of the normal fluid can therefore be described as the superposition of an imposed uniform flow and wakes generated by the vortex lines, leading to non-classical statistics of the normal fluid velocity. We also argue that this first evidence of independent fluid structures in the thermal excitations postulated by Landau may be at the root of recent, unaccounted for, experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Shadow Pauli Flow: Characterising Determinism in MBQCs involving Pauli Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09368v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new characterisation of determinism in Measurement-Based Quantum Computing (MBQC). The one-way model consists in performing local measurements over a large entangled state represented by a graph. The ability to perform an overall deterministic computation requires a correction strategy because of the non-determinism of each measurement. The existence of such a correction strategy depends on the underlying open graph, which is a description of the resource state together with the basis of the performed measurements. GFlow is a well-known graphical characterisation of robust determinism in MBQC when every measurement is performed in some specific planes of the Bloch sphere. While Pauli measurements are ubiquitous in MBQC, GFlow fails to be necessary for determinism when a measurement-based quantum computation involves Pauli measurements. Pauli Flow was designed as a generalisation of GFlow to handle MBQC with Pauli measurements, and guarantees robust determinism, however, it has been shown more recently that it fails to be a necessary condition. Our contribution is twofold. First, we demonstrate that Pauli flow is actually necessary for robust determinism in a weaker sense: given an open graph, i.e. a resource state, a deterministic computation can be driven iff it has a Pauli flow. However, the Pauli flows do not reflect all the possible correction strategies over a particular resource state, and properties like measurement order or computational depth are not necessarily reflected by a Pauli flow. Thus, to characterise determinism in full generality, we introduce a further extension called Shadow Pauli Flow that we prove necessary and sufficient for robust determinism: An MBQC is robustly deterministic if and only if its correction strategy is consistent with a Shadow Pauli flow. Furthermore, we show that Shadow Pauli flow can be computed in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Decoding general error correcting codes and the role of complementarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06661v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among various classes of quantum error correcting codes (QECCs), non-stabilizer codes have rich properties and are of theoretical and practical interest. Decoding non-stabilizer codes is, however, a highly non-trivial task. In this paper, we show that a decoding circuit for Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes can be straightforwardly extended to handle general QECCs. The key to the extension lies in the use of a pair of classical-quantum (CQ) codes associated with the QECC to be decoded. The decoding error of the proposed decoding circuit depends on the classical decoding errors of the CQ codes and their degree of complementarity. We demonstrate the power of the decoding circuit in a toy model of the black hole information paradox, improving decoding errors compared to previous results. In addition, we reveal that black hole dynamics may optimally encode quantum information but poorly encode classical information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a fast implementation of the minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder, the most widely used decoder for several important families of quantum error correcting codes, including surface codes. Our algorithm, which we call sparse blossom, is a variant of the blossom algorithm which directly solves the decoding problem relevant to quantum error correction. Sparse blossom avoids the need for all-to-all Dijkstra searches, common amongst MWPM decoder implementations. For 0.1% circuit-level depolarising noise, sparse blossom processes syndrome data in both $X$ and $Z$ bases of distance-17 surface code circuits in less than one microsecond per round of syndrome extraction on a single core, which matches the rate at which syndrome data is generated by superconducting quantum computers. Our implementation is open-source, and has been released in version 2 of the PyMatching library.</description>

Abstract: In the last two decades, there has been much effort in finding secure protocols for two-party cryptographic tasks. It has since been discovered that even with quantum mechanics, many such protocols are limited in their security promises. In this work, we use stochastic selection, an idea from stochastic programming, to circumvent such limitations. For example, we find a way to switch between bit commitment, weak coin flipping, and oblivious transfer protocols to improve their security. We also use stochastic selection to turn trash into treasure yielding the first quantum protocol for Rabin oblivious transfer.</description>

Abstract: This paper discusses the question of Stable Facts in Relational Quantum Mechanics. I examine how the approach to quantum logic in the consistent histories formalism can be used to clarify what information about a system can be shared between different observers.I suggest that the mathematical framework for Consistent Histories can and should be incorporated into RQM, whilst being clear on the interpretational differences between the two approaches. Finally I briefly discuss two related issues: the similarities and differences between special relativity and RQM and the recent Cross- Perspectival Links modification to RQM.</description>

      <title>Extracting Error Thresholds through the Framework of Approximate Quantum Error Correction Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The robustness of quantum memory against physical noises is measured by two methods: the exact and approximate quantum error correction (QEC) conditions for error recoverability, and the decoder-dependent error threshold which assesses if the logical error rate diminishes with system size. Here we unravel their relations and propose a unified framework to extract an intrinsic error threshold from the approximate QEC condition, which could upper bound other decoder-dependent error thresholds. Our proof establishes that relative entropy, effectively measuring deviations from exact QEC conditions, serves as the order parameter delineating the transition from asymptotic recoverability to unrecoverability. Consequently, we establish a unified framework for determining the error threshold across both exact and approximate QEC codes, addressing errors originating from noise channels as well as those from code space imperfections. This result sharpens our comprehension of error thresholds across diverse QEC codes and error models.</description>

      <title>Sub-2 Kelvin characterization of nitrogen-vacancy centers in silicon carbide nanopillars</title>

Abstract: The development of efficient quantum communication technologies depends on the innovation in multiple layers of its implementation, a challenge we address from the fundamental properties of the physical system at the nano-scale to the instrumentation level at the macro-scale. We select a promising near infrared quantum emitter, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in 4H-SiC, and integrate it, at an ensemble level, with nanopillar structures that enhance photon collection efficiency into an objective lens. Moreover, changes in collection efficiency in pillars compared to bulk can serve as indicators of color center orientation in the lattice. To characterize NV center properties at the unprecedented sub-2 Kelvin temperatures, we incorporate compatible superconducting nanowire single photon detectors inside the chamber of an optical cryostat and create the ICECAP, the Integrated Cryogenic system for Emission, Collection And Photon-detection. ICECAP measurements show no significant linewidth broadening of NV ensemble emission and up to 14-fold enhancement in collected emission. With additional filtering, we measure emitter lifetimes of NV centers in a basal ($hk$) and an axial ($kk$) orientation unveiling their cryogenic values of 2.2 ns and 2.8 ns.</description>

Abstract: The Rydberg blockade mechanism is an important ingredient in quantum simulators based on neutral atom arrays. It enables the emergence of a rich variety of quantum phases of matter, such as topological spin liquids. The typically isotropic nature of the blockade effect, however, restricts the range of natively accessible models and quantum states. In this work, we propose a method to systematically overcome this limitation, by developing gadgets, i.e., specific arrangements of atoms, that transform the underlying Rydberg blockade into more general constraints. We apply this technique to realize dimer models on square and triangular geometries. In these setups, we study the role of the quantum fluctuations induced by a coherent drive of the atoms and find signatures of $U(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid states in the respective ground states. Finally, we show that these states can be dynamically prepared with high fidelity, paving the way for the quantum simulation of a broader class of constrained models and topological matter in experiments with Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for copula-based risk aggregation using orthogonal series density estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo integration (QMCI) provides a quadratic speed-up over its classical counterpart, and its applications have been investigated in various fields, including finance. This paper considers its application to risk aggregation, one of the most important numerical tasks in financial risk management. Risk aggregation combines several risk variables and quantifies the total amount of risk, taking into account the correlation among them. For this task, there exists a useful tool called copula, with which the joint distribution can be generated from marginal distributions with a flexible correlation structure. Classically, the copula-based method utilizes sampling of risk variables. However, this procedure is not directly applicable to the quantum setting, where sampled values are not stored as classical data, and thus no efficient quantum algorithm is known. In this paper, we introduce a quantum algorithm for copula-based risk aggregation that is compatible with QMCI. In our algorithm, we first estimate each marginal distribution as a series of orthogonal functions, where the coefficients can be calculated with QMCI. Then, by plugging the marginal distributions into the copula and obtaining the joint distribution, we estimate risk measures using QMCI again. With this algorithm, nearly quadratic quantum speed-up can be obtained for sufficiently smooth marginal distributions.</description>

      <title>Classifying two-body Hamiltonians for Quantum Darwinism</title>

Abstract: Quantum Darwinism is a paradigm to understand how classically objective reality emerges from within a fundamentally quantum universe. Despite the growing attention that this field of research as been enjoying, it is currently not known what specific properties a given Hamiltonian describing a generic quantum system must have to allow the emergence of classicality. Therefore, in the present work, we consider a broadly applicable generic model of an arbitrary finite-dimensional system interacting with an environment formed from an arbitrary collection of finite-dimensional degrees of freedom via an unspecified, potentially time-dependent Hamiltonian containing at most two-body interaction terms. We show that such models support quantum Darwinism if the set of operators acting on the system which enter the Hamiltonian satisfy a set of commutation relations with a pointer observable and with one other. We demonstrate our results by analyzing a wide range of example systems: a qutrit interacting with a qubit environment, a qubit-qubit model with interactions alternating in time, and a series of collision models including a minimal model of a quantum Maxwell demon.</description>

      <title>Logical Error Rates for a [[4,2,2]]-Encoded Variational Quantum Eigensolver Ansatz</title>

Abstract: Quantum computing offers a potential for algorithmic speedups for applications, such as large-scale simulations in chemistry and physics. However, these speedups must yield results that are sufficiently accurate to predict realistic outcomes of experiments precisely. Delivering on the promise of high accuracy and precision requires methods to evaluate the computational accuracy of the quantum computing devices. We develop a framework to estimate the computational accuracy of near-term noisy, intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computing devices using a quantum chemistry application. Application benchmarks that run on NISQ devices require techniques for mitigating errors to improve accuracy and precision. We use device agnostic error-mitigation schemes, quantum error detection and readout error detection, with post-selection to mitigate the dominant sources of noise. We evaluate the framework by simulating the ground state of molecular hydrogen with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, estimating the energy and calculating the precision of the estimate using numerical simulations with realistic noise models. We first quantify the improvement in the logical error rate and state fidelity of the VQE application when encoded with the [[4,2,2]] quantum error detection code. When additionally encoded with readout error detection, we show that compared to the unencoded simulation, the encoded simulation yields a more accurate estimate by more than 1 mHa (0.027 eV) with comparable precision and higher state fidelity. Additionally, unlike the best estimate from the unencoded simulations, the results from the encoded simulation fall within the chemical accuracy threshold of 1.6 mHa of the exact energy. The estimated accuracy and precision indicate that current quantum computers can achieve error rates that yield useful outcomes for chemical applications.</description>

      <title>Schr\"odinger cat states of a nuclear spin qudit in silicon</title>

Abstract: High-dimensional quantum systems are a valuable resource for quantum information processing. They can be used to encode error-correctable logical qubits, which has been demonstrated using continuous-variable states in microwave cavities or the motional modes of trapped ions. For example, high-dimensional systems can be used to realise `Schr\"{o}dinger cat' states, superpositions of widely displaced coherent states that can also be used to illustrate quantum effects at large scales. Recent proposals have suggested encoding qubits in high-spin atomic nuclei, finite-dimensional systems that can host hardware-efficient versions of continuous-variable codes. Here we demonstrate the creation and manipulation of Schrodinger cat states using the spin-7/2 nucleus of an antimony atom embedded in a silicon nanoelectronic device. We use a multi-frequency control scheme to produce spin rotations that preserve the symmetry of the qudit, and constitute logical Pauli operations for qubits encoded in the Schrodinger cat states. Our work demonstrates the ability to prepare and control nonclassical resource states, a prerequisite for applications in quantum information processing and quantum error correction using our scalable, manufacturable semiconductor platform.</description>

Abstract: In extreme environments such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron-star mergers, and the early Universe, neutrinos are dense enough that their self-interactions significantly affect, if not dominate, their flavor dynamics. In order to develop techniques for characterizing the resulting quantum entanglement, I present the results of simulations of Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions that include all three physical neutrino flavors and were performed on D-Wave Inc.'s {\tt Advantage} 5000+ qubit quantum annealer. These results are checked against those from exact classical simulations, which are also used to compare the Dirac neutrino-neutrino interactions to neutrino-antineutrino and Majorana neutrino-neutrino interactions. The D-Wave {\tt Advantage} annealer is shown to be able to reproduce time evolution with the precision of a classical machine for small numbers of neutrinos and to do so without Trotter errors. However, it suffers from poor scaling in qubit-count with the number of neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the design and experimental characterization of a kinetic-inductance traveling-wave parametric amplifier (KI-TWPA) for sub-GHz frequencies. KI-TWPAs amplify signals through nonlinear mixing processes supported by the nonlinear kinetic inductance of a superconducting transmission line. The device described here utilizes a compactly meandered TiN microstrip transmission line to achieve the length needed to amplify sub-GHz signals. It is operated in a frequency translating mode where the amplified signal tone is terminated at the output of the amplifier, and the idler tone at approximately 2.5~GHz is brought out of the cryostat. By varying the pump frequency, a gain of up to 22 dB was achieved in a tunable range from about 450 to 850~MHz. Use of TiN as the nonlinear element allows for a reduction of the required pump power by roughly an order of magnitude relative to NbTiN, which has been used for previous KI-TWPA implementations. This amplifier has the potential to enable high-sensitivity and high-speed measurements in a wide range of applications, such as quantum computing, astrophysics, and dark matter detection.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional entanglement witnessed by correlations in arbitrary bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certifying entanglement is an important step in the development of many quantum technologies, especially for higher-dimensional systems, where entanglement promises increased capabilities for quantum communication and computation. A key feature distinguishing entanglement from classical correlations is the occurrence of correlations for complementary measurement bases. In particular, mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are a paradigmatic example that is well-understood and routinely employed for entanglement certification. However, implementing unbiased measurements exactly is challenging and not generically possible for all physical platforms. Here, we extend the entanglement-certification toolbox from correlations in MUBs to arbitrary bases. This practically significant simplification paves the way for efficient characterizations of high-dimensional entanglement in a wide range of physical systems. Furthermore, we introduce a simple three-MUBs construction for all dimensions without using the Wootters-Fields construction, potentially simplifying experimental requirements when measurements in more than two MUBs are needed, especially in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Role of Quantum Coherence in Kinetic Uncertainty Relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kinetic Uncertainty Relation (KUR) bounds the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic currents in terms of the number of transitions per unit time, known as the dynamical activity. This bound was derived in a classical context, and can be violated in the quantum regime due to coherent effects. However, the precise connection between KUR violations and quantum coherence has so far remained elusive, despite significant investigation. In this work, we solve this problem by deriving a modified bound that exactly pinpoints how, and when, coherence might lead to KUR violations. Our bound is sensitive to the specific kind of unraveling of the quantum master equation. It therefore allows one to compare quantum jumps and quantum diffusion, and understand, in each case, how quantum coherence affects fluctuations. We illustrate our result on a double quantum dot, where the electron current is monitored either by electron jump detection or with continuous diffusive charge measurement.</description>

We assume knowledge of basic quantum mechanics -- the Schr\"{o}dinger evolution of states in Hilbert space, the Born probability rule, the Dirac formalism, and so on -- while explicating such ideas as projectors, density operators, Bell inequalities, entanglement and the Lindblad equation. In other words this work is a \emph{primer} in the simplest sense of that word: without taking a stand on the major questions, it is intended to make an enormous and growing body of research more accessible.</description>

      <title>Optimal trace-distance bounds for free-fermionic states: Testing and improved tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-fermionic states, also known as fermionic Gaussian states, represent an important class of quantum states ubiquitous in physics. They are uniquely and efficiently described by their correlation matrix. However, in practical experiments, the correlation matrix can only be estimated with finite accuracy. This raises the question: how does the error in estimating the correlation matrix affect the trace-distance error of the state? We show that if the correlation matrix is known with an error $\varepsilon$, the trace-distance error also scales as $\varepsilon$ (and vice versa). Specifically, we provide distance bounds between (both pure and mixed) free-fermionic states in relation to their correlation matrix distance. Our analysis also extends to cases where one state may not be free-fermionic. Importantly, we leverage our preceding results to derive significant advancements in property testing and tomography of free-fermionic states. Property testing involves determining whether an unknown state is close to or far from being a free-fermionic state. We first demonstrate that any algorithm capable of testing arbitrary (possibly mixed) free-fermionic states would inevitably be inefficient. Then, we present an efficient algorithm for testing low-rank free-fermionic states. For free-fermionic state tomography, we provide improved bounds on sample complexity in the pure-state scenario, substantially improving over previous literature, and we generalize the efficient algorithm to mixed states, discussing its noise-robustness.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning for Digital Health? A Systematic Review</title>

Abstract: With the digitization of health data, the growth of electronic health and medical records lowers barriers for using algorithmic techniques for data analysis. While classical machine learning techniques for health data approach commercialization, there is not yet clear evidence whether quantum machine learning (QML) will provide any empirical advantage for digital health data processing. In this systematic literature review we assess whether QML algorithms have the potential to outperform existing classical methods in efficacy or efficiency. We include digital electronic health/medical records (EH/MRs) and data considered to be a reasonable proxy to EH/MRs. Eligible QML algorithms must be designed for quantum computing hardware, as opposed to quantum-inspired techniques. PubMed, Embase, IEEE, Scopus and arXiv yielded 4915 studies between 2015 to 10 June 2024. After screening 169 eligible studies, most studies contained widespread technical misconceptions about QML and we excluded 123 studies for insufficient rigor in analysis. Of the remaining 46 studies, only 16 studies consider realistic QML operating conditions, either by testing algorithms on quantum hardware, or using noisy quantum circuits when assessing QML algorithms. We find QML applications in digital health focus primarily on clinical decision support rather than health service delivery or public health. Nearly all QML models are linear quantum models, and therefore represent a subset of general quantum algorithms. Meanwhile, novel data-encoding strategies do not address scalability issues, except in regimes requiring restrictive assumptions about quantum hardware, rendering these protocols inefficient for the general encoding of large health datasets. By establishing the current state of evidence for QML-based health applications, we pave the way for meaningful dialogue about QML use-case discovery in digital health.</description>

Abstract: Recently we introduced a local photon approach for modelling the quantised electromagnetic field in position space. Using this approach, we define the momentum of light in this paper as in quantum mechanics as the generator for spatial translation. Afterwards, we analyse the momentum dynamics of photonic wave packets which transition from air into a denser dielectric medium. Our analysis shines new light onto the Abraham-Minkowski controversy which highlights the intricacies involved in the characterisation of the momentum of the electromagnetic field. Although our results align with Minkowski's theory and with the definition of the canonical momentum of light in quantum electrodynamics, there are also some crucial differences.</description>

      <title>Beyond the semiclassical approximation in atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a quantum perturbative approach to evaluating the phase shift of an atom interferometer in a weakly anharmonic trap. This provides a simple way to evaluate quantum corrections to the standard semi-classical approximation. The calculation benefits from the use of generalized coherent states for a basis. We find that the form of the semi-classical approximation remains valid to first order in the anharmonic perturbation, but that phase differences arise because the trajectory of a quantum wave packet will generally deviate from that of a classical particle. The quantum correction to the phase is a factor $\ell^2/A^2$ smaller than the semi-classical perturbation itself, where $\ell$ is the quantum harmonic oscillator length scale and $A$ is the classical amplitude of the motion. We provide analytical results for one-dimensional perturbations of power three through six in the position coordinate.</description>

Abstract: Open quantum systems are ubiquitous in nature and central to quantum technologies. A common description of their dynamics is given by the celebrated Lindblad master equation, which can be generalized to the non-Markovian scenario. In this work, we introduce the Non-Markovian Ensemble Propagation (NMEP) method, which extends the Monte Carlo Wave-Function (MCWF) method to the non-Markovian case in a simple and general manner. We demonstrate its accuracy and effectiveness in a selection of examples, and compare the results with either analytic expressions or direct numerical integration of the master equation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Compilation Toolkit for Rydberg Atom Arrays with Implications for Problem Hardness and Quantum Speedups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Scheme to Detect the Strong-to-weak Symmetry Breaking via Randomized Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking plays a central role in classifying the phases of quantum many-body systems. Recent developments have highlighted a novel symmetry-breaking pattern, in which the strong symmetry of a density matrix spontaneously breaks to the week symmetry. This strong-to-weak symmetry breaking is typically detected using multi-replica correlation functions, such as the R\'enyi-2 correlator. In this letter, we propose a practical protocol for detecting strong-to-weak symmetry breaking in experiments using the randomized measurement toolbox. Our scheme involves collecting the results of random Pauli measurements for (i) the original quantum state and (ii) the quantum state after evolution with the charged operators. Based on the measurement results, with a large number of samples, we can obtain the exact solution to the R\'enyi-2 correlator. With a small sample size, we can still provide an alternative approach to estimate the phase boundary to a decent accuracy. We perform numerical simulations of Ising chains with all-to-all decoherence as an exemplary demonstration. Our result opens the opportunity for the experimental studies of the novel quantum phases in mixed quantum states.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimizing the Expected Performance of Sampling-Based Quantum-Inspired Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-inspired classical algorithms has received much attention due to its exponential speedup compared to existing algorithms, under certain data storage assumptions. The improvements are noticeable in fundamental linear algebra tasks. In this work, we analyze two major subroutines in sampling-based quantum-inspired algorithms, specifically, inner product estimation and sampling from a linear combination of vectors, and discuss their possible improvements by generalizing the data structure. The idea is to consider the average behavior of the subroutines under certain assumptions regarding the data elements. This allows us to determine the optimal data structure, and the high-dimensional nature of data makes our assumptions reasonable. Experimental results from recommendation systems also highlight a consistent preference for our proposed data structure. Motivated by this observation, we tighten the upper bound on the number of required measurements for direct fidelity estimation. We expect our findings to suggest optimal implementations for various quantum and quantum-inspired machine learning algorithms that involve extremely high-dimensional operations, which has potential for many applications.</description>

Abstract: We formalize a rigorous connection between barren plateaus (BP) in variational quantum algorithms and exponential concentration of quantum kernels for machine learning. Our results imply that recently proposed strategies to build BP-free quantum circuits can be utilized to construct useful quantum kernels for machine learning. This is illustrated by a numerical example employing a provably BP-free quantum neural network to construct kernel matrices for classification datasets of increasing dimensionality without exponential concentration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parametrically driven oscillator has two stable vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. The states have opposite phase and equal amplitudes. An extra drive at half the modulation frequency provides an effective bias that lifts the state symmetry. Quantum fluctuations lead to switching between the states, i.e., to phase-flip transitions. We develop a semiclassical approach that allows us to find the dependence of the switching rates on the amplitude of the bias and the parameters of the modulating field. We find that the rate of switching from a ''shallow'' state can become anomalously small at certain parameter values, leading to an efficient localization in this state. This is a consequence of the change of the topology of the oscillator phase trajectories. The results pave the way for implementing nonreciprocal quantum Ising systems based on parametric oscillators.</description>

      <title>Dispersive nodal fermions along grain boundaries in Floquet topological crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven quantum materials often feature emergent topology, otherwise absent in static crystals. Dynamic bulk-boundary correspondence, encoded by nondissipative gapless modes residing near the Floquet zone center and/or boundaries, is its most prominent example. Here we show that topologically robust gapless dispersive modes appear along the grain boundaries, embedded in the interior of Floquet topological crystals, when the Floquet-Bloch band inversion occurring at a finite momentum (${\bf K}^{\rm Flq}_{\rm inv}$) and the Burgers vector (${\bf b}$) of the constituting array of dislocations satisfy ${\bf K}^{\rm Flq}_{\rm inv} \cdot {\bf b}=\pi$ (modulo $2 \pi$). Such nondissipative gapless states can be found near the center and/or edges of the Floquet Brillouin zone, irrespective of the drive protocol. We showcase these general outcomes for two-dimensional driven time-reversal symmetry breaking insulators. Promising experimental platforms hosting such dynamic topological dispersive bands in real materials are discussed.</description>

      <title>Charting the space of ground states with tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ matrix product states (MPS) and tensor networks to study topological properties of the space of ground states of gapped many-body systems. We focus on families of states in one spatial dimension, where each state can be represented as an injective MPS of finite bond dimension. Such states are short-range entangled ground states of gapped local Hamiltonians. To such parametrized families over $X$ we associate a gerbe, which generalizes the line bundle of ground states in zero-dimensional families (\emph{i.e.} in few-body quantum mechanics). The nontriviality of the gerbe is measured by a class in $H^3(X, \mathbb{Z})$, which is believed to classify one-dimensional parametrized systems. We show that when the gerbe is nontrivial, there is an obstruction to representing the family of ground states with an MPS tensor that is continuous everywhere on $X$. We illustrate our construction with two examples of nontrivial parametrized systems over $X=S^3$ and $X = \mathbb{R} P^2 \times S^1$. Finally, we sketch using tensor network methods how the construction extends to higher dimensional parametrized systems, with an example of a two-dimensional parametrized system that gives rise to a nontrivial 2-gerbe over $X = S^4$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study neutrino flavor evolution in the quantum many-body approach using the full neutrino-neutrino Hamiltonian, including the usually neglected terms that mediate non-forward scattering processes. Working in the occupation number representation with plane waves as single-particle states, we explore the time evolution of simple initial states with up to $N=10$ neutrinos. We discuss the time evolution of the Loschmidt echo, one body flavor and kinetic observables, and the one-body entanglement entropy. For the small systems considered, we observe `thermalization' of both flavor and momentum degrees of freedom on comparable time scales, with results converging towards expectation values computed within a microcanonical ensemble. We also observe that the inclusion of non-forward processes generates a faster flavor evolution compared to the one induced by the truncated (forward) Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel scheme for modelling quantum plasmas in the warm dense matter (WDM) regime via a hybrid smoothed particle hydrodynamic - molecular dynamic treatment, here referred to as 'Bohm SPH'. This treatment is founded upon Bohm's interpretation of quantum mechanics for partially degenerate fluids, does not apply the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and is computationally tractable, capable of modelling dynamics over ionic timescales at electronic time resolution. Bohm SPH is also capable of modelling non-Gaussian electron wavefunctions. We present an overview of our methodology, validation tests of the single particle case including the hydrogen 1s wavefunction, and comparisons to simulations of a warm dense hydrogen system performed with wave packet molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Transition due to particle losses in a monitored fermionic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in the dynamics of monitored quantum systems using linear jump operators related to the creation or annihilation of particles. Here, we study the dynamics of the entanglement entropy under quantum jumps that induce local particle losses in a model of free fermions with hopping and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ pairing. We solve the non-unitary dynamics using the recently developed Faber Polynomial method and explore the different steady-state entanglement regimes by tuning the pairing strength, thus interpolating between monitored free fermions coherently driven by a particle number conserving Hamiltonian to a parity conserving one. In the absence of pairing, all quantum trajectories approach the vacuum at long times, with the entanglement entropy showing non-monotonic behavior over time that we capture with a phenomenological quasiparticle \emph{ansatz}. In this regime, quantum jumps play a key role, and we highlight this by exactly computing their waiting-time distribution. On the other hand, the interplay between losses and pairing gives rise to quantum trajectories with entangled steady-states. We show that by tuning the system parameters, a measurement-induced entanglement transition occurs where the entanglement entropy scaling changes from logarithmic to area-law. We compare this transition with the one derived in the no-click limit and observe qualitative agreement in most of the phase diagram. Furthermore, the statistics of entanglement gain and loss are analyzed to better understand the impact of the linear jump operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Embedding techniques allow the efficient description of correlations within localized fragments of large molecular systems, while accounting for their environment at a lower level of theory. We introduce FragPT2: a novel embedding framework that addresses multiple interacting active fragments. Fragments are assigned separate active spaces, constructed by localizing canonical molecular orbitals. Each fragment is then solved with a multi-reference method, self-consistently embedded in the mean field from other fragments. Finally, inter-fragment correlations are reintroduced through multi-reference perturbation theory. Our framework provides an exhaustive classification of inter-fragment interaction terms, offering a tool to analyze the relative importance of various processes such as dispersion, charge transfer, and spin exchange. We benchmark FragPT2 on challenging test systems, including \ce{N_2} dimers, multiple aromatic dimers, and butadiene. We demonstrate that our method can be succesful even for fragments defined by cutting through a covalent bond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the concept of phase time, which has been previously proposed as a solution to the problem of time in quantum gravity. Concretely, we show how the geometry of configuration space together with the phase of the wave function of the universe can, under certain conditions, lead to the definition of a positive-definite squared norm from which probabilities can be defined. The norm is conserved under time evolution, and we obtain a version of Ehrenfest's theorem that is analogous to the one in ordinary quantum mechanics. We address how the present approach avoids some difficulties that were encountered in previous attempts at defining an Ehrenfest theorem relative to phase time in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics and canonical quantum gravity, and how it is connected to a notion of gauge fixing the inner product. We conclude with a brief outlook.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a way to detect gravitons by replicating the Brownian motion experiment. The number $N_g$ of gravitons can be large enough for the stochastic gravitational noise produced by them to displace a massive test particle in a physical system, allowing for the detection of gravitons. Possible experiments to detect gravitons are proposed involving collective stochastic fluctuations due to a large number of gravitons, causing a Brownian motion displacement of a massive test body. Gravitational wave experiments involving advanced interferometer techniques and mirrors could detect the large collective number of gravitons, and could detect Brownian motion of test particles in the detectors' component mirrors. The problem of reducing thermal and other background noise is investigated.</description>

Abstract: We show that the conventional Jarzynski equality does not hold for a system prepared in a microcanonical ensemble. We derive a modified equality that connects microcanonical work fluctuations to entropy production, in an analogous way to the Jarzynski equality, but with reference to an inverse temperature that depends on the path of the work protocol. For close to isothermal processes the modified equality can improve on the bound $\langle W\rangle\ge \Delta F$. Our result is a special case of a general expression for the microcanonical moment-generating function for any extensive quantity, which enables calculation of the breakdown of ensemble equivalence for thermodynamic fluctuations. We demonstrate our microcanonical Jarzynski equality in a system of driven two-level spins.</description>

      <title>Stochastic thermodynamics and the Ericsson nano engine -- Efficiency from equilibrium results</title>

Abstract: In this work, we study an Ericsson cycle whose working substance is a charged (quantum) oscillator in a magnetic field that is coupled to a heat bath. The resulting quantum Langevin equations with built-in noise terms encapsulate a thermodynamic structure and allow for the computation of the efficiency of the cycle. We numerically compute the efficiency of the cycle in the quasi-static regime using the steady-state thermodynamic functions of the system. Interestingly, it is found that by increasing the system-bath coupling strength, the efficiency of the cycle can be tuned to a maximum. We also explore the behavior of the efficiency as a function of the pair of magnetic-field values between which the cycle is operated.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Quantum-Classical Systems in Nonequilibrium Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a classical environment and subject to constraints that drive it out of equilibrium is described. The evolution of the system is governed by the quantum-classical Liouville equation. Rather than evaluating the evolution of the mixed quantum-classical density operator, we derive exact equations of motion for the nonequilibrium average values of a set of operators or variables, along with correlation function expressions for the dissipative coefficients that enter these equations. These equations are obtained by requiring that the exact nonequilibrium averages are equal to local nonequilibrium averages that depend on auxiliary fields whose values satisfy evolution equations obtained using projection operator methods. The results are illustrated by deriving reaction-diffusion equations coupled to fluid hydrodynamic equations for a dilute solution of quantum particles that can exist in two metastable states. Nonequilibrium steady states are discussed along with the reaction rate and diffusion correlation functions that characterize such states.</description>
