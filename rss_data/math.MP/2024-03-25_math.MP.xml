      <title>The classification of general affine connections in Newton--Cartan geometry: Towards metric-affine Newton--Cartan gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a full classification of general affine connections on Galilei manifolds in terms of independently specifiable tensor fields. This generalises the well-known case of (torsional) Galilei connections, i.e. connections compatible with the metric structure of the Galilei manifold. Similarly to the well-known pseudo-Riemannian case, the additional freedom for connections that are not metric-compatible lies in the covariant derivatives of the two tensors defining the metric structure (the clock form and the space metric), which however are not fully independent of each other.</description>

      <title>Metric-affine cosmological models and the inverse problem of the calculus of variations. Part 1: variational bootstrapping -- the method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of variational completion allows one to transform an (in principle, arbitrary) system of partial differential equations -- based on an intuitive ``educated guess'' -- into the Euler-Lagrange one attached to a Lagrangian, by adding a canonical correction term. Here, we extend this technique to theories that involve at least two sets of dynamical variables : we show that an educated guess of the field equations with respect to one of these sets of variables only is sufficient to variationally complete these equations and recover a Lagrangian for the full theory, up to terms that do not involve the respective variables.
  Applying this idea to natural metric-affine theories of gravity, we prove that, starting from an educated guess of the metric equations only, one can find the full metric equations, together with a generally covariant Lagrangian for the theory, up to metric-independent terms; the latter terms (which can only involve the distortion of the connection) are then completely classified over 4-dimensional spacetimes, by techniques pertaining to differential invariants.</description>

      <title>Efficient semiclassical approximation for bound states in graphene in magnetic field with a small trigonal warping correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the construction of efficient (simple to implement) explicit semiclassical asymptotic eigenfunctions of the Dirac operator for high-energy bound states in graphene in magnetic field. When considering excited states in graphene, a distortion called trigonal warping begins to play an~important role, see [7], [12]. We are dealing with a~trigonal warping correction, considering it to be small. While the standard semiclassical methods allow one to solve the eigenequations for operators if and only if quantization conditions are met, we, based on article [1], develop approaches that can be used in case these conditions are violated. The complete symbol turns out to be only close to integrable, which brings its own difficulties. The present paper relies heavily on the results from [3].</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Limit of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we rewrite the time-dependent Bogoliubov$\unicode{x2013}$de Gennes equation in an appropriate semiclassical form and establish its semiclassical limit to a two-particle kinetic transport equation with an effective mean-field background potential satisfying the one-particle Vlasov equation. Moreover, for some semiclassical regimes, we obtain a higher-order correction to the two-particle kinetic transport equation, capturing a nontrivial two-body interaction effect. The convergence is proven for $C^2$ interaction potentials in terms of a semiclassical optimal transport pseudo-metric. Furthermore, combining our current results with the results of Marcantoni et al. [arXiv:2310.15280], we establish a joint semiclassical and mean-field approximation of the dynamics of a system of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Fermions by the Vlasov equation in some negative order Sobolev topology.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent autocorrelation of a disordered Kuramoto model in the asynchronous state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model has provided deep insights into synchronization phenomena and remains an important paradigm to study the dynamics of coupled oscillators. Yet, despite its success, the asynchronous regime in the Kuramoto model has received limited attention. Here, we adapt and enhance the mean-field approach originally proposed by Stiller and Radons [Phys. Rev. E 58 (1998)] to study the asynchronous state in the Kuramoto model with a finite number of oscillators and with disordered connectivity. By employing an iterative stochastic mean field (IMF) approximation, the complex N-oscillator system can effectively be reduced to a one-dimensional dynamics, both for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. This method allows us to investigate the power spectra of individual oscillators as well as of the multiplicative "network noise" in the Kuramoto model in the asynchronous regime. By taking into account the finite system size and disorder in the connectivity, our findings become relevant for the dynamics of coupled oscillators that appear in the context of biological or technical systems.</description>

      <title>Compositional statistical mechanics, entropy and variational inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this document, we aim to gather various results related to a compositional/categorical approach to rigorous Statistical Mechanics. Rigorous Statistical Mechanics is centered on the mathematical study of statistical systems. Central concepts in this field have a natural expression in terms of diagrams in a category that couples measurable maps and Markov kernels. We showed that statistical systems are particular representations of partially ordered sets (posets), that we call A-specifications, and expressed their phases, i.e., Gibbs measures, as invariants of these representations. It opens the way to the use of homological algebra to compute phases of statistical systems. Two central results of rigorous Statistical Mechanics are, firstly, the characterization of extreme Gibbs measures as it relates to the zero-one law for extreme Gibbs measures, and, secondly, their variational principle which states that for translation invariant Hamiltonians, Gibbs measures are the minima of the Gibbs free energy. We showed how the characterization of extreme Gibbs measures extends to A-specifications; we proposed an Entropy functional for A-specifications and gave a message-passing algorithm, that generalized the belief propagation algorithm of graphical models, to find critical points of the associated variational free energy.</description>

      <title>Properties of some dynamical systems for three collapsing inelastic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we continue the study of the collapse of three inelastic particles in dimension $d \geq 2$, complementing the results we obtained in its companion paper. We focus on the particular case of the nearly-linear inelastic collapse, when the order of collisions becomes eventually the infinite repetition of the period $0-1$, $0-2$, under the assumption that the relative velocities of the particles (with respect to the central particle $0$) do not vanish at the time of collapse. Taking as starting point the full dynamical system that describes two consecutive collisions of the nearly-linear collapse, we derive formally a two-dimensional dynamical system, called the two-collision mapping. This mapping governs the evolution of the variables of the full dynamical system. We show in particular that in the so-called Zhou-Kadanoff regime, the orbits of the two-collision mapping can be described in full detail. We study rigorously the two-collision mapping, proving that the Zhou-Kadanoff regime is stable and locally attracting in a certain region of the phase space of the two-collision mapping. We describe all the fixed points of the two-collision mapping in the case when the norms of the relative velocities tend to the same positive limit. We establish conjectures to characterize the orbits that verify the Zhou-Kadanoff regime, motivated by numerical simulations, and we prove these conjectures for a simplified version of the two-collision mapping.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We upgrade the results of Borot--Bouchard--Chidambaram--Creutzig to show that the Gaiotto vector in $\mathcal{N} = 2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory admits an analytic continuation with respect to the energy scale (which can therefore be taken to be finite, instead of infinitesimal), and is computed by topological recursion on the (ramified) UV or Gaiotto spectral curve. This has a number of interesting consequences for the Gaiotto vector: relations to intersection theory on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ in two different ways, Hurwitz numbers and quantum curves. The same method is used to establish analogous results for the more general Whittaker vector constructed in the recent work of Chidambaram--Dolega--Osuga.</description>

      <title>A Linear Time-Delay Scheme to Propagate Reduced Electron Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any linear system where the unreduced dynamics are governed by unitary propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand the memory-dependence of reduced $1$-electron density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the reduced $1$-electron density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. In numerical tests on two model systems (H$_2$ and HeH$^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To derive our method, we calculate the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our calculation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This calculation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix is constant and equals the number of electrons.</description>

      <title>An Anisotropic Constitutive Relationship by a Series of 8 Chain Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperelastic models have been widely used to model polymers and soft tissues. However, most hyperelastic models are phenomenological material models. Based on statistical mechanics and molecular chain configuration, 8 chain model or Arruda-Boyce model is a physical model which can be used to understand how microstructures of chains affect macroscopic mechanical properties of polymers and soft tissues. Mechanical properties of many polymers and soft tissues are directional dependent. Polymer matrix can be reinforced by fibers. For soft tissues, ligaments and tendons will lead to anisotropic properties. Since matrix and reinforcements are composed of similar microstructural molecular chains, they can be modeled by using the same mathematical model. In this paper, a series of 8 chain models is used to understand composite properties. That is, an isotropic 8 chain model will be used to model matrix and anisotropic 8 chain models will be used to model fibers. Replacing I_1 in isotropic 8 chain model with I_4 in anisotropic 8 chain model is physically corresponding to changing representative 8 chain cubic cell to 8 chain slender cell. This treatment not only simplifies exist anisotropic mathematical structures but also keeps microscopic physics of 8 chain model unchanged.</description>

      <title>Existence for turbulent flows through permeable media with unbounded turbulent-depending coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mathematical model that governs turbulent flows through permeable media is considered in this work. The model under consideration is based on a double-averaging concept which in turn is described by the time-averaging technique characteristic of the turbulence k-epsilon model and by the volume-averaging methodology that is used to model unstable flows through porous media. The functions of turbulence viscosity, turbulence diffusion and turbulence production are assumed to be unbounded with respect to the turbulent kinetic energy. For the associated initial-and boundary-value problem, we prove the existence of suitable weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Positive mass and isoperimetry for continuous metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the positive mass theorem and the existence of isoperimetric sets on $3$-manifolds endowed with continuous complete metrics having nonnegative scalar curvature in a suitable weak sense.
  We prove that if the manifold has an end that is $C^0$-locally asymptotically flat, and the metric is the local uniform limit of smooth metrics with vanishing lower bounds on the scalar curvature outside a compact set, then Huisken's isoperimetric mass is nonnegative. This addresses a version of a recent conjecture of Huisken about positive isoperimetric mass theorems for continuous metrics satisfying $R_g\geq 0$ in a weak sense. As a consequence, any fill-in of a truncation of a Schwarzschild space with negative ADM mass has nonnegative isoperimetric mass.
  Moreover, in case the whole manifold is $C^0$-locally asymptotically flat and the metric is the local uniform limit of smooth metrics with vanishing lower bounds on the scalar curvature outside a compact set, we prove that, as a large scale effect, isoperimetric sets with arbitrarily large volume exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric momentum is the proper momentum for a moving particle constrained on a curved surface, which depends on the outer curvature and has observable effects. In the context of multi-component quantum states, geometric momentum should be rewritten as generally covariant geometric momentum. For a Dirac fermion constrained on a two-dimensional hypersurface, we give the generally covariant geometric momentum, and show that on the pseudosphere and the helical surface there exist no curvature-induced geometric potentials. These results verify that the dynamical quantization conditions are effective in dealing with constrained systems on hypersurfaces, and one could obtain the generally convariant geometric momentum and the geometric potential of a spin particle constrained on surfaces with definite parametric equations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kramers-Wanier Duality from Bilinear Phase Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Bilinear Phase Map (BPM), a concept that extends the Kramers-Wannier (KW) transformation to investigate unconventional gapped phases, their dualities, and phase transitions. Defined by a matrix of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ elements, the BPM not only encapsulates the essence of KW duality but also enables exploration of a broader spectrum of generalized quantum phases and dualities. By analyzing the BPM's linear algebraic properties, we elucidate the loss of unitarity in duality transformations and derive general non-invertible fusion rules. Applying this framework to (1+1)D systems yields the discovery of new dualities, shedding light on the interplay between various Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) phases. Additionally, we construct a duality web that interconnects these phases and their transitions, offering valuable insights into relations between different quantum phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A local time decay estimate of fractional Schr\"odinger operators with slowly decaying positive potentials are studied. It is shown that its resolvent is smooth near zero and the time propagator has fast local time decay which is very different from very short-range cases. The key element of the proof is to establish a weaker Agmon estimate for a classically forbidden region using exotic symbol calculus. As a byproduct, we prove that the Riesz operator is a pseudodifferential operator with an exotic symbol.</description>

      <title>Covariant Lagrangian Cubic Interaction Vertices For Irreducible Higher Spin Fields in Minkowski Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the application of BRST and BRST-BV approaches to construct the generic off-shell local Lorentz covariant cubic interaction vertices for irreducible massless and massive higher integer spin fields (as the candidates for massive particles in the Dark Matter problem) on $d$-dimensional Minkowski spaces. It is shown that equivalence among two Lagrangian dynamics for the same cubically interacting fields with given masses and spins obtained by means of the approach with complete BRST, $Q$, operator and of one with incomplete BRST, $Q_c$, operator in presence of consistent off-shell holonomic (traceless) constraints can be uplifted from the equivalence of the Lagrangians for free higher spin fields. We found that to get non-contradictory Lagrangians for irreducible interacting higher-spin fields within approach with $Q_c$ operator, together with off-shell algebraic constraints in addition to necessary condition of superconmmuting of $Q_c$ with appropriate holonomic constraints on the field and gauge parameter vectors, these constraints should form Abelian superalgebra both with BRST operator above and with operators of cubic vertices.</description>

      <title>Accumulated spectrograms for hyperuniform determinantal point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the accumulated spectrogram associated to a locally trace class orthogonal projection operator and to a bounded set using the polar decomposition of its restriction on that set and prove a convergence theorem for accumulated spectrograms along an exhaustion in the case when the corresponding determinantal point process is hyperuniform. We prove that a radial determinantal point process on Rd is always hyperuniform along the exhaustion formed by the dilations of a bounded open set, and as a consequence, we obtain that dilations of the corresponding accumulated spectrogram converge to the indicator function of the considered set, establishing thus a universal phenomenon. Our result is a generalisation of a theorem by Abreu-Gr\"ochenig-Romero in [1] concerning time-frequency localization operators.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the confluent hypergeometric process with a varying external potential in the super-exponential region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a determinantal point process on the interval $(-s,s)$, associated with the confluent hypergeometric kernel. Let $\mathcal{K}^{(\alpha,\beta)}_s$ denote the trace class integral operator acting on $L^2(-s, s)$ with the confluent hypergeometric kernel. Our focus is on deriving the asymptotics of the Fredholm determinant $\det(I-\gamma \mathcal{K}^{(\alpha,\beta)}_s)$ as $s \to +\infty$, while simultaneously $\gamma \to 1^-$ in a super-exponential region. In this regime of double scaling limit, our asymptotic result also gives us asymptotics of the eigenvalues $\lambda^{(\alpha, \beta)}_k(s)$ of the integral operator $\mathcal{K}^{(\alpha,\beta)}_s$ as $s \to +\infty$. Based on the integrable structure of the confluent hypergeometric kernel, we derive our asymptotic results by applying the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method to analyze the related Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that many tame modules of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ algebra can be explicitly constructed in a purely combinatorial way using the theory of $q$-characters. The examples include families of evaluation modules obtained from analytic continuation and automorphism twists of Verma modules of the quantum affine $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ algebra. The combinatorial bases in the modules are labeled by colored plane partitions with various properties.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lagrangian multiforms for quad equations, tetrahedron equations, and octahedron equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present three novel types of discrete Lagrangian 2-form for the integrable quad equations of the ABS list. Two of our new Lagrangian 2-forms have the quad equations, or a system equivalent to the quad equations, as their Euler-Lagrange equations, whereas the third produces the tetrahedron equations. This is in contrast to the well-established Lagrangian 2-form for these equations, which produces equations that are weaker than the quad equations (they are equivalent to two octahedron equations). We use relations between the Lagrangian 2-forms to prove that the system of quad equations is equivalent to the combined system of tetrahedron and octahedron equations. Furthermore, for each of the Lagrangian 2-forms, existing and new, we study the double zero property of the exterior derivative. In particular, this gives a possible variational interpretation to the octahedron equations.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Gibbs States are Unentangled and Efficiently Preparable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that thermal states of local Hamiltonians are separable above a constant temperature. Specifically, for a local Hamiltonian $H$ on a graph with degree $\mathfrak{d}$, its Gibbs state at inverse temperature $\beta$, denoted by $\rho =e^{-\beta H}/ \textrm{tr}(e^{-\beta H})$, is a classical distribution over product states for all $\beta &lt; 1/(c\mathfrak{d})$, where $c$ is a constant. This sudden death of thermal entanglement upends conventional wisdom about the presence of short-range quantum correlations in Gibbs states.
  Moreover, we show that we can efficiently sample from the distribution over product states. In particular, for any $\beta &lt; 1/( c \mathfrak{d}^3)$, we can prepare a state $\epsilon$-close to $\rho$ in trace distance with a depth-one quantum circuit and $\textrm{poly}(n) \log(1/\epsilon)$ classical overhead. A priori the task of preparing a Gibbs state is a natural candidate for achieving super-polynomial quantum speedups, but our results rule out this possibility above a fixed constant temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the global well-posedness of the stochastic Abelian-Higgs equations in two dimensions. The proof is based on a new covariant approach, which consists of two parts: First, we introduce covariant stochastic objects. The covariant stochastic objects and their multi-linear interactions are controlled using covariant heat kernel estimates. Second, we control nonlinear remainders using a covariant monotonicity formula, which is inspired by earlier work of Hamilton.</description>

      <title>High-order transient multidimensional simulation of a thermo-electro-chemo-mechanical model for Lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build a transient multidimensional multiphysical model based on continuum theories, involving the coupled mechanical, thermal and electrochemical phenomena occurring simultaneously in the discharge or charge of lithium-ion batteries. The process delivers a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. Besides initial and boundary conditions, we highlight the treatment of the electrode-electrolyte interface condition, which corresponds to a Butler-Volmer reaction kinetics equation. We present the derivation of the strong and weak forms of the model, as well as the discretization procedure in space and in time. The discretized model is computationally solved in two dimensions by means of a finite element method that employs $hp$ layered meshes, along with staggered second order semi-implicit time integration. The expected error estimate is of higher order than any other similar work, both in space and in time. A representative battery cell geometry, under distinct operating scenarios, is simulated. The numerical results show that the full model allows for important additional insights to be drawn than when caring only for the electrochemical coupling. Considering the multiphysics becomes more important as the applied current is increased, whether for discharge or for charge. Our full model provides battery design professionals with a valuable tool to optimize designs and advance the energy storage industry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.04339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the topological recursion formalism can be used to quantize any generic classical spectral curve with smooth ramification points and simply ramified away from poles. For this purpose, we build both the associated quantum curve, i.e.~the differential operator quantizing the algebraic equation defining the classical spectral curve considered, and a basis of wave functions, that is to say a basis of solutions of the corresponding differential equation. We further build a Lax pair representing the resulting quantum curve and thus present it as a point in an associated space of meromorphic connections on the Riemann sphere, a first step towards isomonodromic deformations. We finally propose two examples: the derivation of a 2-parameter family of formal trans-series solutions to Painlev\'e 2 equation and the quantization of a degree three spectral curve with pole only at infinity.</description>

      <title>Landscape approximation of the ground state eigenvalue for graphs and random hopping models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the localization landscape function $u$ and ground state eigenvalue $\lambda$ for operators on graphs. We first show that the maximum of the landscape function is comparable to the reciprocal of the ground state eigenvalue if the operator satisfies certain semigroup kernel upper bounds. This implies general upper and lower bounds on the landscape product $\lambda\|u\|_\infty$ for several models, including the Anderson model and random hopping (bond-disordered) models, on graphs that are roughly isometric to $\mathbb{Z}^d$, as well as on some fractal-like graphs such as the Sierpinski gasket graph. Next, we specialize to a random hopping model on $\mathbb{Z}$, and show that as the size of the chain grows, the landscape product $\lambda\|u\|_\infty$ approaches $\pi^2/8$ for Bernoulli off-diagonal disorder, and has the same upper bound of $\pi^2/8$ for Uniform([0,1]) off-diagonal disorder. We also numerically study the random hopping model when the band width (hopping distance) is greater than one, and provide strong numerical evidence that a similar approximation holds for low-lying energies in the spectrum.</description>

Abstract: We review the applications of twisted spectral triples to the Standard Model. The initial motivation was to generate a scalar field, required to stabilise the electroweak vacuum and fit the Higgs mass, while respecting the first-order condition. Ultimately, it turns out that the truest interest of the twist lies in a new -- and unexpected -- field of 1-forms, which is related to the transition from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be either a general hypersurface of degree $n+1$ in $\mathbb P^n$ or a general $(2,n)$ complete intersection in $\mathbb P^{n+1}, n\geq 4$. We construct balanced rational curves on $X$ of all high enough degrees. If $n=3$ or $g=1$, we construct rigid curves of genus $g$ on $X$ of all high enough degrees. As an application we construct some rigid bundles on Calabi-Yau threefolds. In addition, we construct some low-degree balanced rational curves on hypersurfaces of degree $n + 2$ in $\mathbb P^n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1977, Thouless, Anderson, and Palmer (TAP) derived a system of consistent equations in terms of the effective magnetization in order to study the free energy in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model. The solutions to their equations were predicted to contain vital information about the landscapes in the SK Hamiltonian and the TAP free energy and moreover have direct connections to Parisi's replica ansatz. In this work, we aim to investigate the validity of the TAP equations in the generic mixed $p$-spin model. By utilizing the ultrametricity of the overlaps, we show that the TAP equations are asymptotically satisfied by the conditional local magnetizations on the asymptotic pure states.</description>

Abstract: Given a compact subset $\Sigma \subset \mathbb{R}$ (or $\mathbb{C}$) with logarithmic capacity greater than zero, we construct an explicit family of probability measures supported on $\Sigma$ such that their closure is all the possible weak limit measures of complete sets of conjugate algebraic integers lying inside $\Sigma$. We give an asymptotic formula for the number of algebraic integers with given degree and prescribed distribution. We exploit the algorithmic nature of our approach to give a family of upper bounds that converges to the smallest limiting trace-to-degree ratio of totally positive algebraic integers and improve the best previously known upper bound on the Schur-Siegel-Smyth trace problem to 1.8216.</description>

Abstract: In a seminal paper, Bacry and L\'evy-Leblond classified kinematical algebras, a class of Lie algebras encoding the symmetries of spacetime. Homogeneous spacetimes (infinitesimally, Klein pairs) associated to these possible kinematics can be partitioned into four families -- riemannian, lorentzian, galilean and carrollian -- based on the type of invariant metric structure they admit. In this work, we classify possible ambient kinematics -- defined as extensions of kinematical algebras by a scalar ideal -- as well as their associated Klein pairs. Kinematical Klein pairs arising as quotient space along the extra scalar ideal are said to admit a lift into the corresponding ambient Klein pair. While all non-galilean Klein pairs admit a unique -- trivial and torsion-free -- higher-dimensional lift, galilean Klein pairs are constructively shown to admit lifts into two distinct families of ambient Klein pairs. The first family includes the bargmann algebra as well as its curved/torsional avatars while the second family is novel and generically allows lifts into torsional ambient spaces. We further comment on the relation between these two families and the maximally symmetric family of leibnizian Klein pairs.</description>

      <title>Derivation of all structure constants for boundary Liouville CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the probabilistic definition of the most general boundary three-point and bulk-boundary structure constants in Liouville conformal field theory (LCFT) agree respectively with the formula proposed by Ponsot-Techsner (2002) and by Hosomichi (2001). These formulas also respectively describe the fusion kernel and modular kernel of the Virasoro conformal blocks, which are important functions in various contexts of mathematical physics. As an intermediate step, we obtain the formula for the boundary reflection coefficient of LCFT proposed by Fateev-Zamolodchikov-Zamolodchikov (2000). Our proof relies on the boundary Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov differential equation recently proved by the first named author, and inputs from the coupling theory of Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) and Schramm Loewner evolution. Our results supply all the structure constants needed to perform the conformal bootstrap for boundary LCFT. They also yield exact descriptions for the joint law of the area and boundary lengths of basic LQG surfaces, including quantum triangles and two-pointed quantum disks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the pairs $(f,G)$ with $f = f(x_1,\dots,x_N)$ being a polynomial defining a quasihomogeneous singularity and $G$ being a subgroup of ${\rm SL}(N,\mathbb{C})$, preserving $f$. In particular, $G$ is not necessary abelian. Assume further that $G$ contains the grading operator $j_f$ and $f$ satisfies the Calabi-Yau condition. We prove that the nonvanishing bigraded pieces of the B-model state space of $(f,G)$ form a diamond. We identify its topmost, bottommost, leftmost and rightmost entries as one-dimensional and show that this diamond enjoys the essential horizontal and vertical isomorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that any mathematical solution for null electromagnetic field knots in flat spacetime is also a null field knotted solution for cosmological electromagnetic fields. This is obtained by replacing the time $t\rightarrow \tau=\int dt/a$, where $a=a(t)$ is the scale factor of the Universe described by the Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology, and by adequately rewriting the (empty flat spacetimes) electromagnetic fields solutions in a medium defined by the FLRW metric. We found that the dispersion (evolution) of electromagnetic Hopfions is faster on cosmological scenarios.
  We discuss the implications of these results for different cosmological models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to perform Heisenberg-limited metrology on GHZ-like states, in the presence of generic spatially local, possibly strong interactions during the measurement process. An explicit protocol, which relies on single-qubit measurements and feedback based on polynomial-time classical computation, achieves the Heisenberg limit. In one dimension, matrix product state methods can be used to perform this classical calculation, while in higher dimensions the cluster expansion underlies the efficient calculations. The latter approach is based on an efficient classical sampling algorithm for short-time quantum dynamics, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Twisted traces on abelian quantum Higgs and Coulomb branches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study twisted traces on the quantum Higgs branches $A_{\operatorname{Higgs}}$ of $3d, \mathcal{N}=4$ gauge theories, that is, the quantum Hamiltonian reductions of Weyl algebras. In theories which are good, we define a twisted trace that arises naturally from the correlation functions of the gauge theory. We show that this trace induces an inner product and a short star product on $A_{\operatorname{Higgs}}$.
  We analyze this trace in the case of an abelian gauge group and show that it has a natural expansion in terms of the twisted traces of Verma modules, confirming a conjecture of the first author and Okazaki. This expansion has a natural interpretation in terms of 3-d mirror symmetry, and we predict that it can be interpreted as an Atiyah-Bott fixed-point formula under the quantum Hikita isomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation is crucial in a wide range of applications, but it often faces challenges such as high computational costs due to data dimensionality and incomplete understanding of underlying mechanisms. To address these challenges, this study presents a novel assimilation framework, termed Latent Assimilation with Implicit Neural Representations (LAINR). By introducing Spherical Implicit Neural Representations (SINR) along with a data-driven uncertainty estimator of the trained neural networks, LAINR enhances efficiency in assimilation process. Experimental results indicate that LAINR holds certain advantage over existing methods based on AutoEncoders, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Basso-Dixon Formula and Calabi-Yau Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the family of Calabi-Yau varieties attached to four-point fishnet integrals in two dimensions. We find that the Picard-Fuchs operators for fishnet integrals are exterior powers of the Picard-Fuchs operators for ladder integrals. This implies that the periods of the Calabi-Yau varieties for fishnet integrals can be written as determinants of periods for ladder integrals. The representation theory of the geometric monodromy group plays an important role in this context. We then show how the determinant form of the periods immediately leads to the well-known Basso-Dixon formula for four-point fishnet integrals in two dimensions. Notably, the relation to Calabi-Yau geometry implies that the volume is also expressible via a determinant formula of Basso-Dixon type. Finally, we show how the fishnet integrals can be written in terms of iterated integrals naturally attached to the Calabi-Yau varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a model consisting of differential equations coupling the time evolution of a finite number of relativistic electrons with the Newtonian dynamics of finitely many nuclei, where the former is described by the Bogoliubov-Dirac-Fock (BDF) equation of quantum electrodynamics (QED). The Cauchy problem for this model is addressed, proving a global well-posedness result. We believe that this system can be seen as a first step in the study of molecular dynamics phenomena, when both relativistic and quantum effects have to be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Graded pseudo-traces for strongly interlocked modules for a vertex operator algebra and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the notion of strongly interlocked for indecomposable generalized modules for a vertex operator algebra, and show that the notion of graded pseudo-trace is well defined for modules which satisfy this property. We prove that the graded pseudo-trace is a symmetric linear operator that satisfies the logarithmic derivative property. As an application, we prove that all the indecomposable reducible generalized modules for the rank one Heisenberg (one free boson) vertex operator algebras are strongly interlocked, independent of the choice of conformal vector and thus have well-defined graded pseudo-traces. We also completely characterize which indecomposable reducible generalized modules for the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebras induced from the level zero Zhu algebra are strongly interlocked. In particular, we prove that the universal Virasoro vertex operator algebra with central charge c has modules induced from the level zero Zhu algebra with conformal weight h that are strongly interlocked if and only if either (c,h) is outside the extended Kac table, or the central charge is either c = 1 or 25, the conformal weight satisfies a certain property, and the level zero Zhu algebra module being induced is determined by a Jordan block of size less than a certain specified parameter. We give several examples of graded pseudo-traces for Heisenberg and Virasoro strongly interlocked modules.</description>

      <title>Expansion of hypergeometric functions in terms of polylogarithms with nontrivial variable change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergeometric functions of one and many variables play an important role in various branches of modern physics and mathematics. Often we have hypergeometric functions with indices linear dependent on a small parameter with respect to which one needs to perform Laurent expansions. Moreover such expansions are desirable to be expressed in terms of well known functions which can be evaluated with arbitrary precision. To solve this problem we use the differential equation method and the reduction of corresponding differential systems to canonical basis. Specifically we will be interested in the generalized hypergeometric functions of one variable together with Appell and Lauricella functions and their expansions in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms. Particular attention will be given to the case of rational indices of considered hypergeometric functions when the reduction to canonical basis involves nontrivial variable change. The article comes with a Mathematica package Diogenes, which provides algorithmic implementation of the required steps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces an advanced Koopman mode decomposition (KMD) technique -- coined Featurized Koopman Mode Decomposition (FKMD) -- that uses time embedding and Mahalanobis scaling to enhance analysis and prediction of high dimensional dynamical systems. The time embedding expands the observation space to better capture underlying manifold structure, while the Mahalanobis scaling, applied to kernel or random Fourier features, adjusts observations based on the system's dynamics. This aids in featurizing KMD in cases where good features are not a priori known. We find that the Mahalanobis scaling from FKMD can be used for effective dimensionality reduction of alanine dipeptide data. We also show that FKMD improves predictions for a high-dimensional Lorenz attractor and a cell signaling problem from cancer research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $Q$ be an arbitrary finite quiver. We use nonabelian stable envelopes to relate representations of the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ to representations of the BPS Lie algebra associated to the tripled quiver $\tilde Q$ with its canonical potential. We use this comparison to provide an isomorphism between the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra and the BPS Lie algebra. Via this isomorphism we prove Okounkov's conjecture, equating the graded dimensions of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ with the coefficients of Kac polynomials. Via general results regarding cohomological Hall algebras in dimensions two and three we furthermore give a complete description of $\mathfrak{g}^{MO}_Q$ as a generalised Kac-Moody Lie algebra with Cartan datum given by intersection cohomology of singular Nakajima quiver varieties, and prove a conjecture of Maulik and Okounkov, stating that their Lie algebra is obtained from a Lie algebra defined over the rationals, by extension of scalars.</description>

      <title>The geodesic dispersion phenomenon in random fields dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random fields are ubiquitous mathematical structures in physics, with applications ranging from thermodynamics and statistical physics to quantum field theory and cosmology. Recent works on information geometry of Gaussian random fields proposed mathematical expressions for the components of the metric tensor of the underlying parametric space, allowing the computation of the curvature in each point of the manifold. In this study, our hypothesis is that time irreversibility in Gaussian random fields dynamics is a direct consequence of geometric properties (curvature) of their parametric space. In order to validate this hypothesis, we compute the components of the metric tensor and derive the twenty seven Christoffel symbols of the metric to define the Euler-Lagrange equations, a system of partial differential equations that are used to build geodesic curves in Riemannian manifolds. After that, by the application of the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation, we numerically build geodesic curves starting from an arbitrary initial point in the manifold. The obtained results show that, when the system undergoes phase transitions, the geodesic curve obtained by time reversing the computational simulation diverges from the original curve, showing a strange effect that we called the geodesic dispersion phenomenon, which suggests that time irreversibility in random fields is related to the intrinsic geometry of their parametric space.</description>

Abstract: Interacting particle systems studied in this paper are probabilistic cellular automata with nearest-neighbor interaction including the Domany-Kinzel model. A special case of the Domany-Kinzel model is directed percolation. We regard the interacting particle system as a Markov chain on a graph. Then we present a new quantization of the interacting particle system. After that, we introduce a zeta function of the quantized model and give its determinant expression. Moreover, we calculate the absolute zeta function of the quantized model for the Domany-Kinzel model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We undertake a detailed study of the gaugings of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by its intrinsic charge conjugation 0-form and centre 1-form global symmetries, elucidating their higher algebraic and geometric structures, as well as the meaning of dual lower form symmetries. Our derivations of orbifold gauge theories make use of a combination of standard continuum path integral methods, networks of topological defects, and techniques from higher gauge theory. We provide a unified description of higher and lower form gauge fields for a $p$-form symmetry in the geometric setting of $p$-gerbes, and derive reverse orbifolds by the dual $(-1)$-form symmetries. We identify those orbifolds in which charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken, and relate the breaking to mixed anomalies involving $(-1)$-form symmetries. We extend these considerations to gaugings by the non-invertible 1-form symmetries of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory by introducing a notion of generalized $\theta$-angle.</description>

Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms, incorporating a total of seven parameters. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky ('94) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev ('10) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama ('23) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima ('23) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

      <title>3d Modularity Revisited</title>

Abstract: The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of the three-dimensional theory with ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019, surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular forms, and vertex algebras, have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive array of examples have been studied, but several general important structural questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds it was observed that the different $\hat Z$-invariants for the same three-manifolds are quantum modular forms that span a subspace of a Weil representation for the modular group $SL_2(Z)$, corresponding to the structure of vector-valued quantum modular forms. We elucidate the meaning of this vector-valued quantum modular form structure by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued quantum modular form is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat Z$-invariants, with and without defects, of a given three-manifold. Second, it was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold, suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for an infinite family of three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third, we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator algebras associated to these invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.</description>
