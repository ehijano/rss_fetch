      <title>Curvature tensors and hyperbolic solitons on Lorentzian trans-Sasakian space form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorantzian trans-Sasakian space form is a special type of space form in which the nature of even and odd dimensional space form both exist. Various curvature tensors with respect to Levi-Civita connection on the space form are derived in this paper. We have shown that if an odd-dimensional Lorentzian trans-Sasakian space form admits a hyperbolic Ricci soliton and hyperbolic conformal Ricci soliton then they will be ${\eta}$-Einstein. We also obtained the conditions for the solitons to be expanding, steady or shrinking. Finally, an example has been constructed which justifies the results obtained.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study compact locally conformally K\"ahler (lcK) manifolds which are Calabi-Yau, in the sense that $c_1^{BC}(X)=0$. We prove that an lcK Gauduchon metric that is Chern-Ricci flat is necessarily Vaisman. Specializing to Calabi--Yau solvmanifolds with left-invariant complex structure, we prove that a left-invariant metric is lcK if and only if it is Vaisman. Therefore, they are finite quotients of the Kodaira manifold.</description>

      <title>On the problem of filling by a Poincar\'e-Einstein metric in dimension 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a metric defined on a manifold of dimension three, we study the problem of finding a conformal filling by a Poincar\'e-Einstein metric on a manifold of dimension four. We establish a compactness result for classes of conformally compact Einstein $4$-manifolds under conformally invariant conditions. A key step in the proof is a result of rigidity for the hyperbolic metric on $\mathbb {B}^4$ or $ S^1 \times \mathbb{B}^3$.
  As an application, we also derive some existence results of conformal filling in for metrics in a definite size neighborhood of the canonical metric; when the conformal infinity is either $S^3$ or $S^1 \times S^2$.</description>

      <title>Finsler structure of the Apollonian weak metric on the unit disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we {\it find} the Finsler structure of the Apollonian weak metric on the open unit disc in $\mathbb{R}^2$, which turns out to be a Randers type Finsler structure and we call it as Apollonian weak-Finsler structure. In fact the Apollonian weak-Finsler structure is the deformation of the hyperbolic Poincar\'e metric in the unit disc by a closed $1$-form. As a cosequence, the trajectories of the geodesic of this Apollonian weak-Finsler structure pointwise agrees with the geodesic of hyperbolic Poincar\'e metric in the open unit disc. Further, we explicitly calculate its $S$-curvature, Riemann curvature, Ricci curvature and flag curvature. It turns out that the $S$-curvature of the Apollonian weak-Finsler structure in the unit disc is bounded below by $\frac{3}{2}$, while its flag curvature $K$ satisfies $\frac{-1}{4}\leq K&lt;2$.</description>

      <title>Minimal surface doublings and electrostatics for Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twenty years ago, N. Kapouleas introduced a singular perturbation construction known as "doubling", which produces sequences of high-genus minimal surfaces converging to a given minimal surface with multiplicity two. Doubling constructions have since been implemented successfully in several settings, with deep work of Kapouleas-McGrath reducing their existence theory to the problem of finding suitable families of ansatz data on the initial minimal surface.
  In this paper, we introduce a variational approach to the existence of minimal doublings, relating the Kapouleas-McGrath construction to the study of nondegenerate critical points for a Coulomb-type interaction energy. By analyzing the minimizers of this energy, we prove that, in a generic closed 3-manifold, every two-sided, embedded minimal surface of index one admits a sequence of minimal doublings. As a corollary, we find that a generic 3-manifold contains an infinite sequence of embedded minimal surfaces with bounded area and arbitrarily large genus, whose geometry can be described with some precision.</description>

      <title>An explicit formula for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the Stiefel manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an explicit formula for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the orthogonal Stiefel manifold, viewed as a constraint submanifold of the Euclidean space of real matrices equipped with the Frobenius metric. Using the general framework of Laplace operators on constraint manifolds, we provide the formula for the Laplace-Beltrami operator in terms of the ambient Euclidean coordinates. The result extends previously known cases, recovering the formulas for the sphere and the special orthogonal group as particular instances.</description>

      <title>A zoo of coisotropic embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend the coisotropic embedding theorem obtained by M. J. Gotay for pre-symplectic manifolds to more general geometric settings: cosymplectic, contact, cocontact, $k$-symplectic, $k$-cosymplectic, $k$-contact, and multisymplectic manifolds. The results are obtained by applying a generic methodology, which gives more relevance to the potential applications. In that sense, this paper gives the fundamental basis to be able to apply the results to the so-called regularization problem of singular Lagrangian systems, both in mechanics and in classical field theories.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel asymptotics and analytic torsion on non-degenerate CR manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact oriented CR manifold of dimension $2n+1$, $n \ge 1$, with a nondegenerate Levi form of constant signature $(n_-, n_+)$. Suppose that condition $Y(q)$ holds at each point of $X$, we establish the small time asymptotics of the heat kernel of Kohn Laplacian. Suppose that condition $Y(q)$ fails, we establish the small time asymptotics of the kernel of the difference of the heat operator and Szeg\H{o} projector. As an application we define the analytic torsion on a compact oriented CR manifold of dimension $2n+1$, $n \ge 1$, with a nondegenerate Levi form. Let $L^k$ be the $k$-th power of a CR complex line bundle $L$ over $X$. We also establish asymptotics of the analytic torsion with values in $L^k$ under certain natural assumptions.</description>

      <title>Lie groups in tangent join restriction categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal bundles have at least three different definitions, depending on the category of geometric objects studied.
  In Differential Geometry, they are defined as locally trivial projection map of smooth manifolds with an atlas whose transition maps are given by group multiplication. In Topology they are $G$-equivariantly trivial $G$-spaces. In Algebraic Geometry, they are \'Etale locally isotrivial geometric quotients of $G$-varieties.
  The goal of this work is to have a categorical notion that recovers all of them. While they are different structures, they are all locally isomorphic to the Cartesian product of a base space with a group.
  There are a variety of other results on group objects and their tangent bundle. In particular we show that the tangent bundle is the product of the tangent space and the group object and that the tangent space has an external Lie algebra structure, generalizing the correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras.
  In order to give a purely categorical definition of a principal bundle, we formulate this notion in the language of join restriction categories. Restriction categories were developed by Cockett and Lack to generalize partial maps (maps defined only on a subset of the domain) and have since then found applications in mathematics and computer science. Join restriction categories, as described by Guo are restriction categories where local restrictions can be joined to obtain a global map. Together with a manifold construction due to Grandis, that allows us to glue together objects, we can describe principal bundles entirely in the language of join-restriction categories.</description>

      <title>A Novel Mathematical Model of Protein Interactions from the Perspective of Electron Delocalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proteins are the workhorse molecules of the cell and perform their biological functions by binding to other molecules through physical contact. Protein function is then regulated through coupling of bindings on the protein (allosteric regulation). Just as the genetic code provides the blueprint for protein synthesis, the coupling is thought to provide the basis for protein communication and interaction. However, it is not yet fully understood how binding of a molecule at one site affects binding of another molecule at another distal site on a protein, even more than $60$ years after its discovery in 1961. In this paper, I propose a simple mathematical model of protein interactions, using a ``quantized'' version of differential geometry, i.e., the discrete differential geometry of $n$-simplices. The model is based on the concept of electron delocalization, one of the main features of quantum chemistry, Allosteric regulation then follows tautologically from the definition of interactions. No prior knowledge of conventional discrete differential geometry, protein science, or quantum chemistry is required. I hope this paper will provide a starting point for many mathematicians to study chemistry and molecular biology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a vector generalization of the square root embedding-based curvature-corrected Cram\'er--Rao bound (CRB) previously considered by the same author in \cite{srk} with scalar parameters. A \emph{directional} curvature correction is established first, and sufficient conditions for a conservative matrix-level CRB refinement are formulated using a simple semidefinite program. The directional correction theorem is rigorously illustrated with a Gaussian example.</description>

      <title>A D-brane fantasy on noncommutative mirror symmetry, prelude: Noncommutative ringed spaces from local noncommutative crepant resolutions of a singular Calabi-Yau space, dynamical D-branes thereupon, and questions beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the world-sheet of a fundamental string, the world-volume of stacked D-branes carries an Azumaya noncommutative structure ([L-Y1: Sec.\ 2] (D(1))), allowing it to directly serve as a probe into noncommutative target-spaces. This feature leads to a D-brane fantasy: {\it Noncommutative Mirror Symmetry between noncommutative Calabi-Yau spaces may be realized as different realizations of a supersymmetric D-brane world-volume quantum field theory exactly like the string world-sheet aspect for Mirror Symmetry between (commutative) Calabi-Yau manifolds}. Driven by this fantasy, in the current notes a class of noncommutative ringed spaces shadowing over a $C^\infty$-manifold with corners are constructed from gluing local noncommutative crepant resolutions of Gorenstein isolated singularities. Dynamical D-branes on such noncommutative target-spaces are realized as maps/morphisms from an Azumaya manifold with a fundamental module with a connection $\nabla$ thereto. The notion of $\nabla$-adjusted kinetic energy for such a map is given via the basic noncommutative differential calculus developed earlier in [L-Y4] (D(11.1)). This provides an action functional for dynamical D-branes on such noncommutative spaces in parallel to the Polyakov action functional for fundamental bosonic strings on a commutative target-space. This sets up a basic stage to begin with for the realization of the D-brane fantasy on Noncommutative Mirror Symmetry. Questions beyond are sampled along the discussion.</description>

      <title>Complete complex Finsler metrics and uniform equivalence of the Kobayashi metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08456v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, first of all, according to Lu's and Zhang's works about the curvature of the Bergman metric on a bounded domain and the properties of the squeezing functions, we obtain that Bergman curvature of the Bergman metric on a bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain with $C^2$-boundary or bounded convex domain is bounded. Secondly, by the property of curvature symmetry on a K\"ahler manifold, we have the property: if holomorphic sectional curvature of a K\"ahler manifold is bounded, we can deduce that its sectional curvature is bounded. After that, applying to the Schwarz lemma from a complete K\"ahler manifold into a complex Finsler manifold, we get that a bounded strictly pseudoconvex domain with $C^2$-boundary or bounded convex domain admit complete strongly pseudoconvex complex Finsler metrics such that their holomorphic sectional curvature is bounded from above by a negative constant. Finally, by the Schwarz lemma from a complete K\"ahler manifold into a complex Finsler manifold, we prove the uniform equivalences of the Kobayashi metric and Carath\'eodory metric on a bounded strongly convex domain with smooth boundary.</description>

      <title>Six dimensional counterexample to the Milnor Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our previous work by building a smooth complete manifold $(M^6,g,p)$ with $\mathrm{Ric}\geq 0$ and whose fundamental group $\pi_1(M^6)=\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ is infinitely generated. The example is built with a variety of interesting geometric properties. To begin the universal cover $\tilde M^6$ is diffeomorphic to $S^3\times \mathbb{R}^3$, which turns out to be rather subtle as this diffeomorphism is increasingly twisting at infinity. The curvature of $M^6$ is uniformly bounded, and in fact decaying polynomially. The example is {\it locally} noncollapsed, in that $\mathrm{Vol}(B_1(x))&gt;v&gt;0$ for all $x\in M$. Finally, the space is built so that it is {\it almost } globally noncollapsed. Precisely, for every $\eta&gt;0$ there exists radii $r_j\to \infty$ such that $\mathrm{Vol}(B_{r_j}(p))\geq r_j^{6-\eta}$. The broad outline for the construction of the example will closely follow the scheme introduced in our previous work. The six-dimensional case requires a couple of new points, in particular the corresponding Ricci curvature control on the equivariant mapping class group is harder and cannot be done in the same manner.</description>

      <title>Half Space Property in RCD(K,N) spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to prove the Half Space Property for RCD(0,N) spaces, namely that if (X,d,m) is a parabolic RCD(0,N) space and $ C \subset X \times \mathbb{R}$ is locally the boundary of a perimeter minimizing set and it is contained in a half space, then $C$ is a locally finite union of horizontal slices.
  The same result is proved for RCD(K,N) spaces, for any $K\in \mathbb{R}$ and $N\in (1,\infty)$, under the stronger assumption that $C$ is the boundary of a \emph{globally} perimeter minimizing set.
  As a consequence, we obtain oscillation estimates and a Half Space Theorem for minimal hypersurfaces in products $M \times \mathbb{R}$, where $M$ is a parabolic smooth manifold (possibly weighted and with boundary), satisfying a Ricci curvature lower bound. On the way of proving the Half Space Property, we also extend to the RCD setting some classical results on Green's functions and parabolic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Sasaki structures on general contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16697v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the concept of a Sasakian structure on a cooriented contact manifold, given by a compatibility between the contact form $\eta$ and a Riemannian metric $g_M$ on $M$, to the case of a general contact structure understood as a contact distribution. Traditionally, the compatibility can be expressed as the fact that the symplectic form $\omega=\mathrm{d}(s^2\eta)$ and the metric $g(x,s)=\mathrm{d} s\otimes\mathrm{d} s+s^2g_M(x)$ define on the cone $\mathcal{M}=M\times\mathbb{R}_+$ a K\"ahler structure. Since general contact structures can be realized as homogeneous symplectic structures $\omega$ on $\mathrm{GL}(1;\mathbb{R})$-principal bundles $P\to M$, it is natural to understand Sasakian structures in full generality as related to `homogeneous K\"ahler structures' on $P$. The difficulty is that, even locally, contact distributions do not provide any preferred contact form, so the standard approach cannot be directly applied. However, we succeeded in characterizing homogeneous K\"ahler structures on $(P,\omega)$ and discovering a canonical lift of Riemannian metrics from the contact manifold $M$ to $P$, which allowed us to define Sasakian structures for general contact manifolds. This approach is completely conceptual and avoids ad hoc choices. Moreover, it provides a natural concept of Sasakian manifold products which we develop in detail.</description>

      <title>Spin(7)-Orbifold Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a general analytic and geometric framework for resolving Spin(7)--orbifolds. These spaces arise naturally as boundary points in the moduli space of exceptional holonomy metrics, and smooth Gromov--Hausdorff resolutions can be viewed as paths from the boundary to the interior of the moduli space. Our construction combines algebraic and symplectic techniques with analytic gluing methods: singular strata are replaced by families of adiabatic torsion--free, asymptotically conical fibred spaces whose existence is controlled by the analysis of Dirac--type operators on orbifold resolutions. We formulate obstruction conditions in terms of string cohomology, prove existence results for torsion--free Spin(7)--structures extending Joyce's theorem arXiv:math/9910002 to the setting of orbifold resolutions, and construct new families of compact Spin(7)--manifolds. By dimensional reduction, our results also recover, generalise and extend the results of Joyce and Karigiannis arXiv:1707.09325 on $G_2$--orbifold resolutions. This unifies and extends all known resolution methods for exceptional holonomy orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Initial data sets with vanishing mass are contained in pp-wave spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1981, Schoen-Yau and Witten showed that in General Relativity both the total energy $E$ and the total mass $m$ of an initial data set modeling an isolated gravitational system are non-negative. Moreover, if $E=0$, the initial data set must be contained in Minkowski space. In this paper, we show that if $m=0$, i.e. if $E$ equals the total momentum $|P|$, the initial data set must be contained in a pp-wave spacetime. Our proof combines spinorial methods with spacetime harmonic functions and works in all dimensions. Additionally, we find the decay rate threshold where the embedding has to be within Minkowski space and construct non-vacuum initial data sets with $m=0$ in the borderline case. As a consequence, this completely settles the rigidity of the spacetime positive mass theorem for spin manifolds.</description>
