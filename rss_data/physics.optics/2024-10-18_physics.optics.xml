      <title>Conservation law for angular momentum based on optical field derivatives: Analysis of optical spin-orbit conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel theoretical framework that offers new insights into understanding the loss of optical angular momentum (AM), spin AM (SAM), and orbital AM (OAM) in light-matter interactions, encompassing both the transfer from light to matter and spin-orbit conversion (SOC). Traditionally, the separation of optical SAM and OAM from total AM relied on vector potentials, leading to gauge-dependent ambiguities and limiting analysis to vacuum conditions, without accounting for material systems. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a field-derivative approach that constructs optical AM from the time derivatives of electric and magnetic fields, allowing for gauge-independent evaluations of SAM and OAM, even in material systems. We apply this framework to analyze spin-orbit conversion (SOC) in two scenarios: the scattering of circularly polarized (CP) Gaussian beams by a single gold nanoparticle, and the focusing of CP beams and linearly polarized (LP) optical vortex (OV) beams by an aplanatic lens. Our results reveal that SOC is highly dependent on particle size in scattering, with larger particles exhibiting significant OAM loss, while SOC occurs during CP beam focusing, but not with LP OV beams. This framework enables the evaluation of previously overlooked optical SAM and OAM losses, providing a powerful tool for studying systems in which the analysis of AM losses is intrinsically important, such as chiral materials, as well as for designing photonic devices and exploring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Spatial Coherence Length Measurements of the Canadian Light Source BXDS-IVU Beamline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High emittance synchrotron sources have always been assumed to possess suboptimal coherence properties, especially in the hard Xray regime. While this is largely true, it is very important to understand the limits of coherence for these existing high emittance sources. Coherence length measurements were carried out in the hard Xray regime at the BXDS IVU beamline, Canadian Light Source. Young's double slit experiment was employed at multiple energies in both the horizontal and vertical direction leading to a thorough characterization of the coherence properties of the beamline. Spatial coherence lengths ranging from 0.77 $\mu \text{m}$ to 6.41 $\mu \text{m}$ were measured in the horizontal direction, the same in the vertical direction was at least 5 times larger. The experiment indicates that the CLS has functional coherent beam properties in the hard Xray regime.</description>

      <title>Chip-scale monolithic optoelectronic voltage boost conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Voltage conversion is a fundamental electronic process critical to engineered systems across a wide spectrum of applications and spanning many orders of magnitude in scale. Conventional approaches like transformers and charge pumps perform well in specific contexts but face fundamental limitations to miniaturization, electromagnetic interference, and voltage range. Here we present a chip-scale, fully integrated monolithic, non-switching optoelectronic voltage conversion platform capable of high gain, bootstrap-free boost-mode operation across several orders of magnitude in power density and voltage scale. Using the bidirectional coupling between LEDs and PV cells with identical active layer materials, our chip-scale, single-die strategy eliminates Stokes losses while improving key parameters like physical footprint, series resistance, and photon leakage by orders of magnitude over implementations using multiple packaged, discrete components. Moreover, by exploiting the large \'etendue of NIR-transparent semi-insulating InP substrates and the atomically smooth, void-free interface of lattice-matched epitaxial growth, simulations indicate that our InGaAsP architecture's photon transport simultaneously provides a &gt; 60x increase in current density and &gt; 50x reduction in non-radiative recombination losses compared with a multiple-die solution while simultaneously reducing fabrication complexity and improving mechanical robustness. We experimentally demonstrate a boost gain of 3.8x in an 8x8 mm$^2$ InGaAs-on-InP chip while validating key aspects of the voltage conversion platform.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the anatase-to-rutile transition for TiO$_2$ sol-gel coatings with refractive index up to 2.7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes the elaboration of rutile titanium dioxide films with high refractive indices and low scattering by sol-gel process and controlled crystallization. The evolutions of the optical properties and crystalline structure of sol-gel processed titania coatings on fused silica were investigated for different thermal budgets of the annealing post-treatment using ellipsometry, spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction and electronic microscopy. It reveals that anatase and rutile coatings with refractive indices of 2.5 and 2.7 can be prepared with associated optical loss of 0.5% and 1%, respectively, which are excellent compromise for applications in integrated photonics. These evolutions are associated to the thermally induced mass transfer and phase transitions occurring during thermal annealing that involves first the nucleation growth and sintering of anatase polyoriented nanocrystals, followed by the transformation into rutile polyoriented nanocrystals. Concomitantly, rutile crystals with (110) faces parallel to the surface consume surrounding anatase and rutile nanocrystals by diffusive sintering to yield micron-size rutile monocrystalline and monooriented platelets patchwork, exhibiting refractive index of 2.73 and 1.2% optical loss. The formation of these platelets is governed by surface energies and is responsible for the increase in optical loss.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform Fourier Domain Stretching method for ultra-wide-angle wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical inspection of wide-angle (WA) or ultra-wide-angle (UWA) computer-generated holograms (CGH) is a computationally demanding task. To surpass this limitation, we propose a novel computational approach for fast and accurate WA-CGH reconstruction based on Fast Fourier transform Fresnel diffraction (FrT) and non-uniform frequency hologram magnification. This novel algorithm, referred to as the non-uniform Fourier Domain Stretching (NU-FDS) method, is based on approximating a spherical wave coming from any object point with a parabolic wave, with the points of convergence of the two waves being different. It is supported by a mathematical solution developed using phase-space to determine the frequency distribution needed to find the distribution of non-uniform magnification. It corrects the axial distance of a parabolic wave so the FrT solution can be applied for WA-CGH reconstruction. The NU-FDS algorithm also allows the reconstruction of a partial view with freedom of position and size selection, reducing computation time. In this way, the NU-FDS method enables fast and accurate quantitative assessment of the 3D information coded into the CGH. The presented evidence shows that the NU-FDS algorithm can accurately and efficiently reconstruct large and highly detailed 3D objects from WA and UWA CGH of FoV and resolution up to 120{\deg} and 16K, respectively.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the acceleration time and reflectance of light sails made from homogeneous and core-shell spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deciding on appropriate materials and designs for use in light sails, like the one proposed in the Breakthrough Starshot Initiative, is a topic that requires much care and forethought. Here, we offer a feasible option in the form of metasurfaces made of periodically arranged homogeneous and core-shell spheres. Using the re-normalized T-matrix from Mie theory, we explore the reflectance, absorptance, and acceleration time of such metasurfaces. We focus on spheres made from aluminum, silicon, silicon dioxide, and combinations thereof. Since the light sails are foreseen to be accelerated using Earth-based laser arrays to 20% of the speed of light, one needs to account for relativistic effects. As a result, a high broadband reflectance is essential for effective propulsion. We identify metasurfaces that offer such properties combined with a low absorptance to reduce heating and deformation. We highlight a promising extension to the case of a metasurface made from homogeneous silicon spheres, as already discussed in the literature, by adding a layer of silicon dioxide. The high broadband reflectance of the silicon and silicon dioxide combination is explained by the favorable interference of the multipolar contributions of the outgoing field up to quadrupolar order. We also consider the impact of an embedding material characterized by different refractive indices. Refractive indices up to 1.13 maintain over 90% reflectance without re-optimizing the light sail.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of polarization in fiber-based quantum sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical fibers constitute an attractive platform for the realization of nonlinear and quantum optics processes. Here we show, through theoretical considerations, how polarization effects of both third-order parametric down-conversion and four-wave-mixing in optical fibers may be exploited to enhance detection schemes. We apply our general framework specifically to the case of tapered fibers for photon triplet generation, a long-standing goal within quantum optics, and obtain explicit expectation values for its efficiency. A quantitative investigation of four-wave-mixing in a microstructured solid-core fiber provides significant consequences for the role of polarization in experimental design.</description>

      <title>OAH-Net: A Deep Neural Network for Hologram Reconstruction of Off-axis Digital Holographic Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-axis digital holographic microscopy is a high-throughput, label-free imaging technology that provides three-dimensional, high-resolution information about samples, particularly useful in large-scale cellular imaging. However, the hologram reconstruction process poses a significant bottleneck for timely data analysis. To address this challenge, we propose a novel reconstruction approach that integrates deep learning with the physical principles of off-axis holography. We initialized part of the network weights based on the physical principle and then fine-tuned them via weakly supersized learning. Our off-axis hologram network (OAH-Net) retrieves phase and amplitude images with errors that fall within the measurement error range attributable to hardware, and its reconstruction speed significantly surpasses the microscope's acquisition rate. Crucially, OAH-Net demonstrates remarkable external generalization capabilities on unseen samples with distinct patterns and can be seamlessly integrated with other models for downstream tasks to achieve end-to-end real-time hologram analysis. This capability further expands off-axis holography's applications in both biological and medical studies.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast pulse propagation time-domain dynamics in dispersive one-dimensional photonic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast pulses, particularly those with durations under 100 femtoseconds, are crucial in achieving unprecedented precision and control in light-matter interactions. However, conventional on-chip photonic platforms are not inherently designed for ultrafast time-domain operations, posing a significant challenge in achieving essential parameters such as high peak power and high temporal resolution. This challenge is particularly pronounced when propagating through dispersive integrated waveguides, unlike classical applications where dispersion is typically near-zero or linear. In addressing this challenge, we present a design methodology for ultrafast pulse propagation in dispersive integrated waveguides, specifically focused on enhancing the time-domain characteristics of one-dimensional grating waveguides (1DGWs). The proposed methodology aims to determine the optimal structural parameters for achieving maximum peak power, enhanced temporal resolution, and extended pulse storage duration during ultrafast pulse propagation. To validate this approach, we design and fabricate two specialized 1DGWs on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. A digital finite impulse response (FIR) model, trained with both transmission and phase measurement data, is employed to obtain ultrafast time-domain characteristics, enabling easy extraction of these results. Our approach achieves a 2.78-fold increase in peak power and reduces pulse broadening by 24%, resulting in a smaller sacrifice in temporal resolution. These results can possibly pave the way for advanced light-matter interactions within dispersive integrated waveguides.</description>

      <title>Enabling a multifunctional telecommunications fiber optic network: Ultrastable optical frequency transfer and attosecond timing in deployed multicore fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The telecommunications industry's deployment of billions of kilometers of optical fiber has created a vast global network that can be exploited for additional applications such as environmental sensing, quantum networking and international clock comparisons. However, for reasons such as the unidirectionality of long-haul fiber links, telecom fiber networks cannot always be adapted for important applications beyond data transmission. Fortunately, new multicore optical fibers create the opportunity for application coexistence with data traffic, creating expansive multifunctional networks. Towards that end, we propose and demonstrate the faithful transfer of ultrastable optical signals through multicore fiber in a way that is compatible with the unidirectionality of long-haul fiber optic systems, demonstrating a fractional frequency instability of 3x10-19 at 10,000 seconds. This opens the door towards intercontinental optical clock comparisons, with applications in fundamental physics and the redefinition of the second.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-based Toroidal Lenslet Array Design for Addressing Laser Guide Star Elongation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Giant Magellan Telescope will use laser tomography adaptive optics to correct for atmospheric turbulence using artificial guide stars created in the sodium layer of the atmosphere (altitude ~95km). The sodium layer has appreciable thickness (~11km) and this results in the laser guide star being an elongated cylinder shape. Wavefront sensing with a Shack-Hartmann is challenging, as subapertures located further away from the laser launch position image an increasingly elongated perspective of the laser guide star. Large detectors can be used to adequately pack and sample the images on the detector, however, this increases readout noise and limits the design space available for the wavefront sensor. To tackle this challenge, we propose an original solution based on nano-engineered meta-optics tailored to produce a spatially varying anamorphic image scale compression. We present meta-lenslet array designs that can deliver ~100% of the full anamorphic image size reduction required for focal lengths down to 8mm, and greater than 50% image size reduction for focal lengths down to 2mm. This will allow greatly improved sampling of the available information across the whole wavefront sensor, while still being a viable design within the limits of current-generation fabrication facilities.</description>

      <title>Exploring Nanoscale Photoresponse Mechanisms for Enhanced Photothermoelectric Effects in van der Waals Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated photodetectors are crucial for their high speed, sensitivity, and efficient power consumption. In these devices, photocurrent generation is primarily attributed to the photovoltaic (PV) effect, driven by electron hole separations, and the photothermoelectric (PTE) effect, which results from temperature gradients via the Seebeck effect. As devices shrink, the overlap of these mechanisms-both dependent on the Fermi level and band structure-complicates their separate evaluation at the nanoscale. This study introduces a novel 3D photocurrent nano-imaging technique specifically designed to distinctly map these mechanisms in a Schottky barrier photodiode featuring a molybdenum disulfide and gold (MoS2 Au) interface. We uncover a significant PTE-dominated region extending several hundred nanometers from the electrode edge, a characteristic facilitated by the weak electrostatic forces typical in 2D materials. Unexpectedly, we find that incorporating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), known for its high thermal conductivity, markedly enhances the PTE response. This counterintuitive enhancement stems from an optimal overlap between thermal and Seebeck profiles, presenting a new pathway to boost device performance. Our findings highlight the capability of this imaging technique to not only advance optoelectronic applications but also to deepen our understanding of light matter interactions within low-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Differential Shape Optimization with Image Representation for Photonic Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for differentiating shapes represented in binary images with respect to their parameters. This framework functions as an automatic differentiation tool for shape parameters, generating both binary density maps for optical simulations and computing gradients when the simulation provides a gradient of the density map. Our algorithm enables robust gradient computation that is insensitive to the image's pixel resolution and is compatible with all density-based simulation methods. We demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness, and generalizability of our differential shape algorithm using photonic designs with different shape parametrizations across several differentiable optical solvers. We also demonstrate a substantial reduction in optimization time using our gradient-based shape optimization framework compared to traditional black-box optimization methods.</description>

      <title>PiLocNet: Physics-informed neural network on 3D localization with rotating point spread function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the 3D localization problem using point spread function (PSF) engineering, we propose a novel enhancement of our previously introduced localization neural network, LocNet. The improved network is a physics-informed neural network (PINN) that we call PiLocNet. Previous works on the localization problem may be categorized separately into model-based optimization and neural network approaches. Our PiLocNet combines the unique strengths of both approaches by incorporating forward-model-based information into the network via a data-fitting loss term that constrains the neural network to yield results that are physically sensible. We additionally incorporate certain regularization terms from the variational method, which further improves the robustness of the network in the presence of image noise, as we show for the Poisson and Gaussian noise models. This framework accords interpretability to the neural network, and the results we obtain show its superiority. Although the paper focuses on the use of single-lobe rotating PSF to encode the full 3D source location, we expect the method to be widely applicable to other PSFs and imaging problems that are constrained by known forward processes.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical micro-rheology of complex fluids at ultra-high frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an optomechanical method for locally measuring the rheological properties of complex fluids in the ultra-high frequency range (UHF). A mechanical disk of microscale volume is used as a small-amplitude oscillating probe that monitors the fluid at rest in thermal equilibrium, while the oscillation is detected by optomechanical transduction within a sub-millisecond measurement time, thanks to an optimized signal collection. An original analytical model for fluid-structure interactions is used to extract from these measurements the rheological properties of liquids over the frequency range 100 MHz - 1 GHz. This new micro-rheology method is calibrated by measurements on liquid water, in which we observe pronounced compressibility effects above 500 MHz, but which we show remains Newtonian all over the explored range. In contrast, measurements reveal that liquid 1-decanol exhibits a non-Newtonian behavior, with a frequency-dependent viscosity associated to several relaxation frequencies in the UHF. Our data agree well with an extended Maxwell model for the viscosity of this alcohol, involving two relaxation times of 797 and 151 picoseconds, which are respectively analyzed as supramolecular and intramolecular relaxation processes. A shear elastic response of the liquid appears at the highest frequencies, compatible with the entropic elasticity of molecules as they attempt to uncurl, and whose value enables estimating the volume of a single molecule of liquid. UHF optomechanical micro-rheology demonstrates here a direct mechanical access to the fast molecular dynamics at play in a liquid, in a quantitative manner and in a short time.</description>

      <title>Terahertz resonant emission by optically excited infrared-active shear phonons in KY(MoO4)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generation of the monochromatic electromagnetic radiation in the terahertz (THz) range of frequencies for many decades remanes a chellenging task. Here we demonstrate the emission of monochromatic sub-THz radiation by coherent optical phonons in dielectric material KY(MoO4)2. The layered crystal structure of KY(MoO4)2 leads to infrared-active shear lattice vibrations with energies below 3.7 meV, which corresponds to the frequencies low than 900 GHz where solid-state compounds based monochromatic radiation sources are rare. Coherent infrared-active optical phonons are excited by broadband THz pulses lasting for tens of picoseconds and re-emit narrow-band subTHz radiation pulses with a decay time of 33 picoseconds, which is exceptionally long for the oscillators with frequencies below 1 THz. Such a long coherent emission allows for the detection of more than 50 periods of radiation with frequencies of 568 and 860 GHz. The remarkably long decay time together with the chemical stability of the employed materials suggest a variety of possible applications in THz laser technology.</description>

      <title>Topological interface modes in systems with damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of topological localised interface modes to systems with damping. The spectral problem is formulated as a root-finding problem for the interface impedance function and Rouch\'e's theorem is used to track the zeros when damping is introduced. We show that the localised eigenfrequencies, corresponding to interface modes, remain for non-zero dampings. Using the transfer matrix method, we explicitly characterise the decay rate of the interface mode.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the visual impact of wind farm lights on the nocturnal landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wind farm lights are a conspicuous feature in the nocturnal landscape. Their presence is a source of light pollution for residents and the environment, severely disrupting in some places the aesthetic, cultural, and scientific values of the pristine starry skies. In this work we present a simple model for quantifying the visual impact of individual wind turbine lights, based on the comparison of their brightnesses with the brightness of well-known night sky objects. The model includes atmospheric and visual variables, and for typical parameters it shows that medium-intensity turbine lights can be brighter than Venus up to ~4 km from the turbine, brighter than alpha CMa (the brightest star on the nighttime sky) until about ~10 km, and reach the standard stellar visibility limit for the unaided eye (m_v=+6.00) at ~38 km. These results suggest that the visual range of wind farms at nighttime may be significantly larger than at daytime, a factor that should be taken into account in environmental impact assessments.</description>

      <title>Postselection technique for optical Quantum Key Distribution with improved de Finetti reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The postselection technique is an important proof technique for proving the security of quantum key distribution protocols against coherent attacks. In this work, we go through multiple steps to rigorously apply the postselection technique to optical quantum key distribution protocols. First, we place the postselection technique on a rigorous mathematical foundation by fixing a technical flaw in the original postselection paper. Second, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to prepare-and-measure protocols by using a de Finetti reduction with a fixed marginal. Third, we show how the postselection technique can be used for decoy-state protocols by tagging the source. Finally, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to realistic optical setups by developing a new variant of the flag-state squasher. We also improve existing de Finetti reductions, which reduce the effect of using the postselection technique on the key rate. These improvements can be more generally applied to other quantum information processing tasks. As an example to demonstrate the applicability of our work, we apply our results to the time-bin encoded three-state protocol. We observe that the postselection technique performs better than all other known proof techniques against coherent attacks.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Synchrotron Beam Characterisation from a Single Interferogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double-aperture Young interferometry is widely used in accelerators to provide a one-dimensional beam measurement. We improve this technique by combining and further developing techniques of non-redundant, two-dimensional, aperture masking and self-calibration from astronomy. Using visible synchrotron radiation, tests at the ALBA synchrotron show that this method provides an accurate two-dimensional beam transverse characterisation, even from a single 1 ms interferogram. The non-redundancy of the aperture mask in the technique enables it to be resistant to spatial phase fluctuations that might be introduced by vibration of optical components, or in the laboratory atmosphere.</description>
