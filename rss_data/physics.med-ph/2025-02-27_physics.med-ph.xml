      <title>Impact of deep learning model uncertainty on manual corrections to auto-segmentation in prostate cancer radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Deep learning (DL)-based organ segmentation is increasingly used in radiotherapy, yet voxel-wise DL uncertainty maps are rarely presented to clinicians. Purpose: This study assessed how DL-generated uncertainty maps impact radiation oncologists during manual correction of prostate radiotherapy DL segmentations. Methods: Two nnUNet models were trained by 10-fold cross-validation on 434 MRI-only prostate cancer cases to segment the prostate and rectum. Each model was evaluated on 35 independent cases. Voxel-wise uncertainty was calculated using the SoftMax standard deviation (n=10) and visualized as a color-coded map. Four oncologists performed segmentation in two steps: Step 1: Rated segmentation quality and confidence using Likert scales and edited DL segmentations without uncertainty maps. Step 2 ($\geq 4$ weeks later): Repeated step 1, but with uncertainty maps available. Segmentation time was recorded for both steps, and oncologists provided qualitative free-text feedback. Histogram analysis compared voxel edits across uncertainty levels. Results: DL segmentations showed high agreement with oncologist edits. Quality ratings varied: rectum segmentation ratings slightly decreased overall in step 2, while prostate ratings differed among oncologists. Confidence ratings also varied. Three oncologists reduced segmentation time with uncertainty maps, saving 1-2 minutes per case. Histogram analysis showed 50% fewer edits for step 2 in low-uncertainty areas. Conclusions: Presenting DL segmentation uncertainty information to radiation oncologists influences their decision-making, quality perception, and confidence in the DL segmentations. Low-uncertainty regions were edited less frequently, indicating increased trust in DL predictions. Uncertainty maps improve efficiency by reducing segmentation time and can be a valuable clinical tool, enhancing radiotherapy planning efficiency.</description>

      <title>Zero Echo Time Functional MRI in Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Conventional echo planar imaging(EPI) based functional MRI(fMRI) uses the BOLD contrast to map activity changes in human brains. Introducing an efficient ZTE sequence for functional brain mapping can help address limitations of EPI and demonstrate the feasibility of using T1 related changes as a surrogate marker of brain activity. Goals: To test and optimize ZTE sequence for fMRI. Methods: A ZTE sequence with radial inside out spokes was used to prepare a dynamic imaging protocol that matches conventional EPI time course. Temporal SNR and sensitivity to susceptibility differences of ZTE were evaluated and the sequence was benchmarked against BOLD EPI in a task based visual fMRI study with healthy volunteers at 3T. Results: Phantom measurements confirmed sensitivity of the ZTE protocol to the oxygen concentration. Functional activation in primary visual cortex could be detected using ZTE. Resting state networks could also be identified using independent component analysis. Discussion: ZTE-based fMRI is proposed for mapping functional activation in human brain. ZTE is robust against susceptibility artefacts and significantly reduces acoustic noise. Radial sampling pattern allows for high undersampling rates to increase temporal resolution.</description>

      <title>Neutron Beam Shaping by Ghost Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to shape a neutron beam and project any specified target image using a single universal patterned mask that is transversely displaced. The method relies on "ghost projection", which is a reversed form of classical ghost imaging. A set of sub-mask regions that combine to construct the required beam shape is computed; illumination of each region with the determined exposure time projects the shaped beam. We demonstrate this method experimentally, using the Dingo neutron imaging beamline at the OPAL nuclear research reactor (Australia). The ability to shape a neutron beam "on demand" allows selective dose delivery away from sensitive areas of samples, such as in cultural heritage artifacts. It also benefits irradiation techniques, e.g., in testing resilience of electronic components for space and defense technologies or neutron therapies.</description>

      <title>Bridging Spectroscopy and Advanced Molecular Orientation Analysis with New 4+ Angle Polarization Toolbox in Quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropy plays a critical role in governing the mechanical, thermal, electrical, magnetic, and optical properties of materials, influencing their behavior across diverse applications. Probing and quantifying this directional dependence is crucial for advancing materials science and biomedical research, as it provides a deeper understanding of structural orientations at the molecular level, encompassing both scientific and industrial benefits. This study introduces the "4+ Angle Polarization" widget, an innovative extension to the open-source Quasar platform (https://quasar.codes/), tailored for advanced multiple-angle polarization analysis. This toolbox enables precise molecular orientation analysis of complex microspectroscopic datasets through a streamlined workflow. Using polarized Fourier transform infrared (p-FTIR) spectroscopy, we demonstrate its versatility across various sample types, including polylactic acid (PLA) organic crystals, murine cortical bone, and human osteons. By overcoming the limitations of traditional two-angle methods, the widget significantly enhances the accuracy of structural and orientational analysis. This novel analytical tool expands the potential of multiple-angle p-FTIR techniques into advanced characterization of structural anisotropy in heterogeneous systems, providing transformative insights for materials characterization, biomedical imaging and beyond.</description>
