      <title>Fluids at an electrostatically active surface: Optimum in interfacial friction and electrohydrodynamic drag</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While fluids near a solid surface are at the core of applications in energy storage/conversion, electrochemistry/electrowetting and adsorption/catalysis, their nanoscale behavior remains only partially deciphered. Beyond conventional effects (e.g. adsorption/reaction, interfacial transport, phase transition shifts), recent experimental and theoretical studies on metallic surfaces have unraveled exotic peculiarities such as complex electrostatic screening, unexpected wetting transition, and interfacial quantum friction. These novel features require developing and embarking new tools to tackle the coupling between charge relaxation in the metal and molecular behavior in the vicinal fluid. Here, using the concept of Virtual Thomas-Fermi fluids, we employ a molecular simulation approach to investigate interfacial transport of fluid molecules and metal charge carriers at their interface--including the underlying electrostatically-driven dynamic friction and the coupling between charge current/hydrodynamic flow (the so-called electrohydrodynamic drag). While conventional numerical techniques consider either insulating materials or metallic materials described as polarizable, non-conducting media, our atom-scale strategy provides an effective yet realistic description of the solid excitation spectrum--including charge relaxation modes and conductivity. By applying this approach to water near metallic surfaces of various electrostatic screening lengths, we unveil a non-monotonous dependence of the fluid/solid friction on the metallicity with a maximum occurring as the charge dynamic structure factors of the solid and fluid strongly overlap. Moreover, we report a direct observation of the electrohydrodynamic drag which arises from the momentum transfer between the solid and liquid through dynamic electrostatic interactions and the underlying interfacial friction.</description>

      <title>Cellular wrapping of elastic particles by a supported lipid membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constancy of life vitally depends on the internalization of particles through biomembranes. Of particular interest, cellular uptake, including phagocytosis, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and membrane fusion, critically depends on the elasticity of particles. Cellular membranes are strongly linked to a supporting cytoskeleton. However, in most previous studies, the effect of this cortical network somehow is overlooked. In this paper, we study the cellular wrapping of a membrane around a 2D elastic particle in the presence of a substrate mimicking cytoskeleton. Our simulations show that the impact of particle flexibility on the wrapping process depends on the magnitude of the membrane particle adhesion. In contrast, the extent of membrane protrusions formed around the target always increases with target stiffness. Since the extension of membrane protrusions is an essential step in the phagocytosis process, this result may indicate a selective behavior of macrophages in the phagocytosis of aged red blood cells.</description>

      <title>Protein-Water Energy Transfer via Anharmonic Low-Frequency Vibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat dissipation is ubiquitous in living systems, which constantly convert distinct forms of energy into each other. The transport of thermal energy in liquids and even within proteins is well understood but kinetic energy transfer across a heterogeneous molecular boundary provides additional challenges. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations under steady-state conditions to analyze how a protein dissipates surplus thermal energy into the surrounding solvent. We specifically focus on collective degrees of freedom that govern the dynamics of the system from the diffusive regime to mid-infrared frequencies. Using a fully anharmonic analysis of molecular vibrations, we analyzed their vibrational spectra, temperatures, and heat transport efficiencies. We find that the most efficient energy transfer mechanisms are associated with solvent-mediated friction. However, this mechanism only applies to a small number of degrees of freedom of a protein. Instead, less efficient vibrational energy transfer in the far-infrared dominates heat transfer overall due to a large number of vibrations in this frequency range. A notable by-product of this work is a highly sensitive measure of deviations from energy equi-partition in equilibrium systems, which can be used to analyze non-ergodic properties.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Structure and Dynamics in Solid Polymer Electrolytes: a Molecular Dynamics Study of LiPF6/polypropylene carbonate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state batteries (SSB) are emerging as next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices. Achieving high energy density in SSB relies on solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) that are electrochemically stable against both lithium metal and high-potential positive electrodes, two conditions that are difficult to satisfy without chemical degradation. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the relationship between structure and dynamics in carbonate-based SPE composed of polypropylene carbonate and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF$_6$), at salt concentrations ranging from 0.32 to 1.21 mol$/$kg. Structural properties are analyzed under ambient pressure at the experimentally relevant temperature $T = 353$ K. Since the slow dynamical processes governing ion transport in these systems are inaccessible to direct molecular dynamics, transport properties are simulated at elevated temperatures up to 900 K and extrapolated to $T = 353$ K using Arrhenius behavior. The results reveal strong ionic correlations, a limited fraction of free ions, and a predominance of negatively charged clusters, especially at high salt concentration. At high temperature, the self-diffusion coefficient of Li$^+$ exceeds that of PF$_6^-$ due to weaker Li$^+$-carbonate and ion-ion interactions. However, at $T = 353$ K, Li$^+$ mobility becomes lower than that of the anion, consistent with typical experimental observations in SPE. As expected, the ionic conductivity $\sigma$ increases with temperature, while at $T = 353$ K it exhibits a maximum for salt concentrations between 1.0 and 1.1 mol$/$kg. Overall, the estimated physico-chemical parameters highlight the key role of ion correlations in SPE and suggest strategies to optimize electrolyte performance. The Arrhenius extrapolation approach used here provides valuable insight into ion transport mechanisms in solid polymer electrolytes.</description>

      <title>An O(N) quasi-Ewald splitting method for nanoconfined electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of charged particles in quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) nanoconfined systems presents a significant computational challenge due to the long-range nature of electrostatic interactions and the geometric anisotropy. To address this, we introduce a novel quasi-Ewald splitting strategy tailored for particle-based simulations in such geometry. Our splitting strategy seamlessly integrates a collection of advanced numerical techniques, including optimal quadrature rules [L. N. Trefethen, SIAM Rev. 64(1)(2022), pp.132-150], fast pairwise kernel summation methods [S. Jiang and L. Greengard, Commun. Comput. Phys. 31(1)(2022), pp.1-26], and the random batch method with importance sampling in k-space [S. Jin, L. Li, Z. Xu et al., SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 43(4)(2021), pp.B937-B960]. The resulting algorithm achieves an O(N) overall computational complexity, where N denotes the total number of confined particles. Simulations of several prototype systems validate the accuracy and efficiency of our method. Furthermore, we present numerical observations specifically related to nanoconfined charged many-body systems, highlighting phenomena such as dielectric boundary effects, anisotropic diffusion, and the structure of the electrical double layer (EDL) under conditions of charge asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Dynamical bicontinuous networks from 3D active phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study phase separation between coexisting active and passive fluids in three-dimensions, using both numerical simulation and experiments. Chaotic flows of the active phase drive giant interfacial deformations and cause the co-existing phases to interpenetrate, generating a continuously reconfiguring bicontinuous steady-state morphology that persists over the lifetime of the active fluid. We demonstrate how activity controls the structure of the bicontinuous network. Quantitative analysis reveals the dominance of dynamical steady-state sheet-like interfaces, in marked difference from the transient bicontinuous structures observed in passive liquid-liquid phase separation, where saddle-like surfaces dominate. These results demonstrate how active stresses suppress the coarsening dynamics of conventional phase separation, generating steady-state reconfigurable morphologies not accessible with conventional surface-modifying agents or through quenching of transient phase separated structures.</description>

      <title>Polymer-Iron Oxide Hybrid Films for Controlling Electrokinetic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrokinetic phenomena at polymer-water interfaces are central to technologies for water purification, ion separations, and energy conversion, yet the ability to systematically control polymer surface charge and associated electrokinetic processes remains limited. Here, we demonstrate a simple liquid-phase infiltration (LPI) method to synthesize polymer-metal oxide hybrid films with controllable interfacial properties. Hydroxy-terminated poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP-OH) brushes grafted to silicon substrates were infiltrated with iron nitrate from ethanolic solution, followed by low-temperature thermal treatment to convert the infiltrated precursor into iron oxide. Spectroscopic ellipsometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis confirmed oxide incorporation and hybrid film formation without polymer degradation. Electrokinetic flow characterization reveals that the hybrid films acquire the electrokinetic properties of the infiltrated oxide, with concentration-dependent streaming potentials and surface conductivities closely matching those of pure iron oxide films. These results establish metal oxide infiltration as a scalable and low-cost strategy for controlling interfacial charge in polymer surfaces. The approach introduces new materials and design parameters for tailoring ion selectivity, transport, and energy conversion, with broad implications for the development of advanced membranes, electrokinetic harvesting devices, and polymer-supported oxide electrodes.</description>

      <title>Thermalized buckling of extensible, semiflexible polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euler buckling of rods is a long-studied mechanical instability, and it remains relevant to this day, as the constituent components in many biological and physical systems are linear polymers, such as microtubules or carbon nanotubes. At finite temperature, if a polymer is shorter than its persistence length, the polymer is semiflexible, and its elasticity remains rod-like. But polymers can also stretch due to their finite extensibility, which can couple to energetically cheap bending deformations in nonlinear ways when a load is applied to the system. We show how the interplay between thermal fluctuations and nonlinear elasticity dramatically modifies the Euler buckling instability for compressed semiflexible polymers in a fixed strain ensemble. We identify a Ginzburg-like length scale beyond which thermally excited undulations lead to a softened Young's modulus, while the polymer nevertheless remains semiflexible. Both perturbative calculations and numerical Monte Carlo simulations suggest a qualitative change in several scaling properties of the buckling transition. The critical compressional strain for thermal buckling now increases with system size, in contrast to athermal buckling, where it decreases with system size. Renormalization group calculations confirm this picture, and also show that thermal buckling is controlled by a new fixed point with different critical exponents compared to classical Euler buckling.</description>

      <title>Consistent thermodynamics reconstructed from transitions between nonequilibrium steady-states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing a thermodynamic framework for nonequilibrium systems remains a major challenge, as quantities such as temperature and free energy often become ambiguous when inferred solely from steady-state properties. Here we take a transformation-based approach and experimentally examine transitions between nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). Using an optically trapped microparticle driven by a tunable correlated stochastic force, we generate active-like steady states with controllable noise statistics. By abruptly changing the trap stiffness, we measure the stochastic work, heat, and entropy produced during NESS-to-NESS transformations. We identify a state-dependent effective temperature that restores the second law for these transitions, enabling the definition of a generalized work that incorporates the consequence of the nonequilibrium fluctuations. With this quantity, we derive and experimentally verify a Crooks-like fluctuation relation linking work distributions to a nonequilibrium free-energy difference defined through the effective temperature. Finally, we establish a fluctuation-response relation for the positional variance following stiffness changes. We demonstrate that this relation is key to distinguishing systems that can be described by a unique effective temperature (i.e., those under equilibrium or white-noise conditions) from those under colored-noise, where an equilibrium-like response cannot be restored. These results delineate the applicability and limits of effective-temperature thermodynamics in driven systems.</description>

Abstract: Understanding contact between rough surfaces undergoing plastic deformation is crucial in many applications. We test Persson's multiscale contact mechanics theory for elastoplastic solids, assuming a constant penetration hardness. Using a numerical model based on the boundary element method, we simulate the contact between a flat rigid surface and an elastic-perfectly plastic half-space with a randomly rough surface. The theory's predictions for elastic, plastic, and total contact area agree quantitatively with the numerical results. The simulations also support the boundary conditions assumed in the theory, namely that the stress probability vanishes at both zero and yield stress. These findings reinforce the validity of the theory for systems with constant hardness.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the contact between rough surfaces undergoing plastic deformation is crucial in many applications. We study the effect of plastic deformation on the surface separation between two solids with random roughness. Assuming a constant penetration hardness, we propose a procedure within Persson's multiscale contact mechanics theory to obtain the average surface separation by applying the elastic formulation to an effective power spectrum that accounts for plastic smoothing. Deterministic numerical simulations based on the boundary element method are used to validate the procedure and show good agreement with the theoretical predictions. The treatment also provides a route to incorporate plastic stiffening of the roughness as the stress state becomes increasingly hydrostatic at large plastic deformation.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a kinetic theory of two species of hard spheres undergoing reactive collisions that convert chemical energy into kinetic energy. The model describes an active species interacting with a passive background, labeled as birds and air respectively, with the reactive collisions representing of self-propulsion. Microscopic reversibility of the reactive dynamics is imposed, and a chemostat is introduced to drive the system out of equilibrium. When the chemostat is sufficiently strong and one restricts to grazing interspecies collisions, we find that the bird momentum damping coefficient can change sign, giving rise to a flocking transition.</description>

      <title>Why planar cracks fragment into echelon cracks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the growth of large cracks in brittle materials is a fundamental unresolved problem in fracture mechanics. Under out-of-plane shear loading, an initially planar crack may fragment into multiple cracks, forming an echelon crack pattern. Explaining this phenomenon is essential for developing a general theory of crack growth. Although numerous empirical criteria have been proposed in the literature, none provide a unified explanation of all observed features and are largely restricted to two-dimensional growth in linear elastic isotropic materials. In this Letter, we confront a classical set of echelon crack growth experiments using two phase-field approaches: the classical variational model and a strength-constrained model. We show that, contrary to prevailing views, the variational model based solely on Griffith's energetic competition between elastic and fracture energies is fundamentally incomplete even for predicting the growth of large cracks. By incorporating a material strength surface that constrains the regions in which a crack can grow, the resulting model accurately predicts echelon crack growth without invoking any ad hoc assumptions about material or geometrical disorder. Results are presented for both soft and hard materials, confirming the model's general applicability to any brittle material. We further identify two governing non-dimensional parameters that control crack orientation and morphology and demonstrate that one of them, the ratio of shear to tensile strength, determines whether crack paths are more influenced by energy-based or stress-based empirical criteria, thereby reconciling these criteria within a single framework.</description>
