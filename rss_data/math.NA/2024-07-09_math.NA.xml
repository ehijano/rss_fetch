      <title>Local convergence analysis of L1/finite element scheme for a constant delay reaction-subdiffusion equation with uniform time mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to develop a refined error estimate of L1/finite element scheme for a reaction-subdiffusion equation with constant delay $\tau$ and uniform time mesh. Under the non-uniform multi-singularity assumption of exact solution in time, the local truncation errors of the L1 scheme with uniform mesh is investigated. Then we introduce a fully discrete finite element scheme of the considered problem. Next, a novel discrete fractional Gr\"onwall inequality with constant delay term is proposed, which does not include the increasing Mittag-Leffler function comparing with some popular other cases. By applying this Gr\"onwall inequality, we obtain the pointwise-in-time and piecewise-in-time error estimates of the finite element scheme without the Mittag-Leffler function. In particular, the latter shows that, for the considered interval $((i-1)\tau,i\tau]$, although the convergence in time is low for $i=1$, it will be improved as the increasing $i$, which is consistent with the factual assumption that the smoothness of the solution will be improved as the increasing $i$. Finally, we present some numerical tests to verify the developed theory.</description>

      <title>A hybrid upwind scheme for two-phase flow in fractured porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the flow of two fluid phases in porous media is a challenging task, especially when fractures are included in the simulation. Fractures may have highly heterogeneous properties compared to the surrounding rock matrix, significantly affecting fluid flow, and at the same time hydraulic aperture that are much smaller than any other characteristic sizes in the domain. Generally, flow simulators face difficulties with counter-current flow, generated by gravity and pressure gradients, which hinders the convergence of non-linear solvers (Newton).
  In this work, we model the fracture geometry with a mixed-dimensional discrete fracture network, thus lightening the computational burden associated to an equi-dimensional representation. We address the issue of counter-current flows with appropriate spatial discretization of the advective fluid fluxes, with the aim of improving the convergence speed of the non-linear solver. In particular, the extension of the hybrid upwinding to the mixed-dimensional framework, with the use of a phase potential upstreaming at the interfaces of subdomains.
  We test the method across several cases with different flow regimes and fracture network geometry. Results show robustness of the chosen discretization and a consistent improvements, in terms of Newton iterations, compared to use the phase potential upstreaming everywhere.</description>

      <title>Function and derivative approximation by shallow neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a Tikhonov regularization scheme specifically tailored for shallow neural networks within the context of solving a classic inverse problem: approximating an unknown function and its derivatives within a unit cubic domain based on noisy measurements. The proposed Tikhonov regularization scheme incorporates a penalty term that takes three distinct yet intricately related network (semi)norms: the extended Barron norm, the variation norm, and the Radon-BV seminorm. These choices of the penalty term are contingent upon the specific architecture of the neural network being utilized. We establish the connection between various network norms and particularly trace the dependence of the dimensionality index, aiming to deepen our understanding of how these norms interplay with each other. We revisit the universality of function approximation through various norms, establish rigorous error-bound analysis for the Tikhonov regularization scheme, and explicitly elucidate the dependency of the dimensionality index, providing a clearer understanding of how the dimensionality affects the approximation performance and how one designs a neural network with diverse approximating tasks.</description>

      <title>Modeling localized failure in geomaterials by large-deformation-plasticity periporomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-deformation localized failure in geomaterials plays a crucial role in geohazards engineering. This article investigates shear bands and retrogressive failure of geomaterials through a recently formulated large-deformation-plasticity periporomechanics (PPM) paradigm. Periporomechanics is a nonlocal reformulation of classical poromechanics through the effective force and peridynamic state concepts. The nonlocal deformation gradient is multiplicatively decomposed into the elastic and plastic parts in this large-deformation PPM paradigm. The stabilized correspondence principle is adopted to implement a classical elastoplastic constitutive model into the new PPM paradigm. We have numerically implemented this large-deformation plasticity PPM paradigm through a Lagrangian meshfree method in space and an explicit Newmark scheme in time. The implemented PPM framework is used to model shear banding and retrogressive slope failure in porous media under dry conditions. The numerical results have demonstrated the efficacy and robustness of this new PPM paradigm for modeling shear banding and retrogressive failure involving large deformation in porous media.</description>

      <title>Sequential hybrid finite element and material point method to simulate slope failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of slope failures seeks to predict two key phenomena: the initiation of failure and the post-failure runout. Currently, most modeling methods for slope failure analysis excel at one of these two but are deficient in the other. For example, the Finite Element Method (FEM) models the initiation of instability well but quickly loses accuracy when modeling large deformations because of mesh distortion, restricting its ability to predict runout. Conversely, the Material Point Method (MPM) utilizes material points which move freely across a background grid, allowing for indefinite deformations without computational issues. However, MPM is restricted in its ability to model slope failure initiation due to limitations of the available boundary conditions and reduced accuracy of its stress distributions. The sequential hybridization of these two methods, initiating a model in FEM and then transferring to MPM, presents an opportunity to accurately capture both initiation and runout by a single model. The exact time for this transfer is not self-apparent, but it must be conducted after the initiation mechanism and before excessive mesh distortion. By simulating two granular column failures and two slope failures, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this hybrid FEM-MPM method and identify the appropriate time to transfer.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds play an essential role in the design and analysis of spectral algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a new method to deduce matrix perturbation bounds, which we call "contour bootstrapping". As applications, we work out several new bounds for eigensubspace computation and low rank approximation. Next, we use these bounds to study utility problems in the area of differential privacy.</description>

      <title>A Third-order Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta Method for Landau-Lifshitz Equation with Arbitrary Damping Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A third-order accurate implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta time marching numerical scheme is proposed and implemented for the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, which models magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic materials, with arbitrary damping parameters. This method has three remarkable advantages:~(1) only a linear system with constant coefficients needs to be solved at each Runge-Kutta stage, which greatly reduces the time cost and improves the efficiency; (2) the optimal rate convergence analysis does not impose any restriction on the magnitude of damping parameter, which is consistent with the third-order accuracy in time for 1-D and 3-D numerical examples; (3) its unconditional stability with respect to the damping parameter has been verified by a detailed numerical study. In comparison with many existing methods, the proposed method indicates a better performance on accuracy and efficiency, and thus provides a better option for micromagnetics simulations.</description>

      <title>pythOS: A Python library for solving IVPs by operator splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator-splitting methods are widespread in the numerical solution of differential equations, especially the initial-value problems in ordinary differential equations that arise from a method-of-lines discretization of partial differential equations. Such problems can often be solved more effectively by treating the various terms individually with specialized methods rather than simultaneously in a monolithic fashion. This paper describes \pythOS, a Python software library for the systematic solution of differential equations by operator-splitting methods. The functionality of \pythOS\ focuses on fractional-step methods, including those with real and complex coefficients, but it also implements additive Runge--Kutta methods, generalized additive Runge--Kutta methods, and multi-rate, and multi-rate infinitesimal methods. Experimentation with the solution of practical problems is facilitated through an interface to the \Firedrake\ library for the finite element spatial discretization of partial differential equations and further enhanced by the convenient implementation of exponential time-integration methods and fully implicit Runge--Kutta methods available from the \Irksome\ software library. The functionality of \pythOS\ as well as some less generally appreciated aspects of operator-splitting methods are demonstrated by means of examples.</description>

      <title>Solving forward and inverse PDE problems on unknown manifolds via physics-informed neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of deep operator networks (DeepONets) in solving both forward and inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs) on unknown manifolds. By unknown manifolds, we identify the manifold by a set of randomly sampled data point clouds that are assumed to lie on or close to the manifold. When the loss function incorporates the physics, resulting in the so-called physics-informed DeepONets (PI-DeepONets), we approximate the differentiation terms in the PDE by an appropriate operator approximation scheme. For the second-order elliptic PDE with a nontrivial diffusion coefficient, we approximate the differentiation term with one of these methods: the Diffusion Maps (DM), the Radial Basis Functions (RBF), and the Generalized Moving Least Squares (GMLS) methods. For the GMLS approximation, which is more flexible for problems with boundary conditions, we derive the theoretical error bound induced by the approximate differentiation. Numerically, we found that DeepONet is accurate for various types of diffusion coefficients, including linear, exponential, piecewise linear, and quadratic functions, for linear and semi-linear PDEs with/without boundaries. When the number of observations is small, PI-DeepONet trained with sufficiently large samples of PDE constraints produces more accurate approximations than DeepONet. For the inverse problem, we incorporate PI-DeepONet in a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to estimate the diffusion coefficient from noisy solutions of the PDEs measured at a finite number of point cloud data. Numerically, we found that PI-DeepONet provides accurate approximations comparable to those obtained by a more expensive method that directly solves the PDE on the proposed diffusion coefficient in each MCMC iteration.</description>

      <title>High-order accurate entropy stable schemes for compressible Euler equations with van der Waals equation of state on adaptive moving meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the high-order entropy stable (ES) finite difference schemes for multi-dimensional compressible Euler equations with the van der Waals equation of state (EOS) on adaptive moving meshes. Semi-discrete schemes are first nontrivially constructed built on the newly derived high-order entropy conservative (EC) fluxes in curvilinear coordinates and scaled eigenvector matrices as well as the multi-resolution WENO reconstruction, and then the fully-discrete schemes are given by using the high-order explicit strong-stability-preserving Runge-Kutta time discretizations.The high-order EC fluxes in curvilinear coordinates are derived by using the discrete geometric conservation laws and the linear combination of the two-point symmetric EC fluxes, while the two-point EC fluxes are delicately selected by using their sufficient condition, the thermodynamic entropy and the technically selected parameter vector.The adaptive moving meshes are iteratively generated by solving the mesh redistribution equations, in which the fundamental derivative related to the occurrence of non-classical waves is involved to produce high-quality mesh. Several numerical tests on the parallel computer system with the MPI programming are conducted to validate the accuracy, the ability to capture the classical and non-classical waves, and the high efficiency of our schemes in comparison with their counterparts on the uniform mesh.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Interacting Particle-Field Algorithm for a Haptotaxis Advection-Diffusion System Modeling Cancer Cell Invasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of tumor invasion and metastasis dynamics is crucial for advancements in cancer biology and treatment. Many mathematical models have been developed to study the invasion of host tissue by tumor cells. In this paper, we develop a novel stochastic interacting particle-field (SIPF) algorithm that accurately simulates the cancer cell invasion process within the haptotaxis advection-diffusion (HAD) system. Our approach approximates solutions using empirical measures of particle interactions, combined with a smoother field variable - the extracellular matrix concentration (ECM) - computed by the spectral method. We derive a one-step time recursion for both the positions of stochastic particles and the field variable using the implicit Euler discretization, which is based on the explicit Green's function of an elliptic operator characterized by the Laplacian minus a positive constant. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm, especially in computing cancer cell growth with thin free boundaries in three-dimensional (3D) space. Numerical results show that the SIPF algorithm is mesh-free, self-adaptive, and low-cost. Moreover, it is more accurate and efficient than traditional numerical techniques such as the finite difference method (FDM) and spectral methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-intrusive model order reduction method for bilinear stochastic differential equations with additive noise is proposed. A reduced order model (ROM) is designed in order to approximate the statistical properties of high-dimensional systems. The drift and diffusion coefficients of the ROM are inferred from state observations by solving appropriate least-squares problems. The closeness of the ROM obtained by the presented approach to the intrusive ROM obtained by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is investigated. Two generalisations of the snapshot-based dominant subspace construction to the stochastic case are presented. Numerical experiments are provided to compare the developed approach to POD.</description>

      <title>A boundary integral equation formulation for transient electromagnetic transmission problems on Lipschitz domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a boundary integral formulation for the dynamic problem of electromagnetic scattering and transmission by homogeneous dielectric obstacles. In the spirit of Costabel and Stephan, we use the transmission conditions to reduce the number of unknown densities and to formulate a system of coupled boundary integral equations describing the scattered and transmitted waves. The system is transformed into the Laplace domain where it is proven to be stable and uniquely solvable. The Laplace domain stability estimates are then used to establish the stability and unique solvability of the original time domain problem. Finally, we show how the bounds obtained in both Laplace and time domains can be used to derive error estimates for semi discrete Galerkin discretizations in space and for fully discrete numerical schemes that use Convolution Quadrature for time discretization and a conforming Galerkin method for discretization of the space variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, an approach to the moment closure problem on the basis of orthogonal polynomials derived from Gram matrices is proposed. Its properties are studied in the context of the moment closure problem arising in gas kinetic theory, for which the proposed approach is proven to have multiple attractive mathematical properties. Numerical studies are carried out for model gas particle distributions and the approach is compared to other moment closure methods, such as Grad's closure and the maximum-entropy method. The proposed ``Gramian'' closure is shown to provide very accurate results for a wide range of distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Modeling Framework using Element-based Galerkin Methods for Moist Atmospheric Limited-Area Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a multiscale modeling framework (MMF) to model moist atmospheric limited-area weather. The MMF resolves large-scale convection using a coarse grid while simultaneously resolving local features through numerous fine local grids and coupling them seamlessly. Both large- and small-scale processes are modeled using the compressible Navier-Stokes equations within the Nonhydrostatic Unified Model of the Atmosphere (NUMA), and they are discretized using a continuous element-based Galerkin method (spectral elements) with high-order basis functions. Consequently, the large-scale and small-scale models share the same dynamical core but have the flexibility to be adjusted individually. The proposed MMF method is tested in 2D and 3D idealized limited-area weather problems involving storm clouds produced by squall line and supercell simulations. The MMF numerical results showed enhanced representation of cloud processes compared to the coarse model.</description>

      <title>A multigrid reduction framework for domains with symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Divergence constraints are present in the governing equations of many physical phenomena, and they usually lead to a Poisson equation whose solution typically is the main bottleneck of many simulation codes. Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) is arguably the most powerful preconditioner for Poisson's equation, and its effectiveness results from the complementary roles played by the smoother, responsible for damping high-frequency error components, and the coarse-grid correction, which in turn reduces low-frequency modes. This work presents several strategies to make AMG more compute-intensive by leveraging reflection, translational and rotational symmetries, often present in academic and industrial configurations. The best-performing method, AMGR, is based on a multigrid reduction framework that introduces an aggressive coarsening to the multigrid hierarchy, reducing the memory footprint, setup and application costs of the top-level smoother. While preserving AMG's excellent convergence, AMGR allows replacing the standard sparse matrix-vector product with the more compute-intensive sparse matrix-matrix product, yielding significant accelerations. Numerical experiments on industrial CFD applications demonstrated up to 70% speed-ups when solving Poisson's equation with AMGR instead of AMG. Additionally, strong and weak scalability analyses revealed no significant degradation.</description>

      <title>An Arnoldi-based approach to polynomial and rational least squares problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we solve polynomial, Sobolev polynomial, rational, and Sobolev rational least squares problems. Although the increase in the approximation degree allows us to fit the data better in attacking least squares problems, the ill-conditioning of the coefficient matrix fuels the dramatic decrease in the accuracy of the approximation at higher degrees. To overcome this drawback, we first show that the column space of the coefficient matrix is equivalent to a Krylov subspace. Then the connection between orthogonal polynomials or rational functions and orthogonal bases for Krylov subspaces in order to exploit Krylov subspace methods like Arnoldi orthogonalization is established. Furthermore, some examples are provided to illustrate the theory and the performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Analysis and finite element approximation of a diffuse interface approach to the Stokes--Biot coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the interaction between a poroelastic structure, described using the Biot model in primal form, and a free-flowing fluid, modelled with the time-dependent incompressible Stokes equations. We propose a diffuse interface model in which a phase field function is used to write each integral in the weak formulation of the coupled problem on the entire domain containing both the Stokes and Biot regions. The phase field function continuously transitions from one to zero over a diffuse region of width $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ around the interface; this allows the equations to be posed uniformly across the domain, and obviates tracking the subdomains or the interface between them. We prove convergence in weighted norms of a finite element discretisation of the diffuse interface model to the continuous diffuse model; here the weight is a power of the distance to the diffuse interface. We in turn prove convergence of the continuous diffuse model to the standard, sharp interface, model. Numerical examples verify the proven error estimates, and illustrate application of the method to fluid flow through a complex network, describing blood circulation in the circle of Willis.</description>

      <title>Investigation of microstructural evolution of irradiation-induced defects in tungsten: an experimental-numerical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hostile condition in a fusion tokomak reactor poses the main challenge in the development and design of in-vessel components such as divertor and breeding blanket due to fusion relevant irradiation conditions (14 MeV) and large thermal loads. The current work describes the employment of an integrated experimental-numerical approach to assess the microstructure evolution of dislocation loops and voids in tungsten proposed for fusion application. Cluster dynamics (CD) model is implemented and simulations are performed on the irradiated tungsten Disk shape Compact Tension (DCT) specimen used in the experimental test. TEM characterisation is performed on the DCT specimen irradiated at 400 {\deg}C and 600 {\deg}C with around 1 dpa, respectively. The dpa rate and cascade overlap rate from the experiments and SPECTRA-PKA code, respectively, are implemented in the CD model. Based on the comparison between experimental and computational results, the dose and temperature dependence of irradiation-induced defects (dislocation loops, voids, c15 clusters) are clearly observed. Trap mediated diffusion is studied and the impact of cascades with the pre-existing defects is analysed through full cascade overlap mode and the consequent influence on the defect concentration is evaluated. The exchange of self-interstitial atoms (SIAs) and the change in the size of loops through reaction between &lt;111&gt; and &lt;100&gt; loops are studied in detail by means of the transfer rate of the SIAs.</description>

      <title>On the Consistency of Dynamic Wetting Boundary Conditions for the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the limiting behavior of the Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard model for binary-fluid flows as the diffuse-interface thickness passes to zero, in the presence of fluid-fluid-solid contact lines. Allowing for motion of such contact lines relative to the solid substrate is required to adequately model multi-phase and multi-species fluid transport past and through solid media. Even though diffuse-interface models provide an inherent slip mechanism through the mobility-induced diffusion, this slip vanishes as the interface thickness and mobility parameter tend to zero in the so-called sharp-interface limit. The objective of this work is to present dynamic wetting and generalized Navier boundary conditions for diffuse-interface models that are consistent in the sharp-interface limit. We concentrate our analysis on the prototypical binary-fluid Couette-flow problems. To verify the consistency of the diffuse-interface model in the limit of vanishing interface thickness, we provide reference limit solutions of a corresponding sharp-interface model. For parameter values both at and away from the critical viscosity ratio, we present and compare the results of both the diffuse- and sharp-interface models. The close match between both model results indicates that the considered test case lends itself well as a benchmark for further research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of big data, an ever-growing volume of information is recorded, either continuously over time or sporadically, at distinct time intervals. Functional Data Analysis (FDA) stands at the cutting edge of this data revolution, offering a powerful framework for handling and extracting meaningful insights from such complex datasets. The currently proposed FDA me\-thods can often encounter challenges, especially when dealing with curves of varying shapes. This can largely be attributed to the method's strong dependence on data approximation as a key aspect of the analysis process. In this work, we propose a free knots spline estimation method for functional data with two penalty terms and demonstrate its performance by comparing the results of several clustering methods on simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>On the Higuchi fractal dimension of invariant measures for countable idempotent iterated function systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the set of invariant idempotent probabilities for countable idempotent iterated function systems (IFS) defined in compact metric spaces. We demonstrate that, with constant weights, there exists a unique invariant idempotent probability. Utilizing Secelean's approach to countable IFSs, we introduce partially finite idempotent IFSs and prove that the sequence of invariant idempotent measures for these systems converges to the invariant measure of the original countable IFS. We then apply these results to approximate such measures with discrete systems, producing, in the one-dimensional case, data series whose Higuchi fractal dimension can be calculated. Finally, we provide numerical approximations for two-dimensional cases and discuss the application of generalized Higuchi dimensions in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Infinite quantum signal processing for arbitrary Szeg\H o functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete solution to the problem of infinite quantum signal processing for the class of Szeg\H o functions, which are functions that satisfy a logarithmic integrability condition and include almost any function that allows for a quantum signal processing representation. We do so by introducing a new algorithm called the Riemann-Hilbert-Weiss algorithm, which can compute any individual phase factor independent of all other phase factors. Our algorithm is also the first provably stable numerical algorithm for computing phase factors of any arbitrary Szeg\H o function. The proof of stability involves solving a Riemann-Hilbert factorization problem in nonlinear Fourier analysis using elements of spectral theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In arXiv:2406.0243 two real functions $g(x,t)$ and $f(x,t)$ are defined, so that the Riemann-Siegel $Z$ function is given as \[Z(t)=\mathop{\mathrm{Re}}\Bigl\{\frac{u(t)e^{\frac{\pi i}{8}}}{\frac12+it}\int_0^\infty g(x,t)e^{i f(x,t)}\,dt\Bigr\},\] where $u(t)$ is a real function of order $t^{-1/4}$ when $t\to+\infty$. The function $g(x,t)$ is indefinitely differentiable and tends to $0$ as well as all its derivatives when $x\to0^+$ or $x\to+\infty$. Since, furthermore, for $t\to+\infty$ the function $f(x,t)$ tends to $+\infty$ we may expect that the integral depends essentially on the behavior of $g(x,t)$ at the extremes.
  As Polya in an analogous situation we consider the substitution of $\psi(x)$ by a simpler similar function. A simple function with this behavior is \[\psi_0(x):=2\pi(1+\tfrac{1}{4}x^{-5/2})e^{-\pi x-\frac{\pi}{4x}}.\] Therefore, we define $J_0(t)$ replacing in the definition of $J(t)$ the function $\psi(x)$ by the simpler $\psi_0(x)$. \begin{equation} J_0(t)=2\pi\int_0^\infty (1+\tfrac{1}{4}x^{-\frac52})e^{-\pi x-\frac{\pi}{4x}}(1-ix)^{\frac12(\frac12+it)}\,dx. \end{equation} The resulting $Z_0(t)$ disappoints us \[Z_0(t)\asymp \mathop{\mathrm{Re}}\Bigl\{\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\exp\Bigl\{i\Bigl(\frac{t}{2}\log\frac{t}{2\pi}-\frac{t}{2}-\frac{\pi}{8}\Bigr)\Bigr\}+\frac{2}{(2\pi t)^{1/4}}\exp\Bigl(\pi i\sqrt{\frac{t}{2\pi}}\;\Bigr)\Bigr\},\quad t\to+\infty.\] However, the integral $J_0(t)$ is interesting as a technical challenge. And still we have the possibility to get a better result improving $\psi_0(x)$.
  This is a preliminary version, and we set it as a challenge: to compute and study this integral.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of computing the value function from a discretely-observed trajectory of a continuous-time diffusion process. We develop a new class of algorithms based on easily implementable numerical schemes that are compatible with discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation. We establish high-order numerical accuracy as well as the approximation error guarantees for the proposed approach. In contrast to discrete-time RL problems where the approximation factor depends on the effective horizon, we obtain a bounded approximation factor using the underlying elliptic structures, even if the effective horizon diverges to infinity.</description>

      <title>Parametric Shape Holomorphy of Boundary Integral Operators with Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of boundary integral operators supported on a collection of parametrically defined bounded Lipschitz boundaries. Consequently, the boundary integral operators themselves also depend on the parametric variables, thus leading to a parameter-to-operator map. The main result of this article is to establish the analytic or holomorphic dependence of said boundary integral operators upon the parametric variables, i.e., of the parameter-to-operator map. As a direct consequence we also establish holomorphic dependence of solutions to boundary integral equations, i.e.,~holomorphy of the parameter-to-solution map. To this end, we construct a holomorphic extension to complex-valued boundary deformations and investigate the \emph{complex} Fr\'echet differentiability of boundary integral operators with respect to each parametric variable. The established parametric holomorphy results have been identified as a key property to overcome the so-called curse of dimensionality in the approximation of parametric maps with distributed, high-dimensional inputs.
  To demonstrate the applicability of the derived results, we consider as a concrete example the sound-soft Helmholtz acoustic scattering problem and its frequency-robust boundary integral formulations. For this particular application, we explore the consequences of our results in reduced order modelling, Bayesian shape inversion, and the construction of efficient surrogates using artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Optimal complexity of goal-oriented adaptive FEM for nonsymmetric linear elliptic PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a goal-oriented adaptive algorithm that aims to efficiently compute the quantity of interest $G(u^\star)$ with a linear goal functional $G$ and the solution $u^\star$ to a general second-order nonsymmetric linear elliptic partial differential equation. The current state of the analysis of iterative algebraic solvers for nonsymmetric systems lacks the contraction property in the norms that are prescribed by the functional analytic setting. This seemingly prevents their application in the optimality analysis of goal-oriented adaptivity. As a remedy, this paper proposes a goal-oriented adaptive iteratively symmetrized finite element method (GOAISFEM). It employs a nested loop with a contractive symmetrization procedure, e.g., the Zarantonello iteration, and a contractive algebraic solver, e.g., an optimal multigrid solver. The various iterative procedures require well-designed stopping criteria such that the adaptive algorithm can effectively steer the local mesh refinement and the computation of the inexact discrete approximations. The main results consist of full linear convergence of the proposed adaptive algorithm and the proof of optimal convergence rates with respect to both degrees of freedom and total computational cost (i.e., optimal complexity). Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and investigate the selection of the parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A backward stable numerical calculation of a function with condition number $\kappa$ will have a relative accuracy of $\kappa\epsilon_{\text{machine}}$. Standard formulations and software implementations of finite-strain elastic materials models make use of the deformation gradient $\boldsymbol F = I + \partial \boldsymbol u/\partial \boldsymbol X$ and Cauchy-Green tensors. These formulations are not numerically stable, leading to loss of several digits of accuracy when used in the small strain regime, and often precluding the use of single precision floating point arithmetic. We trace the source of this instability to specific points of numerical cancellation, interpretable as ill-conditioned steps. We show how to compute various strain measures in a stable way and how to transform common constitutive models to their stable representations, formulated in either initial or current configuration. The stable formulations all provide accuracy of order $\epsilon_{\text{machine}}$. In many cases, the stable formulations have elegant representations in terms of appropriate strain measures and offer geometric intuition that is lacking in their standard representation. We show that algorithmic differentiation can stably compute stresses so long as the strain energy is expressed stably, and give principles for stable computation that can be applied to inelastic materials.</description>

Abstract: Arguably, geodesics are the most important geometric objects on a differentiable manifold. They describe candidates for shortest paths and are guaranteed to be unique shortest paths when the starting velocity stays within the so-called injectivity radius of the manifold. In this work, we investigate the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold under the canonical metric. The Stiefel manifold $St(n,p)$ is the set of rectangular matrices of dimension $n$-by-$p$ with orthogonal columns, sometimes also called the space of orthogonal $p$-frames in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Using a standard curvature argument, Rentmeesters has shown in 2013 that the injectivity radius of the Stiefel manifold is bounded by $\sqrt{\frac{4}{5}}\pi$. It is an open question, whether this bound is sharp. With the definition of the injectivity radius via cut points of geodesics, we gain access to the information of the injectivity radius by investigating geodesics. More precisely, we consider the behavior of special variations of geodesics, called Jacobi fields. By doing so, we are able to present an explicit example of a cut point. In addition, since the theoretical analysis of geodesics for cut points and especially conjugate points as a type of cut points is difficult, we investigate the question of the sharpness of the bound by means of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A variationally consistent membrane wrinkling model based on tension-compression decomposition of the strain tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel variationally consistent membrane wrinkling model for analyzing the mechanical responses of wrinkled thin membranes. The elastic strain energy density is split into tensile and compressive terms via a spectral decomposition of the strain tensor. Tensile and compressive parts of the stress and tangent material matrices are then obtained via consistent variation from the respective strain energies. Considering only the positive part of the strain energy in the variational formulation, we obtain a membrane with zero compressive stiffness. By adding the negative strain energy multiplied with a reduction factor, we further obtain a residual compressive stiffness, which improves stability and allows handling also states of slackening. Comparison with results from analytical, numerical and experimental examples from the literature on membrane wrinkling problems demonstrate the great performance and capability of the proposed approach, which is also compatible with commercial finite element software.</description>

      <title>A single shooting method with approximate Fr\'{e}chet derivative for computing geodesics on the Stiefel manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows how to use the shooting method, a classical numerical algorithm for solving boundary value problems, to compute the Riemannian distance on the Stiefel manifold $ \mathrm{St}(n,p) $, the set of $ n \times p $ matrices with orthonormal columns. The proposed method is a shooting method in the sense of the classical shooting methods for solving boundary value problems; see, e.g., Stoer and Bulirsch, 1991. The main feature is that we provide an approximate formula for the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of the geodesic involved in our shooting method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the algorithms' accuracy and performance. Comparisons with existing state-of-the-art algorithms for solving the same problem show that our method is competitive and even beats several algorithms in many cases.</description>

      <title>Two-point stress approximation: A simple and robust finite volume method for linearized (poro-)mechanics and Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a unified continuum formulation of linearized mechanics, Stokes' flow and poromechanics in terms of a conservation structure. Starting from this formulation, we construct corresponding simple and robust finite volume discretizations for these physical systems, based only on co-located, cell-centered variables. These discretizations have a minimal discretization stencil, using only the two neighboring cells to a face to calculate numerical stresses and fluxes.
  We show well-posedness of a weak statement of the continuous formulation in appropriate Hilbert spaces, and identify the appropriate weighted norms for the problem. For the discrete approximations, we prove stability and convergence, both of which are robust in terms of the material parameters. Numerical experiments in 3D support the theoretical results, and provide additional insight into the practical performance of the discretization.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, various properties of core-EP matrices are investigated. We introduce the MPDMP matrix associated with $A$ and by means of it, some properties and equivalent conditions of core-EP matrices can be obtained. Also, properties of MPD, DMP, and CMP inverses are studied and we prove that in the class of core-EP matrices, DMP, MPD, and Drazin inverses are the same. Moreover, DMP and MPD binary relation orders are introduced and the relationship between these orders and other binary relation orders are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the constraint energy minimization generalized multiscale finite element method (CEM-GMsFEM) to solve Helmholtz equations in heterogeneous medium. This novel multiscale method is specifically designed to overcome problems related to pollution effect, high-contrast coefficients, and the loss of hermiticity of operators. We establish the inf-sup stability and give an a priori error estimate for this method under a number of established assumptions and resolution conditions. The theoretical results are validated by a set of numerical tests, which further show that the multiscale technique can effectively capture pertinent physical phenomena.</description>

      <title>Epidemic Transmission Modeling with Fractional Derivatives and Environmental Pathogens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research presents an advanced fractional-order compartmental model designed to delve into the complexities of COVID-19 transmission dynamics, specifically accounting for the influence of environmental pathogens on disease spread. By enhancing the classical compartmental framework, our model distinctively incorporates the effects of order derivatives and environmental shedding mechanisms on the basic reproduction numbers, thus offering a holistic perspective on transmission dynamics. Leveraging fractional calculus, the model adeptly captures the memory effect associated with disease spread, providing an authentic depiction of the virus's real-world propagation patterns. A thorough mathematical analysis confirming the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the model's solutions emphasizes its robustness. Furthermore, the numerical simulations, meticulously calibrated with real COVID-19 case data, affirm the model's capacity to emulate observed transmission trends, demonstrating the pivotal role of environmental transmission vectors in shaping public health strategies. The study highlights the critical role of environmental sanitation and targeted interventions in controlling the pandemic's spread, suggesting new insights for research and policy-making in infectious disease management.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Density Estimation via Variance-Reduced Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonparametric density models are of great interest in various scientific and engineering disciplines. Classical density kernel methods, while numerically robust and statistically sound in low-dimensional settings, become inadequate even in moderate higher-dimensional settings due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we introduce a new framework called Variance-Reduced Sketching (VRS), specifically designed to estimate multivariable density functions with a reduced curse of dimensionality. Our framework conceptualizes multivariable functions as infinite-size matrices, and facilitates a new sketching technique motivated by numerical linear algebra literature to reduce the variance in density estimation problems. We demonstrate the robust numerical performance of VRS through a series of simulated experiments and real-world data applications. Notably, VRS shows remarkable improvement over existing neural network estimators and classical kernel methods in numerous density models. Additionally, we offer theoretical justifications for VRS to support its ability to deliver nonparametric density estimation with a reduced curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Robust and accurate simulations of flows over orography using non-conforming meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically validate the static local mesh refinement capabilities of a recently proposed IMEX-DG scheme implemented in the framework of the deal.II library. Non-conforming meshes are employed in atmospheric flow simulations to increase the resolution around complex orography. A number of numerical experiments based on classical benchmarks with idealized as well as real orography profiles demonstrate that simulations with the refined mesh are stable for long lead times and no spurious effects arise at the interfaces of mesh regions with different resolutions. Moreover, correct values of the momentum flux are retrieved and the correct large-scale orographic response is established. Hence, large-scale orography-driven flow features can be simulated without loss of accuracy using a much lower total amount of degrees of freedom. In a context of spatial resolutions approaching the hectometric scale in numerical weather prediction models, these results support the use of locally refined, non-conforming meshes as a reliable and effective tool to greatly reduce the dependence of atmospheric models on orographic wave drag parametrizations.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Phase Field Simulations Through a Hybrid Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator with U-Net Backbone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prolonged contact between a corrosive liquid and metal alloys can cause progressive dealloying. For such liquid-metal dealloying (LMD) process, phase field models have been developed. However, the governing equations often involve coupled non-linear partial differential equations (PDE), which are challenging to solve numerically. In particular, stiffness in the PDEs requires an extremely small time steps (e.g. $10^{-12}$ or smaller). This computational bottleneck is especially problematic when running LMD simulation until a late time horizon is required. This motivates the development of surrogate models capable of leaping forward in time, by skipping several consecutive time steps at-once. In this paper, we propose U-Shaped Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (U-AFNO), a machine learning (ML) model inspired by recent advances in neural operator learning. U-AFNO employs U-Nets for extracting and reconstructing local features within the physical fields, and passes the latent space through a vision transformer (ViT) implemented in the Fourier space (AFNO). We use U-AFNOs to learn the dynamics mapping the field at a current time step into a later time step. We also identify global quantities of interest (QoI) describing the corrosion process (e.g. the deformation of the liquid-metal interface) and show that our proposed U-AFNO model is able to accurately predict the field dynamics, in-spite of the chaotic nature of LMD. Our model reproduces the key micro-structure statistics and QoIs with a level of accuracy on-par with the high-fidelity numerical solver. We also investigate the opportunity of using hybrid simulations, in which we alternate forward leap in time using the U-AFNO with high-fidelity time stepping. We demonstrate that while advantageous for some surrogate model design choices, our proposed U-AFNO model in fully auto-regressive settings consistently outperforms hybrid schemes.</description>
