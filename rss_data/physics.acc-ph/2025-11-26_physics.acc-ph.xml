      <title>Mechanical Design of the PIP-II ORBUMP Pulsed Dipole Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Proton Improvement Plan II (PIP-II) project is a vital upgrade to the Fermilab accelerator complex. The magnet pulse rate of the PIP-II Injection system requires an increase from the current rate of 15 Hz to 20 Hz as well as a roughly 30% increase in the magnetic field of the new Orbital Bump (ORBUMP) pulsed dipole magnets in the Booster. The ORBUMP magnet mechanical design is presented in this paper. The ORBUMP magnet is secured in a vacuum box and the core is made up of 0.127 mm thick, low carbon steel laminations with a C-5 inorganic magnesium phosphate coating. The core is clamped using external tie bars welded to the core end plates. ANSYS Finite Element Analysis (FEA) was used to evaluate the clamping design to minimize the deflection of the core post welding of the tie bars. The water-cooled, single turn coil, which shapes the magnetic field by acting as the pole tips, is critical for the integrated field homogeneity. The coil manufacturing tolerances and fabrication techniques were evaluated to ensure the magnetic properties of the magnet could be obtained. The coil is electrically isolated from the core using virgin Polyether ether ketone (PEEK) insulating material in the gap. An investigation into the high voltage performance of the virgin PEEK insulator was conducted via partial discharge testing using a 1:1 scale sample.</description>

      <title>Analog Signal Multiplexing System for the Iota Proton Injector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) Facility at FNAL is a dedicated research and development center focused on advancing particle accelerator technologies for future applications worldwide. Currently, a key objective of FAST Operations is to commission the 2.5&amp;#8239;MeV IOTA Proton Injector (IPI) and enable proton injection into the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator (IOTA) storage ring. The low and medium-energy sections of the IPI include four frame-style dipole trims and two multi-function correctors with independently controlled coils, requiring readout of 32 analog channels for current and voltage monitoring in total. To reduce cost and optimize rack space within the PLC-based control system, a 32-to-4 analog signal multiplexing system was designed and implemented. This system enables real-time readback of excitation parameters from all magnetic correctors. This paper presents the design, construction, implementation, and performance of the multiplexing system.</description>

      <title>Beam Steering and Radiation Generation of Electrons in Bent Crystals in the Sub-GeV Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an investigation into beam steering and radiation emission by sub-GeV electrons traversing bent silicon crystals. Using 855, 600, and 300~MeV electron beams at the Mainz Microtron (MAMI), we explored orientational coherent effects and particle dynamics in a 15~$\mu$m-thick crystal bent along the (111) planes. Combined experimental and simulation analyses enabled the classification and quantitative assessment of the contributions from channeling, dechanneling, rechanneling, and volume capture to both beam deflection and radiation emission. Crystal steering remained effective even at 300~MeV, with measured channeling efficiencies exceeding 50\%, a record at such low energy. Channeling and volume reflection enhanced radiation emission by up to a factor of six compared to the misaligned orientation, highlighting strong orientational coherence effects in the sub-GeV regime. These findings confirm the feasibility of using bent crystals for efficient beam manipulation and high-intensity photon generation at low energies, supporting the development of novel light sources and beam control strategies at accelerator facilities operating in this energy range.</description>

      <title>Evaluating a Transition-jump System for the Fermilab Main Injector Using Xsuite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an Xsuite simulation framework for the Fermilab Main Injector (MI) along with an evaluation of transition-crossing behaviors in the accelerator. In particular, we studied the introduction of quadrupole magnets into the lattice as part of a transition-jump system that will be implemented through the $2^{nd}$ Proton Improvement Plan (PIP-II). Simulated beam losses spurred by transition-induced instabilities were assessed under several systematic effects, including MI quad errors, magnet-to-magnet variability in the jump magnets, power-supply errors, and timing jitter.</description>

      <title>Future Colliders Comparative Evaluation -- Working Group Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In anticipation of the completion of the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) programme by the end of 2041, CERN is preparing to launch a new major facility in the mid-2040s. According to the 2020 European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP), the highest-priority next collider is an electron-positron Higgs factory, followed in the longer term by a hadron-hadron collider at the highest achievable energy. The CERN directorate established a Future Colliders Comparative Evaluation working group in June 2023. This group brings together project leaders and domain experts to conduct a consistent evaluation of the Future Circular Collider (FCC) and alternative scenarios based on shared assumptions and standardized criteria. This report presents a comparative evaluation of proposed future collider projects submitted as input for the Update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. These proposals are compared considering main performance parameters, environmental impact and sustainability, technical maturity, cost of construction and operation, required human resources, and realistic implementation timelines. An overview of the international collider projects within a similar timeframe, notably the CEPC in China and the ILC in Japan is also presented, as well as a short review of the status and prospects of new accelerator techniques.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the Use of BPM Quadrupole Moments to Measure Emittance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the PIP-II program, transverse emittance in the Fermilab Booster must remain well controlled at higher bunch intensities. 4-plate beam position monitors (BPMs) have a small but measurable quadrupole moment, making it possible to infer transverse emittance. By compositing many BPMs together, it becomes possible to improve the quality of the quadrupole signal. The Fermilab Booster BPM system has been used to measure these quadrupole moments in the past year and derive emittances from them. Recent benchmarks show that the derived BPM emittances show similar emittance evolution and value to IPM and Multiwire data. This approach can both supplement and complement existing non-intercepting emittance monitors in accelerators.</description>

      <title>Knock Out Slow Extraction Using Betatron Sidebands at High Harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio frequency knock out resonant slow extraction is a standard method for extracting stored particle beams from synchrotrons by transverse excitation. Excitation signals comprising many betatron sidebands have shown to reduce intensity fluctuations of the extracted beam spill and are used at several facilities. In this contribution, the effect of individual sidebands at different harmonics on the spill quality is systematically studied using efficient noise excitation signals fully covering the respective sidebands. Particle tracking simulations show a clear correlation between the chosen excitation frequency and the spill quality. This relation is attributed to the spectrum of particle motion shortly before their extraction, and an empiric relation between the spectrum, the excitation frequency, and the resulting spill quality is given. Experiments show an additional reduction of pile-up when using higher excitation frequencies. These insights have implications for an optimal design of excitation waveforms and hardware for Knock Out extraction systems.</description>
