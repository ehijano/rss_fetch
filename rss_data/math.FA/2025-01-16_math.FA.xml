      <title>Transportation cost spaces and stochastic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study transportation cost spaces over finite metric spaces, also known as Lipschitz free spaces. Our work is motivated by a core problem posed by S. Dilworth, D. Kutzarova and M. Ostrovskii, namely, find a condition on a metric space $M$ equivalent to the Banach-Mazur distance between the transportation cost space over $M$ and $\ell_1^N$ of the corresponding dimension, which we call the $\ell_1^N$-distortion of $M$. In this regard, some examples have been studied like the $N\times N$ grid by Naor and Schechtman (2007) and the Laakso and diamond graphs by Dilworth, Kutzarova and Ostrovskii (2020), later studied by Baudier, Gartland and Schlumprecht (2023). We present here three main results. Firstly, we give a partial solution to this problem relating to the tree-like structure of the metric space. For that purpose, we develop a new technique that could potentially lead to a complete solution of the problem and utilize it to find an asymptotically tight upper bound of the $\ell_1^N$-distortion of the Laakso graphs, fully solving an open problem raised by Dilworth, Kutzarova and Ostrovskii. Finally, we apply our technique to prove that finite hyperbolic approximations of doubling metric spaces have uniformly bounded $\ell_1^N$-distortion.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Bourgain's circular maximal theorem and a local smoothing estimate on quantum Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a local smoothing estimate on two-dimensional quantum Euclidean space. This is the noncommutative analogue of the one due to Mockenhaupt$-$Seeger$-$Sogge \cite{MSS}. As an application and simultaneously one motivation, we obtain the noncommutative analogue of Bourgain's circular maximal theorem, resolving one problem after \cite{Hong}.</description>

      <title>Continuous Approach to Phase (Norm) Retrieval Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of continuous frames, with a particular focus on phase retrieval and norm retrieval in the context of Hilbert spaces. We introduce the concept of continuous near-Riesz bases and prove their invariance under invertible operators. Some equivalent conditions for phase and norm retrieval property of continuous frames are presented. We study the stability of phase retrieval under perturbations. Furthermore, tensor product frames for separable Hilbert spaces are studied, and we establish the equivalence of phase retrieval and norm retrieval properties between components and their tensor products.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Levenberg-Marquardt Method for Inverse Problem with H\"{o}lder Stability Estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze convergence of the Levenberg-Marquardt method for solving nonlinear inverse problems in Hilbert spaces. Specifically, we establish local convergence and convergence rates for a class of inverse problems that satisfy H\"{o}lder stability estimate. Furthermore, based on what we found in the mentioned analysis, we develop global reconstruction algorithms for solving inverse problems with finite measurements for exact and noisy data, respectively.</description>

      <title>Relationship between limiting K-spaces and J-spaces in the real interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper Description of the $K$-spaces by means of $J$-spaces and the reverse problem, Math. Nachr. 296 (2023), no. 9, 4002--4031, we have establish conditions under which the limiting $K$-space $(X_0,X_1)_{0,q,b;K}$, involving a slowly varying function $b$, can be described by means of the $J$-space $(X_0,X_1)_{0,q,a;J}$, with a convenient slowly varying function $a$, and we have also solved the reverse problem. It has been shown that if these conditions are not satisfied that the given problem may not have a solution.
  In this paper we assume that these conditions are not satisfied. Nevertheless, our aim is to express the limiting $K$-space $(X_0,X_1)_{0,q,b;K}$ as some limiting $J$-space $(Y_0,Y_1)_{0,q,A;J}$, and, similarly, to express the limiting $J$-space $(X_0,X_1)_{0,q,a;J}$ as a convenient limiting $K$-space $(Z_0,Z_1)_{0,q,B;K}$. To be more precise, we show that $$(X_0,X_1)_{0,q,b;K}=(X_0,X_0+X_1)_{0,q,A;J}=X_0+(X_0,X_1)_{0,q,A;J}$$ and $$(X_0,X_1)_{0,q,a;J}=(X_0,X_0\cap X_1)_{0,q,B;K}=X_0\cap (X_0,X_1)_{0,q,B;K},$$ where $A$ and $B$ are convenient weights. Moreover, we establish equivalent norms in the above mentioned spaces. The obtained results are applied to get density theorems for spaces in question.</description>

      <title>Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces on homogeneous groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a theory of Besov spaces $\dot{\mathbf{B}}^{\sigma}_{p,q} (N)$ and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces $\dot{\mathbf{F}}^{\sigma}_{p,q} (N)$ on an arbitrary homogeneous group $N$ for the full range of parameters $p, q \in (0, \infty]$ and $\sigma \in \mathbb{R}$. Among others, it is shown that these spaces are independent of the choice of the Littlewood-Paley decomposition and that they admit characterizations in terms of continuous maximal functions and molecular frame decompositions. The defined spaces include as special cases various classical function spaces, such as Hardy spaces on homogeneous groups and homogeneous Sobolev spaces and Lipschitz spaces associated to sub-Laplacians on stratified groups.</description>

      <title>$p$-Energy forms on fractals: recent progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we survey recent progress on self-similar $p$-energy forms on self-similar fractals, where $p\in(1,\infty)$. While for $p=2$ the notion of such forms coincides with that of self-similar Dirichlet forms and there have been plenty of studies on them since the late 1980s, studies on the case of $p\in(1,\infty)\setminus\{2\}$ was initiated much later in 2004 by Herman, Peirone and Strichartz [Potential Anal. 20 (2004), 125--148] and Strichartz and Wong [Nonlinearity 17 (2004), 595--616] and no essential progress on this case had been made since then until a few years ago. The recent progress by Kigami, Shimizu, Cao--Gu--Qiu and Murugan--Shimizu has established the existence of such $p$-energy forms on general post-critically finite (p.-c.f.) self-similar sets and on large classes of low-dimensional infinitely ramified self-similar sets, and the authors have proved further detailed properties of these forms and associated $p$-harmonic functions, mainly for p.-c.f. self-similar sets. This article is devoted to a review of these results, focusing on the most recent developments by the authors and illustrating them in the simplest non-trivial setting of the two-dimensional standard Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket.</description>

      <title>Dual Frame Completion Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the construction of an exact dual frame under specific structural assumptions posed on the dual frame. When given a frame $F$ for a finite dimensional Hilbert space, and a set of vectors $H$ that is assumed to be a subset of a dual frame of $F$, we answer the following question: Which dual frame $G$ for $F$ - if it exists - completes the given set $H$? Solutions are explored through a direct and an indirect approach, as well as via the singular value decomposition of the synthesis operator of $F$.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singular value decomposition is widely used in modal analysis, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and resolvent analysis, to extract key features from complex problems. SVD derivatives need to be computed efficiently to enable the large scale design optimization. However, for a general complex matrix, no method can accurately compute this derivative to machine precision and remain scalable with respect to the number of design variables without requiring the all of the singular variables. We propose two algorithms to efficiently compute this derivative based on the adjoint method and reverse automatic differentiation and RAD-based singular value derivative formula. Differentiation results for each method proposed were compared with FD results for one square and one tall rectangular matrix example and matched with the FD results to about 5 to 7 digits. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method by calculating the derivatives of singular values with respect to the snapshot matrix derived from the POD of a large dataset for a laminar-turbulent transitional flow over a flat plate, sourced from the John Hopkins turbulence database.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We completely characterize the bounded composition operators $C_\phi f=f\circ\phi$ on the Paley-Wiener spaces $B^2_{\sigma}$ for $\sigma&gt;0$ that are self-adjoint, unitary, cohyponormal, normal, complex symmetric and hypercyclic. Moreover, we show that if $\phi(0)\notin \mathbb{R}$ or $\phi(0)\in \mathbb{R}$ with $0&lt;|\phi(0)|\leq 1$ (for this case, $\sigma&lt;\pi$) then $C_{\phi}$ is cyclic on $B^2_{\sigma}.$</description>

Abstract: For every $p &gt; (1 + \sqrt{5})/2$ we construct a uniformly discrete real sequence $\{\lambda_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ satisfying $|\lambda_n| = n + o(1)$, a function $g \in L^p(\mathbb{R})$, and continuous linear functionals $\{g^*_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$ on $L^p(\mathbb{R})$, such that every $f \in L^p(\mathbb{R})$ admits a series expansion \[ f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} g_n^*(f) g(x-\lambda_n) \] convergent in the $L^p(\mathbb{R})$ norm. We moreover show that $g$ can be chosen nonnegative.</description>
