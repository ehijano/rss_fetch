      <title>Finitely Correlated States Driven by Topological Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\Omega, \P)$ be a standard probability space and let $\vartheta:\Omega \to \Omega$ be a measure preserving ergodic homeomorphism. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a $C^*$-algebra with a unit and let $\mathcal{A}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ be the quasi-local algebra associated to the spin chain with one-site algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Equip $\mathcal{A}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ with the group action of translation by $k$-units, $\tau_k\in Aut(\mathcal{A}_{\mathbb{Z}})$ for $k\in \mathbb{Z}$. We study the problem of finding a disordered matrix product state decomposition for disordered states $\psi(\omega)$ on $\mathcal{A}_{\mathbb{Z}}$ with the covariance symmetry condition $\psi(\omega) \circ \tau_k = \psi(\vartheta^k \omega)$. This can be seen as an ergodic generalization of the results of Fannes, Nachtergaele, and Werner \cite{FannesNachtergaeleWerner}. To reify our structure theory, we present a disordered state $\nu_\omega$ obtained by sampling the AKLT model \cite{AKLT} in parameter space. We go on to show that $\nu_\omega$ has a nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonian, its bulk spectral gap closes, but it has almost surely exponentially decaying correlations, and finally, that $\nu_\omega$ is time-reversal symmetry protected with a Tasaki index of $-1$.</description>

      <title>The rank two Jacobi algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic rank two Jacobi algebra is identified from the relations obeyed by the bispectral operators of the two variable Jacobi polynomials orthogonal on the triangle. It is seen to admit as subalgebras Racah and Jacobi algebras of rank one. The dual realizations in terms of differential operators in the variable representation and in terms of difference operators in the degree representation are provided. Structure relations for the two variable Jacobi polynomials are obtained as a by product.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel original procedure of encryption/decryption based on the polyadic algebraic structures and on signal processing methods is proposed. First, we use signals with integer amplitudes to send information. Then we use polyadic techniques to transfer the plaintext into series of special integers. The receiver restores the plaintext using special rules and systems of equations.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Quantum Field Theory in Anti-de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the framework of Quantum Field Theories in general backgrounds through the lens of the path integral, in the formulation known as the Functorial QFT. With the aim of studying properties of strongly coupled QFTs, we present key concepts and techniques such as the effective action, renormalization group flow, and the 1/N expansion.
  At the fixed points of the RG flow we typically find Conformal Field Theories, which are symmetric under local rescaling of the metric. Among other things, CFTs play a central role in the context of QFT in Anti-de Sitter spacetime, through what is known as the AdS/CFT correspondence.
  Finally, the developed formalism is applied to analyze the O(N) model in AdS at finite coupling. In particular, we focus on the non-singlet sector, which requires an understanding of crossed-channel diagram contributions to the s-channel conformal block decomposition.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Quantum Error Correction with Stabilizer Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give an introduction to the theory of quantum error correction using stabilizer codes that is geared towards the working computer scientists and mathematicians with an interest in exploring this area. To this end, we begin with an introduction to basic quantum computation for the uninitiated. We then construct several examples of simple error correcting codes without reference to the underlying mathematical formalism in order to develop the readers intuition for the structure of a generic code. With this in hand, we then discuss the more general theory of stabilizer codes and provide the necessary level of mathematical detail for the non-mathematician. Finally, we give a brief look at the elegant homological algebra formulation for topological codes. As a bonus, we give implementations of the codes we mention using OpenQASM, and we address the more recent approaches to decoding using neural networks. We do not attempt to give a complete overview of the entire field, but provide the reader with the level of detail needed to continue in this direction.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic bootstrap for RCFT: signs and bounds for quasi-characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-characters are solutions of simple modular differential equations that form an explicit basis for the space of all admissible characters that can potentially describe rational CFT. They were classified for rank-$2$ in arXiv:1810.09472 [hep-th], where it was conjectured that their $q$-series has coefficients of alternating sign that stabilise to a fixed sign at order $\frac{c}{12}$ and sometimes undergo more exotic behaviour -- where $c$ is the central charge. Here we prove some of these conjectures and estimate the growth of coefficients near the stabilisation point. We also explain what role the signs play in the construction of admissible characters from quasi-characters.</description>

      <title>Positive paths in diffeomorphism groups of manifolds with a contact distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a cooriented contact manifold $(M,\xi)$, it is possible to define a notion of positivity on the group $\mathrm{Diff}(M)$ of diffeomorphisms of $M$, by looking at paths of diffeomorphisms that are positively transverse to the contact distribution $\xi$. We show that, in contrast to the analogous notion usually considered on the group of diffeomorphisms preserving $\xi$, positivity on $\mathrm{Diff}(M)$ is completely flexible. In particular, we show that for the standard contact structure on $\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$ any two diffeomorphisms are connected by a positive path. This result generalizes to compactly supported diffeomorphisms on a large class of contact manifolds. As an application we answer a question about Legendrians in thermodynamic phase space posed by Entov, Polterovich and Ryzhik in the context of thermodynamic processes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems on torus related to general Heun equations: phase-lock areas and constriction breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The overdamped Josephson junction in superconductivity is modeled by a family of dynamical systems on two-dimensional torus: the so-called RSJ model. As was discovered by V.M.Buchstaber and S.I.Tertychnyi, this family admits an equivalent description by a family of second order differential equations: special double confluent Heun equations. In the present paper we construct two new families of dynamical systems on torus that can be equivalently described by a family of general Heun equations (GHE), with four singular points, and confluent Heun equations, with three singular points. The first family, related to GHE, is a deformation of the RSJ model, which will be denoted by dRSJ. The {\it phase-lock areas} of a family of dynamical systems on torus are those level subsets of the rotation number function that have non-empty interiors. For the RSJ model, V.M.Buchstaber, O.V.Karpov and S.I.~Tertychnyi discovered the Rotation Number Quantization Effect: phase-lock areas exist only for integer rotation number values. As was shown by A.V.~Klimenko and O.L.~Romaskevich, each phase-lock area is a chain of domains separated by points. Those separation points that do not lie in the abscissa axis are called {\it constrictions}. In the present paper we study phase-lock areas in the new family dRSJ. The Quantization Effect remains valid in this family. On the other hand, we show that in the new family dRSJ the constrictions break down.</description>

      <title>Anomaly diagnosis via symmetry restriction in two-dimensional lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a method for computing the anomaly of any finite unitary symmetry group $G$ acting by finite-depth quantum circuits on a two-dimensional lattice system. The anomaly is characterized by an index valued in the cohomology group $H^4(G,U(1))$, which generalizes the Else-Nayak index for locality preserving symmetries of quantum spin chains. We show that a nontrivial index precludes the existence of a trivially gapped symmetric Hamiltonian; it is also an obstruction to ``onsiteability" of the symmetry action. We illustrate our method via a simple example with $G=\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$. Finally, we provide a diagrammatic interpretation of the anomaly formula which hints at a higher categorical structure.</description>

      <title>The equilibrium distribution function for strongly nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equilibrium distribution function determines macroscopic observables in statistical physics. While conventional methods correct equilibrium distributions in weakly nonlinear or near-integrable systems, they fail in strongly nonlinear regimes. We develop a framework to get the equilibrium distributions and dispersion relations in strongly nonlinear many-body systems, incorporating corrections beyond the random phase approximation and capturing intrinsic nonlinear effects. The theory is verified on the nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak model, and the FPUT-beta model, demonstrating its accuracy across distinct types of nonlinear systems. Numerical results show substantial improvements over existing approaches, even in strong nonlinear regimes. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for equilibrium statistical properties in strongly nonlinear systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Saito theory associates to an isolated singularity rich structure that plays an important role in mirror symmetry. In this note we construct Saito theory for A and D type Landau--Ginzburg orbifolds. Namely, for the pairs $(f,G)$, where $f$ defines an isolated singularity of A and D type and $G$ is a group of symmetries of $f$. In total we consider five families of such pairs. In particular, we construct the orbifold versions of Brieskorn lattice and the Gauss--Manin connection computing them explicitly for the A and D type Landau--Ginzburg orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Genus zero Whitham hierarchy via Hurwitz--Frobenius manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: B. Dubrovin introduced the structure of a Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold on a space of ramified coverings of a sphere by a genus $g$ Riemann surface with the prescribed ramification profile. This is now known as a genus $g$ Hurwitz--Frobenius manifold. We investigate the genus zero Hurwitz--Frobenius manifolds and their connection to the integrable hierarchies. In particular, we prove that the Frobenius potentials of the genus zero Hurwitz--Frobenius manifolds stabilize and therefore define an infinite system of commuting PDEs. We show that this system of PDEs is equivalent to the genus zero Whitham hierarchy of I. Krichever. Our result shows that this system of PDEs has both Fay form, depending heavily on the flat structure fo the Hurwitz--Frobenius manifold and coordinatefree Lax form. We also show how to extend this system of PDEs to the multicomponent KP hierarchy via the $\hbar$--deformation of the differential operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study multi-species stochastic interacting particle systems and their mean-field McKean-Vlasov partial differential equations (PDEs) in non-convex landscapes. We discuss the well-posedness of the multi-species SDE system, propagation of chaos and the derivation of the coupled McKean-Vlasov PDE system in the mean field limit. Our focus is on the long-time and asymptotic behaviour of the mean-field PDEs. Under suitable growth assumptions on the potentials and an appropriate structural assumption, we show the existence and (non-) uniqueness of stationary solutions and study their linear stability. Under a symmetry assumption we construct a free-energy functional that plays the role of a Lyapunov function for the mean-field PDE system. Furthermore, we prove the existence of a phase transition at low noise strengths and establish the convergence of solutions to the mean-field PDEs (and of their free energy) to a stationary state (and the corresponding free energy).</description>

      <title>Trapped string states in AdS$_5$ black hole geometry: A path toward Hawking radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of a closed bosonic string in the curved spacetime of an AdS$_5$-Schwarzschild black hole. Starting from the Polyakov action, we perform a canonical quantization of the string and formulate its quantum mechanical equation of motion in the Schr\"odinger (string coordinate) representation. This framework facilitates in obtaining quantum mechanical wave equation governing the radial and angular modes of the string. A central result of our analysis is the emergence of a trapping radius in the exterior region of the black hole. Near this radius, the radial motion of the string is governed by an effective potential that supports small, quantized oscillations, akin to a quantum harmonic oscillator. This behavior indicates a localization of the string at the trapping surface, where it becomes dynamically confined. The angular sector of the wave function is found to be governed by the confluent Heun equation, yielding confluent Heun functions as the angular part of the wave function. The emergence of a trapping surface is analogous to the stretched horizon proposed by Susskind in the context of black hole complementarity. The quantized harmonic oscillation of the string at the trapping radius complements with the Planck's black body whence the string can emit black-body radiation. Thus, the quantum dynamics of strings in black hole spacetimes offers a novel path to probing the quantum origin of Hawking radiation.</description>

Using a splitting of $q[t,t^{-1}]^{\theta}$, we construct $\theta$-twisted Poisson-commutative versions of the Feigin--Frenkel centre and the universal Gaudin subalgebra introduced by Ilin and Rybnikov in 2021.</description>

Abstract: We study cubic differentials and their spectral networks on Riemann surfaces, focusing on the polynomial case on the Riemann sphere. We introduce the notion of spectral core as the primary tool for our study, refining the classical notion of core in the theory of flat surfaces, and show that it controls the birthing process of spectral network trajectories. As an application, we completely characterize the polynomial cubic differentials having saddle connections or critical tripods when the degree $d$ is at most $3$; in particular, we obtain the relevant degenerations as the phase is varied and determine explicitly the wall-and-chamber structure. In this case, we obtain the BPS structure according to Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke's algorithm, and verify that it satisfies the Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formula. In physics language, this corresponds to computing the BPS spectrum of a certain four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ quantum field theory, known as the $(A_{2},A_{d-1})$ generalized Argyres-Douglas theory.</description>

      <title>From spatial to null infinity: Connecting initial data to peeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymptotic structure of space-time is studied by imposing conditions on the asymptotics of the metric. These conditions are weak enough to include large classes of physically relevant isolated space-times, but have a rich enough structure to be able to define important physically meaningful quantities like mass, angular momentum, and gravitational waves.
  By using a unified expansion of the metric in a neighborhood of spatial infinity that includes a piece of null infinity, we connect the asymptotic expansions of solutions to Einstein's equations in the different asymptotic regimes. Within the class of space-times under consideration, we find a connection between the peeling properties of the Weyl scalars and symmetries of initial data near spatial infinity. In particular, we show that for initial data that to leading order is symmetric under parity + time reversal, $\Psi_2$ has the usual $1/r^3$ fall-off rate at null infinity. If, in addition, the subleading part of the data is antisymmetric under parity + time reversal, then $\Psi_1$ has the usual $1/r^4$ fall-off rate at future null infinity.</description>

      <title>Variational formulations of transport on combinatorial meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09443v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop analogues of the primal and mixed variational formulations of the conservation laws describing transport of scalar physical properties for topological spaces referred to as cell complexes. The development is restricted to cell complexes with cells having connectivity of simple polytopes. Such spaces are suitable representations of physical systems composed of elements of different apparent topological dimensions, where all elements might have individual properties, and elements of a given dimension might interact via common elements of lower dimensions. This modelling foundation can be considered as intermediate between the foundation for particle-based modelling, which is the discrete topology, and the foundation for continuum modelling, which is the smooth topology. The new foundation offers advantages for the analysis of the behaviour of physical systems with complex internal structures. The development is based on a calculus with combinatorial differential forms which is a discrete analogue of the smooth exterior calculus with differential forms. We call the resulting calculus combinatorial mesh calculus (CMC) as it is based on combinatorial meshes, for which embedding is forgotten and only the connectivity between cells and measures of the cells are used in calculations. We discuss how the obtained formulation is specialised for several different problems, including mass diffusion, heat conduction, fluid flow in porous media, and charge diffusion, and provide details about the formulation of initial boundary value problems for these transport cases. Examples and results for selected boundary value problems are given to demonstrate the capabilities of the CMC formulations.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and Limit Theorems for $q$-step walks on random graphs of long-range percolation radius model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11667v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study cumulants of numbers of $q$-step walks on Erd\"os-R\'enyi-type random graphs of long-range percolation radius model in the limit when the number of vertices $N$, concentration $c$, and the interaction radius $R$ tend to infinity. These cumulants can be associated with a formal cumulant expansion of the free energy of matrix models of exponential random graphs widely known in mathematical and theoretical physics.
  We show that in three different asymptotic regimes, the limiting values of $k$-th cumulants ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ exist and can be associated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for $q$-step non-closed walks and $c^2R/N^2$ for 3-step closed walks, respectively. In certain cases, we obtain ${\cal F}_k^{(q)}$ in explicit form.
  These results allow us to prove Limit Theorems for the number of non-closed walks and for the number of triangles in corresponding ensembles of large random graphs. As a consequence, we indicate an asymptotic regime when in random graphs that we consider, the average vertex degree remains bounded while the total number of triangles infinitely increases, thus rigorously solving a graph collapse problem known in applications.</description>

      <title>On Marginal Stability in Low Temperature Spherical Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show marginal stability of near-ground states in spherical spin glasses is equivalent to full replica symmetry breaking at zero temperature near overlap $1$. This connection has long been implicit in the physics literature, which also links marginal stability to the performance of efficient algorithms. For even models, we prove the Hessian has no outlier eigenvalues, and obtain geometric consequences for low temperature Gibbs measures in the case that marginal stability is absent. Our proofs rely on interpolation bounds for vector spin glass models. For generic models, we give another more conceptual argument that full RSB near overlap $1$ implies marginal stability at low temperature.</description>

      <title>Interacting phantom dark energy: new accelerating scaling attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed investigation of interacting phantom cosmology, by applying the powerful method of dynamical system analysis. We consider two well-studied interaction forms, namely one global and one local one, while the novel ingredient of our work is the examination of new potentials for the phantom field. Our analysis shows the existence of saddle matter-dominated points, stable dark-energy dominated points, and scaling accelerating solutions, that can attract the Universe at late times. As we show, some of the stable accelerating scaling attractors, in which dark matter and dark energy can co-exist, alleviating the cosmic coincidence problem, are totally new, even for the previously studied interaction rates, and arise purely from the novel potential forms.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Stabilizer entropies of random bipartite pure quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19261v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between non-stabilizerness and entanglement in random states is a very rich arena of study for the understanding of quantum advantage and complexity. In this work, we tackle the problem of such interplay in random pure quantum states. We show that while there is a strong dependence between entanglement and magic, they are, surprisingly, perfectly uncorrelated. We compute the expectation value of non-stabilizerness given the Schmidt spectrum (and thus entanglement). At a first approximation, entanglement determines the average magic on the Schmidt orbit. However, there is a finer structure in the average magic distinguishing different orbits where the flatness of entanglement spectrum is involved.</description>

      <title>Nonmodal amplitude equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider fluid flows for which the linearized Navier-Stokes operator is strongly non-normal. The responses of such flows to external perturbations are spanned by a generically very large number of non-orthogonal eigenmodes. They are therefore qualified as ``nonmodal" responses, to insist on the inefficiency of the eigenbasis to describe them. In the aim of the article to reduce the system to a lower-dimensional one free of spatial degrees of freedom, (eigen)modal reduction techniques, such as the center manifold, are thus inappropriate precisely because the leading-order dynamics cannot be restricted to a low-dimensional eigensubspace. On the other hand, it is often true that only a small number (we assume only one) of singular modes is sufficient to reconstruct the nonmodal responses at the leading order. By adopting the latter paradigm, we propose a general method to analytically derive a weakly nonlinear amplitude equation for the nonmodal response of a fluid flow to a small harmonic forcing, stochastic forcing, and initial perturbation, respectively. In these last two problems, we assumed a parallel base flow with a spatially monochromatic external excitation. The present approach is simpler than the one we previously proposed and provides an explicit treatment of the sub-optimal responses. The derived amplitude equations are tested in three distinct flows. For sufficiently small excitation amplitudes, yet up to values large enough for the flow to depart from the linear regime, they can systematically predict the weakly nonlinear modification of the gains as the amplitude of the external excitation is increased. However, the proposed approach condemns the flow spatial structure to be mostly along the leading singular mode, and thus is often too simplistic to predict the occurrence of subcritical transitions as the excitation amplitude is increased to too large values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by parallel developments in coarse geometry in mathematics and exact macroscopic quantization in physics, we present a family of general trace formulae which are universally quantized and depend only on large-scale geometric features of the input data. They generalize, to arbitrary dimensions, formulae found by Roe in his partitioned manifold index theorem, as well as the Kubo and Kitaev formulae for 2D Hall conductance used in physics.</description>
