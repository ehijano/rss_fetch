      <title>AI-Based Regional Emulation for Kilometer-Scale Dynamical Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An AI-based Limited-Area Model (LAM) is developed for dynamical downscaling over the Southern Great Plains and the southeastern United States, with strong generalization abilities under diverse boundary conditions. The model is trained using 0.25-degree, 3-hourly ERA5 as forcings and CONUS404 as targets in 1980--2019, producing 4-km, hourly dynamical downscaling outputs; it is also connected to a post-processing model to derive additional diagnostic variables. The model is evaluated across multiple forcing datasets, time periods, and climate regimes. For present-day downscaling in the 2021--2024 water years, the model produces stable multi-year simulations with no unrealistic drift; its deterministic verification scores are comparable to other weather-forecasting-oriented AI models. The model also generalizes robustly to a 1.0-degree, 6-hourly non-ERA5 forcing dataset, yielding only minor performance changes. Frontal cyclone and hurricane case studies further demonstrate that the model reconstructs realistic, interpretable weather-scale dynamical and thermodynamic structure from coarse boundary information. The AI-based LAM is further tested by downscaling 30-year global climate model runs in 1980--2010 and 2070--2100, and climate model ensembles in 2025-2027. In this application, the model remains stable at hourly downscaling frequencies for all 30 years and effectively captures future climate-change signals, indicating meaningful generalization across different climate regimes. When downscaling ensembles, the model produces well-posed ensemble distributions without collapsing the ensemble spread. Overall, the AI-based LAM of this study offers good downscaling performance and generalization abilities. It provides a practical and transferable example of adapting AI weather prediction models for regional climate applications.</description>

      <title>Chlorophyll-a Mapping and Prediction in the Mar Menor Lagoon Using C2RCC-Processed Sentinel 2 Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mar Menor, Europe's largest hypersaline coastal lagoon, located in southeastern Spain, has undergone severe eutrophication crises, with devastating impacts on biodiversity and water quality. Monitoring chlorophyll-a, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, is essential to anticipate harmful algal blooms and guide mitigation strategies. Traditional in situ measurements, while precise, are spatially and temporally limited. Satellite-based approaches provide a more comprehensive view, enabling scalable and long-term monitoring. This study aims to overcome limitations of chlorophyll monitoring, often restricted to surface estimates or limited temporal coverage, by developing a reliable methodology to predict and map chlorophyll-a concentrations across the water column of the Mar Menor. This work integrates Sentinel 2 imagery with buoy-based ground truth to create models capable of high-resolution, depth-specific monitoring, enhancing early-warning capabilities for eutrophication. Sentinel 2 images were atmospherically corrected using C2RCC processors. Buoy data were aggregated by depth. Multiple ML algorithms, including CatBoost, XGBoost, SVMs, and MLPs, were trained and validated using a cross-validation scheme with multi-objective optimization functions. Band-combination experiments and spatial aggregation strategies were tested to optimize prediction. The results show depth-dependent performance. The Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) obtained ranges from 0.34 at the surface to 0.39 at 3-4 m, while the R2 value was 0.76 at the surface, 0.76 at 1-2 m, 0.70 at 2-3 m, and 0.60 at 3-4 m. Generated maps successfully reproduced known eutrophication events. The study delivers an end-to-end, validated methodology chlorophyll mapping. Its integration of multispectral band combinations, buoy calibration, and modeling offers a transferable framework for other turbid coastal systems.</description>
