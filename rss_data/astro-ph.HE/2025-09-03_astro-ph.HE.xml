      <title>A generalized study of linear electromagnetic cascades in astrophysical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy gamma rays can trigger electromagnetic cascades via pair production on ambient photons, reprocessing their energy to lower frequencies. A classic example is the cascade from the gamma rays produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in extragalactic photon fields, whose universal spectral shape was first described by Berezinsky in the 1970s. Recently, internal cascades, developing within the gamma-ray sources themselves, have gained a prominent role, as the IceCube data suggest that most detected neutrinos originate in gamma-ray-opaque environments. We analyze under what conditions these internal cascades can approach a universal spectrum. Since the Berezinsky treatment breaks down if synchrotron losses dominate, we present a generalized theory incorporating synchrotron-dominated cascades. We show the emergence of universal cascade spectrum among various examples of high-energy sources containing non-thermal cosmic rays, and discuss the conditions for its appearance.</description>

      <title>Very Massive, Rapidly Spinning Binary Black Hole Progenitors through Chemically Homogeneous Evolution -- The Case of GW231123</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the over 200 gravitational wave detections reported so far, GW231123 is a remarkable event that not only holds the record for the most massive black hole merger, but also exhibits extreme spins. Its origin is actively debated. Proposed scenarios include dynamical formation involving a sequence of mergers, Population III stars, accretion in an AGN disk and also more exotic explanations including primordial black holes and cosmic strings, each facing different challenges. Recent work showed that the incoming black holes of GW231123 can be formed out of massive rapidly rotating collapsing helium stars. Here, we address the question how such very massive rapidly rotating helium stars can be formed in very close binary systems. For this we explore chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) involving progenitors with masses above the pair-instability mass gap. We compute a grid of detailed massive binary models with the stellar evolution code MESA to follow the early evolution of binary progenitors and show that: (i) very massive ($M_i &gt; 140\, M_\odot$) CHE binaries at low metallicity ($Z=10^{-5}$) naturally produce rapidly rotating progenitors with high masses and high spins matching the properties of the black holes in GW231123 and (ii) the maximum spin of the progenitors is bound by their critical rotation rate leading to a tight correlation between the dimensionless spin and mass, $a \propto M^{-0.9}$, in models that have no hydrogen left. We conclude that the CHE channel appears to be a viable and natural scenario to produce progenitors. We compare and discuss the differences with earlier studies and comment on the large uncertainties in the final fate and collapse.</description>

      <title>Nonradial oscillations of stratified neutron stars with solid crusts: Mode characterization and tidal resonances in coalescing binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical tides of neutron stars in the late stages of binary inspirals provide a viable probe into dense matter through gravitational waves, and potentially trigger electromagnetic precursors. We model the tidal response as a set of driven harmonic oscillators, where the natural frequencies are given by the quasinormal modes of a nonrotating neutron star. These modes are calculated in general relativity by applying linear perturbation theory to stellar models that include a solid crust and compositional stratification. For the mode spectrum, we find that the canonical interface mode associated with the crust-core boundary vanishes in stratified neutron stars and is replaced by compositional gravity modes with mixed gravity-interfacial character, driven primarily by strong buoyancy in the outer core. We also find that fluid modes such as the core gravity mode and the fundamental mode can penetrate the crust, and we establish a criterion for such penetration. Regarding the tidal interaction, we find that transfer of binding energy to oscillations is dominated by the fundamental mode despite its frequency being too high to resonate with the tidal forcing. In general, we find that lower-frequency modes induce gravitational-wave phase shifts smaller than $\sim 10^{-3},\rm rad$ for the equation of state we consider. We discover that nonresonant fundamental and crustal shear modes can trigger crust breaking already near the first gravity-mode resonance, while gravity-mode resonance concentrates strain at the base of the crust and may marginally crack it. These results suggest that both resonant and nonresonant excitations can overstress the crust and may channel energy into the magnetosphere prior to merger, potentially powering electromagnetic precursors. Our work represents an important step toward realistic modeling of dynamical tides of neutron stars in multimessenger observations.</description>

      <title>Multi-messengers from the radioactive decay of $r$-process nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radioactive $\beta$-decay of nuclei synthesized in the rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process) releases a variety of particles, including electrons, $\gamma$-rays, neutrinos, and neutrons. These particles provide a rich set of multi-messenger signals that carry information about the astrophysical environments where neutron-rich nucleosynthesis occurs. In this work, we calculate from first principles the emission spectra resulting from the $\beta$-decay of $r$-process nuclei. Our approach incorporates detailed nuclear structure and decay data to model the energy distributions of each particle species. We couple the spectra with a nuclear reaction network simulation to obtain the temporal evolution of these distributions. We find that the emission distributions vary significantly in time and are non-thermal, with substantial average energies. We investigate these nuclear signals as a direct probe of heavy element formation and show that they are complementary observables to kilonova.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study the structure of the strange stars admixed
  with bosonic dark matter, and find that these stars can well explain
  the mass and radius observations of XTE J1814-338. We also find that
  for the strong interaction coupling constant $\alpha_{S}=0.6$ and
  $B^{1/4}=135$ MeV ($B$ is the bag constant), the observations of XTE
  J1814-338 constrain the mass of the bosonic dark matter to
  $m_{\chi}\leq 307 (\lambda /\pi)^{1/4}$ MeV ($\lambda$ is the
  dimensionless coupling constant of the bosonic dark matter).</description>

      <title>The Most Luminous Known Fast Blue Optical Transient AT 2024wpp: Unprecedented Evolution and Properties in the Ultraviolet to the Near-Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extensive photometric and spectroscopic ultraviolet-optical-infrared campaign on the luminous fast blue optical transient (LFBOT) AT 2024wpp over the first ~100 d. AT 2024wpp is the most luminous LFBOT discovered to date, with $L_{\rm{pk}}\approx(2-4)\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (5-10 times that of the prototypical AT 2018cow). This extreme luminosity enabled the acquisition of the most detailed LFBOT UV light curve thus far. In the first ~45 d, AT 2024wpp radiated $&gt;10^{51}$ erg, surpassing AT 2018cow by an order of magnitude and requiring a power source beyond the radioactive $^{56}$Ni decay of traditional supernovae. Like AT 2018cow, the UV-optical spectrum of AT 2024wpp is dominated by a persistently blue thermal continuum throughout our monitoring, with blackbody parameters at peak of T&gt;30,000 K and $R_{\rm{BB}}/t\approx0.2-0.3c$. A temperature of $\gtrsim$20,000 K is maintained thereafter without evidence for cooling. We interpret the featureless spectra as a consequence of continuous energy injection from a central source of high-energy emission which maintains high ejecta ionization. After 35 d, faint (equivalent width &lt;10 {\AA}) H and He spectral features with kinematically separate velocity components centered at 0 km s$^{-1}$ and -6400 km s$^{-1}$ emerge, implying spherical symmetry deviations. A near-infrared excess of emission above the optical blackbody emerges between 20-30 d with a power-law spectrum $F_{\rm\nu,NIR}\propto\nu^{-0.3}$ at 30 d. We interpret this distinct emission component as either reprocessing of early UV emission in a dust echo or free-free emission in an extended medium above the optical photosphere. LFBOT asphericity and multiple outflow components (including mildly relativistic ejecta) together with the large radiated energy are naturally realized by super-Eddington accretion disks around neutron stars or black holes and their outflows.</description>

      <title>The Most Luminous Known Fast Blue Optical Transient AT 2024wpp: Unprecedented Evolution and Properties in the X-rays and Radio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present X-ray (0.3--79 keV) and radio (0.25--203 GHz) observations of the most luminous Fast Blue Optical Transient (LFBOT) AT\,2024wpp at $z=0.0868$, spanning 2--280 days after first light. AT 2024wpp shows luminous ($L_{\rm X} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{43}\, \rm erg\,s^{-1}$), variable X-ray emission with a Compton hump peaking at $\delta t \approx 50$ days. The X-ray spectrum evolves from a soft ($F_{\nu} \propto \nu^{-0.6}$) to an extremely hard state ($F_{\nu} \propto \nu^{1.26}$) accompanied by a re-brightening at $\delta t \approx 50$\,days. The X-ray emission properties favor an embedded high-energy source shining through asymmetric expanding ejecta. We detect radio emission peaking at $L_{\rm 9\,GHz} \approx 1.7 \times 10^{29}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}$ at $\delta t \approx 73$ days. The spectral evolution is unprecedented: the early millimeter fluxes rise nearly an order of magnitude during $\delta t \approx 17-32$ days followed by a decline in spectral peak fluxes. We model the radio emission as synchrotron radiation from an expanding blast wave interacting with a dense environment ($\dot{M} \sim 10^{-3}\, \rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$ for $v_{\rm w} = 1000\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$). The inferred outflow velocities increase from $\Gamma \beta c \approx 0.07\, \rm to\,0.42c$ during $\delta t \approx 32-73$ days, indicating an accelerating blast-wave. We interpret these observations as a shock propagating through a dense shell of radius $\approx 10^{16}$\,cm, then accelerating into a steep density profile $\rho_{\rm CSM}(r) \propto r^{-3.1}$. All radio-bright LFBOTs exhibit similar circumstellar medium (CSM) density profiles ($\rho_{\rm CSM} \propto r^{-3}$), suggesting similar progenitor processes. The X-ray and radio properties favor a progenitor involving super-Eddington accretion onto a compact object launching mildly-relativistic disk-wind outflows.</description>

      <title>Imaging the positron annihilation line with 20-year INTEGRAL/SPI observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The e$^+$ e$^-$ annihilation line at 511 keV provides a unique probe for studying the distribution and origin of positrons in our Galaxy. The SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL has observed this gamma-ray line for two decades. We analyze 20 years of INTEGRAL/SPI observations to produce the most sensitive all-sky map of the 511 keV line emission to date, aiming to reveal new features and provide refined measurements of known sources. We perform image deconvolution using the RL algorithm and employ bootstrap analysis to evaluate statistical uncertainties of fluxes from regions of interest. Systematic uncertainties in parameter choices are also considered. We utilize GPU acceleration to enable this computationally intensive analysis. The reconstructed image successfully recovers the basic morphological features reported in model-fitting studies: a bright central component, a broad bulge, and an elongated disk component along the Galactic plane. We also report hints of new spatial features in the reconstructed image, including an asymmetric structure in the broad bulge emission and 511 keV emission potentially associated with massive stars from the Sco-Cen and other OB associations. While the significance of these new features is marginal ($\sim 2\sigma$), they are spatially consistent with $^{26}$Al emission from massive stars in that region, suggesting that this 511 keV emission originates from its $\beta^{+}$ decay. Our 20-year dataset provides the most detailed 511 keV emission map to date, reproducing global structures suggested in model-fitting approach while revealing hints of new spatial features. These findings provide insights into the origin of Galactic positrons and propagation of low-energy positrons in the interstellar medium. Future MeV gamma-ray observations, such as COSI, are expected to confirm the reported features and shed further light on the nature of positrons in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>$w$-mode oscillation of neutron star in a new relativistic hybrid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the pulsation frequencies of axial gravitational-wave modes ($w$-modes) in a non-rotating neutron star depend on its composition, particularly when including quarkyonic matter and fermionic dark matter. These modes emerge from the coupling between the star's fluid component and the gravitational field of general relativity, which are highly damped and characterized by complex frequencies with comparable real and imaginary parts. Using a relativistic mean field formalism for the nucleonic component, we modeled the neutron star's interior, while the exterior is analyzed through the complex-coordinate method to determine the $w$-modes. Our study employs a realistic equation of state, based on different physical assumptions and covering a broad area of observational constraints, starting from finite nuclei to nuclear matter with extreme conditions. The numerical findings demonstrate that axial $w$-modes provide valuable insights into the properties of neutron star matter, highlighting their significance in probing the star's internal structure.</description>

      <title>Magnetar Outburst Models with Cooling Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetar outbursts are among the most noteworthy manifestations of magnetism in neutron stars. They are episodes in which the X-ray luminosity of a strongly magnetised neutron star swiftly rises by several orders of magnitude to then decay over the course of several months. In this work, we present simulations of outbursts as a consequence of localised heat deposition in a magnetised neutron star crust, and the subsequent surface cooling. In particular, we employed a magnetothermal evolution code adapted to the study of short-term phenomena; that is, one including in its integration domain the outer layers of the star, where heat diffusion is faster. This choice entailed the development and use of heat blanketing envelope models that are thinner than those found in the literature as the surface boundary ondition. We find that such envelopes can support a higher surface temperature than the thicker ones (albeit for less time), which can account for the typical luminosities observed in outbursts even when coming from small hotspots (few km in radius). We study several parameters related to the energetics and geometry of the heating region, concluding that the cooling of a crustal hotspot found in the outer part of the crust can account for the luminosity evolution observed in outbursts both in terms of peak luminosity and timescales. Finally, we discuss the key observables that must be studied in future observations to better constrain the nature of the underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Natal kicks of compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When compact objects -- neutron stars and black holes -- are formed in a supernova explosion, they may receive a high velocity at formation, which may reach or even exceed $\approx{1000}$~km~s$^{-1}$ for neutron stars and hundreds of km~s$^{-1}$ for black holes. The origin of the kick is intimately related to supernova physics. A better understanding of kick properties from astronomical observations will shed light on the unsolved problems of these explosions, such as the exact conditions leading to exotic electron capture and ultra-stripped supernovae.
  Compact object kicks are profoundly important in several areas of astrophysics. First, being a result of supernova explosions, the kick velocity distribution must be explained in the framework of the supernova mechanism. Second, the kick magnitudes and directions influence many aspects of the evolution of binary systems, including the rate of compact object coalescences observable through gravitational waves. Third, the evolution of isolated neutron stars depends on their spatial velocities relative to the surrounding medium. Finally, knowledge of the kick velocity distribution is significant in predicting future observational results and their interpretation. For example, it is expected that the Roman space telescope will discover many microlensing events related to neutron stars and black holes; accurate estimates require precise kinematic properties of these compact objects.</description>

      <title>Studying the black widow pulsars PSR J0312$-$0921 and PSR J1627$+$3219 in the optical and X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. PSR J0312$-$0921 and PSR J1627$+$3219 are black widow pulsars with orbital periods of 2.34 and 3.98 hours. They were recently detected in the radio and $\gamma$-rays. Aims. Our goals are to estimate the fundamental parameters of both binary systems and their components. Methods. We performed first phase-resolved multi-band photometry of both objects with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias and fitted the obtained light curves with a model assuming direct heating of the companion by the pulsar. Archival X-ray data obtained with the Swift and XMM-Newton observatories were also analysed. Results. For the first time, we firmly identified both systems in the optical. Their optical light curves show a rather symmetric single peak per orbital period and a peak-to-peak amplitude of $\gtrsim$2 mag. We also identified the X-ray counterpart to J1627$+$3219, while for J0312$-$0921 we set an upper limit on the X-ray flux. Conclusions. We estimated the masses of the pulsars, companion temperatures and masses, Roche lobe filling factors, orbital inclinations, and the distances to both systems. PSR J0312$-$0921 has a very light ($\approx$0.02 M$_\odot$) companion which possibly has one of the lowest ($\approx$1600 K) `night-side' temperatures among the known black widow systems. We found that the distances to J0312$-$0921 and J1627$+$3219 are about 2.5 and 4.6 kpc, respectively. This likely explains their faintness in X-rays. The X-ray spectrum of PSR J1627$+$3219 can be described by the power-law model, and its parameters are compatible with those obtained for other black widows.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Periodic Eruptions as a Probe of Accretion Disk in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are X-ray transients characterized by nearly regular recurring flares from galactic nuclei. Recent observations have confirmed that some QPEs occur in galactic centers that experienced a tidal disruption event (TDE) a few years earlier. This may be reasonably explained if QPEs are produced when a star orbiting a supermassive black hole passes through an accretion disk formed by the TDE. Based on this scenario, we investigate the expected QPE signatures in the early stages of TDEs, taking into account the time evolution of the accretion disk. In the early phase, the disk is in a super-Eddington accretion state. The interaction between the star and such a slim disk results in QPEs with durations of $\sim 100-1000\,{\rm s}$ and temperatures of $\sim 1-100\,{\rm keV}$, which are significantly shorter and hotter than those of the currently detected QPE population. These events are detectable with current X-ray telescopes, but their small duty cycle ($\lesssim1\,\%$) and the potential presence of a massive disk wind may make detection challenging. We encourage early-time and long-term monitoring TDEs showing X-rays to capture these QPEs, as such detections would provide valuable insights into the disk formation process in TDEs.</description>

      <title>LOFAR constraints on the repetition &amp; environments of CHIME FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behaviour of fast radio bursts (FRBs) at radio frequencies &lt;400 MHz is not well understood due to very few detections, with only two known sources detected below 300 MHz. Characterising low-frequency emission of FRBs is vital for understanding FRB emission mechanisms and circumburst environments. We robustly characterise the 150 MHz activity CHIME-detected FRB sources relative to their 600 MHz activity -- using their non-detection in 473 h of archival observations from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Tied-Array All-Sky Survey (LOTAAS), and 252 h of LOFAR observations of 14 repeating FRB sources, the largest sub-300 MHz targeted FRB campaign to date.
  In the LOTAAS data, we search for repeat bursts from 33 CHIME/FRB repeaters, 10 candidate repeaters and 430 apparent non-repeaters. Their non-detection yields a population-level constraint on the statistical spectral index $\alpha_{s, 150MHz/600MHz}&gt;-0.9$, indicating that FRB spectral indices are, on average, flatter than known spectral indices from pulsars. From the targeted campaign, we find that the prolific repeater FRB 20201124A shows a positive $\alpha_s&gt;0.55$, implying reduced low-frequency activity, unlike the typically negative $\alpha_{s}$ seen from FRBs at higher frequency bands. We explore free-free absorption in the circumburst environment as a cause of the non-detection at 150 MHz. The non-detection of FRB 20201124A is consistent with either a very young $\sim10$ yr old supernova remnant, or a typical HII region.
  Our simulations indicate that LOFAR2.0 can detect 0.3-9 FRBs per week, and up to 4 FRBs at redshifts in the range $1&lt;z&lt;3$. Such detections will provide robust constraints on cosmological parameters due to their clean environments. Our results guide future low-frequency FRB searches by showing how even non-detections can place meaningful constraints on the repetition rates and circumburst environments of FRBs.</description>

      <title>Does the high-energy AMS-02 positron flux originate from the dark matter density spikes around nearby black holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements made by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) have detected accurate positron flux for energy range 1-1000 GeV. The energy spectrum can be best described by two source terms: the low-energy background diffusion term and an unknown high-energy source term. In this article, we discuss the possibility of the emission of positrons originating from dark matter annihilation in two nearby black hole X-ray binaries A0620-00 and XTE J1118+480. We show that the dark matter density spikes around these two black holes can best produce the observed AMS-02 high-energy positron flux due to dark matter annihilation with rest mass $m_{\rm DM} \approx 8000$ GeV via the $W^+W^-$ annihilation channel. This initiates a new proposal to account for the unknown high-energy source term in the AMS-02 positron spectrum.</description>

      <title>Far-infrared probing with PRIMA into particle acceleration associated with relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is presented that the Probe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) has a high potential to study particle acceleration phenomena associated with jets emanating from active galactic nuclei. A special focus is put on hot spots of radio galaxies because they are widely regarded as the jet-terminal shock where particles are accelerated via the diffusive shock acceleration. To investigate the particle acceleration condition in the hot spots, it is of prime importance to evaluate their magnetic field strength. As a useful indicator of the magnetic field, we propose to adopt a synchrotron spectral feature called the cooling break, of which the frequency is determined by the mutual balance between the synchrotron radiative cooling and the adiabatic one. Referring to the standard physical parameter of the hot spots, the cooling break is expected to reside in or slightly below the far-infrared range covered with PRIMA. The feasibility of the PRIMA observations to measure the far-infrared flux density and to constrain their cooling break frequency is discussed for nearby well-studied hot spots. An affordable observational strategy with PRIMA is described. A possible application of the method to lobes of radio galaxies is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of Wave-Optics Gravitationally Lensed Massive Black Hole Binaries with Space-Based Gravitational Wave Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within a Bayesian statistical framework, we jointly estimate the source and lens parameters and evaluate the relative evidence between the lensed and unlensed models. This work focuses on the wave optics effects induced by a point mass (PM) lens on gravitational waves (GW) from equal-mass massive binary black holes (MBHB), and assesses the capability of the space-based GW detector Taiji to detect such effects. Specifically, we investigate the impact of the redshifted lens mass MLz in the range [3e5, 3e7] solar masses, impact parameter y in [10, 50], source redshift zs in [4, 6], and total source mass Ms in [1e5, 1e7] solar masses on parameter estimation and model selection. Our results show that, for the cases we studied, larger MLz increases the waveform mismatch MM, which directly enhances the waveform difference and the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), thereby improving the ability to discriminate between the lensed and unlensed models. In contrast, for y &gt; 50, both MM and SNR are too small to allow effective model discrimination in these cases. Parameter estimation further indicates that for y &lt; 50, the degeneracy between the luminosity distance and MLz can be effectively broken. Although the Bayes factor decreases as zs increases, lensing signatures remain identifiable up to zs = 6. The role of Ms depends on the overlap of the GW signal with the detector sensitive band. Overall, effective model discrimination requires MM greater than or equal to 1e-7 (corresponding to SNR greater than 5).</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic change with energy of the mean logarithmic mass of cosmic rays in the knee region: the mechanism of formation of this feature and sources of particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) published measurements of the all-particle CR energy spectrum and the mean logarithmic mass of CRs with unprecedented accuracy in 0.3-30 PeV. The mean logarithmic mass shows a nonmonotonic change with energy, a feature observed for the first time. In this work, we present a new approach to describe the mechanisms of formation of this feature. The key elements of this approach are the non-classical diffusion model of cosmic rays developed by the authors in which the knee in the observed spectrum occurs naturally without the use of additional assumptions, as well as power-law asymptotics before and after the knee, and a soft spectrum of particle generation in cosmic ray source. To obtain a more complete picture of the spectrum formation in the region of the knee and the sources that form it, we carried out calculations of the spectra of the main groups of nuclei in the energy range of 1 TeV-100 PeV. It is shown that the behavior of the all-particle spectrum and mass composition in the knee region is determined by local pevatrons located at a distance of 750-900 pc from the Earth. The energy of the knee practically coincides with the knees in the spectra of protons and helium nuclei. The contribution of the light components $p$+He is about 70%, the CNO group provides $\sim$13%. The energy spectrum index of the light components is -2.61 before the knee. The nonmonotonic change in the mean logarithmic mass is due mainly to a decrease in the contribution of the CNO group in the energy range of 0.3-3 PeV.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a sample of $\gamma$-ray active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse 77 \textit{Fermi} sources and their potential low-energy counterparts previously proposed in the literature. These sources were classified as active galactic nuclei, mainly blazars, based on optical spectroscopy. The main goals of this work are to examine these associations, classify the blazars based on their multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and identify potential masquerading BL Lac objects. Through SED analysis, we assess whether the multi-wavelength emission follows the characteristic double-peaked curve of blazars. Additionally, we propose the region of origin of the emission at different wavelengths, investigate the correlation between $\gamma$-ray and lower-energy emission, and classify objects as low-, intermediate-, high- or extreme high synchrotron peaked (LSP, ISP, HSP, E-HSP) blazars. We search for masquerading BL Lacs, a class of flat-spectrum radio quasars where broad emission lines are swamped by non-thermal jet emission. The multi-wavelength analysis revealed that the 64 radio-loud sources in our sample exhibit an SED with a double-peak structure, typically ascribed to jet activity. Based on the synchrotron peak, 46 are HSP, 11 as ISP, and 7 as LSP. We also found 9--18 masquerading BL Lac candidates ($\approx$15--30\% of the radio-loud sample). For the 13 radio-quiet UGSs, the SEDs do not exhibit the double-peak structure typical of jetted AGN. Further analysis ruled out star formation as the origin of the observed $\gamma$-ray emission, making its reconciliation with lower-energy emission challenging. We explored alternative counterparts, identifying low-energy matches for 7 sources, with no plausible counterparts found for the others.</description>

      <title>High-mass microquasars from binary to black hole scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 3D hydrodynamical simulation of a wind-accreting high-mass microquasar, from 30 binary separations (d) to 256 black hole (BH) gravitational radii, over one-sixth of a full orbit in time, with system parameters inspired by Cyg X-1. The simulation allows key system components to emerge naturally as inter-dependent quasi-stationary parts of an inherently multi-scale flow. The BH accretion disk is highly eccentric, with spirally shaped accreting and decreting zones. Its flow field is consistent with elliptical orbits confocal at the BH. The disk structure relates to its feeding: a cold 3D accretion cone channels matter from opposite the L1 point and within 2/3d from the BH toward the disk. Above and below the disk, a polytropic atmosphere establishes, with temperatures one-tenth of the virial temperature. A hot cocoon of shocked wind material engulfs the BH accretion structure on scales of d/10. We hypothesize that the shocks may accelerate particles and the atmosphere may up-scatter photons to GeV energies and beyond. An Archimedian spiral is apparent out to at least 10d, as the orbiting BH perturbs the homogeneous donor star wind. Our simulation offers a coherent cross-scale perspective that allows us to contextualize observations, interpretations, and specific models.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity distribution of extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present realistic eccentricity distributions for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) forming via the two-body relaxation channel in nuclear star clusters, tracking their evolution up to the final plunge onto the central Schwarzschild massive black hole (MBH). We find that EMRIs can retain significant eccentricities at plunge, with a distribution peaking at $e_\mathrm{pl} \approx0.2$, and a considerable fraction reaching much higher values. In particular, up to $20\%$ of the forming EMRIs feature $e_\mathrm{pl} &gt; 0.5$ for central MBH masses $M_\bullet$ in the range $10^5 \mathrm{M_\odot} \leq M_\bullet \leq 10^6 \mathrm{M_\odot}$, partially due to EMRIs forming at large semi-major axes and "cliffhanger EMRI", usually neglected in literature. This highlights the importance of accounting for eccentricity in waveform modeling and detection strategies for future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Furthermore, we find that the numerical fluxes in energy and angular momentum currently implemented in the FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) package may not adequately sample the full parameter space relevant to low-mass MBHs ($M_\bullet &lt; 10^6 \mathrm{M_\odot}$), potentially limiting its predictive power in that regime. Specifically, for $M_\bullet=10^5 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ we find that about $75\%$ ($50 \%$) of EMRIs at 2 years (6 months) from plunge fall outside the currently available flux parameter space. Our findings motivate the development of extended flux grids and improved interpolation schemes to enable accurate modeling of EMRIs across a broader range of system parameters.</description>

      <title>Was SNR 0509-67.5 the result of a double detonation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe) occur when a white dwarf (WD) is disrupted by runaway thermonuclear burning. The nature and observable signatures of the mechanism triggering the explosion are still debated. In this work, we study how supernova remnants (SNRs) are impacted by the `double detonation' explosion mechanism, or a helium shell detonation in a sub-Chandrasekhar WD followed by a core detonation. We evolve double detonation SN models to the remnant phase (up to several centuries) and measure the size of substructures formed in the SNR as a result of turbulent activity. We compare our results to small-scale substructures seen in high-resolution optical observations of the SNR 0509-67.5. Substructures dominated by iron in that SNR are observed to be about $40\%$ larger than those dominated by sulfur. This has been shown to be a definitive signature of the explosion of a sub-Chandrasekhar WD by Mandal et al. Comparisons against our suite of SNR models with a range of core and shell masses suggest that the specific substructure sizes in SNR 0509-67.5 are most consistent with the double detonation explosion of a WD with a carbon-oxygen core mass and a helium shell mass of $1M_{\odot}$ and $&gt;0.05M_{\odot}$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate heat propagation in rigidly rotating bodies within the theory of general relativity. Using a first-order gradient expansion, we derive a universal partial differential equation governing the temperature evolution. This equation is hyperbolic, causal, and stable, and it naturally accounts for both rotational and gravitational Tolman-Ehrenfest effects. Any other first-order theory consistent with established physics (including the parabolic theories used in neutron star cooling models) must be equivalent to our formulation within an error that is of higher order in gradients. As a case study, we analyze heat transfer in solid cylinders rotating around their symmetry axis, so that the tangential speed approaches the speed of light on the surface. We also compute the relativistic rotational corrections to the cooling law of black bodies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider possible observable signals from explosive events in the very early universe, ``bursts". These could be expected in connection
  with massive black hole or ``baby universe'' formation. We anticipate that such major disruptions of spacetime would be associated with
  neutrino and perhaps other pulses. While these seem to be not
  detectable directly, we discuss how they could lead to potentially observable signals. We analyze how the pulses from very early times
  may ``escape'', that is
  propagate to the last scattering epoch at the time $t_{cmb}$ and later,
  or alternatively be absorbed earlier, ``contained''. The possibly detectable signals include effects on small regions of the CMB, a soft x-ray resulting from positron production, or a nonthermal addition to
  the relic neutrino background.</description>

      <title>Enhanced long-duration gravitational-wave transient sources search pipeline with denoising and tree clustering algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a two-stage upgrade to the PySTAMPAS pipeline that boosts the search for long-duration (10 to 10^3 s) transients in gravitational-wave detector data. First, a denoising scheme combines complex 2D wavelet shrinkage with an adaptive pixel threshold to suppress noise while retaining signal power. Second, a KDTree nearest-neighbour algorithm clusters surviving pixels in O(log n) time, replacing the standard clustering approach. Tests with one week of LIGO O3b data show a large reduction in false-alarm rate and up to a factor-of-two improvement in search sensitivity. The computational time is also significantly reduced. These gains extend the sensitivity of all-sky, all-time searches to weaker and shorter transients, enabling rapid and deeper analyses in forthcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observation campaigns.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of charged black points in vacuum nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper analyzes the thermodynamic properties of a special state of charged black holes, in which the event horizon becomes point-like and coincides with the singularity. It is shown that for such states, called black points, in contrast to Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black holes, the third law of thermodynamics in Planck's formulation is fulfilled. It is also shown that the formation of a black point is not a first-order phase transition. Considerable attention is paid to the special state of a black point with a doubly degenerate horizon, similar to the extreme state of a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole.</description>

      <title>Shower formation in the presence of a string-inspired foam in space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently proposed that predictions of Lorentz-breaking space-time foam models from string theory may be compatible with the suggestion of light-speed variation from gamma-ray burst studies. Our analysis of foam-modified kinematics shows that despite the subluminal photon velocities explaining photon time delays one may, and in certain circumstances does, keep intact the electromagnetic showers essential for the detection and identification of cosmic photons. In contrast to other~(mostly phenomenological) approaches to Lorentz violations with modified dispersions leading to drastic changes on the formation length for the cascade development in the atmosphere and in detectors, there is the possibility that the dispersion effect in the present string foam model avoids such modifications and the theory naturally escapes the shower formation constraints from recent observations.</description>

      <title>Parallel Application of Slitless Spectroscopy to Analyze Galaxy Evolution (PASSAGE): Survey Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the second half of Cycle 1 of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), we conducted the Parallel Application of Slitless Spectroscopy to Analyze Galaxy Evolution (PASSAGE) program. PASSAGE received the largest allocation of JWST observing time in Cycle 1, 591 hours of NIRISS observations to obtain direct near-IR imaging and slitless spectroscopy. About two thirds of these were ultimately executed, to observe 63 high-latitude fields in Pure Parallel mode. These have provided more than ten thousand near-infrared grism spectrograms of faint galaxies.
  PASSAGE brings unique advantages in studying galaxy evolution: A) Unbiased spectroscopic search, without prior photometric pre-selection. By including the most numerous galaxies, with low masses and strong emission lines, slitless spectroscopy is the indispensable complement to any pre-targeted spectroscopy; B) The combination of several dozen independent fields to overcome cosmic variance; C) Near-infrared spectral coverage, often spanning the full range from 1.0--2.3 $\mu$m, with minimal wavelength gaps, to measure multiple diagnostic rest-frame optical lines, minimizing sensitivity to dust reddening; D) JWST's unprecedented spatial resolution, in some cases using two orthogonal grism orientations, to overcome contamination due to blending of overlapping spectra; E) Discovery of rare bright objects especially for detailed JWST followup. PASSAGE data are public immediately, and our team plans to deliver fully-processed high-level data products.
  In this PASSAGE overview, we describe the survey and data quality, and present examples of these accomplishments in several areas of current interest in the evolution of emission-line galaxy properties, particularly at low masses.</description>

      <title>The Role of Stellar Mass and Star Formation in Shaping X-ray Emission of Radio-Loud and Radio-Quiet AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy evolution and extragalactic astronomy research depend on an understanding of the interactions between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies. We investigate the relationships between X-ray luminosity (Lx), star formation rate (SFR), and stellar mass (M) in distinct samples of radio-loud (RL) and radio-quiet (RQ) AGN. Using data from 4XMM-DR11, SDSS-DR16, and the DESI AGN Host Galaxies VAC, we examine how these key properties correlate within each AGN population. Our analysis reveals different behaviors: RL-AGN show a strong, statistically significant Lx-SFR correlation but no significant link with M, suggesting that accretion and star formation are coupled, possibly independent of host mass. In contrast, RQ-AGN display moderate, significant positive correlations across all parameters, consistent with joint growth driven by a shared cold gas supply.These results suggest that radio-loud AGN might slow down star formation in their galaxies, while radio-quiet AGN seem to grow together with it.</description>

      <title>Signal processing and data acquisition system for the BTO detectors onboard COSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The energy range from a few hundred keV to a few MeV includes important probes such as nuclear gamma-rays and the 511 keV annihilation line. However, compared to X-rays and GeV/TeV gamma-rays, this range suffers from lower sensitivity by orders of magnitude. The upcoming NASA SMEX satellite mission Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI), scheduled for launch in 2027, is expected to break through this limitation with its Compton telescope utilizing a germanium semiconductor detector, covering the 0.2-5 MeV energy range. In addition to the main instrument, two Background and Transient Observer (BTO) detectors will be installed on COSI. The detectors are NaI(Tl) scintillators coupled with SiPMs, and they are being developed as a student collaboration project. BTO aims to 1) measure background radiation in orbit to maximize COSI's sensitivity and 2) detect GRBs and other gamma-ray transients. For this purpose, it is required to cover the lower-energy range from 30 keV to 2 MeV with &lt; 20% FWHM energy resolution. In addition, large signals and afterglow generated by heavy ions penetrating the NaI(Tl) crystal should be appropriately handled. To address these requirements, we have developed a compact signal processing and data acquisition system comprised of two main components: an analog board and a digital board. The analog board amplifies signals from the SiPM, generates triggers, and performs AD conversion. The digital board features a Microchip SAMV71 microcontroller, and we developed the software to control the analog board, read ADC data via SPI interface, add timestamps, and buffer event data. Through this development, we achieved the required wide bandpass and an energy resolution of 10% FWHM at 662 keV with a processing time of 20 us per event. We also implemented veto signal generation for large signals using a discriminator and an onboard detection algorithm for transient events.</description>

      <title>Modified Black Hole Potentials and Their Korteweg-de Vries Integrals: Instabilities and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black Hole (BH) Quasi-Normal Modes (QNMs) and Greybody Factors (GBFs) are key signatures of BH dynamics that are crucial for testing fundamental physics via gravitational waves. Recent studies of the BH pseudospectrum have revealed instabilities in QNMs. Here, we introduce a new perspective using hidden symmetries in the BH dynamics, specifically the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals - an infinite series of conserved quantities. By analyzing modified BH potentials, we find strong evidence that KdV integrals are valuable indicators for detecting instabilities in QNMs and GBFs.</description>

      <title>Cascading from the winds to the disk: the universality of supernovae-driven turbulence in different galactic interstellar mediums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star-forming galaxies are in a state of turbulence, with one of the principle components of the turbulence sourced by the constant injection of momentum from supernovae (SNe) explosions. Utilizing high-resolution stratified, gravito-hydrodynamical models of SNe-driven turbulence with interstellar medium (ISM) cooling and heating, we explore how SNe-driven turbulence changes across different galactic conditions, parameterized by the galactic mass and potential, SNe-driving rate, and seeding functions. We show that even though the underlying ISM changes between starburst and Milky Way analogue models, the velocity fluctuations in the turbulence of both models, but not the kinetic energy fluctuations, can be normalized into a universal, single cascade, $u^2(k) \propto k^{-3/2}$, where $u$ is the velocity and $k$ is the wavemode, indicating that the structure of the turbulence is robust to significant changes in the ISM and SNe seeding. Moreover, the cascades connect smoothly from the winds into the galactic disk, pushing the outer-scale of the turbulence, $\ell_{\rm cor}$, to over $\ell_{\rm cor} \approx 6 \ell_0$, where $\ell_0$ is the gaseous scale-height. By providing an analytical model for the sound speed spectrum, $c_s^2(k)$, in the weak-cooling, adiabatic limit, we show that it is the compressible turbulent modes, $u_c$, that control the volume-filling phase structure of the galactic disks in our models, with $c_s^2(k) \propto k^{-2} \propto u_c^2(k)$. This may indicate that galactic turbulence does not only have highly-universal features across different galaxies, but also directly sets the volume-filling hot and warm phase structure of the underlying galactic ISM through turbulent compressible modes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational memory meets astrophysical environments: exploring a new frontier through osculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first study of how dark matter environments influence nonlinear gravitational memory from intermediate-mass-ratio binaries. Incorporating dark matter effects-gravitational potential, dynamical friction, and accretion-we compute nonlinear memory for both bound and unbound orbits under dark matter minispikes and Navarro-Frenk-White profiles. For quasi-circular orbits within a minispike profile, we further account empirically for the evolution of the dark matter density. Our findings reveal significant deviations from the vacuum case, with important implications for the detectability of gravitational memory by future gravitational wave observatories. These results underscore the role of astrophysical environments in shaping gravitational memory, strengthening its interpretation as a hereditary imprint of past binary evolution and providing a novel bridge between dark matter physics and memory effects.</description>

      <title>Detection of 'super-virial' gas in the Circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way towards PKS 2155-304</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first simultaneous detection of four distinct highly ionized $z=0$ absorbing phases using Chandra and XMM-Newton grating spectra toward the blazar PKS 2155$\hbox{-}$304. We detect the MgXII K$\alpha$ absorption line for the first time in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way. Along with MgXII K$\alpha$, we detect SiXIV K$\alpha$ absorption, which are the tell-tale signatures of the hot 'super-virial' gas in the CGM. Both from the model-independent calculations and hybrid-ionization modeling, we infer four phases at distinct temperatures, hot 'super-virial' ($5.4^{+1.9}_{-0.8} \times 10^7$ K), warm-hot 'virial' ($1.8^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \times 10^6$ K), warm 'sub-virial' ($2.2\pm 0.5 \times 10^5$ K), and cool phase ($&lt;1.7 \times 10^5$ K). The warm-hot and hot phases are $\alpha$-enhanced, and [C/O] and [Ne/O] are super-solar in the warm-hot phase, while [Mg/O] and [Si/O] are super-solar in the hot phase. The low-ionization lines are blue-shifted (v$_{\rm los} \approx -100$ km s$^{-1}$), whereas the high-ionization lines are red-shifted. It suggests a scenario of infalling sub-virial, quasi-static virial, and outflowing super-virial phases along this sightline. Earlier studies on individual sightlines were confined to the Northern Hemisphere. Our sightline is located in the Southern hemisphere, demonstrating that hot super-virial gas is also present at Southern Galactic latitudes as well. This confirms a more widespread distribution of the super-virial gas across both hemispheres.</description>

      <title>Detection of a Higher Harmonic Quasi-normal Mode in the Ringdown Signal of GW231123</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ringdown phase of a gravitational wave signal from a binary black hole merger offers a unique laboratory for testing general relativity in the strong-field regime and probing the properties of the final remnant black hole. In this study, we analyze the ringdown of GW231123 and find strong evidence for a multimode quasinormal spectrum. Our analysis employs two time-domain methodologies: a full Bayesian inference and an enhanced F-statistic framework, which we extend to enable the calculation of Bayesian evidence and the reconstruction of posterior distributions for all model parameters. We report a statistically significant detection of the $\ell|m|n=200$ mode, with a $\log_{10}$(Bayes factor) of $5.3$, commencing at $12\,M$ after the peak amplitude--a time well within the accepted linear regime. This two-mode analysis yields a redshifted final mass of $305.6^{+35.7}_{-47.3}M _{\odot}$ and a final spin of $0.84^{+0.07}_{-0.14}$ at $90\%$ credibility, from a ringdown signal with a network signal-to-noise ratio of approximately $14.5$. Furthermore, a test of the no-hair theorem performed using the two detected modes reveals no deviation from the predictions of general relativity. These results highlight the power of the F-statistic methodology to uncover nuanced features in gravitational wave signals, thereby providing novel insights into the fundamental properties of black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interacting transient SN 2016cvk (ASASSN-16jt) is a member of the peculiar SN 2009ip-like events. We present our follow-up data and aim to draw conclusions about the physical nature of the progenitor system. Our spectrophotometric data set of SN 2016cvk covers the ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared wavelength region extending to +1681 d from the light curve peak; the data is analysed and compared to other SN 2009ip-like transients. Archival data reveals pre-outbursts of the progenitor with the first detection at -1219 d. The light curve evolution of SN 2016cvk consists of two consecutive luminous events A and B with peak magnitudes of M_V &lt; -15.6 and M_r = -18.3 mag, respectively. The spectra are dominated by Balmer emission lines that have a complex, multi-component evolution similar to other SN 2009ip-like targets. SN 2016cvk is among the first detected SN 2009ip-like events that show early `flash ionisation' features of C III, N III, and He II, lasting for 16 +/- 5 d. Our late-time +405 d spectrum shows forbidden [Ca II], [Fe II], and [O I] features with the latter detected particularly clearly for a SN 2009ip-like event. The evolution of SN 2016cvk is similar to other SN 2009ip-like transients, with some uncommon traits. The lack of a double-peaked structure in the Balmer lines is likely caused by differences in the circumstellar medium structure or viewing angle. The flash features in the early spectra propose abundances consistent with a red, yellow, or blue supergiant progenitor rather than for example a luminous blue variable. The detection of [O I] in the +405 d spectrum suggests possible evidence of nucleosynthesised material generated in a SN explosion.</description>

      <title>A High Incidence of Mid-infrared Variability in Local Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore mid-infrared (MIR) variability in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs; infrared luminsoity $L_{\rm IR}&gt;10^{12}\ L_\odot$) utilizing the $\sim$11 years of photometry from the NEOWISE multi-epoch catalog of {\it Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer} ({\it WISE}). We identify 30 variable ULIRGs with statistically significant MIR variability. The variability is observed on timescales of a few years, implying that the MIR-emitting regions are compact ($\lesssim 1$ pc). The difference between maximum and minimum $W2$ (4.6 ${\rm \mu}$m) band luminosity ($\Delta L_{\rm W2}$) of the 30 variable ULIRGs range from $\Delta L_{W2}$ = $7\times10^{42}$ to $5\times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The $\Delta L_{W2}$ of 25 variable ULIRGs out of 30 are greater than $\Delta L_{W2}$ = $1\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, surpassing the MIR luminosity {range} observed in known supernovae (SNe; $L_{\rm 3.6\ {\rm \mu m}}$ and $L_{\rm 4.5\ {\rm \mu m}}$ &lt; 10$^{42.3}$ erg s$^{-1}$). Therefore, the MIR variabilities in these 25 ULIRGs are most likely driven by tidal disruption events (TDEs) or intrinsic changes in their active galactic nuclei (AGN) torus emission. Our sample includes hard X-ray detected AGNs (e.g., UGC 05101) and previously reported TDE candidates (IRAS F01004-2237, IRAS 05189-2524). All 25 also exhibit at least one AGN signature(s) besides the MIR variability, suggesting that even if the MIR variability originates from TDEs, the black holes responsible are likely AGNs. Our results suggest that MIR variability is an effective tool for detecting buried AGNs and highlights the intense nuclear activity in ULIRGs.</description>

      <title>A congruous approach with realistic cross section towards limiting sub-GeV dark matter from LUX-ZEPLIN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present constraints on sub-GeV dark matter (DM) through the mechanism of being boosted by cosmic rays (CRs). We utilize the nuclear recoil data from the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment for this purpose. Without the mechanism of boosted dark matter (BDM), sub-GeV DM particles are cold enough to produce detectable nuclear recoil in the LZ experiment above the detector threshold. We choose to work with the leading components of cosmic rays to take into account the boost due to them towards the cold DM. In the present discussion we worked on models consisting of a Dirac fermion $\chi$ with a new $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry and DM particles have non-zero coupling to the nucleons as per the model parameters. Specific examples of the energy dependence of the scattering cross section have been invoked through the secluded dark photon model and $U(1)_{B-L}$ model. Additionally, we present the upper bound on the interaction cross section due to the Earth shielding effect in the light of a systematic analysis of the energy loss by the BDM while traveling to the underground detector through the Earth's crust.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole growth from stellar binary encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02316v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a central problem in astrophysics, with current observations providing only limited constraints on the underlying mechanisms. One possible growth channel is stellar accretion via the Hill's mechanism, wherein a SMBH tidally breaks up a passing binary star, capturing and eventually accreting a member of the binary. We adopt a model to predict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density of stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole mass. We then use this model to estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of galactic environments. In a data set of 30 galaxies of various types and masses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may be a driver of recent growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed hypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary star interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced in this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active growth channel for the LMC's black hole.</description>

      <title>Role of density profile of sub-GeV dark matter in the properties of dark matter admixed quark stars with Bayesian analysis of dark-NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and oscillation properties of dark matter (DM) admixed strange quark stars (DMSQSs). The strange quark matter (SQM) is described with the well-known Nambu-Jona-Lasino (NJL) model and the self-interacting fermionic DM is included in a systematic manner. The self-interaction of DM is of four-Fermi type and the overall DM density is considered as a function of the baryon density of SQM with two free parameters ($\alpha$, $\rho_{sc}$). This work is the first to consider four-Fermi interactions between fermionic DM and SQM in DMSQSs. Certain experiments like LZ, XENON, DarkSide, CRESST, and LHC have almost ruled out the possibility of contact interaction between SQM and massive DM (in GeV order). Recently, the quest for sub-GeV DM has garnered significant attention. We show that recent astrophysical constraints on the structural properties of compact stars also do not support the presence of massive DM in DMSQSs. On the other hand, we find sub-GeV DM to successfully concur with such observational constraints. We also calculate the fundamental $f$-mode frequency ($f_f$) of the DMSQSs, which shows universality with compactness, mean density, and tidal deformability. Further, we investigate the prospect of detection of $f_f$ with respect to the projected sensitivity of upcoming gravitational wave detectors like aLIGO, A+, Cosmic Explorer, and Einstein Telescope. In our DMSQS model, the three free parameters are $\alpha$, $\rho_{sc}$, and the ratio of repulsive to attractive interaction in SQM ($G_V/G_S$), which are optimized by Bayesian analysis in light of various recent astrophysical data.</description>

      <title>The legacy of the IXPE instrument and prospects for the next generation of polarimetric photoelectric X-ray detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging X-ray polarimetry with IXPE has demonstrated the scientific potential of the technique but also revealed the need for significant detector upgrades, particularly with the read-out ASIC that images photoelectron tracks and possibly the multiplication stage. Building on this experience, we are developing a next generation three-dimensional photoelectron track polarimeter based on the GridPix detector, originally developed for axion and axion-like-particle searches. We report on the current status of prototype development and preparations for the ion-irradiation tests. Preliminary proton beam irradiation runs at the Bonn Isochronous Cyclotron facility of the University of Bonn verified both this generation of ASIC's tolerance to high radiation doses present in space and the capability of the cyclotron facility to operate at sufficiently low rates for controlled tests.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference favors quark matter in neutron star interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a physics-informed Bayesian analyses of the equation of state of hybrid neutron stars that incorporates color-flavor-locked quark matter modeled by a three-flavor non-local Nambu-Jona-Lasinio framework with vector repulsion and diquark pairing. Contrary to the model-agnostic Bayesian analyses our scheme allows for distinguishing between the scenarios of neutron stars with quark cores and without them. The used quark model realizes asymptotic conformality at high densities in accordance with perturbative QCD. The hadronic sector is described by the density-dependent relativistic functional DD2Y-T, which satisfies chiral effective field theory constraints and includes hyperonic degrees of freedom. We construct a large set of candidate hybrid EOSs by varying the vector and diquark couplings and apply a Maxwell construction for the quark-hadron phase transition. Observational constraints from recent NICER pulsar mass-radius measurements and tidal deformability from GW170817 are incorporated into the likelihood. Depending on whether the observational data from the black widow pulsar PSR J0952-0607 and the HESS J1731-347 object are included to the analysis or not, the posterior distribution favors vector and diquark couplings around $(\eta_V,\eta_D)\simeq (0.82,0.40)$ or $(\eta_V,\eta_D)\simeq (0.64,0.36)$, respectively. This corresponds to equations of state that support two-solar-mass neutron stars with superconformal speed of sound and relatively low onset densities for deconfinement. Our findings indicate that the most probable hybrid EOSs are statistically preferred over the purely hadronic baseline. The corresponding probabilities of agreeing with the observational data differ by one or two orders of magnitude depending on the data set used. This suggests that quark cores may exist in all observed neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Insights into the broad-band emission of the TeV blazar Mrk 501 during the first X-ray polarization measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first multi-wavelength study of Mrk 501 including very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray observations simultaneous to X-ray polarization measurements from the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). We use radio-to-VHE data from a multi-wavelength campaign organized between 2022-03-01 and 2022-07-19. The observations were performed by MAGIC, Fermi-LAT, NuSTAR, Swift (XRT and UVOT), and several instruments covering the optical and radio bands. During the IXPE pointings, the VHE state is close to the average behavior with a 0.2-1 TeV flux of 20%-50% the emission of the Crab Nebula. Despite the average VHE activity, an extreme X-ray behavior is measured for the first two IXPE pointings in March 2022 with a synchrotron peak frequency &gt;1 keV. For the third IXPE pointing in July 2022, the synchrotron peak shifts towards lower energies and the optical/X-ray polarization degrees drop. The X-ray polarization is systematically higher than at lower energies, suggesting an energy-stratification of the jet. While during the IXPE epochs the polarization angle in the X-ray, optical and radio bands align well, we find a clear discrepancy in the optical and radio polarization angles in the middle of the campaign. We model the broad-band spectra simultaneous to the IXPE pointings assuming a compact zone dominating in the X-rays and VHE, and an extended zone stretching further downstream the jet dominating the emission at lower energies. NuSTAR data allow us to precisely constrain the synchrotron peak and therefore the underlying electron distribution. The change between the different states observed in the three IXPE pointings can be explained by a change of magnetization and/or emission region size, which directly connects the shift of the synchrotron peak to lower energies with the drop in polarization degree.</description>

      <title>Insights from the first flaring activity of a high-synchrotron-peaked blazar with X-ray polarization and VHE gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23140v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a flaring activity of the HSP Mrk421 that was characterized from radio to very-high-energy (VHE; E $&gt;0.1$TeV) gamma rays with MAGIC, Fermi-LAT, Swift, XMM-Newton and several optical and radio telescopes. These observations included, for the first time for a gamma-ray flare of a blazar, simultaneous X-ray polarization measurements with IXPE. We find substantial variability in both X-rays and VHE gamma rays throughout the campaign, with the highest VHE flux above 0.2 TeV occurring during the IXPE observing window, and exceeding twice the flux of the Crab Nebula. However, the VHE and X-ray spectra are on average softer, and the correlation between these two bands weaker that those reported in previous flares of Mrk421. IXPE reveals an X-ray polarization degree significantly higher than that at radio and optical frequencies. The X-ray polarization angle varies by $\sim$100$^\circ$ on timescales of days, and the polarization degree changes by more than a factor 4. The highest X-ray polarization degree reaches 26%, around which a X-ray counter-clockwise hysteresis loop is measured with XMM-Newton. It suggests that the X-ray emission comes from particles close to the high-energy cutoff, hence possibly probing an extreme case of the Turbulent Extreme Multi-Zone model. We model the broadband emission with a simplified stratified jet model throughout the flare. The polarization measurements imply an electron distribution in the X-ray emitting region with a very high minimum Lorentz factor, which is expected in electron-ion plasma, as well as a variation of the emitting region size up to a factor of three during the flaring activity. We find no correlation between the fluxes and the evolution of the model parameters, which indicates a stochastic nature of the underlying physical mechanism. Such behaviour would be expected in a highly turbulent electron-ion plasma crossing a shock front.</description>

      <title>Modelling Cosmic Rays Flux with Pierre Auger and Telescope Array Data in $\boldsymbol{f(R)}$ and $\boldsymbol{f(Q)}$ Theories of Gravity</title>

Abstract: We investigate the effects of the magnetic field and the redshift on the propagation of galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays (CRs) in a modified theory of gravity (MTG) and an alternative theory of gravity (ATG) framework. For this purpose, we consider the $f(R)$ gravity and the $f(Q)$ gravity theories. We utilise these two MTG and ATG to compute the density enhancement factor of CRs as a function of the magnetic field and the redshift. For this work, we take the magnetic field strength from $1-100$ nG, while $0-2.5$ for the redshift. For each of these parameters, we take $100$ bins within their considered range for the computation. The enhancement parameter for the mixed composition of heavy nuclei up to Fe is also taken into account for this work. Further, we compute the $E^3$ magnified diffusive flux for $150$ sources separated by a distance $d_\text{s}$ for the different cosmological models. For the fitting with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and Telescope Array (TA), we parameterized some set that consists of the redshift $z$, the separation distances $d_\text{s}$ between the $150$ sources, and the maximum cutoff energy $E_{\text{max}}$. For each case, a residue plot and $\chi^2$ value are also added to check the goodness of fitting. A comparative analysis of considered models has been performed in each of the cases along with the $\Lambda$CDM model. The considered MTG and ATG models produce notable and fascinating outcomes, with the $f(Q)$ model showing the highest CR density enhancement and the lowest reduced chi-squared value when fitted to PAO and TA data of UHECRs flux. This research provides new perspectives on the connections between high-energy physics, astrophysics, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Geminga: A Window into the Role Played by the Local Halo in the Cosmic-Ray Propagation Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel phenomenon among the recently observed Geminga pulsar halo is the presence of distinct radiation morphology at high energies, while no extended radiation is detected in the 10-500 GeV energy band within a $40\degree\times40\degree$ region. This phenomenon suggests that pulsar halos play a crucial role in the local propagation of cosmic rays, making it necessary to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon. This work focuses on the 3D propagation study of cosmic rays, incorporating the Geminga pulsar into our propagation framework to investigate its contribution to different observational spectra. We consider Geminga a dominant local source of positrons, partially reproducing the observed positron spectrum and multi-wavelength radiative spectra of the Geminga halo. Through calculations of signal and background at different angles, we find that: (1) The slow-diffusion properties near the Geminga pulsar and its proper motion may cause the radiation from electrons originating from Geminga to be distributed across a more extended region. (2) The incomplete subtraction of radiation from the local halo may contribute, to some extent, to the diffuse gamma ray fluctuations detected by LHAASO. We hope that LHAASO will detect more sources of cosmic ray halo to further validate our model.</description>

      <title>Did IceCube discover Dark Matter around Blazars?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of blazar jets, that explain observations of their photon spectra, typically predict too few neutrinos to be possibly seen by existing telescopes. In particular, they fall short in reproducing the first neutrino ever detected from a blazar, TXS 0506+056, by IceCube in 2017. We predict larger neutrino fluxes by using the same jet models, extended to include deep inelastic scatterings between protons within the jets and sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around the central black holes of blazars. In this way we succeed in explaining neutrino observations of TXS 0506+056, for DM parameters allowed by all laboratory, direct and indirect searches. Our proposal will be tested by DM searches, as well as by the observation of more neutrinos from blazars. Our findings motivate to implement DM-nuclei interactions in jet models and to improve our knowledge of DM spikes around active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Analysing Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays' Anisotropy in $\boldsymbol{f(R, T)}$ Gravity Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the anisotropy of diffusive Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) by employing three cosmological models: two models from the $f(R, T)$ gravity theory and the other is the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The primary objective of this work was to ascertain the role of the $f(R, T)$ gravity theory in comprehending the anisotropy of UHECRs without implicitly endorsing the conventional cosmology. We parameterized the magnetic field and the source distance in anisotropy calculations to align well with the observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory for all the cosmological models. An uncertainty band is presented along with the $\chi^2$ test for all cosmological models to demonstrate the goodness of fitting. Our findings revealed that the amplitude of the anisotropy is highly sensitive to these cosmological models. Notably, the $f(R, T)$ models exhibited a lower amplitude of anisotropy (i.e., more isotropy), while the $\Lambda$CDM model predicted a comparatively higher amplitude at most of the energies considered.</description>

      <title>The First Search for Optical Transient as a Counterpart of a Month-timescale IceCube Neutrino Multiplet Event</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical transients with timescale of months, such as supernovae (SNe) and tidal disruption events (TDEs), are candidates of high-energy neutrino sources. Multiple neutrino detections from the same direction within a month timescale provide a unique opportunity to identify such optical counterparts in the nearby Universe. In this work, we conduct archival search for the optical counterpart of an IceCube triplet event using the data of Zwicky Transient Facility. We develop a dedicated alert filtering system and validate the performance by following a blind analysis method. Applying this filtering system to the data after the detections of the IceCube triplet event, we find no transient candidates within the localization area. Assuming that the IceCube triplet event originates from an astrophysical source, we constrain parameters of optical transient, a peak luminosity and a decay timescale, using a simple signal model that is motivated by TDEs and superluminous SNe (SLSNe). Assuming the case with no time lag between neutrino detections and optical peak, almost entire parameter space of the known TDEs and SLSNe would be constrained. To give constraints on transients with a rapidly evolving light curve, quick follow-up observations for future neutrino multiplet events are crucial.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high energy cosmic rays with UFA-15 source model in Bumblebee gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the effects of Bumblebee gravity on the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) using astrophysical sources modelled in the Unger-Farrar-Anchordoqui (UFA) framework (2015), which includes star formation rate (SFR), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We compute the density enhancement factor for various source separations distances ($d_\text{s}$s) up to 100 Mpc within the Bumblebee gravity scenario. Additionally, we calculate the CRs flux and their suppression, goodness-of-fit values obtained from comparisons with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) and the Telescope Array experiment data for the flux and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for suppression. The anisotropy in the CRs arrival directions is examined, with corresponding goodness-of-fit values obtained from the PAO surface detector data (SD 750 and SD 1500). Finally, we present skymaps of flux and anisotropy under different model assumptions, providing insights into the observational signatures of UHECRs in Bumblebee gravity. We show that Bumblebee gravity stands as a viable cosmological model for explaining key observational features of UHECRs, including spectrum, composition and anisotropy. Our results show that increasing the Bumblebee gravity parameter $l$ enhances the density factor $\xi$, particularly at low energies, highlighting Lorentz violation's impact on CRs' propagation. Larger $d_\text{s}$ values amplify deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model, with AGN sources dominating at high energies and GRB/SFR sources at lower energies. The skymaps indicate the structured flux patterns at large $d_\text{s}$ and structured anisotropies at higher energies.</description>

      <title>Suppression of composition $g$-modes in chemically-equilibrating warm neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of chemical equilibration and the resulting bulk viscosity on non-radial oscillation modes of warm neutron stars at temperatures up to $T\approx 5$ MeV, relevant for protoneutron stars and neutron-star post-merger remnants. In this regime, the relaxation rate of weak interactions becomes comparable to the characteristic frequencies of composition $g$-modes in the core, resulting in resonant damping. To capture this effect, we introduce the dynamical sound speed, a complex, frequency-dependent generalization of the adiabatic sound speed that encodes both the restoring force and the dissipative effects of bulk compression. Using realistic weak reaction rates and three representative equations of state, we compute the complex frequencies of composition $g$-modes with finite-temperature profiles. We find that bulk viscous damping becomes increasingly significant with temperature and can completely suppress composition $g$-modes. In contrast, the $f$-mode remains largely unaffected by bulk viscosity due to its nearly divergence-free character. Our results highlight the sensitivity of $g$-mode behavior to thermal structure, weak reaction rates, and the equation of state, and establish the dynamical sound speed as a valuable descriptor characterizing oscillation properties in dissipative neutron star matter.</description>

      <title>Prospective sensitivity of CTAO on detection of evaporating primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the lifetime of a black hole decreases, the energy of the Hawking radiation it emits increases, ultimately culminating in its disappearance through a powerful burst of gamma rays. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with an initial mass of $\sim 5\times10^{14}$ g, their lifespans are expected to end in the present epoch. Detecting such PBH bursts would provide compelling evidence of their existence. The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) has the potential to observe these bursts at the high-energy end of the gamma-ray spectrum. To investigate this possibility, we conduct a study to evaluate the sensitivity of CTAO to the local burst rate density of PBHs. Our results suggest that during a 5-year observational campaign, CTAO could exclude a local burst rate density exceeding $\sim 36\ \mathrm{pc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, which represents an improvement of one order of magnitude over the upper limit set by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). In addition, we propose an observation strategy optimized for detecting PBH bursts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of an anti-glitch with a fractional frequency change of $\Delta\nu/\nu=-3.46(6)\times10^{-9}$ in the rotation-powered pulsar PSR J1835$-$1106 at MJD 55813, based on timing observations collected with the Nanshan 26-m and Parkes 64-m radio telescopes from January 2000 to July 2022. A comparison of the average pulse profiles within $\pm300$ d of the event reveals no significant morphological changes. We also estimate the angular velocity lag between the normal and superfluid components at the time of the glitch, showing that one of the superfluid glitch models is incompatible with PSR J1835$-$1106 due to its insufficient spin-down rate and angular velocity lag. The wind braking scenario offers a viable alternative, consistent with the observed spin-down behavior, glitch amplitude, and post-glitch recovery. High-cadence, high-sensitivity monitoring of similar events is essential to distinguish between internal (superfluid) and external (wind-related) glitch mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: We perform the first direct consistency check between the recently measured proton spectrum at the knee by Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) and the collaboration's own high-precision mapping of Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission. By modeling the hadronic gamma-ray production using the updated cosmic-ray spectra, gas templates and cross-section models, we show that the predicted gamma-ray flux robustly overshoots the LHAASO data in both inner and lateral Galactic regions. This persistent mismatch in both normalization and spectral shape challenges conventional scenarios linking the local cosmic-ray sea to Galactic gamma-ray emission, and calls for a revision of current cosmic ray models in the TeV-PeV sky.</description>

      <title>Natal kick by early-asymmetrical pairs of jets to the neutron star of supernova remnant S147</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the bipolar morphology of the jet-shaped core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) S147 and its neutron star (NS) kick velocity, and suggest that two pairs of unequal, opposite jets contributed to the NS kick velocity. This kick by early asymmetrical pairs (kick-BEAP) of jets mechanism operates within the framework of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We examine the prominent pair of large ears and, based on their flat structure rather than the more common conical structure of ears, conclude that two pairs of jets close in angle inflated the two opposite ears. We connect two opposite X-ray bright zones by an additional axis to create the full point-symmetric morphology of CCSNR S147. We propose that the two unequal jets that formed the X-ray bright zones imparted the first kick-BEAP, while the two pairs of jets that formed the ears imparted the second kick-BEAP. The two kick velocities are of about equal magnitude of ~450 km/s, which implies very energetic jets. Such jets can excite gravitational waves that present detectors can detect from the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. We use the morphology we identify to estimate the CCSNR age at 23,000 yr. Our results strengthen the JJEM.</description>

      <title>Effect of symmetry energy on properties of rapidly rotating neutron stars and universal relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated universal relations for compact stars rotating at the Keplerian (mass-shedding) limit, which is highly relevant for
  understanding the rapidly rotating objects formed in the aftermath of a neutron star-neutron star merger. Our analysis is based on a
  set of nucleonic equations of state (EoSs) featuring systematic variations in the symmetry energy slope parameter $L_{\rm sym}$ and the
  isoscalar skewness parameter $Q_{\rm sat}$, varied within ranges that are broadly consistent with current laboratory and astrophysical
  constraints. The global observable properties of isolated maximally rotating stars are examined, focusing on the mass-radius relation,
  moment of inertia, quadrupole moment, and the Keplerian (maximum) rotation frequency, as well as their variations in the
  $L_{\rm sym}$-$Q_{\rm sat}$ parameter space. Next, we demonstrate that, in the limit of Keplerian rotation, universal relations remain valid across
  the same set of EoSs characterized by varying $L_{\rm sym}$ and $\Qsat$. In particular, we present explicit results for the moment
  of inertia ($I$) and quadrupole moment ($Q$) as functions of compactness, as well as for the moment of inertia-quadrupole moment
  relation. All of these relations exhibit excellent universality, with deviations typically within a range from a few percent to 10\%
  across a wide range of parameters. Additionally, we verify for our set of EoSs that the universality of $I$-$Q$ holds to higher accuracy
  (at the level of 1\%) in the slow-rotation approximation compared with the Kepler limit, where the relative error increases up to $\lesssim
  10\%$. Our findings support the applicability of $I$-Love-$Q$-type universal relations in observational modeling of maximally rotating
  compact stars and the gravitational wave emitted by them.</description>

Abstract: POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) is a scaled-down version of the Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) design, optimized to be flown as a payload on one of NASA's sub-orbital super pressure balloons circling the Earth above the southern oceans for a mission duration of more than 20 days. One of the main science objectives of PBR is to follow up astrophysical event alerts in search of neutrinos with very high energy ($10^8 \lesssim E_\nu /{\rm GeV} \lesssim 10^{10}$). Of particular interest for anticipated PBR observations, the KM3NeT Collaboration has recently reported the detection of the neutrino KM3-230213A with $10^{7.8} \lesssim E_\nu/{\rm GeV} \lesssim 10^{9.0}$. Such an unprecedented event is in tension with upper limits on the cosmic neutrino flux from IceCube and the Pierre Auger Observatory: for a diffuse isotropic neutrino flux there is a $3.5\sigma$ tension between KM3NeT and IceCube measurements, and about $2.6\sigma$ if the neutrino flux originates in transient sources. Therefore, if KM3-230213A was not beginner's luck, it becomes compelling to consider beyond Standard Model (BSM) possibilities which could lead to a signal at KM3NeT-ARCA but not at IceCube/Auger. We calculate the PBR horizon-range sensitivity to probe BSM physics compatible with observation at KM3NeT-ARCA and non-observation at IceCube/Auger. As an illustration, we consider a particular class of BSM physics models which has been described in the literature as a possible explanation of KM3-230213A.</description>

      <title>Search for spatial coincidences between galaxy mergers and Fermi-LAT 4FGL-DR4 sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for spatial association between a high confidence sample of 3,166 morphologically selected galaxy mergers drawn from the initial convolutional neural network (CNN) catalog of 328,151 candidate mergers and refined through SDSS cross-matching and the Fermi Large Area Telescope Fourth Source Catalog Data Release 4 (4FGL-DR4) catalog of gamma-ray sources detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Using a conservative 4$\sigma$ positional uncertainty threshold and a Poisson based statistical framework, we identify 21 statistically significant associations with match probabilities $p &lt; 0.05$. Among these are known classes of gamma-ray emitters such as Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae objects (BLL), and radio galaxies bolstering the hypothesis that merger driven processes can fuel high energy activity. Intriguingly, five of the associated sources remain unclassified in 4FGL-DR4, hinting at a possible link between galaxy mergers and a hitherto unrecognized population of gamma-ray sources. The dominance of AGN like matches supports the scenario in which mergers trigger accretion onto central supermassive black holes, initiating AGN activity observable at gamma-ray energies. Moreover, the recurrent presence of unassociated sources among secure matches underscores the potential of merger catalogs as physically motivated priors in gamma-ray source identification efforts. This work constitutes the first dedicated effort to explore associations between gamma-ray sources and a large, morphologically selected sample of galaxy mergers catalog, opening new avenues for understanding the role of galaxy interactions in high-energy astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Dynamics of Strongly Magnetized Ion-Electron Relativistic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present 3D simulations of semirelativistic collisionless magnetic reconnection, where upstream ions are subrelativistic while electrons are ultrarelativistic. We employ the realistic proton-to-electron mass ratio and explore a range of upstream ion magnetization spanning two orders of magnitude, with our highest-magnetization run achieving unprecedentedly large domain sizes. Through a parameter scan, we find that as the system transitions from mildly to trans- and ultrarelativistic regimes the qualitative behavior of reconnection becomes strongly influenced by 3D effects mediated by drift-kink and flux-rope kink dynamics. As a result, magnetic-energy dissipation at high magnetizations, and the subsequent nonthermal particle acceleration, can become less efficient, contrary to general expectations for 3D relativistic reconnection. Our results have important implications for understanding reconnection in magnetized astrophysical scenarios, such as the surroundings of black holes and neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The magnetar model's energy crisis for a prolific repeating fast radio burst source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are widely considered to originate from magnetars that power the explosion through releasing magnetic energy. Active repeating FRBs have been seen to produce hundreds of bursts per hour and can stay active for months, thus may provide stringent constraints on the energy budget of FRBs' central engine. Within a time span of 214 days, we detected 11,553 bursts from the hyper-active FRB 20240114A that reached a peak burst rate of 729 hr$^{-1}$. This is the largest burst sample from any single FRB source, exceeding the cumulative total of all published bursts from all known FRBs to date. Assuming typical values of radio efficiency and beaming factor, the estimated total isotropic burst energy of this source exceeds 86% of the dipolar magnetic energy of a typical magnetar. The total released energy from this source exceeds that of other known repeaters by about one and a half orders of magnitude, yielding the most stringent lower limit of $4.7\times10^{32}$ G cm$^3$ for the magnetar's magnetic moment. The source remained active at the end of this observation campaign. Our findings thus require either the FRB's central magnetar engine's possessing exceptionally high emission efficiency or a more powerful compact object than a typical magnetar.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent gamma-ray morphology estimation tool in Gammapy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17622v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An understanding of the energy dependence of gamma-ray sources can yield important information on the underlying emission mechanisms. However, despite the detection of energy-dependent morphologies in many TeV sources, we lack a proper quantification of such measurements. We introduce an estimation tool within the Gammapy landscape, an open-source Python package for the analysis of gamma-ray data, for quantifying the energy-dependent morphology of a gamma-ray source. The proposed method fits the spatial morphology in a global fit across all energy slices (null hypothesis) and compares this to separate fits for each energy slice (alternative hypothesis). These are modelled using forward-folding methods, and the significance of the variability is quantified by comparing the test statistics of the two hypotheses. We present a general tool for probing changes in the spatial morphology with energy, employing a full forward-folding approach with a 3D likelihood. We present its usage on a real dataset from H.E.S.S. and on a simulated dataset to quantify the significance of the energy dependence for sources of different sizes. In the first example, which utilises a subset of data from HESSJ1825-137, we observe extended emission at lower energies that becomes more compact at higher energies. The tool indicates a very significant variability (9.8{\sigma}) in the case of the largely extended emission. In the second example, a source with a smaller extent (~0.1{\deg}), simulated using the CTAO response, shows the tool can still provide a statistically significant variation (9.7{\sigma}) on small scales.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a Spectral Break or Curvature in the Spectrum of Astrophysical Neutrinos from 5 TeV--10 PeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report improved measurements of the all flavor astrophysical neutrino spectrum with IceCube by combining complementary neutrino samples in two independent analyses. Both analyses show evidence of a harder spectrum at energies below $\sim$30~TeV compared to higher energies where the spectrum is well characterized by a power law. The spectrum is better described by a log parabola or a broken power law, the latter being the preferred model. Both, however, reject a single power law over an energy range 5~TeV-10~PeV with a significance $&gt;4\sigma$, providing new constraints on properties of cosmic neutrino sources.</description>

      <title>XRISM/Resolve View of Abell 2319: Turbulence, Sloshing, and ICM Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05067v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results from XRISM/Resolve observations of the core of the galaxy cluster Abell 2319, focusing on its kinematic properties. The intracluster medium (ICM) exhibits temperatures of approximately 8 keV across the core, with a prominent cold front and a high-temperature region ($\sim$11 keV) in the northwest. The average gas velocity in the 3 arcmin $\times$ 4 arcmin region around the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) covered by two Resolve pointings is consistent with that of the BCG to within 40 km s$^{-1}$ and we found modest average velocity dispersion of 230-250 km s$^{-1}$. On the other hand, spatially-resolved spectroscopy reveals interesting variations. A blueshift of up to $\sim$230 km s$^{-1}$ is observed around the east edge of the cold front, where the gas with the lowest specific entropy is found. The region further south inside the cold front shows only a small velocity difference from the BCG; however, its velocity dispersion is enhanced to 400 km s$^{-1}$, implying the development of turbulence. These characteristics indicate that we are observing sloshing motion with some inclination angle following BCG and that gas phases with different specific entropy participate in sloshing with their own velocities, as expected from simulations. No significant evidence for a high-redshift ICM component associated with the subcluster Abell 2319B was found in the region covered by the current Resolve pointings. These results highlight the importance of sloshing and turbulence in shaping the internal structure of Abell 2319. Further deep observations are necessary to better understand the mixing and turbulent processes within the cluster.</description>

      <title>Search for echoes on the edge of quantum black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I perform a template-based search for stimulated emission of Hawking radiation (or Boltzmann echoes) by combining the gravitational wave data from 47 binary black hole merger events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. With a Bayesian inference approach, I found no statistically significant evidence for this signal in either of the 3 Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs GWTC-1, GWTC-2 and GWTC-3. While the data does not provide definitive evidence against the presence of Boltzmann echoes, the Bayesian evidence for most events falls within the range of 0.3-1.6, with the hypothesis of a common (non-vanishing) echo amplitude for all mergers being weakly disfavoured at 2:5 odds. The only exception is GW190521, the most massive and confidently detected event ever observed, which shows a positive evidence of 9.2 for stimulated Hawking radiation. The ''look-elsewhere'' effect for this outlier event is assessed by applying two distinct methods to add simulated signals in real data, before and after the event, giving false (true) positive detection probabilities for higher Bayes factors of $1.5^{+1.2}_{-0.9}\%$, $4.4^{+2.0}_{-2.0} \%$ ($35 \pm 7 \%$, $35 \pm 15 \%$). An optimal combination of posteriors yields an upper limit of $A &lt; 0.4$ (at $90\%$ confidence level) for a universal echo amplitude, whereas $A \sim 1$ was predicted in the canonical model. To ensure the robustness of the results, I have employed an additional method to combine the events hierarchically. This approach involves using a target gaussian distribution and extracting the parameters from multiple uncertain observations, which may be affected by selection biases.</description>

Abstract: Viscous fluids can dissipate and alter the propagation of gravitational waves, as well as modify the relaxation and stability properties of self-gravitating fluids. This is particularly relevant in order to understand the relaxation to equilibrium of neutron stars, and their gravitational wave emission. Here we study the linearized theory of perturbations of spherically symmetric self-gravitating fluids. Dissipative effects are included through the hydrodynamics theory of Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK). This theory has been shown to be causal and stable, despite involving only first order gradients. We show how the problem reduces to two coupled wave equations in the axial sector, one of them associated to a novel viscous mode, and including explicitly dissipative terms. In the polar sector, we reduce the problem to five coupled wave equations and one additional constraint. We comment on their causal structure, and recover the causality bounds of the BDNK theory.</description>

      <title>Lensing and wave optics in the strong field of a black hole</title>

Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are lensed by matter, offering a unique probe of both the large-scale structure of the Universe and the fundamental properties of GW propagation. GWs can also be affected by wave optics effects when their wavelength is comparable to the size of the lens. While this regime has been well studied in the Newtonian approximation, the role of strong gravitational fields remains largely unexplored. This is particularly relevant for lensing by intermediate and supermassive black holes (BHs), which can occur near active galactic nuclei or in compact triple systems. In this work, we analyze the lensing of GWs by a non-rotating BH and compare our results to the Newtonian point-mass approximation. We construct frequency-dependent amplification factors that incorporate strong-field effects, revealing explicit polarization mixing and absorption by the event horizon. Using a fiducial GW event, we explore key phenomenological signatures of BH lensing, highlighting new observational opportunities to probe strong gravitational fields through GW lensing.</description>

      <title>Effect of primary scalar hair on black hole's strong lensing in Beyond Horndeski Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational lensing effects of a static, asymptotically flat black hole with primary scalar hair in Beyond Horndeski gravity, focusing on the strong lensing regime. Recently, in Ref. [1], we placed constraints on the scalar hair parameter by analyzing its thermodynamic stability and the black hole shadow. In this work, we further investigate the strong lensing properties of the black hole, which form the basis of shadow formation, and employ observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope to derive more precise constraints on the scalar hair parameter. Additionally, we compute the shape and position of different lensed images of a thin accretion disk and argue that the observed black hole shadow corresponds to the secondary image of the emitting disk. Using this interpretation, we perform a new set of constraints on the scalar hair. Furthermore, we discuss why higher-order images are not suitable for astrophysical constraints, highlighting the limitations posed by their faintness and observational challenges. Finally, we find that models satisfying these constraints exhibit local instabilities.</description>

      <title>Dark Spin-2 Field Solitons as a Source of Electromagnetic Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-$s$ light dark boson particles can exhibit wave-like behavior, capable of forming long-lived, coherent, spatially localized structures known as solitons. This work considers the possibility that a light spin-2 particle might be part of or all the dark matter content of the Universe, which could result in a significant fraction of solitons existing today in galactic halos. If these dark matter particles interact with electromagnetism through dimension-6 operators, the solitons may experience parametric resonance of photons triggered by the surrounding electromagnetic field. We explore the feasibility and key characteristics of this electromagnetic radiation, as well as the potential for detection through soliton mergers using ground-based facilities.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Analytical Expressions for Gray-Body Factors and Application to Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a machine learning approach that explores the space of mathematical expressions to identify those that best fit a given dataset, balancing both accuracy and simplicity. We apply SR to the study of Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), which play a crucial role in the derivation of Hawking radiation and are recognized for their computational complexity. We explore simple analytical forms for the GBFs of the Schwarzschild Black Hole (BH). We compare the results obtained with different approaches and quantify their consistency with those obtained by solving the Teukolsky equation. As a case study, we apply our pipeline, which we call \texttt{ReGrayssion}, to the study of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as Dark Matter (DM) candidates, deriving constraints on the abundance from observations of diffuse extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background. These results highlight the possible role of SR in providing human-interpretable, approximate analytical GBF expressions, offering a new pathway for investigating PBH as a DM candidate.</description>

      <title>Probing the quantum speed limit and entanglement in flavor oscillations of neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a spinning primordial black hole (PBH) described by the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild polar coordinates. We derive an analytical expression for the four-vector gravitational potential in the underlying Hermitian Dirac Hamiltonian using these coordinates. This gravitational potential introduces an axial vector term in the Dirac equation in curved spacetime. We find that the magnitudes of the temporal and spatial components of the four-vector gravitational potential are significantly affected by the angle of the position vector of the spinor with respect to the spin axis of the PBH, its radial distance from the PBH, and the strength of the specific angular momentum of the PBH. These potentials modify the effective mass matrix of the neutrino-antineutrino system and significantly affect the transition probabilities during the flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system. We then use the transition probability to investigate the quantum speed limit time bound ratio for the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system in curved spacetime. This helps us estimate how quickly the initial neutrino flavor state evolves over time under the influence of the gravitational field. Finally, we discuss quantum correlations such as entanglement entropy during the two-flavor oscillation of the neutrino-antineutrino system near a spinning PBH.</description>

      <title>Evolution of precessing binary black holes on eccentric orbits using orbit-averaged evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20543v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The most general bound binary black hole (BBH) system has an eccentric orbit and precessing spins. The detection of such a system with significant eccentricity close to the merger would be a clear signature of dynamical formation. In order to study such systems, it is important to be able to evolve their spins and eccentricity from the larger separations at which the binary formed to the smaller separations at which it is detected, or vice versa. Knowledge of the precessional evolution of the binary's orbital angular momentum can also be used to twist up aligned-spin eccentric waveform models to create a spin-precessing eccentric waveform model. In this paper, we present a new publicly available code to evolve eccentric, precessing BBHs using orbit-averaged post-Newtonian (PN) equations from the literature. The spin-precession dynamics is 2PN accurate, i.e., with the leading spin-orbit and spin-spin corrections. The evolution of orbital parameters (orbital frequency, eccentricity, and periastron precession), which follow the quasi-Keplerian parametrization, is 3PN accurate in the point particle terms and includes the leading order spin-orbit and spin-spin effects. All the spin-spin terms include the quadrupole-monopole interaction. The eccentricity enhancement functions in the fluxes use the high-accuracy hyperasymptotic expansions from Loutrel and Yunes [Classical Quantum Gravity {\bf 34} 044003 (2017)]. We discuss various features of the code and study the evolution of the orbital and spin-precession parameters of eccentric, precessing BBHs. In particular, we study the dependence of the spin morphologies on eccentricity, where we find that the transition point from one spin morphology to another can depend nonmonotonically on eccentricity, and the fraction of binaries in a given morphology at a given point in the evolution of a population depends on the instantaneous eccentricity.</description>

      <title>On the symmetry energy expansion and the peak value of the bulk viscosity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The symmetry energy expansion is a useful way to parametrize the properties of dense matter near nuclear saturation density, and much work has been done to connect physical quantities like the neutron star radius and the core-crust transition density to the symmetry energy parameters. In this work, I connect the weak-interaction-driven bulk viscosity in neutron-proton-electron ($npe$) matter to the symmetry parameters by calculating the susceptibilities of dense matter in terms of the symmetry energy. I use this result to calculate the resonant-peak value of the bulk viscosity as a function of density, finding that it strongly depends on $L$, as does the minimum bulk-viscous dissipation timescale. Also resulting from this calculation is a formula for finding the conformal points of the zero-temperature equation of state. Finally, I determine for which values of the symmetry parameters the maximum r-mode-stable rotation frequency of an $npe$-matter neutron star is smaller than the Kepler frequency, in the high-temperature conditions where bulk viscosity is the dominant dissipation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Binary mass transfer in 3D -- Mass Transfer Rate and Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mass transfer is crucial in binary evolution, yet its theoretical treatment has long relied on analytic models whose key assumptions remain debated. We present a direct and systematic evaluation of these assumptions using high-resolution 3D hydrodynamical simulations including the Coriolis force. We simulate streams overflowing from both the inner and outer Lagrangian points, quantify mass transfer rates, and compare them with analytic solutions. We introduce scaling factors, including the overfilling factor, to render the problem dimensionless. The donor-star models are simplified, with either an isentropic initial stratification and adiabatic evolution or an isothermal structure and evolution, but the scalability of this formulation allows us to extend the results for a mass-transferring system to arbitrarily small overfilling factors for the adiabatic case. We find that the Coriolis force -- often neglected in analytic models -- strongly impacts the stream morphology: breaking axial symmetry, reducing the stream cross section, and shifting its origin toward the donor's trailing side. Contrary to common assumptions, the sonic surface is not flat and does not always intersect the Lagrangian point: instead, it is concave and shifted, particularly toward the accretor's trailing side. Despite these structural asymmetries, mass transfer rates are only mildly suppressed relative to analytic predictions and the deviation is remarkably small -- within a factor of two (ten) for the inner (outer) Lagrangian point over seven orders of magnitude in mass ratio. We use our results to extend the widely-used mass-transfer rate prescriptions by Ritter(1988) and Kolb&amp;Ritter(1990), for both the inner and outer Lagrangian points. These extensions can be readily adopted in stellar evolution codes like MESA, with minimal changes where the original models are already in use.</description>

      <title>Revisiting GW150914 with a non-planar, eccentric waveform model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first direct detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO collaboration, GW150914, marked the start of a new exciting era in astronomy, enabling the study of the Universe through a new messenger. Since then, the field has grown rapidly, with the development of increasingly more sophisticated techniques to detect, analyze and interpret the signals. In this paper we revisit GW150914, presenting updated estimates of its source parameters using a waveform model developed within the EOB formalism, able to describe gravitational-wave emission from generic non-circular, non-planar binaries. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the signal and its properties, considering and contrasting various scenarios for the source: from the simplest, aligned-spin quasi-circular binary black hole merger, to more complex scenarios, including precession, eccentricity or both. Unsurprisingly, we find that the signal is consistent with a quasi-circular ($e &lt; 0.08$ at $15$ Hz), slowly spinning $(\chi_{\rm eff} = -0.03^{+0.12}_{-0.13})$ binary black hole merger, a-posteriori validating a considerable body of works. This is the first analysis performed with an inspiral-merger-ringdown model containing both eccentricity and precession.</description>

      <title>Jet-Feedback on kpc scales: a review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic jets from AGN are an important driver of feedback in galaxies. They interact with their environments over a wide range of physical scales during their lifetime, and an understanding of these interactions is crucial for unraveling the role of supermassive blackholes in shaping galaxy evolution. The impact of such jets have been traditionally considered in the context of heating the large-scale environments. However, in the last few decades there has been additional focus on the immediate impact of jet feedback on the host galaxy itself. In this review we outline the development of various numerical simulations since the onset of studies of jets to the present day, where sophisticated numerical techniques have been employed to study jet feedback including a range of physical processes. The jets can act as an important agent of injecting energy in the host's ISM, as confirmed both in observations of multi-phase gas, as well as in simulations. Such interactions have the potential to impact the kinematics of the gas as well as its star formation. We summarize the recent results from simulations of jet feedback on kpc scales, and outline the broader implications for observations and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GRANDProto300 (GP300) is a prototype array of the GRAND experiment, designed to validate the technique of autonomous radio-detection of astroparticles by detecting cosmic rays with energies between 10$^{17}$-10$^{18.5}$ eV. This observation will further enable the study of the Galactic-to-extragalactic source transition region. Between November 2024 u to May 2025, 46 out of 300 antennas have been operational and collecting data stably. We present here our cosmic-ray search pipeline, which involves several filtering steps: (1) coincidence search for signals triggering multiple antennas within a time window, (2) directional reconstruction of events, (3) exclusion of clustered (in time and space) noise events, (4) polarization cut, (5) selection based on the size of the footprint, and (6) other less mature cuts in this preliminary stage, including visual cuts. The efficiency of the pipeline is evaluated and applied to the first batch of data, yielding a set of cosmic-ray candidate events, which we present.</description>

      <title>Continuum Reverberation Mapping of Accretion Disks Surrounding Supermassive Black Hole Binaries: Observational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has remained challenging to reliably identify sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), despite them being expected to be ubiquitous. We propose a new method using multi-band continuum reverberation mapping to identify low-mass-ratio SMBHBs in active galactic nuclei. The basic principle is that, due to the presence of a low-density cavity between the mini-disks and the circumbinary disk, the continuum emissions show a deficit at certain wavelengths, leading to a distinguishing feature in the relation between the inter-band time lag and wavelengths $\tau(\lambda)$. Specifically, the relation appears flat at short wavelengths because of the truncated sizes of the mini-disks and transits to a power law $\lambda^{4/3}$ at long wavelength stemming from the circumbinary disk. This transition feature is distinct from the uniform relation $\lambda^{4/3}$ of the standard accretion disk around a single black hole. Using the lamp-post scenario and assuming that only the secondary black hole is active in a low-mass-ratio SMBHB, we design a simple continuum reverberation model to calculate the transfer function of the accretion disks and the resulting $\tau(\lambda)$ relations for various SMBHB orbital parameters. The transition wavelength typically can lie at UV/optical bands, mainly depending on the total mass and orbital separation of the SMBHB. We apply our SMBHB model to the intensive multiwavelength monitoring data of the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and find that the SMBHB model can reproduce the inter-band time lags. Remarkably, the inferred total mass and orbital period from the SMBHB fitting are consistent with values derived from other independent methods.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in Palatini gravity for a non-minimal geometry-matter coupling</title>

Abstract: We discuss the propagation of gravitational waves over a non-Riemannian spacetime, when a non-minimal coupling between the geometry and matter is considered in the form of contractions of the energy momentum tensor with the Ricci and co-Ricci curvature tensors. We focus our analysis on perturbations on a Minkowski background, elucidating how derivatives of the energy momentum tensor can sustain non-trivial torsion and non-metricity excitations, eventually resulting in additional source terms for the metric field. These can be reorganized in the form of D'Alembert operator acting on the energy momentum tensor and the equivalence principle can be reinforced at the linear level by a suitable choice of the parameters of the model. We show how tensor polarizations can exhibit a subluminal phase velocity in matter, evading the constraints found in General Relativity, and how this allows for the kinematic damping in specific configurations of the medium and of the geometry-matter coupling. These in turn define regions in the wavenumber space where propagation is forbidden, leading to the appearance of typical cut-off scale in the frequency spectrum.</description>

      <title>Numerical computation of electromagnetically sourced nonlinear tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20499</link>

Abstract: Amazingly, recent studies indicate that nonlinear effects are of great significance for modelling black hole ringdown. Transient electromagnetic events in the astrophysical environment are typically high-energetic, potentially responsible for some nonlinearities in ringdown. Motivated by the desire to understand these nonlinearities, we solve the inhomogeneous Bardeen-Press-Teukolsky equation numerically, and find second-order gravitational tails induced by an electromagnetic source. Our results suggest that the second-order tails of curvature perturbations with multipole numbers $l\geq4$ decay as $t^{-2l-2}$ at fixed spatial position and $u^{-l-3}$ in retarded-time $u$ at null infinity, slower than their linear counterparts, which can play a role in multi-messenger observations.</description>

      <title>The fate of rotating massive stars across cosmic times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial mass and metallicity of stars both have a strong impact on their fate. Stellar axial rotation also has a strong impact on the structure and evolution of massive stars. In this study, we exploit the large grid of GENEC models, covering initial masses from 9 to 500 $M_{\odot}$ and metallicities ranging from $Z=10^{-5}$ (nearly zero) to 0.02 (supersolar), to determine the impact of rotation on their fate across cosmic times. Using the carbon-oxygen core mass and envelope composition as indicators of their fate, we predict stellar remnants, supernova engines, and spectroscopic supernova types for both rotating and non-rotating stars. We derive rates of the different supernova and remnant types considering two initial mass functions to help solve puzzles such as the absence of observed pair-instability supernovae. We find that rotation significantly alters the remnant type and supernova engine, with rotating stars favouring black hole formation at lower initial masses than their non-rotating counterparts. Additionally, we confirm the expected strong metallicity dependence of the fates with a maximum black hole mass predicted to be below 50 $M_{\odot}$ at SMC or higher metallicities. A pair-instability mass gap is predicted between about 90 and 150 $M_{\odot}$, with the most massive black holes below the gap found at the lowest metallicities. Considering the fate of massive single stars has far-reaching consequences across many different fields within astrophysics, and understanding the impact of rotation and metallicity will improve our understanding of how massive stars end their lives, and their impact on the universe.</description>
