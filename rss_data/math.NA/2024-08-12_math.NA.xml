      <title>UGrid: An Efficient-And-Rigorous Neural Multigrid Solver for Linear PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical solvers of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are of fundamental significance to science and engineering. To date, the historical reliance on legacy techniques has circumscribed possible integration of big data knowledge and exhibits sub-optimal efficiency for certain PDE formulations, while data-driven neural methods typically lack mathematical guarantee of convergence and correctness. This paper articulates a mathematically rigorous neural solver for linear PDEs. The proposed UGrid solver, built upon the principled integration of U-Net and MultiGrid, manifests a mathematically rigorous proof of both convergence and correctness, and showcases high numerical accuracy, as well as strong generalization power to various input geometry/values and multiple PDE formulations. In addition, we devise a new residual loss metric, which enables unsupervised training and affords more stability and a larger solution space over the legacy losses.</description>

      <title>Regularization of linear machine learning problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the simplest version of a linear neural network (LNN). Assuming that for training (constructing an optimal weight matrix $Q$) we have a set of training pairs, i.e. we know the input data \begin{equation} G=\left\{g^{\left(1\right)},g^{\left(2\right)},\cdots,g^{\left(K\right)}\right\}, \end{equation} as well as the correct answers to these input data \begin{equation} H=\left\{h^{\left(1\right)},h^{\left(2\right)},\cdots,h^{\left(K\right)}\right\}. \end{equation} We will study the possibilities of constructing a weight matrix $Q$ of a neural network that will give correct answers to arbitrary input data based on the connection of the specified problem with a system of linear algebraic equations (SLAE). Consider a class of neural networks in which each neuron has only one output signal and performs linear operations. We will show how such LNEs are reduced to SLAEs. Since the questions $G$ and the correct answers $H$ are known to us, the desired weight matrix $Q$ must satisfy the equations \begin{equation} Qg^{\left(k\right)}=h^{\left(k\right)}, k=1,2,\cdots,K. \end{equation} It is required to restore $Q$. In the general case, the matrix $Q$ is rectangular $Q=Q_{MN}=\left\{q_{mn}\right\}$, $m$ is the row number, and $g^{\left(k\right)}\in\mathbb{R}^N$, $h^{\left(k\right)}\in\mathbb{R}^M$. Let $G_{NK}$ be a matrix composed of columns $g^{\left(1\right)}, g^{\left(2\right)},\cdots,g^{\left(k\right)}$, and $H_{MK}$ be a matrix composed of columns $h^{\left(1\right)},h^{\left(2\right)},\cdots,h^{\left(k\right)}$. Then, with respect to $Q_{MN}$, we obtain a matrix SLAE. \begin{equation} Q_{MN}G_{NK}=H_{MK}. \end{equation} This paper will present methods for regularizing the constructed system.</description>

      <title>Some notes concerning preconditioning of linear parabolic optimal control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the conditioning of optimal control problems constrained by linear parabolic equations with Neumann boundaries. While we concentrate on a given end-time target function the results hold also when the target function is given over the whole time horizon. When implicit time discretization and conforming finite elements in space are employed we show that the reduced problem formulation has condition numbers which are bounded independently of the discretization level in arbitrary space dimension. In addition we propose for the all-at-once approach, i.e. for the first order conditions of the unreduced system a preconditioner based on work by Greif and Sch\"otzau, which provides also bounds on the eigenvalue distribution independently of the discretization level. Numerical experiments demonstrate the obtained results and the efficiency of the suggested preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Meshfree Generalized Multiscale Exponential Integration Method for Parabolic Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers flow problems in multiscale heterogeneous porous media. The multiscale nature of the modeled process significantly complicates numerical simulations due to the need to compute huge and ill-conditioned sparse matrices, which negatively affect both the computational cost and the stability of the numerical solution. We propose a novel combined approach of the meshfree Generalized Multiscale Finite Element Method (MFGMsFEM) and exponential time integration for solving such problems. MFGMsFEM provides a robust and efficient spatial approximation, allowing us to consider complex heterogeneities without constructing a coarse computational grid. At the same time, exponential integration, using the cost-effective MFGMsFEM matrix, provides a robust temporal approximation for stiff multiscale problems, allowing larger time steps. For the proposed multiscale approach, we provide a rigorous convergence analysis, including the new analysis of the MFGMsFEM spatial approximation. We conduct numerical experiments to computationally verify the proposed approach by solving linear and semi-linear flow problems in multiscale media. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed multiscale method achieves significant reductions in computational cost and improved stability, even with larger time steps, confirming the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Learning a robust shape parameter for RBF approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial basis functions (RBFs) play an important role in function interpolation, in particular in an arbitrary set of interpolation nodes. The accuracy of the interpolation depends on a parameter called the shape parameter. There are many approaches in literature on how to appropriately choose it as to increase the accuracy of interpolation while avoiding instability issues. However, finding the optimal shape parameter value in general remains a challenge. We present a novel approach to determine the shape parameter in RBFs: we introduce a data-driven method that controls the condition of the interpolation matrix to avoid numerically unstable interpolations, while keeping a very good accuracy. In addition, we formulate a fall-back procedure that enforces a strict upper bound on the condition number of the generated interpolation matrix. We present numerical test cases to assess the performance of the proposed methods in interpolation tasks and in a RBF based finite difference (RBF-FD) method, in one and two-space dimensions.</description>

      <title>An augmented Lagrangian preconditioner for the control of the Navier--Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the solution of the distributed control problem for the steady, incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. We propose an inexact Newton linearization of the optimality conditions. Upon discretization by a finite element scheme, we obtain a sequence of large symmetric linear systems of saddle-point type. We use an augmented Lagrangian-based block triangular preconditioner in combination with the flexible GMRES method at each Newton step. The preconditioner is applied inexactly via a suitable multigrid solver. Numerical experiments indicate that the resulting method appears to be fairly robust with respect to viscosity, mesh size, and the choice of regularization parameter when applied to 2D problems.</description>

      <title>Numerical aspects of integration in physics-informed neural networks modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we numerically analyse problems that arise in numerical integration used in various problems that are nowadays being solved by physics-informed neural networks. In particular we show how inaccurately evaluated integrands can lead to severe precision problems. The tricky and serious part of the problem is especially in its detection, when for example a simple macroscopic visualization of the integrand does not indicate any potential problems and obtained results are often wrongly treated as correct. To solve the problem, it is crucial to decide if it is sufficient to evaluate the integrand in the standard double arithmetic or if a higher precision arithmetic has to be used. We compare and recommend numerical quadratures for selected examples and different parameter values, especially for problematic cases.</description>

      <title>A hybrid SIAC -- data-driven post-processing filter for discontinuities in solutions to numerical PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid filter that incorporates a mathematically accurate moment-based filter with a data driven filter for discontinuous Galerkin approximations to PDE solutions that contain discontinuities. Numerical solutions of PDEs suffer from an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ error in the neighborhood about discontinuities, especially for shock waves that arise in inviscid compressible flow problems. While post-processing filters, such as the Smoothness-Increasing Accuracy-Conserving (SIAC) filter, can improve the order of error in smooth regions, the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ error in the vicinity of a discontinuity remains. To alleviate this, we combine the SIAC filter with a data-driven filter based on Convolutional Neural Networks. The data-driven filter is specifically focused on improving the errors in discontinuous regions and therefore {\it only includes top-hat functions in the training dataset.} For both filters, a consistency constraint is enforced, while the SIAC filter additionally satisfies $r-$moments. This hybrid filter approach allows for maintaining the accuracy guaranteed by the theory in smooth regions while the hybrid SIAC-data-driven approach reduces the $\ell_2$ and $\ell_\infty$ errors about discontinuities. Thus, overall the global errors are reduced. We examine the performance of the hybrid filter about discontinuities for the one-dimensional Euler equations for the Lax, Sod, and sine-entropy (Shu-Osher) shock-tube problems.</description>

      <title>Modelling parametric uncertainty in PDEs models via Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an approach enabling one to employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for uncertainty quantification. Our approach is applicable to systems where observations are scarce (or even lacking), these being typical situations associated with subsurface water bodies. Our novel physics-informed neural network under uncertainty (PINN-UU) integrates the space-time domain across which processes take place and uncertain parameter spaces within a unique computational domain. PINN-UU is then trained to satisfy the relevant physical principles (e.g., mass conservation) in the defined input domain. We employ a stage training approach via transfer learning to accommodate high-dimensional solution spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PINN-UU in a scenario associated with reactive transport in porous media, showcasing its reliability, efficiency, and applicability to sensitivity analysis. PINN-UU emerges as a promising tool for robust uncertainty quantification, with broad applicability to groundwater systems. As such, it can be considered as a valuable alternative to traditional methods such as multi-realization Monte Carlo simulations based on direct solvers or black-box surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Cost Attribution And Risk-Averse Unit Commitment In Power Grids Using Integrated Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to addressing uncertainty and associated risks in power system management, focusing on the discrepancies between forecasted and actual values of load demand and renewable power generation. By employing Economic Dispatch (ED) with both day-ahead forecasts and actual values, we derive two distinct system costs, revealing the financial risks stemming from uncertainty. We present a numerical algorithm inspired by the Integrated Gradients (IG) method to attribute the contribution of stochastic components to the difference in system costs. This method, originally developed for machine learning, facilitates the understanding of individual input features' impact on the model's output prediction. By assigning numeric values to represent the influence of variability on operational costs, our method provides actionable insights for grid management. As an application, we propose a risk-averse unit commitment framework, leveraging our cost attribution algorithm to adjust the capacity of renewable generators, thus mitigating system risk. Simulation results on the RTS-GMLC grid demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving grid reliability and reducing operational costs.</description>

      <title>Interpolating Refinable Functions and $n_s$-step Interpolatory Subdivision Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard interpolatory subdivision schemes and their underlying interpolating refinable functions are of interest in CAGD, numerical PDEs, and approximation theory. Generalizing these notions, we introduce and study $n_s$-step interpolatory $M$-subdivision schemes and their interpolating $M$-refinable functions with $n_s\in \mathbb{N} \cup\{\infty\}$ and a dilation factor $M\in \mathbb{N}\backslash\{1\}$. We completely characterize $\mathscr{C}^m$-convergence and smoothness of $n_s$-step interpolatory subdivision schemes and their interpolating $M$-refinable functions in terms of their masks. Inspired by $n_s$-step interpolatory stationary subdivision schemes, we further introduce the notion of $r$-mask quasi-stationary subdivision schemes, and then we characterize their $\mathscr{C}^m$-convergence and smoothness properties using only their masks. Moreover, combining $n_s$-step interpolatory subdivision schemes with $r$-mask quasi-stationary subdivision schemes, we can obtain $r n_s$-step interpolatory subdivision schemes. Examples and construction procedures of convergent $n_s$-step interpolatory $M$-subdivision schemes are provided to illustrate our results with dilation factors $M=2,3,4$. In addition, for the dyadic dilation $M=2$ and $r=2,3$, using $r$ masks with only two-ring stencils, we provide examples of $\mathscr{C}^r$-convergent $r$-step interpolatory $r$-mask quasi-stationary dyadic subdivision schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper we study absolute error of sampling discretization of the integral $L_p$-norm for function classes of continuous functions. We use basic approaches from chaining technique to provide general upper bounds for the error of sampling discretization of the $L_p$-norm on a given function class in terms of entropy numbers in the uniform norm of this class. As an example we apply these general results to obtain new error bounds for sampling discretization of the $L_p$-norms on classes of multivariate functions with mixed smoothness. In the second part of the paper we apply our general bounds to study the problem of universal sampling discretization.</description>

      <title>Tree quasi-separable matrices: a simultaneous generalization of sequentially and hierarchically semi-separable representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unification and generalization of what is known in the literature as sequentially and hierarchically semi-separable (SSS and HSS) representations for matrices. Describing rank-structured representations of (inverses of) sparse matrices whose adjacency graph is a tree, it is shown that these so-called tree quasi-separable (TQS) matrices inherit all the favorable algebraic properties of SSS and HSS under addition, products, and inversion. To arrive at these properties, we prove a key result that characterizes the conversion of any dense matrix into a TQS representation. Here, we specifically show through an explicit construction procedure that the generator sizes are dictated by the ranks of certain Hankel blocks of the matrix. Analogous to SSS and HSS, TQS matrices admit fast matrix-vector products and direct solvers provided the generator sizes are small. A sketch of the associated algorithms is provided.</description>

      <title>Determinants and Inverses of banded Toeplitz Matrices over $\mathbb{F}_p$ Are Periodic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Banded Toeplitz matrices over $\mathbb{F}_p$, as a well-known class of matrices, have been extensively studied in the fields of coding theory and automata theory. In this paper, we discover that both determinants and inverses of banded Toeplitz matrices over $\mathbb{F}_p$ exhibit periodicity. For a Toeplitz matrix with bandwidth $k$, The period $P(f)$ is related to the parameters on the band and is independent of the order, with an upper limit of $P(f) \le p^{k-1}-1$. We provide an algorithm which can compute the determinant of any order banded Toeplitz matrix within $O(k^4)$. And its inverse can be represented by three submatrices of size $P(f)*P(f)$ located respectively on the diagonal, above the diagonal, and below the diagonal. Thus, the computational cost for calculating the inverse is fixed, and our algorithm can solve it within $O(k^5)+3kP(f)^2$. This is the first time that the periodicity of determinants and inverses of general banded Toeplitz matrices over $\mathbb{F}_p$ has been computed and proven.</description>

      <title>A Low-Frequency-Stable Higher-Order Isogeometric Discretization of the Augmented Electric Field Integral Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This contribution investigates the connection between isogeometric analysis and integral equation methods for full-wave electromagnetic problems up to the low-frequency limit. The proposed spline-based integral equation method allows for an exact representation of the model geometry described in terms of non-uniform rational B-splines without meshing. This is particularly useful when high accuracy is required or when meshing is cumbersome for instance during optimization of electric components. The augmented electric field integral equation is adopted and the deflation method is applied, so the low-frequency breakdown is avoided. The extension to higher-order basis functions is analyzed and the convergence rate is discussed. Numerical experiments on academic and realistic test cases demonstrate the high accuracy of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: We present Wideband back-projection diffusion, an end-to-end probabilistic framework for approximating the posterior distribution induced by the inverse scattering map from wideband scattering data. This framework leverages conditional diffusion models coupled with the underlying physics of wave-propagation and symmetries in the problem, to produce highly accurate reconstructions. The framework introduces a factorization of the score function into a physics-based latent representation inspired by the filtered back-propagation formula and a conditional score function conditioned on this latent representation. These two steps are also constrained to obey symmetries in the formulation while being amenable to compression by imposing the rank structure found in the filtered back-projection formula. As a result, empirically, our framework is able to provide sharp reconstructions effortlessly, even recovering sub-Nyquist features in the multiple-scattering regime. It has low-sample and computational complexity, its number of parameters scales sub-linearly with the target resolution, and it has stable training dynamics.</description>
