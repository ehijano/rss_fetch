      <title>Isochronous bifurcations dependence on the driving mode phase shift in two-harmonic standard maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some dynamical properties of nonlinear coupled systems can be described by the two-harmonic standard map, a two-dimensional area-preserving system with two parameters, where two distinct arbitrary resonant modes compete. Usually, the initial phase of the resonant modes is considered to be null. In this paper, we consider a non-null phase shift between the two competing isochronous modes that form the system. We observe that a non-zero phase shift alters the phase space, changing the stability and positions of the fixed points. Furthermore, the phase shift can change the dominant mode and create intermediate modes between the main ones. Lastly, we analyze the effect of the phase shift on the onset of secondary shearless curves in the phase space. Thus, different phase shifts result in various scenarios in which secondary shearless curves emerge in the phase space.</description>

      <title>Emergent oscillations and chaos in non-compliant microfluidic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incompressible fluids in microfluidic networks with non-rigid channels can exhibit flow rate oscillations analogous to electric current oscillations in RLC circuits. This is due to the elastic deformation of channel walls that can store and release fluid, as electric capacitors can store and release electric charges. This property is quantified through the compliance of the system, defined as the volume change relative to the pressure change. In systems with rigid walls and incompressible fluid, compliance vanishes and no oscillations can occur through this mechanism. Here, we show that not only oscillations but also chaos can emerge in the flow-rate dynamics of non-compliant microfluidic networks with incompressible fluid. Notably, these dynamics emerge spontaneously, even under time-independent driving pressures. The underlying mechanism is governed by the effect of fluid inertia, which becomes relevant at moderate Reynolds numbers observed in microfluidic systems exhibiting complex flow patterns. The results are established using a combination of direct numerical simulations and a reduced model derived from modal analysis. This approach enables us to determine the onset of oscillations, the associated bifurcations, the oscillation frequencies and amplitudes, and their dependence on the driving pressures. These findings can inspire novel studies and applications of previously unexplored oscillatory and chaotic regimes in non-compliant microfluidic systems.</description>
