      <title>A class of linear operators on Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the boundedness of the linear operator $S$ on $L^{p}_{a}(dA_{\alpha})$ $(0&lt;p&lt;\infty)$. In particular, we obtain a sufficient and necessary condition for the compactness of the linear operator $S$ on $L^{p}_{a}(dA_{\alpha})$ $(1&lt;p&lt;\infty)$. Our results weaken the assumptions of earlier results of J. Miao and D. Zheng in a certain sense.</description>

      <title>Linear maps on $\mathcal{L}(\ell_p^n,\ell_p^m)$, $(p\in \{1,\infty\})$ preserving parallel pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two vectors $x,y$ of a Banach space are said to form a parallel (resp. triangle equality attaining or TEA) pair if $\|x+\lambda y\|=\|x\|+\|y\|$ holds for some scalar $\lambda$ with $|\lambda|=1$ (resp. $\lambda=1$). For $p\in \{1,\infty\},$ and $ m,n\geq 2,$ we study the linear maps $T: \mathcal{L}(\ell_p^n, \ell_p^m) \to \mathcal{L}(\ell_p^n,\ell_p^m)$ that preserve parallel (resp. TEA) pairs, that is, those linear maps $T$ for which $T(A),T(B)$ form a parallel (resp. TEA) pair whenever $A,B$ form a parallel (resp. TEA) pair of $\mathcal{L}(\ell_p^n,\ell_p^m).$ We prove that if $T$ is non-zero, then the following are equivalent:
  (1) $T$ preserves TEA pairs.
  (2) $T$ preserves parallel pairs and rank$(T)&gt;1$.
  (3) $T$ preserves parallel pairs and $T$ is invertible.
  (4) $T$ is a scalar multiple of an isometry.</description>

      <title>On Whitney-type extension theorems for $C^{1,+}$, $C^2$, $C^{2,+}$, and $C^3$-smooth mappings between Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1973 J. C. Wells showed that a variant of the Whitney extension theorem holds for $C^{1,1}$-smooth real-valued functions on Hilbert spaces. In 2021 D. Azagra and C. Mudarra generalised this result to $C^{1,\omega}$-smooth functions on certain super-reflexive spaces. We show that while the vector-valued version of these results do hold in some rare cases (when the target space is an injective Banach space, e.g. $\ell_\infty$), it does not hold for mappings from infinite-dimensional spaces into "somewhat euclidean" spaces (e.g. infinite-dimensional spaces of a non-trivial type), and neither does the $C^2$-smooth variant. Further, we prove negative results concerning the real-valued $C^{2,+}$, $C^{2,\omega}$, and $C^3$-smooth versions generalising older results of J. C. Wells.</description>

      <title>Littlewood-Paley square functions and the local Hardy space for Multi-Norm Structures on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-norm singular integrals and Fourier multipliers were introduced in [29], and one application of these notions was a precise description of the composition of convolution operators with Calder\'on-Zygmund kernels adapted to $n$ different families of dilations. The description of the resulting operators was given in terms of differential inequalities specified by a matrix $\mathbf E$, and in terms of dyadic decompositions of the kernels and multipliers. In this paper we extend the analysis of multi-norm structures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ by studying the induced Littlewood-Paley decomposition of the frequency space and various associated square functions. After establishing their $L^1$-equivalence, we use these square functions to define a local multi-norm Hardy space $\mathbf{h}^{1}_{\mathbf{E}}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. We give several equivalent descriptions of this space, including an atomic characterization. There has been recent work, limited to the $2$-dilation case, by other authors. The general $n$-dilation case treated here is considerably harder and requires new ideas and a more systematic approach.</description>

      <title>An order-theoretic characterization of JB-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an order-theoretic characterization of the JB-algebras among the complete order unit spaces in terms of the existence of an order-anti-automorphism of the interior of the cone that is homogeneous of degree -1. More geometrically, we characterize JB-algebras as those complete order unit spaces for which the interior of the cone is a symmetric Banach--Finsler manifold under Thompson's metric. Furthermore, we show that two order unit spaces are isomorphic if there exists a gauge-reversing bijection between them, thus answering a question raised by Noll--Sch\"afer. These results have previously been established for finite-dimensional resp. reflexive order unit spaces by Walsh and Lemmens--R.--Wortel.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional model spaces invariant under composition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-dimensional model spaces are quotient spaces of the Hardy space on the open unit disc, determined by finite Blaschke products. Composition operators, on the other hand, act by composing Hardy space functions with analytic self-maps of the open unit disc. Both are classical and well-studied objects in the theory of analytic function spaces. In this paper, we present a complete characterization of finite-dimensional model spaces that are invariant under composition operators. Finite cyclic groups and the prime factorizations of natural numbers play a crucial role in understanding the structure of such invariant subspaces and the associated analytic self-maps.</description>

      <title>Generalized weighted EP elements in Banach algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new class of generalized inverses with weights, which represent a natural extension of EP (Moore-Penrose) and *-DMP (Drazin-Moore-Penrose) elements in a Banach *-algebra. This paper presents various characteristics of weighted EP elements. Moreover, we characterize the weighted EP element through the core-EP decomposition and a polar-like property. Finally, we explore weighted *-DMP elements and uncover several new properties of *-DMP elements.</description>

      <title>Dunkl paraproducts and fractional Leibniz rules for the Dunkl Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish fractional Leibniz rules for the Dunkl Laplacian $\Delta_k$ of the form $$\|(-\Delta_k)^s(fg)\|_{L^p(d\mu_k)} \lesssim \|(-\Delta_k)^s f\|_{L^{p_1}(d\mu_k)} \|g\|_{L^{p_2}(d\mu_k)} + \|f\|_{L^{p_1}(d\mu_k)} \|(-\Delta_k)^s g\|_{L^{p_2}(d\mu_k)}.$$ Our approach relies on adapting the classical paraproduct decomposition to the Dunkl setting. In the process, we develop several new auxiliary results. Specifically, we show that for a Schwartz function $f$, the function $(-\Delta_k)^s f$ satisfies a pointwise decay estimate; we establish a version of almost orthogonality estimates adapted to the Dunkl framework; and we investigate the boundedness of Dunkl paraproduct operators on the Lebesgue spaces.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: Hadamard powers and tensor products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore and generalize a Cauchy-Schwarz-type inequality originally proved in [Electronic Journal of Linear Algebra 35, 156-180 (2019)]: $\|\mathbf{v}^2\|\|\mathbf{w}^2\| - \langle\mathbf{v}^2,\mathbf{w}^2\rangle \leq \|\mathbf{v}\|^2\|\mathbf{w}\|^2 - \langle\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\rangle^2$ for all $\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. We present three new proofs of this inequality that better illustrate "why" it is true and generalize it in several different ways: we generalize from vectors to matrices, we explore which exponents other than 2 result in the inequality holding, and we derive a version of the inequality involving three or more vectors.</description>

      <title>Annealed almost periodic entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies certain notions of entropy that can be associated to (i) a representation of a separable, unital C*-algebra $\mathfrak{A}$ and (ii) an auxiliary random sequence $(\pi_n)_{n\ge 1}$ of finite-dimensional representations of $\mathfrak{A}$. This continues a previous research program into the properties of these entropy notions when each $\pi_n$ is deterministic, which uncovered a range of analogies with entropy in ergodic theory and also with non-commutative generalizations of Szeg\H{o}'s limit theorems.
  We associate two new notions of entropy to data as in (i) and (ii) above: `annealed' AP entropy, which is roughly a kind of first-moment average of deterministic AP entropies; and `zeroth-order' AP entropy, which controls the large deviations probabilities that certain positive definite functions appear in the representations $\pi_n$ at all.
  After developing some of this general theory, we then focus on the special case in which $\mathfrak{A}$ is the group C*-algebra of a finitely-generated free group and each $\pi_n$ is generated by choosing a tuple of $n$-by-$n$ unitary matrices independently at random from Haar measure. In that case, explicit formulas can be derived for some of our notions of entropy, and new large deviations principles in random matrix theory are obtained as a consequence.</description>

      <title>A pseudospectral approach to rigorous numerical estimation of Ruelle resonances of transfer operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonances, isolated eigenvalues of a transfer operator acting on suitably chosen Banach spaces, play a fundamental role in understanding the statistical properties of chaotic dynamical systems. In this paper, we introduce a pseudospectral approach, inspired by Householder's theorem, for the rigorous, computer-assisted estimation of resonances, providing regions where resonances must exist and precluding the presence of resonances elsewhere. The approach is general, and applies to the transfer operators of a wide variety of chaotic systems, including Anosov/ Axiom A diffeomorphisms and piecewise expanding maps. We implement this approach computationally for a class of analytic uniformly expanding maps of the circle. We anticipate that the pseudospectral framework developed here will be broadly applicable to other spectral problems in dynamical systems and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the connection between cyclic quasi-monotonicity and quasi-convexity, focusing on whether every cyclically quasi-monotone (possibly multivalued) map is included in the normal cone operator of a quasi-convex function, in analogy with Rockafellar's theorem for convex functions. We provide a positive answer for $\mathscr{C}^1$-regular, non-vanishing maps in any dimension, as well as for general multi-maps in dimension $1$. We further discuss connections to revealed preference theory in economics and to $L^\infty$ optimal transport. Finally, we present explicit constructions and examples, highlighting the main challenges that arise in the general case.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Wasserstein Barycenters: The Analysis Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of estimating a matrix that encodes pairwise distances in a finite metric space (or, more generally, the edge weight matrix of a network) under the barycentric coding model (BCM) with respect to the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance function. We frame this task as estimating the unknown barycentric coordinates with respect to the GW distance, assuming that the target matrix (or kernel) belongs to the set of GW barycenters of a finite collection of known templates. In the language of harmonic analysis, if computing GW barycenters can be viewed as a synthesis problem, this paper aims to solve the corresponding analysis problem. We propose two methods: one utilizing fixed-point iteration for computing GW barycenters, and another employing a differentiation-based approach to the GW structure using a blow-up technique. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the proposed GW analysis approach in a series of numerical experiments and applications to machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a mathematical framework for indiscernibility of quantum states, arguing that, given a set of observables, the ``distinguishable objects'' are the equivalence classes modulo indiscernibility relative to the observables. The structure of the set of distinguishable objects - called the Holevo space - is investigated in detail, and it is shown that the observables admit a natural lift to continuous functions on the Holevo space. The theory is illustrated by several examples where the ``distinguishable objects'' can be described explicitly. Among other things, the Holevo spaces and the lifted functions are described for position measurements on a free particle and for spin measurements in the EPR and Bell experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a smooth connected manifold, we consider all possible locally elliptic and locally bounded measurable coefficient Riemannian metrics called rough Riemannian metrics. We equip this set with an extended metric which is connected if and only if the manifold is compact. We prove that this is a complete length extended metric space and the components on which the distance is finite are path-connected. Moreover, we identify the closure of smooth metrics in this space to be continuous metrics.</description>

Abstract: We propose an improved strategy for point sources tracking in a temporal stack through an off-the-grid fashion, inspired by the Benamou-Brenier regularisation in the literature. We define a lifting of the problem in the higher-dimensional space of the roto-translation group. This allows us to overcome the theoretical limitation of the off-the-grid method towards tangled point source trajectories, thus enabling the reconstruction and untangling even from the numerical standpoint. We define accordingly a new regularisation based on the relaxed Reeds-Shepp metric, an approximation of the sub-Riemannian Reeds-Shepp metric, further allowing control on the local curvature of the recovered trajectories. Then, we derive some properties of the discretisation and prove a $\Gamma$-convergence result, fostering interest for practical applications of polygonal, B\'ezier, and piecewise geodesic discretisation. We finally test our proposed method on a localisation problem example, and give a fair comparison with the state-of-the-art off-the-grid method.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fej\'er monotone sequences and their finitary content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide quantitative and abstract strong convergence results for sequences from a compact metric space satisfying a certain form of \emph{generalized Fej\'er monotonicity} where (1) the metric can be replaced by a much more general type of function measuring distances (including, in particular, certain Bregman distances), (2) full Fej\'er monotonicity is relaxed to a partial variant and (3) the distance functions are allowed to vary along the iteration. For such sequences, the paper provides explicit and effective rates of metastability and even rates of convergence, the latter under a regularity assumption that generalizes the notion of metric regularity introduced by Kohlenbach, L\'opez-Acedo and Nicolae, itself an abstract generalization of many regularity notions from the literature.
  In the second part of the paper, we apply the abstract quantitative results established in the first part to two algorithms: one algorithm for approximating zeros of maximally monotone and maximally $\rho$-comonotone operators in Hilbert spaces (in the sense of Combettes and Pennanen as well as Bauschke, Moursi and Wang) that incorporates inertia terms \emph{every other} term and another algorithm for approximating zeros of monotone operators in Banach spaces (in the sense of Browder) that is only Fej\'er monotone w.r.t.\ a certain Bregman distance.</description>

      <title>The Sz\'asz inequality for matrix polynomials and functional calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08965v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sz\'asz inequality is a classical result that provides a bound for polynomials with zeros in the upper half of the complex plane, expressed in terms of their low-order coefficients. Generalizations of this result to polynomials in several variables have been obtained by Borcea-Br\"and\'en and Knese.
  In this article, we discuss the Sz\'asz inequality in the context of polynomials with matrix coefficients or matrix variables. In the latter case, the estimation provided by the Sz\'asz-type inequality can be sharper than that offered by the von Neumann inequality.
  As a byproduct, we improve the scalar Sz\'asz inequality by relaxing the assumption regarding the location of zeros.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study inclusion relations between Gelfand-Shilov type spaces defined via a weight (multi-)sequence system, a weight function system, and a translation-invariant Banach function space. We characterize when such spaces are included into one another in terms of growth relations for the defining weight sequence and function systems. Our general framework allows for a unified treatment of the Gelfand-Shilov spaces $\mathcal{S}^{[M]}_{[A]}$ (defined via weight sequences $M$ and $A$) and the Beurling-Bj\"orck spaces $\mathcal{S}^{[\omega]}_{[\eta]}$ (defined via weight functions $\omega$ and $\eta$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey recent developments on the structure of complemented subspaces of Banach lattices, including in particular the construction of a complemented subspace of a $C(K)$-space which is not linearly isomorphic to any Banach lattice. Motivated by this, several natural questions and directions of future research are presented. We provide an approach to some of these problems using tools from the theory of free Banach lattices.</description>

      <title>A new proof of Lee's conjecture on the Frobenius norm via the matrix Cauchy-Schwarz inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2010, Eun-Young Lee conjectured that if $A,B$ are two $n\times n$ complex matrices and $\left|A\right|, \left|B\right|$ are the absolute values of $A, B$, respectively, then \[ \|A+B\|_F\le \sqrt{\dfrac{1+\sqrt{2}}{2}}\|\left|A\right|+\left|B\right|\|_F, \] where $\|\cdot\|_F$ is the Frobenius norm of matrices. This conjecture has been proven by Lin and Zhang [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 516 (2022) 126542] by studying inequalities for the angle between two matrices induced by the Frobenius inner product. In this paper, we present a new proof of the same result, relying solely on the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.</description>

      <title>The Daugavet property is equivalent to the polynomial Daugavet property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we prove that the Daugavet property implies the polynomial Daugavet property, solving a longstanding open problem in the field. Our approach is based on showing that a geometric characterization of the Daugavet property due to Shvidkoy, originally formulated in terms of the weak topology, remains valid when the weak topology is replaced by the weak polynomial topology. Using similar techniques, we further establish that every linear Daugavet center is also a polynomial Daugavet center, and that the weak operator Daugavet property implies its polynomial counterpart. As an application of the latter result, we present new examples of Banach spaces whose $N$-fold symmetric tensor products satisfy the Daugavet property.</description>

      <title>The Strong Law of Large Numbers for random semigroups on uniformly smooth Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider random linear continuous operators $\Omega \to \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{X})$ on a Banach space $\mathcal{X}$. For example, such random operators may be random quantum channels. The Law of Large Numbers is known when $\mathcal{X}$ is a Hilbert space, in the form of the usual Law of Large Numbers for random operators, and in some other particular cases. Instead of the sum of i.i.d. variables, there may be considered the composition of random semigroups $e^{A_it/n}$. We obtain the Strong Law of Large Numbers in Strong Operator Topology for random semigroups of bounded linear operators on a uniformly smooth Banach space. We also develop another approach giving the SLLN in Weak Operator Topology for all Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>The Weighted $L^p$ Minkowski Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20064v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem in convex geometry concerns showing a given Borel measure on the unit sphere is, up to perhaps a constant, some type of surface area measure of a convex body. Two types of Minkowski problems in particular are an active area of research: $L^p$ Minkowski problems, introduced by Lutwak and (Lutwak,Yang, and Zhang), and weighted Minkowski problems, introduced by Livshyts. For the latter, the Gaussian Minkowski problem, whose primary investigators were (Huang, Xi and Zhao), is the most prevalent. In this work, we consider weighted surface area in the $L^p$ setting. We propose a framework going beyond the Gaussian setting by focusing on rotational invariant measures, mirroring the recent development of the Gardner-Zvavitch inequality for rotational invariant, log-concave measures. Our results include existence for all $p \in \mathbb R$ (with symmetry assumptions in certain instances). We also have uniqueness for $p \geq 1$ under a concavity assumption. Finally, we obtain results in the so-called $small$ $mass$ $regime$ using degree theory, as instigated in the Gaussian case by (Huang, Xi and Zhao). Most known results for the Gaussian Minkowski problem are then special cases of our main theorems.</description>

      <title>Estimates on the decay of the Laplace-Polya integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laplace--P\'olya integral, defined by $J_n(r) = \frac1\pi\int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathrm{sinc}^n t \cos(rt) \mathrm{d} \, t$, appears in several areas of mathematics. We study this quantity by combinatorial methods; accordingly, our investigation focuses on the values at integer $r$'s. Our main result establishes a lower bound for the ratio $\frac{J_n(r+2)}{J_n(r)}$ which extends and generalises the previous estimates of Lesieur and Nicolas, and provides a natural counterpart to the upper estimate established in our previous work. We derive the statement by purely combinatorial, elementary arguments. As a corollary, we deduce that no subdiagonal central sections of the unit cube are extremal, apart from the minimal, maximal, and the main diagonal sections. We also prove several consequences for Eulerian numbers.</description>

      <title>A spectral radius for matrices over an operator space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With every operator space structure $\mathcal{E}$ on $\mathbb{C}^d$, we associate a spectral radius function $\rho_{\mathcal{E}}$ on $d$-tuples of operators. For a $d$-tuple $X = (X_1, \ldots, X_d) \in M_n(\mathbb{C}^d)$ of matrices we show that $\rho_{\mathcal{E}}(X)&lt;1$ if and only if $X$ is jointly similar to a tuple in the open unit ball of $M_n(\mathcal{E})$, that is, there is an invertible matrix $S$ such that $\|S^{-1}X S\|_{M_n(\mathcal{E})}&lt;1$, where $S^{-1} X S =(S^{-1} X_1 S, \ldots, S^{-1} X_d S)$. When $\mathcal{E}$ is the row operator space, for example, our spectral radius coincides with the joint spectral radius considered by Bunce, Popescu, and others, and we recover the condition for a tuple of matrices to be simultaneously similar to a strict row contraction. When $\mathcal{E}$ is the minimal operator space $\min(\ell^\infty_d)$, our spectral radius $\rho_{\mathcal{E}}$ is related to the joint spectral radius considered by Rota and Strang but differs from it and has the advantage that $\rho_{\mathcal{E}}(X)&lt;1$ if and only if $X$ is simultaneously similar to a tuple of strict contractions. We show that for a nc rational function $f$ with descriptor realization $(A,b,c)$, the spectral radius $\rho_{\mathcal{E}}(A)&lt;1$ if and only the domain of $f$ contains a neighborhood of the noncommutative closed unit ball of the operator space dual $\mathcal{E}^*$ of $\mathcal{E}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general approach for quantitative convergence analysis of non-reversible Markov processes, based on the concept of second-order lifts and a variational approach to hypocoercivity. To this end, we introduce the flow Poincar\'e inequality, a space-time Poincar\'e inequality along trajectories of the semigroup, and a general divergence lemma based only on the Dirichlet form of an underlying reversible diffusion. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by applying it to a pair of run-and-tumble particles with jamming, a model from non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and several piecewise deterministic Markov processes used in sampling applications, in particular including general stochastic jump kernels.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we develop the following general approach. We study asymptotic behavior of the entropy numbers not for an individual smoothness class, how it is usually done, but for the collection of classes, which are defined by integral operators with kernels coming from a given class of functions. Earlier, such approach was realized for the Kolmogorov widths.</description>
