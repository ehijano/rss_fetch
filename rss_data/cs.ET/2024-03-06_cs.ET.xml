      <title>DOCTOR: Dynamic On-Chip Remediation Against Temporally-Drifting Thermal Variations Toward Self-Corrected Photonic Tensor Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic computing has emerged as a promising solution for accelerating computation-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, offering unparalleled speed and energy efficiency, especially in resource-limited, latency-sensitive edge computing environments. However, the deployment of analog photonic tensor accelerators encounters reliability challenges due to hardware noises and environmental variations. While off-chip noise-aware training and on-chip training have been proposed to enhance the variation tolerance of optical neural accelerators with moderate, static noises, we observe a notable performance degradation over time due to temporally drifting variations, which requires a real-time, in-situ calibration mechanism. To tackle this challenging reliability issues, for the first time, we propose a lightweight dynamic on-chip remediation framework, dubbed DOCTOR, providing adaptive, in-situ accuracy recovery against temporally drifting noises. The DOCTOR framework intelligently monitors the chip status using adaptive probing and performs fast in-situ training-free calibration to restore accuracy when necessary. Recognizing nonuniform spatial variation distributions across devices and tensor cores, we also propose a variation-aware architectural remapping strategy to avoid executing critical tasks on noisy devices. Extensive experiments show that our proposed framework can guarantee sustained performance under drifting variations with 34% higher accuracy and 2-3 orders-of-magnitude lower overhead compared to state-of-the-art on-chip training methods.</description>

      <title>Spintronic Implementation of UNet for Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image segmentation plays a crucial role in computer vision applications like self-driving cars, satellite imagery analysis, and medical diagnosis. Implementing these complex deep neural networks on conventional hardware is highly inefficient. In this work, we propose hardware implementation of UNet for segmentation tasks, using spintronic devices. Our approach involves designing hardware for convolution, deconvolution, ReLU, and max pooling layers of the UNet architecture. We demonstrate the synaptic behavior of the domain wall MTJ, and design convolution and deconvolution layers using the domain wall-based crossbar array. We utilize the orthogonal current injected MTJ with its continuous resistance change and showcase the ReLU and max pooling functions. We employ a hybrid simulation setup by coupling micromagnetic simulation, non-equilibrium Green's function, Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equations, and circuit simulation with Python programming to incorporate the diverse physics of spin-transport, magnetization dynamics, and CMOS elements in our proposed designs. We evaluate our UNet design on the CamVid dataset and achieve segmentation accuracies that are comparable to software implementation. During training, our design consumes 43.59pJ of energy for synaptic weight updates.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum programming with PennyLane Lightning on HPC platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce PennyLane's Lightning suite, a collection of high-performance state-vector simulators targeting CPU, GPU, and HPC-native architectures and workloads. Quantum applications such as QAOA, VQE, and synthetic workloads are implemented to demonstrate the supported classical computing architectures and showcase the scale of problems that can be simulated using our tooling. We benchmark the performance of Lightning with backends supporting CPUs, as well as NVidia and AMD GPUs, and compare the results to other commonly used high-performance simulator packages, demonstrating where Lightning's implementations give performance leads. We show improved CPU performance by employing explicit SIMD intrinsics and multi-threading, batched task-based execution across multiple GPUs, and distributed forward and gradient-based quantum circuit executions across multiple nodes. Our data shows we can comfortably simulate a variety of circuits, giving examples with up to 30 qubits on a single device or node, and up to 41 qubits using multiple nodes.</description>

      <title>Highly Reproducible and CMOS-compatible VO2-based Oscillators for Brain-inspired Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With remarkable electrical and optical switching properties induced at low power and near room temperature (68C), vanadium dioxide (VO2) has sparked rising interest in unconventional computing among the phase-change materials research community. The scalability and the potential to compute beyond the von Neumann model make VO2 especially appealing for implementation in oscillating neural networks for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, to solve constraint satisfaction problems, and for pattern recognition. Its integration into large networks of oscillators on a Silicon platform still poses challenges associated with the stabilization in the correct oxidation state and the ability to fabricate a structure with predictable electrical behavior showing very low variability. In this work, the role played by the different annealing parameters applied by three methods (slow thermal annealing, flash annealing, and rapid thermal annealing), following the vanadium oxide atomic layer deposition (ALD), on the formation of VO2 grains is studied and an optimal substrate stack configuration that minimizes variability between devices is proposed. Material and electrical characterizations are performed on the different films and a step-by-step recipe to build reproducible VO2-based oscillators is presented, which is argued to be made possible thanks to the introduction of a hafnium oxide (HfO2) layer between the silicon substrate and the vanadium oxide layer. Up to seven nearly identical VO2-based devices are contacted simultaneously to create a network of oscillators, paving the way for large-scale implementation of VO2 oscillating neural networks.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Electro-optic Resonant Phase Shifting for Multi-dimensional, Ultra-dynamic Photonic Switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical circuit switching is connection-oriented, being deterministic through the reservation of a complete wavelength channel or spatial path for a certain period. However, this comes at a trade-off against link dynamics, and overall capacity can thus be constrained by the time slot reservations, especially for switches with microsecond- to millisecond-scale reconfiguration times. For data-intensive applications, the communication patterns associated with random data sets typically yield short-lived flows. This situation calls for a new multi-dimensional switching paradigm that fully exploits not only the space and wavelength domains but also with nanosecond-scale reconfigurable capability in the time domain to enable ultra-dynamic links. In this work, we focus on the exploitation of micro-ring resonant phase shifters (RPSs) that are wavelength selective for optical switching in a single plane. By proposing an innovative analytical method with transmission circle chart, we fully unlock the power of RPS with nanosecond-scale reconfigurability and the capability to arbitrarily manipulate its phase and amplitude. Such a compact model offers fresh insights into designs with under and critically coupled RPSs beyond the commonly explored over-coupling condition. This creates not only versatile switch elements but also perfect absorbers for robust multi-wavelength operations. The proposed device can bring about a breakthrough in the optical switching capacity that potentially addresses the challenges faced by modern data center networks, as well as other photonic circuits for high-throughput signal processing.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thesis investigates the utilization of memristive and memcapacitive crossbar arrays in low-power machine learning accelerators, offering a comprehensive co-design framework for deep neural networks (DNN). The model, implemented through a hybrid Python and PyTorch approach, accounts for various non-idealities, achieving exceptional training accuracies of 90.02% and 91.03% for the CIFAR-10 dataset with memristive and memcapacitive crossbar arrays on an 8-layer VGG network. Additionally, the thesis introduces a novel approach to emulate meminductor devices using Operational Transconductance Amplifiers (OTA) and capacitors, showcasing adjustable behavior. Transistor-level simulations in 180 nm CMOS technology, operating at 60 MHz, demonstrate the proposed meminductor emulator's viability with a power consumption of 0.337 mW. The design is further validated in neuromorphic circuits and CNN accelerators, achieving training and testing accuracies of 91.04% and 88.82%, respectively. Notably, the exclusive use of MOS transistors ensures the feasibility of monolithic IC fabrication. This research significantly contributes to the exploration of advanced hardware solutions for efficient and high-performance machine-learning applications.</description>

      <title>Hardware in Loop Learning with Spin Stochastic Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the promise of superior efficiency and scalability, real-world deployment of emerging nanoelectronic platforms for brain-inspired computing have been limited thus far, primarily because of inter-device variations and intrinsic non-idealities. In this work, we demonstrate mitigating these issues by performing learning directly on practical devices through a hardware-in-loop approach, utilizing stochastic neurons based on heavy metal/ferromagnetic spin-orbit torque heterostructures. We characterize the probabilistic switching and device-to-device variability of our fabricated devices of various sizes to showcase the effect of device dimension on the neuronal dynamics and its consequent impact on network-level performance. The efficacy of the hardware-in-loop scheme is illustrated in a deep learning scenario achieving equivalent software performance. This work paves the way for future large-scale implementations of neuromorphic hardware and realization of truly autonomous edge-intelligent devices.</description>

      <title>Magic Mirror on the Wall, How to Benchmark Quantum Error Correction Codes, Overall ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs) are pivotal in advancing quantum computing by protecting quantum states against the adverse effects of noise and errors. With a variety of QECCs developed, including new developments and modifications of existing ones, selecting an appropriate QECC tailored to specific conditions is crucial. Despite significant improvements in the field of QECCs, a unified methodology for evaluating them on a consistent basis has remained elusive. Addressing this gap, this paper presents the first benchmarking framework for QECCs, introducing a set of universal parameters. By evaluating eight prominent QECCs, we propose a comprehensive suite of eight parameters for their analysis. Our methodology establishes a universal benchmarking approach and highlights the complexity of quantum error correction, indicating that the choice of a QECC depends on the unique requirements and limitations of each scenario. Furthermore, we develop a systematic strategy for selecting QECCs that adapts to the specific requirements of a given scenario, facilitating a tailored approach to quantum error correction. Additionally, we introduce a novel QECC recommendation tool that assesses the characteristics of a given scenario provided by the user, subsequently recommending a spectrum of QECCs from most to least suitable, along with the maximum achievable distance for each code. This tool is designed to be adaptable, allowing for the inclusion of new QECCs and the modification of their parameters with minimal effort, ensuring its relevance in the evolving landscape of quantum computing.</description>
