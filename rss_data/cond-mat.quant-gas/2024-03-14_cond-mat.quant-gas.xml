      <title>Superfluid fraction of interacting bosonic gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superfluid fraction $f$ of a quantum fluid is defined in terms of the response of the system to a weak and constant drag. Notably, Leggett long ago derived two simple expressions providing a rigorous upper bound and a heuristic lower bound for $f$. Here we study the superfluid fraction of bosonic gases in various two-dimensional potentials, such as regular optical lattices and disordered speckles, by solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and performing Diffusion Monte Carlo simulations. We show that under conditions relevant for most ultracold experiments the bounds proposed by Leggett provide a surprisingly narrow bracketing of the exact value of the superfluid fraction.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation in canonical ensemble with fixed total momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Bose-Einstein condensation of noninteracting homogeneous three-dimensional gas in canonical ensemble when both particle number $N$ and total momentum $\mathbf{P}$ of all particles are fixed. Using the saddle point method, we derive the large-$N$ analytical approximations for partition function, free energy, and statistical distributions of occupation numbers of different single-particle energy levels. At temperatures below the critical point of phase transition, we predict, in some ranges of $\mathbf{P}$, fragmentation of the condensate, when more than one single-particle level is macroscopically occupied. The occupation number distributions have approximately Gaussian shapes for the levels hosting the condensate, and exponential shapes for other, noncondensate levels. Our analysis demonstrates breaking of Galilean invariance of moving finite-temperature many-particle system in the presence of Bose-Einstein condensation and extends the theory of moving and rotating quantum systems to the finite-temperature large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking quantum master equations beyond ultraweak coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Nathan and Rudner derived a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation from the Redfield equation. The claim is that the level of approximation is equal to that of the Redfield equation. This is ground breaking work since a quantum master equation that guarantees physical states and that is as accurate as the Redfield equation is still missing. Here we benchmark the Nathan-Rudner equation (NRE) against the exact solution of a damped harmonic oscillator and compare its performance to that of the time-dependent Redfield equation (RE). We find that which of the equations performs better depends on the regime considered. It turns out that the short-time dynamics is generally much better captured by the RE, whereas the NRE delivers similar results to the rotating-wave approximation. For the steady state, in the high-temperature limit the RE also performs better and its solution approaches the exact result for ultrahigh temperatures. Nevertheless, also here the NR equation constitutes a good approximation. In the low-temperature limit, in turn, the NRE still provides a good approximation to the steady state, while the solution of the RE becomes unphysical for too strong coupling. Moreover, we show that, like the RE, also the NRE approaches the correct steady state in the limit of vanishing system-bath coupling. However, in second-order system-bath coupling, where the RE is known to provide the steady-state coherences correctly but not the populations, the NRE generally neither reproduces the correct populations nor the coherences.</description>

      <title>Emergent Continuous Time Crystal in Dissipative Quantum Spin System without Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time crystal, a nonequilibrium phenomenon extending spontaneous symmetry breaking into the temporal dimension, holds fundamental significance in understanding quantum many-body physics. In this work, we explore the nonequilibrium phase diagram of a two-dimensional dissipative Heisenberg spin system in the absence of explicit driving. We numerically identify the emergence of novel nonstationary oscillatory states by analyzing the spin dynamics. These states are categorized as limit cycle and chaos based on the Lyapunov exponent. Remarkably, the observed limit cycle behavior represents a continuous time crystal (CTC), spontaneously breaking the continuous time translation symmetry of the system. We further confirm those oscillatory behaviors by studying the stability against local perturbations applied to the system. Finally, we investigate the robustness of the emergent CTC by introducing isotropic Gaussian-type white noise into the interactions. This study provides many insights into the intricate interplay between dissipation-induced decay processes and interaction-induced spin precession, deepening our understanding of dissipative quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Environment-Induced Information Scrambling Transition with Charge Conservations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In generic closed quantum systems, the complexity of operators increases under time evolution governed by the Heisenberg equation, reflecting the scrambling of local quantum information. However, when systems interact with an external environment, the system-environment coupling allows operators to escape from the system, inducing a dynamical transition between the scrambling phase and the dissipative phase. This transition is known as the environment-induced information scrambling transition, originally proposed in Majorana fermion systems. In this work, we advance this dicovery by investigating the transition in charge-conserved systems with space-time randomness. We construct solvable Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models of complex fermions coupled to an environment, enabling the analytical computation of operator growth. We determine the critical dissipation strength, which is proportional to $n(1-n)$ with $n$ being the density of the complex fermions, arising from the suppression in the quantum Lyapunov exponent due to the Pauli blockade in the scattering process. We further analyze the density dependence of maximally scrambled operators at late time. Our results shed light on the intriguing interplay between information scrambling, dissipation, and conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Ancilla-free measurement of out-of-time-ordered correlation functions: General measurement protocol and Rydberg atom implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a protocol that gives access to out-of-time-ordered correlation functions in many-body quantum systems. Unlike other such protocols, our proposal, which can be applied to arbitrary initial states, neither requires ancilla degrees of freedom to the quantum system of interest, nor has the need for randomized measurements. Nontrivial experimental capabilities required to implement the protocol are single-site measurements, single-site rotations, and backwards time evolution. To exemplify the implementation of the protocol, we put forward a strategy for Hamiltonian sign inversion $H\to-H$ in arrays of Rydberg-dressed atoms. In this way, a complete and practical toolbox is obtained for the measurement of out-of-time-ordered correlations in equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Transport in a Superfluid Josephson Junction Chain: Is There Negative Differential Conductivity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the far-from-equilibrium quantum transport dynamics in a 1D Josephson junction chain of multi-mode Bose-Einstein condensates. We develop a theoretical model to examine the experiment of R. Labouvie et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 050601 (2015)], wherein the phenomenon of negative differential conductivity (NDC) was reported in the refilling dynamics of an initially depleted site within the chain. We demonstrate that a unitary c-field description can quantitatively reproduce the experimental results over the full range of tunnel couplings, and requires no fitted parameters. With a view towards atomtronic implementations, we further demonstrate that the filling is strongly dependent on spatial phase variations stemming from quantum fluctuations. Our findings suggest that the interpretation of the device in terms of NDC is invalid outside of the weak coupling regime. Within this restricted regime, the device exhibits a hybrid behaviour of NDC and the AC Josephson effect. A simplified circuit model of the device will require an approach tailored to atomtronics that incorporates quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Simulation of time crystal behavior for a few boson chiral soliton model in a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04843v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations for a chiral soliton model with N=2,3 bosons in a ring, this being a few-particle version of our previous mean-field model for a quantum time crystal. Following Syrwid, Kosior, and Sacha (SKS), the notion is that a precise position measurement of one particle can lead to spontaneous formation of a bright soliton that in a time crystal should rotate intact for at least a few revolutions around the ring. In their work SKS find spontaneous formation of a soliton due to the position measurement, but quantum fluctuations cause the soliton to subsequently decay before it has a chance to perform even one revolution of the ring. Based on this they conclude that time crystal dynamics are impossible. In contrast, for our few boson chiral soliton model, and allowing for imprecise (weak) measurements of the particle position, we show that time crystal behavior is possible allowing for several revolutions of the spontaneously formed soliton around the ring. We therefore argue that our chiral soliton model can realize a quantum time crystal when weak position measurements are allowed for.</description>

      <title>Detecting defect dynamics in relativistic field theories far from equilibrium using topological data analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium dynamics of relativistic $N$-component scalar field theories in Minkowski space-time in a classical-statistical regime, where typical occupation numbers of modes are much larger than unity. In this strongly correlated system far from equilibrium, the role of different phenomena such as nonlinear wave propagation and defect dynamics remains to be clarified. We employ persistent homology to infer topological features of the nonequilibrium many-body system for different numbers of field components $N$ via a hierarchy of cubical complexes. Specifically, we show that the persistent homology of local energy density fluctuations can give rise to signatures of self-similar scaling associated with topological defects, distinct from the scaling behaviour of nonlinear wave modes. This contributes to the systematic understanding of the role of topological defects for far-from-equilibrium time evolutions of nonlinear many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Coherent Control of the Fine-Structure Qubit in a Single Alkaline-Earth Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the first realization of a novel neutral atom qubit encoded in the metastable fine-structure states ${^3\rm{P}_0}$ and ${^3\rm{P}_2}$ of single $^{88}$Sr atoms trapped in an optical tweezer. Raman coupling of the qubit states promises rapid single-qubit rotations on par with the fast Rydberg-mediated two-body gates. We demonstrate preparation, read-out, and coherent control of the qubit. In addition to driving Rabi oscillations bridging an energy gap of more than 17 THz using a pair of phase-locked clock lasers, we also carry out Ramsey spectroscopy to extract the transverse qubit coherence time $T_2$. When the tweezer is tuned into magic trapping conditions, which is achieved in our setup by tuning the tensor polarizability of the ${^3\rm{P}_2}$ state via an external control magnetic field, we measure $T_2 = 1.2$ ms. A microscopic quantum mechanical model is used to simulate our experiments including dominant noise sources. We identify the main constraints limiting the observed coherence time and project improvements to our system in the immediate future. Our work opens the door for a so far unexplored qubit encoding concept for neutral atom based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Simulating Meson Scattering on Spin Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Studying high-energy collisions of composite particles, such as hadrons and nuclei, is an outstanding goal for quantum simulators. However, preparation of hadronic wave packets has posed a significant challenge, due to the complexity of hadrons and the precise structure of wave packets. This has limited demonstrations of hadron scattering on quantum simulators to date. Observations of confinement and composite excitations in quantum spin systems have opened up the possibility to explore scattering dynamics in spin models. In this article, we develop two methods to create entangled spin states corresponding to wave packets of composite particles in analog quantum simulators of Ising spin Hamiltonians. One wave-packet preparation method uses the blockade effect enabled by beyond-nearest-neighbor Ising spin interactions. The other method utilizes a quantum-bus-mediated exchange, such as the native spin-phonon coupling in trapped-ion arrays. With a focus on trapped-ion simulators, we numerically benchmark both methods and show that high-fidelity wave packets can be achieved in near-term experiments. We numerically study scattering of wave packets for experimentally realizable parameters in the Ising model and find inelastic-scattering regimes, corresponding to particle production in the scattering event, with prominent and distinct experimental signals. Our proposal, therefore, demonstrates the potential of observing inelastic scattering in near-term quantum simulators.</description>
