      <title>Towards Robustness Across Cosmological Simulation Models TNG, SIMBA, ASTRID, and EAGLE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large-scale cosmological simulations has opened new avenues for cosmological and astrophysical research. However, the increasing diversity among cosmological simulation models presents a challenge to the robustness. In this work, we develop the Model-Insensitive ESTimator (MIEST), a machine that can robustly estimate the cosmological parameters, $\Omega_m$ and $\sigma_8$, from neural hydrogen maps of simulation models in the CAMELS project$-$TNG, SIMBA, ASTRID, and EAGLE. An estimator is considered robust if it possesses a consistent predictive power across all simulations, including those used during the training phase. We train our machine using multiple simulation models and ensure that it only extracts common features between the models while disregarding the model-specific features. This allows us to develop a novel model that is capable of accurately estimating parameters across a range of simulation models, without being biased towards any particular model. Upon the investigation of the latent space$-$a set of summary statistics, we find that the implementation of robustness leads to the blending of latent variables across different models, demonstrating the removal of model-specific features. In comparison to a standard machine lacking robustness, the average performance of MIEST on the unseen simulations during the training phase has been improved by $\sim17$% for $\Omega_m$ and $\sim 38$% for $\sigma_8$. By using a machine learning approach that can extract robust, yet physical features, we hope to improve our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution in a (subgrid) model-insensitive manner, and ultimately, gain insight into the underlying physical processes responsible for robustness.

      <title>Learning the Universe: $3\ h^{-1}{\rm Gpc}$ Tests of a Field Level $N$-body Simulation Emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply and test a field-level emulator for non-linear cosmic structure formation in a volume matching next-generation surveys. Inferring the cosmological parameters and initial conditions from which the particular galaxy distribution of our Universe was seeded can be achieved by comparing simulated data to observational data. Previous work has focused on building accelerated forward models that efficiently mimic these simulations. One of these accelerated forward models uses machine learning to apply a non-linear correction to the linear $z=0$ Zeldovich approximation (ZA) fields, closely matching the cosmological statistics in the $N$-body simulation. This emulator was trained and tested at $(h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ volumes, although cosmological inference requires significantly larger volumes. We test this emulator at $(3\ h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ by comparing emulator outputs to $N$-body simulations for eight unique cosmologies. We consider several summary statistics, applied to both the raw particle fields and the dark matter (DM) haloes. We find that the power spectrum, bispectrum and wavelet statistics of the raw particle fields agree with the $N$-body simulations within ${\sim} 5 \%$ at most scales. For the haloes, we find a similar agreement between the emulator and the $N$-body for power spectrum and bispectrum, though a comparison of the stacked profiles of haloes shows that the emulator has slight errors in the positions of particles in the highly non-linear interior of the halo. At these large $(3\ h^{-1}{\rm Gpc})^3$ volumes, the emulator can create $z=0$ particle fields in a thousandth of the time required for $N$-body simulations and will be a useful tool for large-scale cosmological inference.

      <title>Learning the Universe: Learning to Optimize Cosmic Initial Conditions with Non-Differentiable Structure Formation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making the most of next-generation galaxy clustering surveys requires overcoming challenges in complex, non-linear modelling to access the significant amount of information at smaller cosmological scales. Field-level inference has provided a unique opportunity beyond summary statistics to use all of the information of the galaxy distribution. However, addressing current challenges often necessitates numerical modelling that incorporates non-differentiable components, hindering the use of efficient gradient-based inference methods. In this paper, we introduce Learning the Universe by Learning to Optimize (LULO), a gradient-free framework for reconstructing the 3D cosmic initial conditions. Our approach advances deep learning to train an optimization algorithm capable of fitting state-of-the-art non-differentiable simulators to data at the field level. Importantly, the neural optimizer solely acts as a search engine in an iterative scheme, always maintaining full physics simulations in the loop, ensuring scalability and reliability. We demonstrate the method by accurately reconstructing initial conditions from $M_{200\mathrm{c}}$ halos identified in a dark matter-only $N$-body simulation with a spherical overdensity algorithm. The derived dark matter and halo overdensity fields exhibit $\geq80\%$ cross-correlation with the ground truth into the non-linear regime $k \sim 1h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Additional cosmological tests reveal accurate recovery of the power spectra, bispectra, halo mass function, and velocities. With this work, we demonstrate a promising path forward to non-linear field-level inference surpassing the requirement of a differentiable physics model.</description>

      <title>On the Impacts of Halo Model Implementations in Sunyaev-Zeldovich Cross-Correlation Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical studies of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) using Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) observations offer a promising method of studying the gas properties of galaxies and the astrophysics that govern their evolution. Forward modeling profiles from theory and simulations allows them to be refined directly off of data, but there are currently significant differences between the thermal SZ (tSZ) observations of the CGM and the predicted tSZ signal. While these discrepancies could be inherent, they could also be the result of decisions in the forward modeling used to build statistical measures off of theory. In order to see effects of this, we compare an analysis utilizing halo occupancy distributions (HODs) implemented in halo models to simulate the galaxy distribution against a previous studies which weighted their results off of the CMASS galaxy sample, which contains nearly one million galaxies, mainly centrals of group sized halos, selected for relatively uniform stellar mass across redshifts between $0.4&lt;z&lt;0.7$. We review some of the implementation differences that can account for changes, such as miscentering, one-halo/two-halo cutoff radii, and mass ranges, all of which will need to be given the proper attention in future high-signal-to-noise studies. We find that our more thorough model predicts a signal $\sim 25\%$ stronger than the one from previous studies on the exact same sample, resulting in a $33\%$ improved fit for non-dust-contaminated angular scales. Additionally, we find that modifications that change the satellite fraction even by just a few percents, such as editing the halo mass range and certain HOD parameters, result in strong changes in the final signal. Although significant, this discrepancy from the modeling choices is not large enough to completely account for the existing disagreements between simulations and measurements.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of $Z_N$ domain walls with bias directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry can lead to the formation of domain walls in the early Universe. In this work, we explore the impact of bias directions on the dynamics of $Z_N$ domain walls, mainly focusing on the $N = 3$ model with a biased potential. Utilizing the Press-Ryden-Spergel method, we numerically investigate the dynamics of domain walls with lattice simulations. We find notable differences in the dynamics of domain walls due to bias directions. Our results indicate that the annihilation time depends not only on the vacuum energy difference $\delta V$ but also on bias directions described by the relative potential difference $ \zeta $.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Detectability of Milky Way Satellites with Image Simulations: a Case Study with KiDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, which can be detected as resolved satellite systems of the Milky Way, are critical to understanding galaxy formation, evolution, and the nature of dark matter, as they are the oldest, smallest, most metal-poor, and most dark matter-dominated stellar systems known. Quantifying the sensitivity of surveys is essential for understanding their capability and limitations in searching for ultra-faint satellites. In this paper, we present the first study of the image-level observational selection function for Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) based on the Synthetic UniveRses For Surveys (surfs)-based KiDS-Legacy-Like Simulations. We generate mock satellites and simulate images that include resolved stellar populations of the mock satellites and the background galaxies, capturing realistic observational effects such as source blending, photometric uncertainties, and star-galaxy separation. The matched-filter method is applied to recover the injected satellites. We derive the observational selection function of the survey in terms of the luminosity, half-light radius, and heliocentric distance of the satellites. Compared to a catalogue-level simulation as used in previous studies, the image-level simulation provides a more realistic assessment of survey sensitivity, accounting for observational limitations that are neglected in catalogue-level simulations. The image-level simulation shows a detection loss for compact sources with a distance $d \gtrsim 100~\rm kpc$. We argue that this is because compact sources are more likely to be identified as single sources rather than being resolved during the source extraction process.</description>

      <title>Particle production from inhomogeneities: general metric perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present universal formulas for particle production from gravitational inhomogeneities. In the massless limit the result is strikingly simple and completely determined by the two-point function of the energy-momentum tensor that is fixed up to a constant - the central charge - for conformally coupled scalars, massless fermions and gauge fields. This result can be applied to any conformally coupled theory, weakly or strongly interacting, unifying previous derivations for fields of different spin and for scalar and tensor perturbations. We derive the results using the Schwinger method of 1PI effective action and through Bogoliubov transformations that allows to compute exclusive information on the distribution of particles. We then apply these results to stochastic backgrounds of scalar and tensor perturbations that can be generated by various phenomena such us inflationary perturbations and first order phase transitions. Differently from particle production usually considered in cosmology this mechanism allows for the production of massless fields. In particular the abundance induced by inhomogeneities can easily reproduce the dark matter abundance if scalar perturbations produced from inflation are enhanced at short scales.</description>

      <title>Positive-Energy Warp Drive in a De Sitter Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing the result of H. Ellis who embedded a warp bubble in the background of a black hole, we introduce a warp bubble in a de Sitter universe. We show that under certain conditions (namely, that the bubble is moving in the radial direction at a velocity equal to the speed of the expansion of the universe), it is possible for the bubble to have strictly non--negative Eulerian energy density and satisfy the averaged weak and null energy conditions (though they are violated locally). We also prove a more generic theorem that if perturbations of vacuum energy produce at least some underdense regions in all reference frames, they always result in local violations of NEC and WEC. We discuss the implications of these results and their possible applications to models of dark energy like "dark fluid" and quintessence, as well as to physical systems like Casimir cavities and analog gravity setups.</description>

      <title>Strong backreaction of gauge quanta produced during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During inflation an axion field coupled to a gauge field through a Chern-Simons term can trigger the production of gauge quanta due to a tachyonic instability. The amplification of the gauge field modes exponentially depends on the velocity of the axion field, which in turn slows down the rolling of the axion field when backreaction is taken into account. To illustrate how the strength of the Chern-Simons coupling and the slope of the axion potential influence the particle production, in this paper we consider a toy model in which the axion field is a spectator with a linear potential. In the strong backreaction regime, the energy density of the gauge field quasiperiodically oscillates. The steep slope of the axion potential linearly increases the peak amplitude of the energy density while the strong coupling linearly decreases the peak amplitude. Additionally, we calculate the energy spectrum of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Hunting for heavy $Z^\prime$ with IceCube neutrinos and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the minimal gauged B-L extension of the Standard Model, we demonstrate that PeV-scale dark matter (DM) and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU) can be simultaneously explained through the three right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) present in the theory. The DM candidate undergoes decay into light neutrinos, providing an explanation for the observed IceCube events, while the other two RHNs generate the BAU via leptogenesis. The breaking of gauge symmetry gives rise to detectable gravitational waves (GWs) from decaying cosmic strings (CS), making this framework testable at several future GW detectors-despite being beyond the reach of conventional collider experiments due to the extremely weak coupling. The symmetry-breaking scale establishes a connection between particle masses, couplings, and the GW spectrum, offering a unified and predictive scenario.</description>

      <title>Learning the Universe: physically-motivated priors for dust attenuation curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of dust on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies is crucial for inferring their physical properties and for studying the nature of interstellar dust. We analyze dust attenuation curves for $\sim 6400$ galaxies ($M_{\star} \sim 10^9 - 10^{11.5}\,M_{\odot}$) at $z=0.07$ in the IllustrisTNG50 and TNG100 simulations. Using radiative transfer post-processing, we generate synthetic attenuation curves and fit them with a parametric model that captures known extinction and attenuation laws (e.g., Calzetti, MW, SMC, LMC) and more exotic forms. We present the distributions of the best-fitting parameters: UV slope ($c_1$), optical-to-NIR slope ($c_2$), FUV slope ($c_3$), 2175 Angstrom bump strength ($c_4$), and normalization ($A_{\rm V}$). Key correlations emerge between $A_{\rm V}$ and the star formation rate surface density $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, as well as the UV slope $c_1$. The UV and FUV slopes ($c_1, c_3$) and the bump strength and visual attenuation ($c_4, A_{\rm V}$) exhibit robust internal correlations. Using these insights from simulations, we provide a set of scaling relations that predict a galaxy's median (averaged over line of sight) dust attenuation curve based solely on its $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and/or $A_{\rm V}$. These predictions agree well with observed attenuation curves from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog despite minor differences in bump strength. This study delivers the most comprehensive library of synthetic attenuation curves for local galaxies, providing a foundation for physically motivated priors in SED fitting and galaxy inference studies, such as those performed as part of the Learning the Universe Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Accretion onto supermassive and intermediate mass black holes in cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion is the dominant contribution to the cosmic massive black hole density in the Universe today. Yet, modelling it in cosmological simulations is challenging due to the dynamic range involved, as well as the theoretical uncertainties of the underlying mechanisms driving accretion from galactic to black hole horizon scales. We present a simple, flexible parametrization for gas inflows onto massive black holes in order to manage this uncertainty in large-volume cosmological simulations. This is done as part of the "Learning the Universe'' collaboration, which aims to jointly infer the initial conditions and physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe using a Bayesian forward-modelling approach. To allow such a forward-modelling, we update the prescription for accretion with a two-parameter free-fall based inflow estimate that allows for a radius-dependent inflow rate and add a simple model for unresolved accretion disks. We use uniform resolution cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and the IllustrisTNG framework to study the massive black hole population and its dependence on the introduced model parameters. Once the parameters of the accretion formula are chosen to result in a roughly similar redshift zero black hole mass density, the differences caused by the details in the accretion formula are moderate in the supermassive black hole regime, indicating that it is difficult to distinguish between accretion mechanisms based on luminous active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes. Applying the same models to intermediate mass black holes at high redshift, however, reveals significantly different accretion rates in high redshift, moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei and different frequencies and mass distributions of intermediate mass black hole mergers for the same black hole formation model.</description>

Abstract: We extend the projected sensitivity of LDMX for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) to the case of dark photons produced through higher order electromagnetic moments. These moments arise from loop diagrams involving portal matter fields, along with the gauge fields of new symmetry groups. Due to the Lorentz structures, in particular the momentum dependence, of these additional interactions, the kinematic distributions expected at missing momentum/energy experiments vary with model in addition to dark photon mass. By considering four additional types of interactions -- magnetic and electric dipole, charge radius, and anapole moment -- we show that LDMX Phase-II is expected to probe the relic target of these additional dark photon models. We compare the analytic with the numerical methods for calculating the dark bremsstrahlung cross section, and compute the kinematic distributions for each model. The potential for model discrimination in the scenario of non-zero signal events at LDMX is discussed. We find that there is a degeneracy between the dark photon mass and model, which can be partially broken by considering both the energy and the transverse momentum of the recoil electron.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a 36 Billion Solar Mass Black Hole at the Centre of the Cosmic Horseshoe Gravitational Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found at the centre of every massive galaxy, with their masses tightly connected to their host galaxies through a co-evolution over cosmic time. For massive ellipticals, the SMBH mass ($M_\text{BH}$) strongly correlates with the central stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_e$), via the $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relation. However, SMBH mass measurements have traditionally relied on central stellar dynamics in nearby galaxies ($z &lt; 0.1$), limiting our ability to explore the SMBHs across cosmic time. In this work, we present a self-consistent analysis combining 2D stellar dynamics and lens modelling of the Cosmic Horseshoe gravitational lens system ($z = 0.44$), one of the most massive galaxies ever observed. Using integral-field spectroscopic data from MUSE and high-resolution imaging from HST, we model the radial arc and stellar kinematics, constraining the galaxy's central mass distribution and SMBH mass. Bayesian model comparison yields a $5\sigma$ detection of an ultramassive black hole (UMBH) with $\log_{10}(M_\text{BH}/M_{\odot}) = 10.56^{+0.07}_{-0.08} \pm (0.12)^\text{sys}$, consistent across various systematic tests. Our findings place the Cosmic Horseshoe $\sim$$1.5\sigma$ above the $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relation, supporting an emerging trend observed in BGCs and other massive galaxies. This suggests a steeper $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relationship at the highest masses, potentially driven by a different co-evolution of SMBHs and their host galaxies. Future surveys will uncover more radial arcs, enabling the detection of SMBHs over a broader redshift and mass range. These discoveries will further refine our understanding of the $M_\text{BH}-\sigma_e$ relation and its evolution across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Violation of Bell inequalities from Cosmic Microwave Background data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper [R. Dale. R. Lapiedra, and J. A. Morales-Lladosa, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 107}, 023506 (2023)] a cosmic-like Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality was proved for the temperature fluctuations $\delta T$ of the perturbed Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), assuming local realism. This inequality can be tested from observational data. In fact, no violation for it has been found from the CMB data provided by the COBE satellite in different sky directions. This is a result which, being negative, is not conclusive in relation to the possible violation of the CHSH inequality in a cosmological context. So, the preceding analysis needs to be extended by using more precise current CMB data, like those provided by WMAP and Planck satellites. This is a task of considerable importance but, technically, much more involved in data treatments. In this work, assuming again local realism behind measurements and observational data, this extension is accomplished. The result is that a sound violation of the CHSH inequality is found, which would mean the failure of the assumed local realism in accordance with the quantum origin of the primordial temperature fluctuations in the framework of standard inflation and the orthodox interpretation of the Quantum Mechanics.</description>

      <title>The Starobinsky model of inflation and Renormalizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Starobinsky model was born in a cosmological scenario where conformally coupled matter quantum field fluctuations on the vacuum drive a non trivial semiclassical energy momentum tensor quadratic in curvature. The presence of an unstable de Sitter solution of the semiclassical Einstein equations contributed to spread the idea that the early universe could have experienced an inflationary epoch. Effective "$R + R^2$" models of gravity have later gained much attention since their predictions are in very good agreement with the measurements of CMB data and tensor to scalar ratio bounds. In this paper we observe how the Starobinsky model can be well approximated by the asymptotically free quadratic gravity on a part of a renormalization group trajectory (below some high UV scale) which is free from tachyonic instabilities, if a definition of ``physical'' running is employed.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Dark Matter Constraints from the Hubble Frontier Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fuzzy dark matter (FDM) cosmologies, the dark matter consists of ultralight bosons ($m\lesssim10^{-20}$ eV). The astrophysically large de Broglie wavelengths of such particles hinder the formation of low-mass dark matter halos. This implies a testable prediction: a corresponding suppression in the faint-end of the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of galaxies. Notably, recent estimates of the faint-end UVLF at $z\sim5-9$ in the Hubble Frontier Fields, behind foreground lensing clusters, probe up to five magnitudes fainter than typical ("blank-field") regions. These measurements thus far disfavor prominent turnovers in the UVLF at low luminosity, implying bounds on FDM. We fit a semi-empirical model to these and blank-field UVLF data, including the FDM particle mass as a free parameter. This fit excludes cases where the dark matter is entirely a boson of mass $m&lt;1.5\times10^{-21}$ eV (with $2\sigma$ confidence). We also present a less stringent bound deriving solely from the requirement that the total observed abundance of galaxies, integrated over all luminosities, must not exceed the total halo abundance in FDM. This more model-agnostic bound disfavors $m&lt;5\times10^{-22}$ eV ($2\sigma$). We forecast that future UVLF measurements from JWST lensing fields may probe masses several times larger than these bounds, although we demonstrate this is subject to theoretical uncertainties in modeling the FDM halo mass function.</description>

      <title>Discriminating among cosmological models by data-driven methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explores the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset to identify patterns that can discriminate between different cosmological models. We focus on determining whether the behaviour of dark energy is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model or suggests novel cosmological features. The central goal is to evaluate the robustness of the $\Lambda$CDM model compared with other dark energy models, and to investigate whether there are deviations that might indicate new cosmological insights. The study takes into account a data-driven approach, using both traditional statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Initially, we evaluate six different dark energy models using traditional statistical methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Static and Dynamic Nested Sampling to infer the cosmological parameters. Subsequently, we adopt a machine learning approach, developing a regression model to compute the distance modulus of each supernova, expanding the feature set to 74 statistical features. Traditional statistical analysis confirms that the $\Lambda$CDM model is robust, yielding expected parameter values. Other models show deviations, with the Generalised and Modified Chaplygin Gas models performing poorly. In the machine learning analysis, feature selection techniques, particularly Boruta, significantly improve model performance. In particular, models initially considered weak (Generalised/Modified Chaplygin Gas) show significant improvement after feature selection. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of a data-driven approach to cosmological model evaluation. The $\Lambda$CDM model remains robust, while machine learning techniques, in particular feature selection, reveal potential improvements in alternative models which could be relevant for new observational campaigns like the recent DESI survey.</description>

      <title>Primordial Bounce-Inflation Scenario to Alleviate Cosmological Tensions and Lensing Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We put forward a primordial scenario to alleviate cosmological tensions, i.e. Hubble ($H_0$) tension and $ S_8 $ tension. Based on flat $\Lambda$CDM, the Bounce-Inflation (BI) scenario gives the results that $ H_0 = 68.60^{+0.40}_{-0.45} \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.806 \pm 0.011 $ by using \texttt{Planck 2018} data sets and $ H_0 = 68.96 \pm 0.38 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.797\pm 0.010 $ by using \texttt{Planck 2018} + \texttt{SPT3G} data sets. These reduce the cosmological tensions slightly. We also take an extended $\Lambda$CDM model into account, $\Lambda$CDM (BI)+$A_L$, where $ A_L $ is the gravitational lensing amplitude. The results are $ H_0 = 69.38 \pm 0.49 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.774 \pm 0.014 $ fitted by \texttt{Planck 2018} data sets and $ H_0 = 69.49 \pm 0.45 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$, $ S_8 = 0.771^{+0.013}_{-0.012} $ fitted by \texttt{Planck 2018} + \texttt{SPT3G} data sets, which reduce the Hubble tension to $\sim 3\sigma $ level and show no $S_8 $ tension. The $A_L \approx 1.1$ is smaller than the result of the inflation scenario with a constraint of \texttt{Planck 2018} data sets. Besides, the spectral index of the bounce-inflation scenario $ n_s $ is about $ 0.98 $, with a trend to the Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $f(R)$ theories of modified gravity may be compatible with current observations if the deviations from general relativity are sufficiently well screened in dense environments. In recent work [arXiv:2310.19955] we have shown that approximations commonly used to assess whether galaxies are screened, or unscreened, fail to hold in observationally interesting parts of parameter space. One of the assumptions commonly made in these approximations, and more broadly in the study of $f(R)$ models, is that the mass of the scalar mode can be neglected inside a galaxy. In this work we demonstrate that this approximation may fail spectacularly and discuss the implications of this for tests of the theory.</description>

      <title>SpectrAx: Spectral Search of Axion-Like Particles Using Multi-Band Observations of Galaxy Clusters from SKA, SO, CMB-S4 and eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of axions or Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) has been predicted by various Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories, and the proposed photon-ALP interaction is one of the ways to probe them. Such an interaction will lead to photon-ALP resonant conversion in galaxy clusters, resulting in a polarized spectral distortion in the CMB along the cluster line of sight. The estimation of this signal from galaxy clusters requires an estimation of their electron density and magnetic field profiles, as well as their redshifts. We have developed a new Bayesian framework \texttt{SpectrAx} that can use observations from different electromagnetic bands such as radio, CMB, optical, and X-ray to infer the astrophysical properties of a galaxy cluster, such as cluster its redshift, electron density and magnetic field, along with the BSM physics such as ALPs. We use simulated redshifts in our analysis, but that can be obtained by cross-matching with optical surveys having overlapping sky regions with the galaxy clusters. Also, we use radial profiles that are motivated from observations of galaxy clusters at low redshifts. By using the simulated data corresponding to the ALP mass of $10^{-14}$ eV for upcoming CMB surveys such as Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 in combination with Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) we demonstrate the capability in accurately inferring the ALPs coupling strength along with the radial profile of electron density and magnetic field from galaxy clusters. The application of this framework to the data from future surveys by combining SKA+SO+eROSITA and SKA+CMB-S4+eROSITA will make it possible for the first time to explore both astrophysics and BSM physics from low-redshift galaxy clusters using a multi-band approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Palatini formalism to investigate the dynamics of large-field inflation using a renormalizable polynomial inflaton potential in the context of $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. Assuming instant reheating, we make a comparative analysis of large-field polynomial inflation (PI). We first consider the minimal and non-minimal coupling of inflaton in $R$ gravity, and then we continue with the minimally and non-minimally coupled inflaton in $f(R,\phi)$ gravity. We scan the parameter space for the inflationary predictions ($n_s$ and $r$) consistent with the Planck and BICEP/Keck 2018 results as well as the sensitivity forecast of the future CMB-S4 and depict the compliant regions in the $\phi_0-\beta$ plane where $\phi_0$ and $\beta$ are two parameters of polynomial inflation model which control the saddle point of the potential and the flatness in the vicinity of this point respectively. We find that a substantial portion of the parameter space aligns with the observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: E to B mixing or "leakage" due to time-ordered data (TOD) filtering has become an important source of sensitivity loss that ground-based cosmic microwave background polarization experiments must address. However, it is a difficult problem for which very few viable solutions exist. In this paper, we expand upon satellite E-mode methods to cover E/B leakage specifically due to TOD filtering. We take a satellite E-mode map and TOD filter it through the ground-based experiment data analysis pipeline, from which we construct a map-space "leakage template" and subtract it from the ground-based experiment map. We evaluate the residual leakage by simulating the satellite E-mode maps with Planck-like and LiteBIRD-like noise levels, and simulate the ground-based experiment with Simons Observatory-like and CMB-S4-like noise levels. The effectiveness of the method is measured in the improvement of the Fisher uncertainty $\sigma(r=0)$. We find that our method can reduce $\sigma(r=0)$ by $\sim15\text{--}75\%$ depending on the noise levels considered.</description>

      <title>What do we learn by mapping dark energy to a single value of $w$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine several dark energy models with a time-varying equation of state parameter, $w(z)$, to determine what information can be derived by fitting the distance modulus in such models to a constant equation of state parameter, $w_*$. We derive $w_*$ as a function of the model parameters for the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, and for the Dutta-Scherrer approximation to hilltop quintessence models. We find that all of the models examined here can be well-described by a pivot-like redshift, $z_{pivot}$ at which the value of $w(z)$ in the model is equal to $w_*$. However, the exact value of $z_{pivot}$ is a model-dependent quantity; it varies from $z_{pivot} = 0.22-0.25$ for the CPL models to $z_{pivot} = 0.17-0.20$ for the hilltop quintessence models. Hence, for all of the models considered here, a constant-$w$ fit gives the value of $w$ for $z$ near 0.2. However, given the fairly wide variation in $z_{pivot}$ over even this restricted set of models, the information gained by fitting to a constant value of $w$ seems rather limited.</description>

      <title>Testing galaxy formation models with the stellar mass-halo mass relations for star-forming and quiescent galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tight relationship between the stellar mass and halo mass of galaxies is one of the most fundamental scaling relations in galaxy formation and evolution. It has become a critical constraint for galaxy formation models. Over the past decade, growing evidence has convincingly shown that the stellar mass-halo mass relations (SHMRs) for star-forming and quiescent central galaxies differ significantly: at a given stellar mass, the average host halo mass of quiescent centrals is more massive than that of the star-forming centrals. Despite the importance of this feature, its scientific implications have not yet been fully recognized or thoroughly explored in the field. In this work, we demonstrate that the semi-analytical model L-GALAXIES successfully reproduces these observational results, whereas three state-of-the-art hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations (TNG, Illustris, and EAGLE) do not. Consequently, in L-GALAXIES, star-forming central galaxies are more efficient at converting baryons into stars than quiescent central galaxies at a given halo mass, while the other models predict similar efficiencies for both populations. Further analysis reveals that these fundamental discrepancies stem from distinct evolutionary paths on the stellar mass-halo mass plane. We show that the observed SHMRs for star-forming and quiescent galaxies support galaxy formation models in which quenching only weakly correlates with halo assembly histories, and in which the stellar mass of star-forming galaxies can increase significantly since cosmic noon. In contrast, models in which quenching strongly prefers to happen in early-formed halos are not very favored. Additionally, we find that galaxy downsizing is present in L-GALAXIES and TNG, but absent in Illustris and EAGLE.</description>
