      <title>Quantifying The Limits of AI Reasoning: Systematic Neural Network Representations of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic, tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning; e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly emulated by a NN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we point out a mistake in G.Cybenko's proof of his version of the universal approximation theorem which has been widely cited. This mistake might not be easily fixable along the idea of his proof and it also leads to an interesting question in measure theory.</description>

      <title>Metric Matters: A Formal Evaluation of Similarity Measures in Active Learning for Cyber Threat Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense due to their stealthy behavior and the extreme class imbalance inherent in detection datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel active learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets, including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for threat intelligence and cyber defense.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Automata and Deep Evolutionary Computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolution by natural selection, which is one of the most compelling themes of modern science, brought forth evolutionary algorithms and evolutionary computation, applying mechanisms of evolution in nature to various problems solved by computers. In this paper we concentrate on evolutionary automata that constitute an analogous model of evolutionary computation compared to well-known evolutionary algorithms. Evolutionary automata provide a more complete dual model of evolutionary computation, similar like abstract automata (e.g., Turing machines) form a more formal and precise model compared to recursive algorithms and their subset - evolutionary algorithms. An evolutionary automaton is an automaton that evolves performing evolutionary computation perhaps using an infinite number of generations. This model allows for a direct modeling evolution of evolution, and leads to tremendous expressiveness of evolutionary automata and evolutionary computation. This also gives the hint to the power of natural evolution that is self-evolving by interactive feedback with the environment.</description>

      <title>Polarisation-Inclusive Spiking Neural Networks for Real-Time RFI Detection in Modern Radio Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is a known growing challenge for radio astronomy, intensified by increasing observatory sensitivity and prevalence of orbital RFI sources. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution for real-time RFI detection by exploiting the time-varying nature of radio observation and neuron dynamics together. This work explores the inclusion of polarisation information in SNN-based RFI detection, using simulated data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA) instrument and provides power usage estimates for deploying SNN-based RFI detection on existing neuromorphic hardware. Preliminary results demonstrate state-of-the-art detection accuracy and highlight possible extensive energy-efficiency gains.</description>

      <title>Sharp Lower Bounds on Interpolation by Deep ReLU Neural Networks at Irregularly Spaced Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interpolation power of deep ReLU neural networks. Specifically, we consider the question of how efficiently, in terms of the number of parameters, deep ReLU networks can interpolate values at $N$ datapoints in the unit ball which are separated by a distance $\delta$. We show that $\Omega(N)$ parameters are required in the regime where $\delta$ is exponentially small in $N$, which gives the sharp result in this regime since $O(N)$ parameters are always sufficient. This also shows that the bit-extraction technique used to prove lower bounds on the VC dimension cannot be applied to irregularly spaced datapoints. Finally, as an application we give a lower bound on the approximation rates that deep ReLU neural networks can achieve for Sobolev spaces at the embedding endpoint.</description>

      <title>Activation degree thresholds and expressiveness of polynomial neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04569v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the expressive power of deep polynomial neural networks through the geometry of their neurovariety. We introduce the notion of the activation degree threshold of a network architecture to express when the dimension of the neurovariety achieves its theoretical maximum. We prove the existence of the activation degree threshold for all polynomial neural networks without width-one bottlenecks and demonstrate a universal upper bound that is quadratic in the width of largest size. In doing so, we prove the high activation degree conjecture of Kileel, Trager, and Bruna. Certain structured architectures have exceptional activation degree thresholds, making them especially expressive in the sense of their neurovariety dimension. In this direction, we prove that polynomial neural networks with equi-width architectures are maximally expressive by showing their activation degree threshold is one.</description>

      <title>Local Learning Rules for Out-of-Equilibrium Physical Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the out-of-equilibrium driving protocol of score-based generative models (SGMs) can be learned via local learning rules. The gradient with respect to the parameters of the driving protocol is computed directly from force measurements or from observed system dynamics. As a demonstration, we implement an SGM in a network of driven, nonlinear, overdamped oscillators coupled to a thermal bath. We first apply it to the problem of sampling from a mixture of two Gaussians in 2D. Finally, we train a 12x12 oscillator network on the MNIST dataset to generate images of handwritten digits 0 and 1.</description>

      <title>From Taylor Series to Fourier Synthesis: The Periodic Linear Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm in modern neural networks relies on simple, monotonically-increasing activation functions like ReLU. While effective, this paradigm necessitates large, massively-parameterized models to approximate complex functions. In this paper, we introduce the Periodic Linear Unit (PLU), a learnable sine-wave based activation with periodic non-monotonicity. PLU is designed for maximum expressive power and numerical stability, achieved through its formulation and a paired innovation we term Repulsive Reparameterization, which prevents the activation from collapsing into a non-expressive linear function. We demonstrate that a minimal MLP with only two PLU neurons can solve the spiral classification task, a feat impossible for equivalent networks using standard activations. This suggests a paradigm shift from networks as piecewise Taylor-like approximators to powerful Fourier-like function synthesizers, achieving exponential gains in parameter efficiency by placing intelligence in the neuron itself.</description>
