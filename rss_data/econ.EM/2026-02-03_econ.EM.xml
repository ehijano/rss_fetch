      <title>Coping with Inductive Risk When Theories are Underdetermined: Decision Making with Partial Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controversy about the significance of underdetermination of theories persists in the philosophy and conduct of science. The issue has practical import when scientific research is used to inform decision making, because scientific uncertainty yields inductive risk. Seeking to enhance communication between philosophers and researchers who analyze public policy, this paper describes econometric analysis of partial identification. Study of partial identification finds underdetermination and inductive risk to be highly consequential for credible prediction of important societal outcomes and, hence, for credible public decision making. It provides mathematical tools to characterize a broad class of scientific uncertainties that arise when available data and credible assumptions are combined to predict population outcomes. Combining study of partial identification with criteria for reasonable decision making under ambiguity yields coherent practical approaches to make policy choices without accepting one among multiple empirically underdetermined theories. The paper argues that study of partial identification warrants attention in philosophical discourse on underdetermination and inductive risk.</description>

      <title>Identification and Estimation in Fuzzy Regression Discontinuity Designs with Covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fuzzy regression discontinuity designs with covariates and characterize the weighted averages of conditional local average treatment effects (WLATEs) that are point identified. Any identified WLATE equals a Wald ratio of conditional reduced-form and first-stage discontinuities. We highlight the Compliance-Weighted LATE (CWLATE), which weights cells by squared first-stage discontinuities and maximizes first-stage strength. For discrete covariates, we provide simple estimators and robust bias-corrected inference. In simulations calibrated to common designs, CWLATE improves stability and reduces mean squared error relative to standard fuzzy RDD estimators when compliance varies. An application to Uruguayan cash transfers during pregnancy yields precise RDD-based effects on low birthweight.</description>

      <title>Do designated market makers provide liquidity during downward extreme price movements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the trading activity of designated market makers (DMMs) in electronic markets using a unique dataset with audit-trail information on trader classification. DMMs may either adhere to their market-making agreements and offer immediacy during periods of heavy selling pressure, or they might lean-with-the-wind to profit from private information. We test these competing theories during extreme (downward) price movements, which we detect using a novel methodology. We show that DMMs provide liquidity when the selling pressure is concentrated on a single stock, but consume liquidity (leaving liquidity provision to slower traders) when several stocks are affected.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Oil Consumption: The Statistical Review of World Energy Meets Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies whether a small set of dominant countries can account for most of the dynamics of regional oil demand and improve forecasting performance. We focus on dominant drivers within the OECD and a broad GVAR sample covering over 90\% of world GDP. Our approach identifies dominant drivers from a high-dimensional concentration matrix estimated row by row using two complementary variable-selection methods, LASSO and the one-covariate-at-a-time multiple testing (OCMT) procedure. Dominant countries are selected by ordering the columns of the concentration matrix by their norms and applying a criterion based on consecutive norm ratios, combined with economically motivated restrictions to rule out pseudo-dominance. The United States emerges as a global dominant driver, while France and Japan act as robust regional hubs representing European and Asian components, respectively. Including these dominant drivers as regressors for all countries yields statistically significant forecast gains over autoregressive benchmarks and country-specific LASSO models, particularly during periods of heightened global volatility. The proposed framework is flexible and can be applied to other macroeconomic and energy variables with network structure or spatial dependence.</description>

      <title>Stable Time Series Prediction of Enterprise Carbon Emissions Based on Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Against the backdrop of ongoing carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, accurate prediction of enterprise carbon emission trends constitutes an essential foundation for energy structure optimization and low-carbon transformation decision-making. Nevertheless, significant heterogeneity persists across regions, industries and individual enterprises regarding energy structure, production scale, policy intensity and governance efficacy, resulting in pronounced distribution shifts and non-stationarity in carbon emission data across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Such cross-regional and cross-enterprise data drift not only compromises the accuracy of carbon emission reporting but substantially undermines the guidance value of predictive models for production planning and carbon quota trading decisions. To address this critical challenge, we integrate causal inference perspectives with stable learning methodologies and time-series modelling, proposing a stable temporal prediction mechanism tailored to distribution shift environments. This mechanism incorporates enterprise-level energy inputs, capital investment, labour deployment, carbon pricing, governmental interventions and policy implementation intensity, constructing a risk consistency-constrained stable learning framework that extracts causal stable features (robust against external perturbations yet demonstrating long-term stable effects on carbon dioxide emissions) from multi-environment samples across diverse policies, regions and industrial sectors. Furthermore, through adaptive normalization and sample reweighting strategies, the approach dynamically rectifies temporal non-stationarity induced by economic fluctuations and policy transitions, ultimately enhancing model generalization capability and explainability in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Dynamic causal inference with time series data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the potential outcome framework to time series with an intervention by defining causal effects on stochastic processes. Interventions in dynamic systems alter not only outcome levels but also evolutionary dynamics -- changing persistence and transition laws. Our framework treats potential outcomes as entire trajectories, enabling causal estimands, identification conditions, and estimators to be formulated directly on path space. The resulting Dynamic Average Treatment Effect (DATE) characterizes how causal effects evolve through time and reduces to the classical average treatment effect under one period of time. For observational data, we derive a dynamic inverse-probability weighting estimator that is unbiased under dynamic ignorability and positivity. When treated units are scarce, we show that conditional mean trajectories underlying the DATE admit a linear state-space representation, yielding a dynamic linear model implementation. Simulations demonstrate that modeling time as intrinsic to the causal mechanism exposes dynamic effects that static methods systematically misestimate. An empirical study of COVID-19 lockdowns illustrates the framework's practical value for estimating and decomposing treatment effects.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Regressing Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating weights in the synthetic control method, typically resulting in sparse weights where only a few control units have non-zero weights, involves an optimization procedure that selects and combines control units to closely match the treated unit. However, it is not uncommon for the linear combination of pre-treatment period outcomes for the control units, using nonnegative weights with the constraint that their sum equals one, to inadequately approximate the pre-treatment outcomes for the treated unit. To address the issue, this paper proposes a simple and effective method called Synthetic Regressing Control (SRC). The SRC method begins by performing the univariate linear regression to appropriately align the pre-treatment periods of the control units with the treated unit. Subsequently, a SRC estimator is obtained by synthesizing the regressed controls. To determine the weights in the synthesis procedure, we propose an approach that utilizes a criterion of an unbiased risk estimator. Theoretically, we show that the synthesis way is asymptotically optimal in the sense of achieving the minimum loss of the infeasible best possible synthetic estimator. Extensive numerical experiments highlight the advantages of the SRC method.</description>

      <title>Optimal Policy Choices Under Uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03910v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Policymakers often face the decision of how to allocate resources across many different policies using noisy estimates of policy impacts. This paper develops a framework for optimal policy choices under statistical uncertainty. I consider a social planner who must choose upfront spending on a set of policies to maximize expected welfare. I show that, for small policy changes relative to the status quo, the posterior mean benefit and net cost of each policy are sufficient statistics for an oracle social planner who knows the true distribution of policy impacts. Since the true distribution is unknown in practice, I propose an empirical Bayes approach to estimate these posterior means and approximate the oracle planner. I derive finite-sample rates of convergence to the oracle planner's decision and show that, in contrast to empirical Bayes, plug-in methods can fail to converge. In an empirical application to 68 policies from Hendren and Sprung-Keyser (2020), I find welfare gains from the empirical Bayes approach and welfare losses from a plug-in approach, suggesting that careful incorporation of statistical uncertainty into policymaking can qualitatively change welfare conclusions.</description>

      <title>Boundary Discontinuity Designs: Theory and Practice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The boundary discontinuity (BD) design is a non-experimental method for identifying causal effects that exploits a thresholding rule based on a bivariate score and a boundary curve. This widely used method generalizes the univariate regression discontinuity design but introduces unique challenges arising from its multidimensional nature. We synthesize over 80 empirical papers that use the BD design, tracing the method's application from its formative stages to its implementation in modern research. We also overview ongoing theoretical and methodological research on identification, estimation, and inference for BD designs employing local polynomial regression, and offer recommendations for practice.</description>

      <title>To Adopt or Not to Adopt: Heterogeneous Trade Effects of the Euro</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two decades of research on the euro's trade effects have produced estimates ranging from 4% to 30%, with no consensus on the magnitude. We find evidence that this divergence may reflect genuine heterogeneity in the euro's trade effect across country pairs rather than methodological differences alone. Using Eurostat data on 15 EU countries (12 eurozone members plus Denmark, Sweden, and the UK as controls) from 1995-2015, we estimate that euro adoption increased bilateral trade by 29% on average (14.1% after fixed effects correction), but effects range from -12% to +79% across eurozone pairs. Core eurozone pairs (e.g., Germany-France, Germany-Netherlands) show large gains, while peripheral pairs involving Finland, Greece, and Portugal saw smaller or negative effects, with some negative estimates statistically significant and interpretable as trade diversion. Pre-euro trade intensity and GDP account for over 90% of feature importance in explaining this heterogeneity. Extending to EU28, we find evidence that crisis-era adopters (Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia) pull down naive estimates to 4.3%, but accounting for fixed effects recovers estimates of 13.4%, consistent with the EU15 fixed-effects baseline of 14.1%. Illustrative counterfactual analysis suggests non-eurozone members would have experienced varied effects: UK (+33%), Sweden (+22%), Denmark (+19%). The wide range of prior estimates appears to be largely a feature of the data, not a bug in the methods.</description>

      <title>Experimental Designs for Multi-Item Multi-Period Inventory Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized experiments, or A/B testing, are the gold standard for evaluating interventions, yet they remain underutilized in inventory management. This study addresses this gap by analyzing A/B testing strategies in multi-item, multi-period inventory systems with lost sales and capacity constraints. We examine two canonical experimental designs, namely, switchback experiments and item-level randomization, and show that both suffer from systematic bias due to interference: temporal carryover in switchbacks and cannibalization across items under capacity constraints. Under mild conditions, we characterize the direction of this bias, proving that switchback designs systematically underestimate, while item-level randomization systematically overestimate, the global treatment effect. Motivated by two-sided randomization, we propose a pairwise design over items and time and analyze its bias properties. Numerical experiments using real-world data validate our theory and provide concrete guidance for selecting experimental designs in practice.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Preference Optimization: Your Language Model is Secretly a Single-Index Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to preference data typically assumes a known link function between observed preferences and latent rewards (e.g., a logistic Bradley-Terry link). Misspecification of this link can bias inferred rewards and misalign learned policies. We study preference alignment under an unknown and unrestricted link function. We show that realizability of $f$-divergence-constrained reward maximization in a policy class induces a semiparametric single-index binary choice model, where a scalar policy-dependent index captures all dependence on demonstrations and the remaining preference distribution is unrestricted. Rather than assuming this model has identifiable finite-dimensional structural parameters and estimating them, as in econometrics, we focus on policy learning with the reward function implicit, analyzing error to the optimal policy and allowing for unidentifiable nonparametric indices. We develop preference optimization algorithms robust to the unknown link and prove convergence guarantees in terms of generic function complexity measures. We demonstrate this empirically on LLM alignment. Code is available at https://github.com/causalml/spo/</description>
