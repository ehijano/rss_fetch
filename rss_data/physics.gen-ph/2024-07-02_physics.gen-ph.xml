      <title>Intersubjectivity and value reproducibility of outcomes of quantum measurements</title>

Abstract: Every measurement determines a single value as its outcome, and yet quantum mechanics predicts it only probabilistically. The Kochen-Specker theorem and Bell's inequality are often considered to reject a realist view but favor a skeptical view that measuring an observable does not mean ascertaining the value that it has, but producing the outcome, having only a personal meaning. However, precise analysis supporting this view is unknown. Here, we show that a quantum mechanical analysis turns down this view. Supposing that two observers simultaneously measure the same observable, we can well pose the question as to whether they always obtain the same outcome, or whether the probability distributions are the same, but the outcomes are uncorrelated. Contrary to the widespread view in favor of the second, we shall show that quantum mechanics predicts that only the first case occurs. We further show that any measurement establishes a time-like entanglement between the observable to be measured and the meter after the measurement, which causes the space-like entanglement between the meters of different observers. We also show that our conclusion cannot be extended to measurements of so-called `generalized' observables, suggesting a demand for reconsidering the notion of observables in foundations of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>The physical basis of teleological evolutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18927v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is easily seen that the mere existence of an optimal quantum computational speedup logically implies the mutually exclusive or of well-defined causal loops. In each of them, it is as if the problem-solver knew in advance one of the possible halves of the information about the solution she will produce and measure in the future and used this knowledge to produce the solution with correspondingly fewer computation steps. Involving only the measurements of commuting observables, quantum algorithms are submitted to the same (classical) logic and should therefore host the quantum superposition of the causal loops in question. However, being causal in character, their ordinary quantum description cannot describe causal loops. We argue that it must therefore be incomplete and show that it is completed by time-symmetrizing it. This leaves the ordinary quantum description mathematically unaltered but replaces its single causal process by the quantum superposition of causal loops in question. In their completed quantum description, quantum algorithms respond to the pre-scientific notion of teleological evolution, that is, an evolution toward a goal (the solution) with an attractor in the goal it will produce in the future (the solution again). Once applied to the evolutions of the living, this notion was dismissed with the advent of modern science for the alleged absence of a physical basis. We show that, under a quantum cosmological interpretation of the Anthropic Principle, the same quantum superposition of causal loops underlying the teleological character of quantum algorithms becomes the missing physical basis of the teleological character of natural evolutions.</description>

      <title>Spin Theory Based on the Extended Least Action Principle and Information Metrics: Quantization, Entanglement, and Bell Test With Time Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13783</link>

Abstract: A theory of electron spin is developed here based on the extended least action principle and assumptions of intrinsic angular momentum of an electron with random orientations. By incorporating appropriate relative entropy for the random orientations of intrinsic angular momentum in the extended least action principle, the theory recovers the quantum formulation of electron spin. The two-level quantization of spin measurement is a natural mathematical consequence. The formulation of measurement probability when a second Stern-Gerlach apparatus is rotated relative to the first Stern-Gerlach apparatus, and the Schr\"{o}dinger-Pauli equation, are also derived successfully. Furthermore, we provide an intuitive physical model and formulation to explain the entanglement phenomenon between two electron spins. In this model, spin entanglement is the consequence of correlation between the random orientations of the intrinsic angular momenta of the two electrons. Since the orientation is an intrinsic local property of electron, the correlation of orientations can be preserved even when the two electrons are remotely separated. Such a correlation can be manifested without causal effect. Owing to this orientation correlation, the Bell-CHSH inequality is shown to be violated in a Bell test. A potential experiment is proposed to test the validity of the present theory. In a typical Bell test that confirms the violation of Bell-CHSH inequality, the present theory suggests that by adding a sufficiently large time delay before Bob's measurement, the Bell-CHSH inequality can become non-violated. Limitations of the theory are also discussed to inspire further investigations on a more rigorous physical model of electron spin.</description>

      <title>Considerations about the measurement of the magnetic moment and electric dipole moment of the electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of the measurement of the magnetic moment of the electron $\mu$, is to experimentaly determine the gyromagnetic ratio. The factor $g/2$ is computed by the accurate measurement of two frequencies, the spin precession frequency $\nu_s$, and the cyclotron frequency $\nu_c$, and is defined as $\nu_s/\nu_c=g/2$. These experiments are performed with a single electron confined inside a Penning trap. The existence of the electric dipole moment ${d}_e$, involves the idea of an asymmetric charge distribution along the spin direction such that ${ d}_e=d_e{ S}/(\hbar/2)$. The energy shift $\Delta U=2{d}_eE_{eff}$ of the interaction of the electric dipole of electrons with a huge effective electric field ${E}_{eff}$, close to the nucleus of heavy neutral atoms or molecules, is determined by a spin precession measurement. By using a classical model of a spinning electron, which satisfies Dirac's equation when quantized, we determine classically the time average value of the electric and magnetic dipole moments of this electron model when moving in a uniform magnetic field and in a Penning trap, with the same fields as in the real experiments, and obtain an estimated value of these dipoles. We compare these results with the experimental data and make some interpretation of the measured dipoles.</description>
