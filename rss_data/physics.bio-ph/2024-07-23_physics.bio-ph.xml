      <title>Pre-oligomerisation stochastic dynamics of prions driven by water molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prions are proteinaceous infectious particles that cause neurodegenerative diseases in humans and animals. The complex nature of prions, with respect to their conformations and aggregations, has been an important area of research for quite some time. Here, we develop a model of prion dynamics prior to the formation of oligomers and subsequent development of prion diseases within a stochastic framework, based on the analytical Master Equation and Stochastic Simulation Algorithm by Gillespie. The results that we obtain shows that solvent water molecules act as driving agents in the dynamics of prion aggregation. Further, it is found that aggregated and non-aggregated proteins tend to co-exist in an equilibrium state, depending upon the reaction rate constants. These results may provide a theoretical and qualitative contexts of possible therapeutic strategies in the treatment of prion diseases.</description>

      <title>Hermitian and non-Hermitian topology in active matter</title>

Abstract: Self-propulsion is a quintessential aspect of biological systems, which can induce nonequilibrium phenomena that have no counterparts in passive systems. Motivated by biophysical interest together with recent advances in experimental techniques, active matter has been a rapidly developing field in physics. Meanwhile, over the past few decades, topology has played a crucial role to understand certain robust properties appearing in condensed matter systems. For instance, the nontrivial topology of band structures leads to the notion of topological insulators, where one can find robust gapless edge modes protected by the bulk band topology. We here review recent progress in an interdisciplinary area of research at the intersection of these two fields. Specifically, we give brief introductions to active matter and band topology in Hermitian systems, and then explain how the notion of band topology can be extended to nonequilibrium (and thus non-Hermitian) systems including active matter. We review recent studies that have demonstrated the intimate connections between active matter and topological materials, where exotic topological phenomena that are unfeasible in passive systems have been found. A possible extension of the band topology to nonlinear systems is also briefly discussed. Active matter can thus provide an ideal playground to explore topological phenomena in qualitatively new realms beyond conservative linear systems.</description>

      <title>When Knots are Plectonemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport of DNA polymers through nanoscale pores is central to many biological processes, from bacterial gene exchange to viral infection. In single-molecule nanopore sensing, the detection of nucleic acid and protein analytes relies on the passage of a long biopolymer through a nanoscale aperture. Understanding the dynamics of polymer translocation through nanopores, especially the relation between ionic current signal and polymer conformations is thus essential for the successful identification of targets. Here, by analyzing ionic current traces of dsDNA translocation, we reveal that features up to now uniquely associated with knots are instead different structural motifs: plectonemes. By combining experiments and simulations, we demonstrate that such plectonemes form because of the solvent flow that induces rotation of the helical DNA fragment in the nanopore, causing torsion propagation outwards from the pore. Molecular dynamic simulations reveal that plectoneme initialization is dominated by the applied torque while the translocation time and size of the plectonemes depend on the coupling of torque and pulling force, a mechanism that might also be relevant for in vivo DNA organization. Experiments with nicked DNA constructs show that the number of plectonemes depends on the rotational constraints of the translocating molecules. Thus, our work introduces plectonemes as essential structural features that must be considered for accurate analysis of polymer transport in the nanopore.</description>

      <title>The structure-dynamics feedback mechanism governs the glassy dynamics in epithelial monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The glassy dynamics in confluent epithelial monolayers is crucial for several biological processes, such as wound healing, embryogenesis, cancer progression, etc. Several experiments have indicated that, unlike particulate systems, the glassy dynamics in these systems correlates with the static properties and shows a readily-found sub-Arrhenius relaxation. However, whether the statics-dynamics correlation is only qualitative or can provide quantitative predictions and what leads to the sub-Arrhenius relaxation remains unclear. We apply a particular analytical theory of glassy dynamics, the mode-coupling theory (MCT) that predicts dynamics using static properties alone as input, to the confluent systems. We demonstrate the remarkable applicability of MCT in simulations of the Vertex model and experiments on Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cells and show the quantitative nature of the structure-dynamics correlation in these systems. Our results elucidate that the structure-dynamics feedback mechanism of MCT, and not the barrier crossing mechanism, dominates the glassy dynamics in these systems where the relaxation time diverges as a power law with a universal exponent of $3/2$. This slower-than-exponential divergence naturally explains the sub-Arrhenius relaxation dynamics in these systems. The quantitative nature of the structure-dynamics correlation also suggests the possibility of describing various complex biological processes, such as cell division and apoptosis, via the static properties of the systems, such as cell shape or shape variability.</description>

      <title>Stochastic trade-offs and the emergence of diversification in E. coli evolution experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laboratory experiments with bacterial colonies, under well-controlled conditions often lead to evolutionary diversification, where at least two ecotypes emerge from an initially monomorphic population. Empirical evidence suggests that such "evolutionary branching" occurs stochastically, even under fixed and stable conditions. This stochastic nature is characterized by: (i) occurrence in a significant fraction, but not all, of experimental settings, (ii) emergence at widely varying times, and (iii) variable relative abundances of the resulting subpopulations across experiments. Theoretical approaches to understanding evolutionary branching under these conditions have been previously developed within the (deterministic) framework of "adaptive dynamics." Here, we advance the understanding of the stochastic nature of evolutionary outcomes by introducing the concept of "stochastic trade-offs" as opposed to "hard" ones. The key idea is that the stochasticity of mutations occurs in a high-dimensional trait space and this translates into variability that is constrained to a flexible tradeoff curve. By incorporating this additional source of stochasticity, we are able to account for the observed empirical variability and make predictions regarding the likelihood of evolutionary branching under different conditions. This approach effectively bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations, providing insights into when and how evolutionary branching is more likely to occur in laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient multiphoton microscopy with picosecond laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiphoton microscopes employ femtosecond lasers as light sources because the high peak power of the ultrashort pulse allows for multiphoton excitation of fluorescence in the examined sample. However, such short pulses are susceptible to broadening in a microscope's highly dispersive optical elements and require careful dispersion management, otherwise decreasing excitation efficiency. Here, we have developed a 10 nJ Yb:fiber picosecond laser with an integrated pulse picker unit and evaluated its performance in multiphoton microscopy. Our results show that performance comparable to femtosecond pulses can be obtained with picosecond pulses only by reducing the pulse repetition rate and that such pulses are significantly less prone to the effect of chromatic dispersion. These findings proved that the temporal compression of fiber lasers is not always efficient, and it can be omitted by using a smaller and easier-to-use all-fiber setup.</description>
