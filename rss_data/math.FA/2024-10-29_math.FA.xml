      <title>Jackson's inequality on the hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the best constant $J(n,d)$ such that Jackson's inequality \[ \inf_{\mathrm{deg}(g) \leq d} \|f - g\|_{\infty} \leq J(n,d) \, s(f), \] holds for all functions $f$ on the hypercube $\{0,1\}^n$, where $s(f)$ denotes the sensitivity of $f$. We show that the quantity $J(n, 0.499n)$ is bounded below by an absolute positive constant, independent of $n$. This complements Wagner's theorem, which establishes that $J(n,d)\leq 1 $. As a first application we show that reverse Bernstein inequality fails in the tail space $L^{1}_{\geq 0.499n}$ improving over previously known counterexamples in $L^{1}_{\geq C \log \log (n)}$. As a second application, we show that there exists a function $f : \{0,1\}^n \to [-1,1]$ whose sensitivity $s(f)$ remains constant, independent of $n$, while the approximate degree grows linearly with $n$. This result implies that the sensitivity theorem $s(f) \geq \Omega(\mathrm{deg}(f)^C)$ fails in the strongest sense for bounded real-valued functions even when $\mathrm{deg}(f)$ is relaxed to the approximate degree. We also show that in the regime $d = (1 - \delta)n$, the bound \[ J(n,d) \leq C \min\{\delta, \max\{\delta^2, n^{-2/3}\}\} \] holds. Moreover, when restricted to symmetric real-valued functions, we obtain $J_{\mathrm{symmetric}}(n,d) \leq C/d$ and the decay $1/d$ is sharp. Finally, we present results for a subspace approximation problem: we show that there exists a subspace $E$ of dimension $2^{n-1}$ such that $\inf_{g \in E} \|f - g\|_{\infty} \leq s(f)/n$ holds for all $f$.</description>

      <title>Matrix representation of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator for a torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We represent a matrix representation of the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator defined on the boundaries of a torus. A torus is a doubly connected domain in three dimensions. There is a well-known parametrization for the shape of the torus, the toroidal coordinate system. Based on the coordinate system, we use toroidal harmonics to get an expansion of the NP operator for the torus. Along with proper bases, the Neumann-Poincar\'e operator can be explicitly represented by an infinite matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schur product of two complex m x n matrices is their entry wise product. We show that an extremal element X in the convex set of m x n complex matrices of Schur multiplier norm at most 1 satisfies the inequality rank(X) =&lt; (m +n)^(1/2) . For positive n x n matrices with unit diagonal, we give a characterization of the extremal elements, and show that such a matrix satisfies rank(X) =&lt; n^(1/2).</description>

      <title>Embedding of some classes of operators into strongly continuous semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the embedding problem of an operator into a strongly continuous semigroup. We obtain characterizations for some classes of operators, namely composition operators and analytic Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space H^2. In particular, we focus on the isometric ones using the necessary and sufficient condition observed by T. Eisner.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hilbert Operator Acting on Hardy Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\alpha&gt;0$ and $\mu$ be a positive Borel measure on the interval $[0,1)$. The Hankel matrix $\mathcal{H}_{\mu,\alpha}=(\mu_{n,k,\alpha})_{n,k\ge0}$ with entries $\mu_{n,k,\alpha}=\int_{[0,1)}^{}\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha)}{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(\alpha)}t^{n+k}d\mu(t)$, induces, formally, the generalized-Hilbert operator as $$ \mathcal{H}_{\mu,\alpha}\left ( f \right ) \left ( z \right ) =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \left (\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \mu_{n,k,\alpha}a_k \right )z^n,z\in\mathbb{D} $$ where $f(z)={\textstyle \sum_{k=0}^{\infty }} a_kz^k$ is an analytic function in $\mathbb{D}$. This article is devoted study the measures $\mu$ for which $\mathcal{H}_{\mu,\alpha }$ is a bounded(resp., compact) operator from $H^p(0&lt;p\le1)$ into $H^p(1\le q&lt;\infty)$. Then, we also study the analogous problem in the Hardy spaces $H^p(1\le p\le2)$. Finally, we obtain the essential norm of $\mathcal{H}_{\mu,\alpha}$ from $H^p(0&lt;p\le1)$ into $H^p(1\le q&lt;\infty)$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss hyponormal block Toeplitz operators $T_{\Phi}$ over the vector-valued weighted Bergman space $A_\alpha^2\left(\mathbb{C}^n\right)$. And two conditions about hyponormal block Toeplitz operators $T_{\Phi}$ on $A_\alpha^2\left(\mathbb{C}^n\right)$ were discussed separately, where $ \Phi(z)=A z^p \bar{z}^q + B z^s \bar{z}^t $, $A,B$ are any n-order complex square matrices.</description>

      <title>Smooth Functional Calculus and Spectral Theorem in Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of projection families generalizes the classical notions of vector and operator-valued measures. We show that projection families are general enough to extend the Spectral Theorem to Banach algebras and operators between Banach spaces. To this end, we first develop a Smooth Functional Calculus in Banach algebras using the Cauchy-Pompeiu Formula, which is further extended to a Continuous Functional Calculus. We also show that these theorems are proper generalizations of the usual result for operators between Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Gibbs principle with infinitely many constraints: optimality conditions and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the Gibbs conditioning principle to an abstract setting combining infinitely many linear equality constraints and non-linear inequality constraints, which need not be convex. A conditional large large deviation principle (LDP) is proved in a Wassersteintype topology, and optimality conditions are written in this abstract setting. This setting encompasses versions of the Schr{\"o}dinger bridge problem with marginal non-linear inequality constraints at every time. In the case of convex constraints, stability results for perturbations both in the constraints and the reference measure are proved. We then specify our results when the reference measure is the path-law of a continuous diffusion process, whose law is constrained at each time. We obtain a complete description of the constrained process through an atypical mean-field PDE system involving a Lagrange multiplier.</description>

      <title>Translation-Invariant Behavior of General Scattering Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main result of our paper offers an alternative, simpler, proof of Mallat's result on the translation invariance of the limiting behavior of sequences of Wavelet Scattering Transforms, which (unlike Mallat's proof) does not rely on the admissibility condition or on the density of a logarithmic Sobolev space in $L^2$. Furthermore, this result is generalized to a broader class of scattering transforms, including, for instance, a modification of the Fourier Scattering Transform. We also prove a new upper bound for the translation contraction result for the Fourier Scattering Transform.</description>

      <title>Eccentric $p-$summing Lipschitz operators and integral inequalities on metric spaces and graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extension of the concept of $p-$summability for linear operators to the context of Lipschitz operators on metric spaces has been extensively studied in recent years. This research primarily uses the linearization of the metric space $M$ afforded by the associated Arens-Eells space, along with the duality between $M$ and the metric dual space $M^\#$ defined by the real-valued Lipschitz functions on $M.$ However, alternative approaches to measuring distances between sequences of elements of metric spaces (essentially involved in the definition of $p-$summability) exist. One approach involves considering specific subsets of the unit ball of $M^\#$ for computing the distances between sequences, such as the real Lipschitz functions derived from evaluating the difference of the values of the metric from two points to a fixed point. We introduce new notions of summability for Lipschitz operators involving such functions, which are characterized by integral dominations for those operators. To show the applicability of our results, we use in the last part of the paper the theoretical tools obtained in the first part to the analysis of metric graphs. In particular, we show new results on the behavior of numerical indices defined on these graphs satisfying certain conditions of summability and symmetry.</description>

      <title>Approximation of discontinuous functions by positive linear operators. A probabilistic approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain approximation results for general positive linear operators satisfying mild conditions, when acting on discontinuous functions and absolutely continuous functions having discontinuous derivatives. The upper bounds, given in terms of a local first modulus of continuity, are best possible, in the sense that we can construct particular sequences of operators attaining them. When applied to functions of bounded variation or absolutely continuous functions having derivatives of bounded variation, these upper bounds are better and simpler to compute than the usual total variation bounds. The particular case of the Bernstein polynomials is thoroughly discussed. We use a probabilistic approach based on representations of such operators in terms of expectations of random variables.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study eigenvalue problems for the de Rham complex on varying three dimensional domains. Our analysis includes both the Helmholtz equation and the Maxwell system with mixed boundary conditions and non-constant coefficients. We provide Hadamard-type formulas for the shape derivatives under weak regularity assumptions on the domain and its perturbations. Proofs are based on abstract results adapted to varying Hilbert complexes. As a bypass product of our analysis we give a proof of the celebrated Helmann-Feynman theorem for simple eigenvalues assuming differentiability of the corresponding eigenvectors. In a forthcoming publication we aim for a more general result involving also multiple eigenvalues of suitable families of self-adjoint operators in Hilbert spaces depending on possibly infinite dimensional parameters.</description>

      <title>IDA function and asymptotic behavior of singular values of Hankel operators on weighted Bergman spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the non-increasing rearrangement of ${\rm IDA}$ function with respect to a suitable measure to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the singular values sequence $\{s_n(H_f)\}_n$ of Hankel operators $H_f$ acting on a large class of weighted Bergman spaces, including standard Bergman spaces on the unit disc, standard Fock spaces and weighted Fock spaces. As a corollary, we show that the simultaneous asymptotic behavior of $\{s_n(H_f)\}$ and $\{s_n(H_{\bar{f}})\}$ can be characterized in terms of the asymptotic behavior of non-increasing rearrangement of mean oscillation function. Moreover, in the context of weighted Fock spaces, we demonstrate the Berger-Coburn phenomenon concerning the membership of Hankel operators in the weak Schatten $p$-class.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate estimates about the Laplace operator in heat flows of harmonic maps, focusing outside the singularities through spherical coordinates. These estimates can be used in the general Ericksen--Leslie system to obtain higher-order estimates. We consider the problem subject to the $\mathbb{T}^2$ and $\mathbb{T}^3$ boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>New results related to cutters and to an extrapolated block-iterative method for finding a common fixed point of a collection of them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a Hilbert space and a finite family of operators defined on the space, the common fixed point problem (CFPP) is the problem of finding a point in the intersection of the fixed point sets of these operators. A particular case of the problem, when the operators are orthogonal projections, is the convex feasibility problem which has numerous applications in science and engineering. In a previous work [Censor, Reem, and Zaknoon, A generalized block-iterative projection method for the common fixed point problem induced by cutters, J. Global Optim. 84 (2022), 967--987] we studied a block-iterative method with dynamic weights for solving the CFPP assuming the operators belong to a wide class of operators called cutters. In this work we continue the study of this algorithm by allowing extrapolation, namely we weaken the assumption on the relaxation parameters. We prove the convergence of this algorithm when the space is finite dimensional in two different scenarios, one of them is under a seems to be new condition on the weights which is less restrictive than a condition suggested in previous works. Along the way we obtain various new results of independent interest related to cutters, some of them extend, generalize and clarify previously published results.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric and geometric inequalities in quantitative form: Stein's method approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt Stein's method to isoperimetric and geometric inequalities. The main challenge is the treatment of boundary terms. We address this by using an elliptic PDE with an oblique boundary condition. We apply our geometric formulation of Stein's method to obtain stability of the Brock-Weinstock inequality, stability of the isoperimetric inequality under a constraint on Steklov's first non-zero eigenvalue, and stability for the combination of weighted and unweighted perimeters. All stability results are formulated with respect to the $\alpha$-Zolotarev distance, $\alpha$ $\in$ (0, 1], that we introduce to interpolate between the Fraenkel asymmetry and the Kantorovich distance.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Stieltjes algebras, decomposable Fourier multipliers and amenability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra $\mathrm{B}(G)$ of a discrete group $G$ is isometrically isomorphic to the algebra $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{dec}}(G)$ of decomposable Fourier multipliers on the group von Neumann algebra $\mathrm{VN}(G)$. In contrast, we show that $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{dec}}(G) \neq \mathrm{B}(G)$ for some classes of non-discrete locally compact groups, while we prove that $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{dec}}(G) = \mathrm{B}(G)$ holds for any (unimodular) inner amenable locally compact group. To prove these results, we leverage groupoid theory and investigate the problem of whether a contractive projection exists, preserving complete positivity, from the space of normal completely bounded operators on $\mathrm{VN}(G)$ onto the space $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{cb}}(G)$ of completely bounded Fourier multipliers. We provide an affirmative solution in the inner amenable case and demonstrate that such projections do not exist for non-amenable connected locally compact groups. Further, we investigate whether the space $\mathfrak{M}^{p,\mathrm{cb}}(G)$ of completely bounded Fourier multipliers on the noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-space $\mathrm{L}^p(\mathrm{VN}(G))$ is complemented in the space of completely bounded operators, where $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. Using doubling metrics on Lie groups and structural results from the solution to Hilbert's fifth problem, we establish that any (unimodular) amenable locally compact group admits compatible bounded projections at the levels $p=1$ and $p=\infty$, which has applications to decomposable Fourier multipliers. Moreover, we present a new characterization of amenability and exhibit a completely bounded Fourier multiplier acting on the von Neumann algebra of a free group, which is not approximable by weak* continuous decomposable operators, thereby improving a result of de Canni\`ere and Haagerup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of bounded linear operators from a Banach space to a Banach lattice is collectively L-weakly compact whenever union of images of the unit ball is L-weakly compact. We extend the Meyer-Nieberg duality theorem to collectively L-weakly compact sets of operators, study relations between these sets and collectively almost limited sets, and discuss the domination problem for collectively compact sets and collectively L-weakly compact sets.</description>

Abstract: Strengthening of two Clarkson-McCarthy inequalities with several operators is established. These not only confirm a conjecture of the author in [Israel J. Math. 2024], but also improve results of Hirazallah-Kittaneh in [Integral Equations Operator Theory 60 (2008)] and Bhatia-Kittaneh in [Bull. London Math. Soc. 36 (2004)]. We also give a generalization of a result for pairs $(A_i,B_i), 1\le i\le n$ and obtain another form of another inequality. The infinite cases of these inequalities are also discussed. The method is an extension of the result obtained by Bourin and Lee in [Linear Algebra Appl. 601 (2020)]. Some related eigenvalue inequalities are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Using the Baire Category Theorem to Explore Lions Problem for Quasi-Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many results for Banach spaces also hold for quasi-Banach spaces. One important such example is results depending on the Baire Category Theorem (BCT). We use the BCT to explore Lions problem for a quasi-Banach couple $(A_0, A_1)$. Lions problem, posed in 1960's, is to prove that different parameters $(\theta,p)$ produce different interpolation spaces $(A_0, A_1)_{\theta, p}$. We first establish conditions on $A_0$ and $A_1$ so that interpolation spaces of this couple are strictly intermediate spaces between $A_0+A_1$ and $A_0\cap A_1$. This result, together with a reiteration theorem, gives a partial solution to Lions problem for quasi-Banach couples. We then apply our interpolation result to (partially) answer a question posed by Pietsch. More precisely, we show that if $p\neq p^*$ the operator ideals $\mathcal{L}^{(a)}_{p,q}(X,Y)$, $\mathcal{L}^{(a)}_{p^*,q^*}(X,Y)$ generated by approximation numbers are distinct. Moreover, for any fixed $p$, either all operator ideals $\mathcal{L}^{(a)}_{p,q}(X,Y)$ collapse into a unique space or they are pairwise distinct. We cite counterexamples which show that using interpolation spaces is not appropriate to solve Pietsch's problem for operator ideals based on general $s$-numbers. However, the BCT can be used to prove a lethargy result for arbitrary $s$-numbers which guarantees that, under very minimal conditions on $X,Y$, the space $\mathcal{L}^{(s)}_{p,q}(X,Y)$ is strictly embedded into $\mathcal{L}^{\mathcal{A}}(X,Y)$. The paper is dedicated to the memory of Prof. A. Pietsch, who passed away recently.</description>

      <title>Classical harmonic analysis viewed through the prism of noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to bridge noncommutative geometry with classical harmonic analysis on Banach spaces, focusing primarily on both classical and noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$ spaces. Introducing a notion of Banach Fredholm module, we define new abelian groups, $\mathrm{K}^{0}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$ and $\mathrm{K}^{1}(\mathcal{A},\mathscr{B})$, of $\mathrm{K}$-homology associated with an algebra $\mathcal{A}$ and a suitable class $\mathscr{B}$ of Banach spaces, such as the class of $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. We establish index pairings of these groups with the $\mathrm{K}$-theory groups of the algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Subsequently, by considering (noncommutative) Hardy spaces, we uncover the natural emergence of Hilbert transforms, leading to Banach Fredholm modules and culminating in index theorems. Moreover, by associating each reasonable sub-Markovian semigroup of operators with a &lt;&lt;Banach noncommutative manifold&gt;&gt;, we explain how this leads to (possibly kernel-degenerate) Banach Fredholm modules, thereby revealing the role of vectorial Riesz transforms in this context. Overall, our approach significantly integrates the analysis of operators on $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces into the expansive framework of noncommutative geometry, offering new perspectives.</description>

      <title>Typical Lipschitz images of rectifiable metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07943v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article studies typical 1-Lipschitz images of $n$-rectifiable metric spaces $E$ into $\mathbb{R}^m$ for $m\geq n$. For example, if $E\subset \mathbb{R}^k$, we show that the Jacobian of such a typical 1-Lipschitz map equals 1 $\mathcal{H}^n$-almost everywhere and, if $m&gt;n$, preserves the Hausdorff measure of $E$. In general, we provide sufficient conditions, in terms of the tangent norms of $E$, for when a typical 1-Lipschitz map preserves the Hausdorff measure of $E$, up to some constant multiple. Almost optimal results for strongly $n$-rectifiable metric spaces are obtained.
  On the other hand, for any norm $|\cdot|$ on $\mathbb{R}^m$, we show that, in the space of 1-Lipschitz functions from $([-1,1]^n,|\cdot|_\infty)$ to $(\mathbb{R}^m,|\cdot|)$, the $\mathcal{H}^n$-measure of a typical image is not bounded below by any $\Delta&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>On predicting for non-vanishing unbounded continuous time signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper studies spectral representation as well as predictability and recoverability problems for non-vanishing unbounded continuous time signals, i.e., for signals that do not necessarily bounded at $\pm\infty$. The notions of transfer functions, spectrum gaps, bandlimitness, and low-pass filters are introduced for these signals.
  This allowed to obtain some frequency criteria for predictability and predictors for signals with a single point spectrum degeneracy and with sublinear rate of growth.</description>

Abstract: We establish complete characterizations of the notion of Li-Yorke chaos for weighted composition operators on $C_0(X)$ spaces and on $L^p(\mu)$ spaces. As a consequence, we obtain simple characterizations of the Li-Yorke chaotic weighted shifts on $c_0$ and on $\ell^p$ ($1 \leq p &lt; \infty$) that complement previously known results. We also investigate the notion of Li-Yorke chaos for weighted shifts on Fr\'echet sequence spaces. As applications, we obtain characterizations of the Li-Yorke chaotic weighted shifts on K\"othe sequence spaces depending only on the entries of the K\"othe matrix and the weights of the shift.</description>

      <title>The Klain approach to zonal valuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show an analogue of the Klain-Schneider theorem for valuations that are invariant under rotations around a fixed axis, called zonal. Using this, we establish a new integral representation of zonal valuations involving mixed area measures with a disk. In our argument, we introduce an easy way to translate between this representation and the one involving area measures, yielding a shorter proof of a recent characterization by Knoerr. As applications, we obtain various zonal integral geometric formulas, extending results by Hug, Mussnig, and Ulivelli. Finally, we provide a simpler proof of the integral representation of the mean section operators by Goodey and Weil.</description>
