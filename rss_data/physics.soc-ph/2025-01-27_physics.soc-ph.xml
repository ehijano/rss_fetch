      <title>Time-Dependent Queuing Model for Traffic Congestion Using Mt/D/1/K: Simulation and Policy Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a generalised macroscopic traffic simulation using a Mt/D/1/K queue to model congestion, using the Enniskillen to Belfast route as a case study. Empirical traffic data from Google's Directions API is used to calibrate the model, thus explaining peak commute times which we model using queue length. Simulations of staggered institutional start times showed significant reductions in queue lengths, suggesting time based interventions to improve rural to urban traffic flow.</description>

      <title>PASER: A Physics-Inspired Theory for Stimulated Growth and Real-Time Optimization in On-Demand Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative framework for understanding on-demand platforms by quantifying positive network effects, trust, revenue dynamics, and the influence of demand on platform operations at per-minute or even per-second granularity. Drawing inspiration from physics, the framework provides both a theoretical and pragmatic perspective, offering a pictorial and quantitative representation of how on-demand platforms create value. It seeks to demystify their nuanced operations by providing practical, tangible, and highly applicable metrics, platform design templates, and real-time optimization tools for strategic what-if scenario planning. Its model demonstrates strong predictive power and is deeply rooted in raw data. The framework offers a deterministic insight into the workings of diverse platforms like Uber, Airbnb, and food delivery services. Furthermore, it generalizes to model all on-demand service platforms with cyclical operations. It works synergistically with machine learning, game theory, and agent-based models by providing a solid quantitative core rooted in raw data, based on physical truths, and is capable of delivering tangible predictions for real-time operational adjustments. The framework's mathematical model was rigorously validated using highly detailed historical data retrieved with near 100% certainty. Applying data-driven induction, distinct qualities were identified in big data sets via an iterative process. Through analogical thinking, a clear and highly intuitive mapping between the elements, operational principles, and dynamic behaviors of a well-known physical system was established to create a physics-inspired lens for Uber. This novel quantitative framework was named PASER (Profit Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Revenue), drawing an analogy to its physical counterpart, the LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation).</description>

      <title>Avoiding Overfitting in Variable-Order Markov Models: a Cross-Validation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher$\text{-}$order Markov chain models are widely used to represent agent transitions in dynamic systems, such as passengers in transport networks. They capture transitions in complex systems by considering not only the current state but also the path of previously visited states. For example, the likelihood of train passengers traveling from Paris (current state) to Rome could increase significantly if their journey originated in Italy (prior state). Although this approach provides a more faithful representation of the system than first$\text{-}$order models, we find that commonly used methods$-$relying on Kullback$\text{-}$Leibler divergence$-$frequently overfit the data, mistaking fluctuations for higher$\text{-}$order dependencies and undermining forecasts and resource allocation. Here, we introduce DIVOP (Detection of Informative Variable$\text{-}$Order Paths), an algorithm that employs cross$\text{-}$validation to robustly distinguish meaningful higher$\text{-}$order dependencies from noise. In both synthetic and real$\text{-}$world datasets, DIVOP outperforms two state$\text{-}$of$\text{-}$the$\text{-}$art algorithms by achieving higher precision, recall, and sparser representations of the underlying dynamics. When applied to global corporate ownership data, DIVOP reveals that tax havens appear in 82$\%$ of all significant higher$\text{-}$order dependencies, underscoring their outsized influence in corporate networks. By mitigating overfitting, DIVOP enables more reliable multi$\text{-}$step predictions and decision$\text{-}$making, paving the way toward deeper insights into the hidden structures that drive modern interconnected systems.</description>

      <title>Mean-field game approach to epidemic propagation on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an SIR model of epidemic propagation on networks in the context of mean-field games. In a real epidemic, individuals adjust their behavior depending on the epidemic level and the impact it might have on them in the future. These individual behaviors in turn affect the epidemic dynamics. Mean-field games are a framework in which these retroaction effects can be captured. We derive dynamical equations for the epidemic quantities in terms of individual contact rates, and via mean-field approximations we obtain the Nash equilibrium associated with the minimization of a certain cost function. We first consider homogeneous networks, where all individuals have the same number of neighbors, and discuss how the individual behaviors are modified when that number is varied. We then investigate the case of a realistic heterogeneous network based on real data from a social contact network. Our results allow to assess the potential of such an approach for epidemic mitigation in real-world implementations.</description>

      <title>The Paradox of Intervention: Resilience in Adaptive Multi-Role Coordination Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex adaptive networks exhibit remarkable resilience, driven by the dynamic interplay of structure (interactions) and function (state). While static-network analyses offer valuable insights, understanding how structure and function co-evolve under external interventions is critical for explaining system-level adaptation. Using a unique dataset of clandestine criminal networks, we combine empirical observations with computational modeling to test the impact of various interventions on network adaptation. Our analysis examines how networks with specialized roles adapt and form emergent structures to optimize cost-benefit trade-offs. We find that emergent sparsely connected networks exhibit greater resilience, revealing a security-efficiency trade-off. Notably, interventions can trigger a "criminal opacity amplification" effect, where criminal activity increases despite reduced network visibility. While node isolation fragments networks, it strengthens remaining active ties. In contrast, deactivating nodes (analogous to social reintegration) can unintentionally boost criminal coordination, increasing activity or connectivity. Failed interventions often lead to temporary functional surges before reverting to baseline. Surprisingly, stimulating connectivity destabilizes networks. Effective interventions require precise calibration to node roles, connection types, and external conditions. These findings challenge conventional assumptions about connectivity and intervention efficacy in complex adaptive systems across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Social dynamics can delay or prevent climate tipping points by speeding the adoption of climate change mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social behaviour models are increasingly integrated into climate change studies, and the significance of climate tipping points for `runaway' climate change is well recognised. However, there has been insufficient focus on tipping points in social-climate dynamics. We developed a coupled social-climate model consisting of an Earth system model and a social behaviour model, both with tipping elements. The social model explores opinion formation by analysing social learning rates, the net cost of mitigation, and the strength of social norms. Our results indicate that the net cost of mitigation and social norms have minimal impact on tipping points when social norms are weak. As social norms strengthen, the climate tipping point can trigger a tipping element in the social model. However, faster social learning can delay or prevent the climate tipping point: sufficiently fast social learning means growing climate change mitigation can outpace the oncoming climate tipping point, despite social-climate feedback. By comparing high- and low-risk scenarios, we demonstrated high-risk scenarios increase the likelihood of tipping points. We also illustrate the role of a critical temperature anomaly in triggering tipping points. In conclusion, understanding social behaviour dynamics is vital for predicting climate tipping points and mitigating their impacts.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic modelling of car traffic accidents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a counting process to model the random occurrence in time of car traffic accidents, taking into account some aspects of the self-excitation typical of this phenomenon. By combining methods from probability and differential equations, we study this stochastic process in terms of its statistical moments and large-time trend. Moreover, we derive analytically the probability density functions of the times of occurrence of traffic accidents and of the time elapsing between two consecutive accidents. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of our modelling approach by means of numerical simulations, which address also a comparison with real data of weekly trends of traffic accidents.</description>

      <title>Fractal-cluster theory and thermodynamic principles of the control and analysis for the self-organizing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1415</link>
      <description>arXiv:1309.1415v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of resource distribution in self-organizing systems on the basis of the fractal-cluster method has been presented. In turn, the fractal-cluster method is based on the fractal-cluster relations of V.P. Burdakov and the analytical apparatus of the thermodynamics of I. Prigozhin's structure. This theory consists of two parts: deterministic and probabilistic. The first part includes the static and dynamic criteria, the fractal-cluster dynamic equations which are based on the Fibonacci's range characteristics fractal-cluster correlations. The second part includes fundamentals of the probabilistic theory of a fractal-cluster systems. This part includes the dynamic equations of the probabilistic evolution of these systems. By using the numerical researches of these equations for the stationary case the random state field of the self-organizing system in the phase space of the $D$, $H$ criteria and probability $f$ have been obtained. For the socio-economical and biological systems this theory has been tested. In particular, three fundamental fractal-cluster laws have been obtained for biological organisms: probabilistic, energetic and evolutionary.</description>

      <title>Waste Heat and Habitability: Constraints from Technological Energy Consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Waste heat production represents an inevitable consequence of energy conversion as per the laws of thermodynamics. Based on this fact, by using simple theoretical models, we analyze constraints on the habitability of Earth-like terrestrial planets hosting putative technological species and technospheres characterized by persistent exponential growth of energy consumption and waste heat generation. In particular, we quantify the deleterious effects of rising surface temperature on biospheric processes and the eventual loss of liquid water. Irrespective of whether these sources of energy are ultimately stellar or planetary (e.g., nuclear, fossil fuels) in nature, we demonstrate that the loss of habitable conditions on such terrestrial planets may be expected to occur on timescales of $\lesssim 1000$ years, as measured from the start of the exponential phase, provided that the annual growth rate of energy consumption is of order $1\%$. We conclude with a discussion of the types of evolutionary trajectories that might be feasible for industrialized technological species, and we sketch the ensuing implications for technosignature searches.</description>

      <title>COOL Research DAO Whitepaper -- Towards community-owned astrophysics for everyone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysics forms a cornerstone of human curiosity and has revolutionised our understanding of the Universe. However, conventional academic structures often hinder collaboration, transparency, and discovery. We present COOL Research DAO, a next-generation framework for cosmic origins astrophysics research that uses decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO) principles to make astrophysics research globally accessible, economically fair, and intellectually open. COOL Research DAO is designed to address four key systemic problems and their manifestations in traditional academic research: general inaccessibility, hierarchical organisation, unfair economic structures, and inefficient knowledge transfer. We describe how these inefficiencies can be addressed using blockchain-based tools and token systems. By fostering bottom-up governance, open-access knowledge networks, and transparent rewards, COOL Research DAO reshapes economic, organisational, and educational paradigms in astrophysics research. Our approach leverages the data-rich and inherently international nature of astrophysics, ensuring a scalable, collaborative platform that welcomes contributions ranging from computational analyses to public outreach. In doing so, we highlight a path toward realising our vision of a truly open research ecosystem, driven by community ownership, intellectual freedom, and shared fascination with our cosmic origins.</description>
