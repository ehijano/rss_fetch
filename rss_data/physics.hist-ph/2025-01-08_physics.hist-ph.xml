      <title>A no-go result for QBism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In QBism the wave function does not represent an element of physical reality external to the agent, but represent an agent's personal probability assignments, reflecting his subjective degrees of belief about the future content of his experience. In this paper, I argue that this view of the wave function is not consistent with protective measurements. The argument does not rely on the realist assumption of the psi-ontology theorems, namely the existence of the underlying ontic state of a quantum system.</description>

      <title>Can the ontology of Bohmian mechanics consists only in particles? The PBR theorem says no</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The meaning of the wave function is an important unresolved issue in Bohmian mechanics. On the one hand, according to the nomological view, the wave function of the universe or the universal wave function is nomological, like a law of nature. On the other hand, the PBR theorem proves that the wave function in quantum mechanics or the effective wave function in Bohmian mechanics is ontic, representing the ontic state of a physical system in the universe. It is usually thought that the nomological view of the universal wave function is compatible with the ontic view of the effective wave function, and thus the PBR theorem has no implications for the nomological view. In this paper, I argue that this is not the case, and these two views are in fact incompatible. This means that if the effective wave function is ontic as the PBR theorem proves, then the universal wave function cannot be nomological, and the ontology of Bohmian mechanics cannot consist only in particles. This incompatibility result holds true not only for Humeanism and dispositionalism but also for primitivism about laws of nature, which attributes a fundamental ontic role to the universal wave function. Moreover, I argue that although the nomological view can be held by rejecting one key assumption of the PBR theorem, the rejection will lead to serious problems, such as that the results of measurements and their probabilities cannot be explained in ontology in Bohmian mechanics. Finally, I briefly discuss three psi-ontologies, namely a physical field in a fundamental high-dimensional space, a multi-field in three-dimensional space, and RDMP (Random Discontinuous Motion of Particles) in three-dimensional space, and argue that the RDMP ontology can answer the objections to the psi-ontology raised by the proponents of the nomological view.</description>

      <title>The April 1, 2471 b.C. eclipse and the end of 4th Egyptian dynasty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On April 1, 2471 bC an impressive, unpredictable phenomenon occurred over the Delta of the Nile: a total solar eclipse, with totality band almost centered on the sacred city of Buto, and with the capital Memphis very close (&gt;95%) to totality. This date is compatible with existing chronologies for the reign of Pharaoh Shepseskaf, who adopted a clamorous symbolic break with respect to the tradition of solarized kings started by Khufu. Indeed his tomb was not built in view from Heliopolis and was not a pyramid, but a kind of unique monument resembling the symbolic shrine at Buto. The aim of the present paper is to investigate in a systematic way the possibility that the origin of this historical break, which marks the end of the 4th dynasty, can be identified precisely in the 2471 bC eclipse, therefore furnishing a new astronomical anchor for the chronology of the Old Kingdom.</description>

      <title>Cournot's for measure-theoretic probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of classical probability, Cournot's principle states that an event with probability very close to $1$ occurs nearly certainly in a single trial of an experiment. This principle has been considered by various authors as the only connection between mathematical probability and the real world of experiments.
  After Kolmogorov, classical probability has been replaced by measure-theoretic probability, where the classical definition of probability is no longer available, and probability spaces and experiments are separate entities that must be related in some way. In this context, the classical formulation of Cournot's principle is no longer appropriate.
  In this paper, a formulation of Cournot's principle appropriate for measure-theoretic probability is proposed. The main changes of the new formulation are: (1) the explicit definition of the empirical property of practical certainty, (2) the formulation of the principle as a criterion for relating probability measures and experiments, and (3) the explicit formulation of the product rule for independent trials. Particular attention has been paid to formulating the new version in a form that is as mathematically rigorous as possible.</description>
