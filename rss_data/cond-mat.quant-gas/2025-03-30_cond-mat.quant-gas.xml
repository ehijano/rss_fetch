      <title>Quantum Borderlines -- Fluctuation Energies in Ultracold Bose Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultracold Bose gases are many-body systems with well-defined particle interactions that may serve as models for interacting quantum fields. The impact of virtual excitations is studied in the spatial transition zone created by a soft confinement potential that separates a degenerate ideal gas from a dense quasi-condensate. We compute within Bogoliubov theory the contribution of quasi-particles to the surface energy at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Rotating anisotropic Bose gas with large number of vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating atomic gases provide a platform for studying phenomena akin to type-II superconductors and quantum Hall systems. Recently, these systems have attracted renewed interest due to technological advances in the trap anisotropy control, in-situ observation capabilities, and cooling and rotating complex atomic species such as dipolar gases. Understanding the vortex lattice formation and quantum melting is crucial for exploring quantum Hall physics in these systems. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the vortex lattices in anisotropic quantum gases. We formulate the rotating gas Hamiltonian in the Landau gauge, and consider the effects of additional perturbations such as the trap potential in the lowest Landau level (LLL). Focusing on the gases with short-range interactions, we obtain the many-body Hamiltonian projected to lowest Landau level. We consider the limit of full Bose-Einstein condensation and obtain the governing Gross-Pitaevskii equation to identify the possible vortex phases. We numerically solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation using the imaginary time evolution, and demonstrate the possible vortex lattices as a function of anisotropy, rotation speed and interaction strength. We show that the number of states with a support in the LLL, which determines the number of vortices, follows a Thomas-Fermi type scaling albeit with slightly different coefficients from the usual condensates.</description>

      <title>Non-resonant inter-species interaction and its effect on the position response function of cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of non-equilibrium statistical physics, the position response of a particle, coupled to a bath, subjected to an external force is a topic of broad interest. A topic of further interest is two distinguishable sets of interacting particles in contact with two different baths. Here, we report the experimental evidence of the modification of the position response function (PRF) of an ensemble of cold atoms in a magneto-optical trap when it is placed alongside a dilute cloud of cold atoms of a different species. Our experiment consists of a mass-imbalanced cold atomic mixture of Potassium and Sodium atoms. We focus on the position response of Potassium atoms when subjected to a sudden displacement in the presence of a cold Sodium atomic cloud. Notably, we find that, in the underdamped regime of motion, the oscillation frequency of motion of the cold atoms changes as much as 30 $\%$ depending on the effective inter-species light-assisted interaction strength. On the other hand, in the overdamped regime, there is a reduction, as high as 10.5 $\%$ in the damping coefficient, depending on the interaction strength. Using a quantum Langevin approach, we develop a framework that aligns well with experimental results, with potential applications in mass and charge transport studies under varied physical conditions simulated in cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Generic transverse stability of kink structures in atomic and optical nonlinear media with competing attractive and repulsive interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence and stability of one-dimensional (1D) topological kink configurations immersed in higher-dimensional bosonic gases and nonlinear optical setups. Our analysis pertains, in particular, to the two- and three-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii models with quantum fluctuations describing droplet-bearing environments but also to the two-dimensional cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation containing higher-order corrections to the nonlinear refractive index. Contrary to the generic dark soliton transverse instability, the kink structures are generically robust under the interplay of low-amplitude attractive and high-amplitude repulsive interactions. A quasi-1D effective potential picture dictates the existence of these defects, while their stability is obtained numerically and analytically through linearization analysis and direct dynamics in the presence of external fluctuations showcasing their unprecedented resilience. These generic (across different models) findings should be detectable in current cold atom and optics experiments, offering insights towards controlling topological excitations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulation with Gauge Fixing: from Ising Lattice Gauge Theory to Dynamical Flux Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of synthetic dynamic gauge field has attracted much attentions in recent years. There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge theories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories with local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected Hamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way towards the simulation of gauge theories based on gauge fixing. To demonstrate this concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field coupled with spinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing, this gauge theory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a ladder with a fluctuating dynamical $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux. Then we shows that this model can be realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases. By analytical and numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce that there is confinement to deconfinement phase transition in the original unfixed gauge theory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge theory using the concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed matter and high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase and multipartite entanglement of Rydberg atom chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of geometric phase (GP) and geometric entanglement (GE), a multipartite entanglement measure, across quantum phase transitions in Rydberg atom chains. Using density matrix renormalization group calculations and finite-size scaling analysis, we characterize the critical properties of transitions between disordered and ordered phases. Both quantities exhibit characteristic scaling near transition points, with the disorder to $Z_2$ ordered phase transition showing behavior consistent with the Ising universality class, while the disorder to $Z_3$ phase transition displays distinct critical properties. We demonstrate that GP and GE serve as sensitive probes of quantum criticality, providing consistent critical parameters and scaling behavior. A unifying description of these geometric quantities from a quantum geometry perspective is explored, and an interferometric setup for their potential measurement is discussed. Our results provide insights into the interplay between geometric phase and multipartite entanglement near quantum phase transitions in Rydberg atom systems, revealing how these quantities reflect the underlying critical behavior in these complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical formation of multiple quantum droplets in a Bose-Bose mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the formation of multiple quantum droplets in a heteronuclear $^{41}$K-$^{87}$Rb mixture released in an optical waveguide. By a sudden change of the interspecies interaction from the non-interacting to the strongly attractive regime, we initially form a single droplet in an excited compression-elongation mode. The latter axially expands up to a critical length and then splits into two or more smaller fragments, recognizable as quantum droplets. We find that the number of formed droplets increases with decreasing interspecies attraction and increasing atom number. We show, by combining theory and experiment, that this behavior is consistent with capillary instability, which causes the breakup of the stretching droplet due to the surface tension. Our results open new possibilities to explore the properties of quantum liquids and systems of multiple quantum droplets in two-component bosonic mixtures.</description>

      <title>Atomic Josephson Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a driven atomic Josephson junction that we propose as a parametric amplifier. By periodically modulating the position of the barrier, we induce a small current across the junction, serving as our input signal. The pump field is implemented by modulating the barrier height at twice the Josephson plasma frequency. The resulting dynamics exhibit parametric amplification of the signal through nonlinear mixing between the signal and pump fields, which is reflected by specific patterns of density waves and phase excitations. We employ a classical-field dynamics method and benchmark our results against driven circuit dynamics. This work paves the way for tunable quantum amplifiers in atomtronic circuits, with potential applications in several fields including precision measurements and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Tunable two-species spin models with Rydberg atoms in circular and elliptical states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14854v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for constructing versatile quantum simulators using ultracold Rydberg atoms in long-lived circular and elliptical states. By exciting different subspaces of internal atomic states, the atoms can be used to simulate two effective spin species with different spin-spin interactions. The strengths of transverse and longitudinal spin-spin interactions, both intra- and inter-species, can be controlled within a wide range of values. This setup can be used to simulate two-species spin models or lattice models with two sublattices. We show examples of specific models which can be realized.</description>
