      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff Convergence of Smocked Measure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smocked spaces are a special class of metric spaces which were introduced as a generalisation of pulled thread spaces. We investigate convergence of these spaces, showing that the smocked space obtained from the Hausdorff limit of a sequence of smocking sets is equivalent to the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the corresponding smocked spaces and also obtaining an analogue of Gromov's compactness theorem for smocked spaces. We then introduce smocked metric measure spaces and smocked Wasserstein spaces of measures, finding that there is a result for Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of certain smocked Wasserstein spaces which may be useful for studying a large class of PDEs which appear in mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>On the complements of union of open balls and related set classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let a $R$-body be a closed set, complement of union of open balls of radius $R$ in the Euclidean space. Properties generalizing similar ones for convex sets are proved for the family of $R$-bodies; properties for the family of sets supported by spheres of radius $R$ (extension of the supporting hyperplane to convex bodies) are investigated. Comparison of that family with the sets of reach $R$ and with the $R$-rolling sets are studied. New properties for the previous families are proved, by using the $R$-cones, generalization of the convex cones.</description>

      <title>Non-Euclidean Triangle Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:1608.08190v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Euclidean triangle centers can be described using homogeneous coordinates that are proportional to the generalized sines of the directed distances of a given center from the edges of the reference triangle. Identical homogeneous coordinates of a specific triangle center may be used for all spaces of uniform Gaussian curvature. We also define the median point for a set of points in non-Euclidean space and a planar center of rotation for a set of points in a non-Euclidean plane.</description>

      <title>Colorful Vector Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend classical estimates for the vector balancing constant of $\mathbb{R}^d$ equipped with the Euclidean and the maximum norms proved in the 1980's by showing that for $p =2$ and $p=\infty$, given vector families $V_1, \ldots, V_n \subset B_p^d$ with $0 \in \sum_{i=1}^n \mathrm{conv}\, V_i$, one may select vectors $v_i \in V_i$ with $ \| v_1 + \ldots + v_n \|_2 \leq \sqrt{d}$ for $p=2$, and $ \| v_1 + \ldots + v_n \|_\infty \leq O(\sqrt{d}) $ for $p = \infty$. These bounds are sharp and asymptotically sharp, respectively, for $n \geq d$. The proofs combine linear algebraic and probabilistic methods with a Gaussian random walk argument.</description>

      <title>The Andoni-Naor-Neiman inequalities and isometric embeddability into a $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Andoni, Naor and Neiman (2018) established a family of quadratic metric inequalities that hold true in every $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space. As stated in their paper, this family seems to include all previously used quadratic metric inequalities that hold true in every $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space. We prove that there exists a metric space that satisfies all inequalities in this family but does not admit an isometric embedding into any $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space. More precisely, we prove that the $6$-point metric space constructed by Nina Lebedeva, which does not admit an isometric embedding into any $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space, satisfy all inequalities in this family.</description>

      <title>A flexible polyhedron without self-intersections in Euclidean 3-space, all of whose dihedral angles change during a flex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a sphere-homeomorphic flexible self-intersection free polyhedron in Euclidean 3-space such that all its dihedral angles change during some flex of this polyhedron. The constructed polyhedron has 26 vertices, 72 edges and 48 faces. To study its properties, we use symbolic computations in the Wolfram Mathematica software system.</description>

      <title>Coarse cubical rigidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.11418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for many right-angled Artin and Coxeter groups, all cocompact cubulations coarsely look the same: they induce the same coarse median structure on the group. These are the first examples of non-hyperbolic groups with this property.
  For all graph products of finite groups and for Coxeter groups with no irreducible affine parabolic subgroups of rank $\geq 3$, we show that all automorphism preserve the coarse median structure induced, respectively, by the Davis complex and the Niblo-Reeves cubulation. As a consequence, automorphisms of these groups have nice fixed subgroups and satisfy Nielsen realisation.</description>

      <title>Exploring a Modification of $d_p$ Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the work by M. C. Lee, A. Naber, and R. Neumayer a beautiful $\varepsilon$-regularity theorem is proved under small negative scalar curvature and entropy bounds. In that paper, the $d_p$ distance for Riemannian manifolds is introduced and the quantitative stability results are given in terms of this notion of distance, with important examples showing why other existing notions of convergence are not adequate in their setting. Due to the presence of an entropy bound, the possibility of long, thin splines forming along a sequence of Riemannian manifolds whose scalar curvature is becoming almost positive is ruled out. It is important to rule out such examples since the $d_p$ distance is not well behaved in the presences of splines that persist in the limit. Since there are many geometric stability conjectures where we want to allow for the presence of splines that persist in the limit, it is crucial to be able to modify the $d_p$ distance to retain its positive qualities and prevent it from being sensitive to splines. In this paper we explore one such modification of the $d_p$ distance and give a theorem which allows one to estimate the modified $d_p$ distance, which we expect to be useful in practice.</description>

      <title>Glued lattices are better quantizers than $K_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 40 years ago, Conway and Sloane proposed using the highly symmetrical Coxeter-Todd lattice $K_{12}$ for quantization, and estimated its second moment. Since then, all published lists identify $K_{12}$ as the best 12-dimensional lattice quantizer. Surprisingly, $K_{12}$ is not optimal: we construct two new 12-dimensional lattices with lower normalized second moments. The new lattices are obtained by gluing together 6-dimensional lattices.</description>

      <title>Optimization and Identification of Lattice Quantizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattices with minimal normalized second moments are designed using a new numerical optimization algorithm. Starting from a random lower-triangular generator matrix and applying stochastic gradient descent, all elements are updated towards the negative gradient, which makes it the most efficient algorithm proposed so far for this purpose. A graphical illustration of the theta series, called theta image, is introduced and shown to be a powerful tool for converting numerical lattice representations into their underlying exact forms. As a proof of concept, optimized lattices are designed in dimensions up to 16. In all dimensions, the algorithm converges to either the previously best known lattice or a better one. The dual of the 15-dimensional laminated lattice is conjectured to be optimal in its dimension and its exact normalized second moment is computed.</description>
