      <title>Dark Matter Halo Parameters from Overheated Exoplanets via Bayesian Hierarchical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark Matter (DM) can become captured, deposit annihilation energy, and hence increase the heat flow in exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Detecting such a DM-induced heating in a population of exoplanets in the inner kpc of the Milky Way thus provides potential sensitivity to the galactic DM halo parameters. We develop a Bayesian Hierarchical Model to investigate the feasibility of DM discovery with exoplanets and examine future prospects to recover the spatial distribution of DM in the Milky Way. We reconstruct from mock exoplanet datasets observable parameters such as exoplanet age, temperature, mass, and location, together with DM halo parameters, for representative choices of measurement uncertainty and the number of exoplanets detected. We find that detection of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ exoplanets in the inner Galaxy can yield quantitative information on the galactic DM density profile, under the assumption of 10% measurement uncertainty. Even as few as $\mathcal{O}(10)$ exoplanets can deliver meaningful sensitivities if the DM density and inner slope are sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Solar multi-object multi-frame blind deconvolution with a spatially variant convolution neural emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of astronomical phenomena through ground-based observations is always challenged by the distorting effects of Earth's atmosphere. Traditional methods of post-facto image correction, essential for correcting these distortions, often rely on simplifying assumptions that limit their effectiveness, particularly in the presence of spatially variant atmospheric turbulence. Such cases are often solved by partitioning the field-of-view into small patches, deconvolving each patch independently, and merging all patches together. This approach is often inefficient and can produce artifacts. Recent advancements in computational techniques and the advent of deep learning offer new pathways to address these limitations. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging a deep neural network to emulate spatially variant convolutions, offering a breakthrough in the efficiency and accuracy of astronomical image deconvolution. By training on a dataset of images convolved with spatially invariant point spread functions and validating its generalizability to spatially variant conditions, this approach presents a significant advancement over traditional methods. The convolution emulator is used as a forward model in a multi-object multi-frame blind deconvolution algorithm for solar images. The emulator enables the deconvolution of solar observations across large fields of view without resorting to patch-wise mosaicking, thus avoiding artifacts associated with such techniques. This method represents a significant computational advantage, reducing processing times by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Neutron and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-ray Discrimination by a Pressurized Helium-4 Based Scintillation Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pressurized helium-4 based fast neutron scintillation detector offers an useful alternative to organic liquid-based scintillator due to its relatively low response to the $\gamma$-rays compared to the latter type of scintillator. In the present work, we have investigated the capabilities of a pressurized $^4$He (PHe) detector for the detection of fast neutrons in a mixed radiation field where both the neutrons and the $\gamma$-rays are present. Discrimination between neutrons and $\gamma$-rays is achieved by using fast-slow charge integration method. We have also conducted systematic studies of the attenuation of fast neutrons and $\gamma$-rays by high-density polyethylene (HDPE). These studies are further corroborated by simulation analyses conducted using GEANT4, which show qualitative agreement with the experimental results. Additionally, the simulation provides detailed insights into the interactions of the radiation quanta with the PHe detector. Estimates of the scintillation signal yield are made based on our GEANT4 simulation results by considering the scintillation mechanism in the PHe gas.</description>

      <title>Challenging theories of dark energy with levitated force sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark energy is one of the most outstanding problems in physical science, and various theories have been proposed. It is therefore essential to directly verify or rule out these theories experimentally. However, despite substantial efforts in astrophysical observations and laboratory experiments, previous tests have not yet acquired enough accuracy to provide decisive conclusions as to the validity of these theories. Here, using a diamagnetically levitated force sensor, we carry out a test on one of the most compelling explanations for dark energy to date, namely the Chameleon theory, an ultra-light scalar field with screening mechanisms, which couples to normal-matter fields and leaves a detectable fifth force. Our results extend previous results by nearly two orders of magnitude to the entire physical plausible parameter space of cosmologically viable chameleon models. We find no evidence for such a fifth force. Our results decisively rule out the basic chameleon model as a candidate for dark energy. Our work, thus, demonstrates the robustness of laboratory experiments in unveiling the nature of dark energy in the future. The methodology developed here can be further applied to study a broad range of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Performance testing of a novel short axis photomultiplier tube for the HUNT project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) with large-area cathodes are increasingly being used in cosmic-ray experiments to enhance detection efficiency. The optical modules (OMs) of the High-Energy Underwater Neutrino Telescope (HUNT) have employed a brand new N6205 20-inch microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT) developed by the North Night Vision Science &amp; Technology (Nanjing) Research Institute Co. Ltd. (NNVT). In order to make the 20-inch PMT fit into the 23-inch diameter pressure-resistant glass sphere, NNVT improved the internal structure of PMT and shortened the height of PMT by more than 10~cm. The first batch of these PMTs has been delivered for preliminary research work. This paper describes a specific PMT testing platform built for the first batch of 15 MCP-PMTs, and some performance parameters of PMT, such as P/V ratio, TTS and nonliniearity, are measured.The measurement results show that the new PMT still has good performance and can meet the requirements of HUNT project.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Results of the speckle-interferometry observations at the 4.1 m Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope (SOAR) obtained during 2023 are presented: 1913 measurements of 1533 resolved pairs or subsystems (median separation 0.16") and non-resolutions of 552 targets; 42 pairs are resolved here for the first time. This work continues our long-term effort to monitor orbital motion in close binaries and hierarchical systems. A large number (147) of orbits have been determined for the first time or updated using these measurements. Complementarity of this program with the Gaia mission is highlighted.</description>

      <title>The Tracking Tapered Gridded Estimator for the 21-cm power spectrum from MWA drift scan observations I: Validation and preliminary results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drift scan observations provide the broad sky coverage and instrumental stability needed to measure the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) 21-cm signal. In such observations, the telescope's pointing center (PC) moves continuously on the sky. The Tracking Tapered Gridded Estimator (TTGE) combines observations from different PC to estimate $P(k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel})$ the 21-cm power spectrum, centered on a tracking center (TC) which remains fixed on the sky. The tapering further restricts the sky response to a small angular region around TC, thereby mitigating wide-field foregrounds. Here we consider $154.2 \, {\rm MHz}$ ($z = 8.2$) Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) drift scan observations. The periodic pattern of flagged channels, present in MWA data, is known to introduce artefacts which pose a challenge for estimating $P(k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel})$. We demonstrate that the TTGE is able to recover $P(k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel})$ without any artefacts, and estimate $P(k)$ within $5 \%$ accuracy over a large $k$-range. We also present preliminary results for a single PC, combining 9 nights of observation $(17 \, {\rm min}$ total). We find that $P(k_{\perp}, k_{\parallel})$ exhibits streaks at a fixed interval of $k_{\parallel}=0.29 \, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, which matches $\Delta \nu_{\rm per}=1.28 \, {\rm MHz}$ that is the period of the flagged channels. The streaks are not as pronounced at larger $k_{\parallel}$, and in some cases they do not appear to extend across the entire $k_{\perp}$ range. The rectangular region $0.05 \leq k_{\perp} \leq 0.16 \, {\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ and $0.9 \leq k_{\parallel} \leq 4.6 \, {\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ is found to be relatively free of foreground contamination and artefacts, and we have used this to place the $2\sigma$ upper limit $\Delta^2(k) &lt; (1.85 \times 10^4)^2\, {\rm mK^2}$ on the EoR 21-cm mean squared brightness temperature fluctuations at $k=1 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Warm Dark Matter: from Cosmological Asymmetry to Chirality of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel scenario involving asymmetric keV-range dark matter (DM) in the form of right-handed (sterile) neutrinos. Based on the Fermi-Dirac distribution, we demonstrate that asymmetric fermionic DM forms a Fermi degenerate gas, making it potentially colder than symmetric fermionic DM. This setup simultaneously accounts for the Universe's baryon asymmetry through tiny Yukawa interactions with Standard Model leptons and the Higgs field, and the homochirality of amino acids via decay into circularly polarized photons. This scenario can be investigated through soft X-ray searches conducted by current and upcoming space missions. The helical X-rays is a smoking-gun signal of our scenario. Additionally, we propose a new mechanism to suppress DM thermal production by introducing a light modulus, which may also benefit cosmology involving generic right-handed neutrinos with large mixing.</description>

      <title>Automation of MKID Simulations for Array Building with AEM (Automated Electromagnetic MKID Simulations)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) are photon detectors comprised of superconducting LC resonators with unique resonant frequencies corresponding to their geometrical structure. As each pixel has its own geometry, electromagnetic simulations by hand of every pixel in a kilo-pixel array are impractical. Simulating fewer pixels and interpolating in between risks reduced pixel yield in arrays due to overlapping resonant frequencies. We introduce a new software called AEM (Automated Electromagnetic MKID simulations) that automates the constructions and simulations of every simulated MKID pixel in an array according to specified resonant frequencies and a Qc range. We show automated designs to have an increased pixel yield (avoiding loses due to interpolation completely), increased accuracy in resonance frequency and Qc values when compared to interpolated structures. We also demonstrate a simulated trial of AEM for 100 MKIDs between 4 &amp; 8 GHz to produce MKIDs with accuracies of +-0.2 MHz with a runtime of 10 hrs 45 mins.</description>

Abstract: The ComPair gamma-ray telescope is a technology demonstrator for a future gamma-ray telescope called the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO). The instrument is composed of four subsystems, a double-sided silicon strip detector, a virtual Frisch grid CdZnTe calorimeter, a CsI:Tl based calorimeter, and an anti-coincidence detector (ACD). The CsI calorimeter's goal is to measure the position and energy deposited from high-energy events. To demonstrate the technological readiness, the calorimeter has flown onboard a NASA scientific balloon as part of the GRAPE-ComPair mission and accumulated around 3 hours of float time at an altitude of 40 km. During the flight, the CsI calorimeter observed background radiation, Regener-Pfotzer Maximum, and several gamma-ray activation lines originating from aluminum.</description>

      <title>Topology of Pulsar Profiles (ToPP). I. Graph theory method and classification of the EPN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some of the most important information on a radio pulsar is derived from its average pulse profile. Many early pulsar studies were necessarily based on only few such profiles. There, discrete profile components were linked to emission mechanism models for individual stars through human interpretation. For the population as a whole, profiles morphology must reflect the geometry and overall evolution of the radio emitting regions. The problem, however, is that this population is becoming too large for intensive studies of all sources individually. Moreover, connecting profiles from a large collection of pulsars rapidly becomes cumbersome. In this article, we present ToPP, the first-ever unsupervised method to sort pulsars by profile-shape similarity, using graph topology. We apply ToPP to the publicly available European Pulsar Network profile database, providing the first organised visual overview of multi-frequency profiles representing 90 individual pulsars. We find discrete evolutionary tracks, varying from simple, single component profiles at all frequencies, towards diverse mixtures of more complex profiles with frequency evolution. The profile evolution is continuous, extending out to millisecond pulsars, and does not fall in sharp classes. We interpret the profiles as a mixture of pulsar core/cone emission type, spin-down energetics, and the line-of-sight impact angle towards the magnetic axis. We show how ToPP can systematically classify sources into the Rankin empirical profile scheme. ToPP forms one of the key unsupervised methods that will be essential to explore upcoming pulsar census data such as expected by the Square Kilometer Array.</description>

      <title>RIGEL: Simulating dwarf galaxies at solar mass resolution with radiative transfer and feedback from individual massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the RIGEL model, a novel framework to self-consistently model the effects of stellar feedback in the multiphase ISM of dwarf galaxies with radiative transfer (RT) on a star-by-star basis. The RIGEL model integrates detailed implementations of feedback from individual massive stars into the RHD code, AREPO-RT. It forms individual massive stars from the resolved multiphase ISM by sampling the IMF and tracks their evolution individually. The lifetimes, photon production rates, mass-loss rates, and wind velocities of these stars are determined by their initial masses and metallicities based on a library that incorporates a variety of stellar models. The RT equations are solved in seven spectral bins accounting for the IR to HeII ionizing bands, using an M1 RT scheme. The thermochemistry model tracks the non-equilibrium H, He chemistry and the equilibrium abundance of CI, CII, OI, OII, and CO to capture the thermodynamics of all ISM phases. We evaluate the performance of the RIGEL model using $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ resolution simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies. We found that the SFR and ISRF show strong positive correlations to the metallicity of the galaxy. Photoionization and photoheating can reduce the SFR by an order of magnitude by removing the available cold-dense gas fuel for star formation. The ISRF also changes the thermal structure of the ISM. Radiative feedback occurs immediately after the birth of massive stars and rapidly disperses the molecular clouds within 1 Myr. As a consequence, radiative feedback reduces the age spread of star clusters to less than 2 Myr, prohibits the formation of massive star clusters, and shapes the cluster initial mass function to a steep power-law form with a slope of $\sim-2$. The mass-loading factor of the fiducial galaxy has a median of $\sim50$, while turning off radiative feedback reduces this factor by an order of magnitude.</description>
