      <title>Efficient Tensor Decomposition via Moment Matrix Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by a flurry of recent work on efficient tensor decomposition algorithms, we show that the celebrated moment matrix extension algorithm of Brachat, Comon, Mourrain, and Tsigaridas for symmetric tensor canonical polyadic (CP) decomposition can be made efficient under the right conditions. We first show that the crucial property determining the complexity of the algorithm is the regularity of a target decomposition. This allows us to reduce the complexity of the vanilla algorithm, while also unifying results from previous works. We then show that for tensors in $S^d\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ with $d$ even, low enough regularity can reduce finding a symmetric tensor decomposition to solving a system of linear equations. For order-$4$ tensors we prove that generic tensors of rank up to $r=2n+1$ can be decomposed efficiently via moment matrix extension, exceeding the rank threshold allowed by simultaneous diagonalization. We then formulate a conjecture that states for generic order-$4$ tensors of rank $r=O(n^2)$ the induced linear system is sufficient for efficient tensor decomposition, matching the asymptotics of existing algorithms and in fact improving the leading coefficient. Towards this conjecture we give computer assisted proofs that the statement holds for $n=2, \dots, 17$. Next we demonstrate that classes of nonidentifiable tensors can be decomposed efficiently via the moment matrix extension algorithm, bypassing the usual need for uniqueness of decomposition. Of particular interest is the class of monomials, for which the extension algorithm is not only efficient but also improves on existing theory by explicitly parameterizing the space of decompositions. Code for implementations of the efficient algorithm for generic tensors and monomials are provided, along with several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Moduli of Multi-Uniformized Stacks and Seifert $\mathbb{G}_m^d$-Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce multi-uniformized stacks as a generalization of the Abramovich--Hassett construction of uniformized twisted varieties. We prove an equivalence between the category of multi $\mathbb{Q}$-line bundles satisfying an analogue of Koll\'{a}r's condition and the category of multi-uniformized twisted varieties, and we construct the corresponding moduli space. We then broaden the framework to encompass Koll\'{a}r's Seifert $\mathbb{G}_m^d$-bundles, showing that their moduli likewise coincide with those of $d$-uniformized $d$-cyclotomic orbispaces.</description>

      <title>Representation stability for moduli spaces of admissible covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a representation stability result for the sequence of spaces $\overline M_{g, n}^A$ of pointed admissible $A$-covers of stable $n$-pointed genus-$g$ curves, for an abelian group $A$. For fixed genus $g$ and homology degree $i$, we give the sequence of rational homology groups $H_i(\overline{M}_{g, n}^A;\mathbb Q)$ the structure of a module over a combinatorial category, a la Sam--Snowden, and prove that this module is generated in degree at most $g + 5 i$. This implies that the generating function for the ranks of the homology groups is rational, with poles in the set $\left\{-1, -\frac{1}{2}, \ldots, -\frac{1}{|A|^2\cdot(g + 5i)}\right\}$. In the case where $A$ is the trivial group, our work significantly improves on previous representation stability results on the Deligne--Mumford compactification $\overline M_{g, n}$.</description>

      <title>On large configurations of lines on quartic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the number of lines on a non-K3 quartic surface. Such a surface with only isolated double point(s) contains at most twenty lines; this bound is attained by a unique configuration of lines and by a surface with a certain limited set of singularities. We have similar itemized bounds for other types of non-simple singularities, which culminate in at most 31 lines on a non-K3 quartic not ruled by lines; this bound is only attained on the quartic monoids described by K.~Rohn.</description>

      <title>Tolerants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the discriminant of a polynomial, which we call the tolerant. The tolerant differs by a square from the duplicant, which was discovered in recent work on $\mathbb{P}^1$-loop spaces in motivic homotopy theory. We show that the tolerant is rational by deriving a formula in terms of discriminants. We also show that the tolerant satisfies many of the same properties as the discriminant. A notable difference between the two is that the discriminant is inversion invariant for all polynomials, whereas the tolerant is only inversion invariant on a proper multiplicative subset of polynomials.</description>

      <title>On jet schemes of determinantal varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determinantal varieties are important objects of study in algebraic geometry. In this paper, we will investigate them using the jet scheme approach. We have found a new connection for the Hilbert series between a determinantal variety and its jet schemes. We denote the $k$-th order jet scheme of the determinantal variety defined by $r$-minors in an $m \times n$ matrix as $\mathscr{L}^{m,n}_{r,k}$. For the special case where $m$, $n$, and $r$ are equal, and $m$ and $r$ are 3 while $k$ is 1, we establish a correspondence between the defining ideals of $\mathscr{L}^{m,n}_{r,k}$ and abstract simplicial complexes, proving their shellability and obtaining the Hilbert series of $\mathscr{L}^{m,n}_{r,k}$ accordingly. Moreover, for general $\mathscr{L}^{m,n}_{r,k}$, \cite{12} provides its irreducible decomposition. We further provide a specific polynomial family defining its irreducible components.
  Keywords. Determinantal varieties, jet schemes, shellability, Hilbert series.</description>

      <title>Abelianized Descent Obstruction for 0-Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical descent theory of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Sansuc for rational points tells that, over a smooth variety $X$, the algebraic Brauer-Manin subset equals the descent obstruction subset defined by a universal torsor. Moreover, Harari shows that the Brauer-Manin subset equals the descent obstruction subset defined by torsors under connected linear groups. By using the abelian cohomology theory by Borovoi, we define abelianized descent obstructions by torsors under connected linear groups. As an analogy, we show the equality between the Brauer-Manin obstruction and the abelianized descent obstruction for 0-cycles. We also show that the abelianized descent obstruction is the closure of the descent obstruction defined by Balestrieri and Berg when $X$ is projective and $\mathrm{Br}(X)/\mathrm{Br}_0(X)$ is finite.</description>

      <title>Compact K\"ahler manifolds with nef anti-canonical bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that a compact K\"ahler manifold $X$ with the nef anti-canonical bundle $-K_{X}$ admits a locally trivial fibration $\phi \colon X \to Y$, where the fiber $F$ is a rationally connected manifold and the base $Y$ is a Calabi--Yau manifold. We introduce a suitable approach that extends the strategy of Cao--H\"oring, originally developed for smooth projective varieties, to more general singular K\"ahler spaces. A key technical ingredient is a flatness criterion for pseudo-effective sheaves with vanishing first Chern class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the space of shifted Poisson structures on a derived scheme $X$ locally of finite presentation is equivalent to the space of shifted Lagrangian thickenings out $X$, solving a conjecture in shifted Poisson geometry. As a corollary, we show that for $M$ a compact oriented $d$-dimensional manifold and an $n$-shifted Poisson structure on $X$, the mapping stack $\mathrm{Map}(M,X)$ has an $(n-d)$-shifted Poisson structure. It extends a known theorem for shifted symplectic structures to shifted Poisson structures.</description>

      <title>Spaces of polygonal triangulations and Monsky polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a combinatorial triangulation of an $n$-gon, we study (a) the space of all possible drawings in the plane such the edges are straight line segments and the boundary has a fixed shape, and (b) the algebraic variety of possibilities for the areas of the triangles in such drawings. We define a generalized notion of triangulation, and we show that the areas of the triangles in a generalized triangulation $\T$ of a square must satisfy a single irreducible homogeneous polynomial relation $p(\T)$ depending only on the combinatorics of $\T$. The invariant $p(\T)$ is called the \emph{Monsky polynomial}; it captures algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial information about $\T$. We give an algorithm that computes a lower bound on the degree of $p(\T)$, and we present several examples in which the algorithm is used to compute the degree.</description>

      <title>Generating systems, generalized Thomsen collections and derived categories of toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bondal claims that for a smooth toric variety $X$, its bounded derived category of coherent sheaves $D_{c}^{b}(X)$ is generated by the Thomsen collection $T(X)$ of line bundles obtained as direct summands of the pushforward of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ along a Frobenius map with sufficiently divisible degree. The claim is confirmed recently. In this article, we consider a generalized Thomsen collection of line bundles $T(X,D)$ with a $\mathbb{Q}$-divisor $D$ as an auxiliary input, and we prove $T(X,D)$ still generates $D_{c}^{b}(X)$. For $D=0$ we recover Bondal's oringinal claim. We give a stacky interpretation of this generalization and then we stick to a proof without using stacks and of different nature from existing works. To do this we introduce the notion of generating systems, and prove a theorem on the generation of $\mathcal{O}_{X}$ in terms of many line bundles arising from a given generating system, with an insight to the combinatorics of some cone decomposition or even real hyperplane arrangement attached to the generating system.</description>

      <title>Liftings of ideals in positive characteristic to those in characteristic zero: Higher dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a pair consisting of a smooth variety of arbitrary dimension over a field of positive characteristic and a multi-ideal with a real exponent. We prove that the set of log discrepancies for a fixed exponent is discrete. Additionally, we show that the set of log canonical thresholds (lcts) of multi-ideals on a smooth variety in positive characteristic is contained within the set of lcts of multi-ideals on a smooth variety over the complex number field. As a result, we find that the accumulation points of log canonical thresholds are rational if all the exponents are rational. We also obtain ACC for the set of lcts of multi-ideals on a smooth varieties in positive characteristic. These findings generalize the author's results presented in arXiv in 2024 to the higher-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Quadratic forms and their duals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many specific results, spread over the literature, regarding the dualisation of quadrics in projective spaces and quadratic forms on vector spaces. In the present work we aim at generalising and unifying some of these. We start with a quadratic form $Q$ that is defined on a subspace $S$ of a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ over a field $F$. Whenever $Q$ satisfies a certain condition, which comes into effect only when $F$ is of characteristic two, $Q$ gives rise to a dual quadratic form $\hat{Q}$. The domain of the latter is a particular subspace $\hat{S}$ of the dual vector space of $V$. The connection between $Q$ and $\hat{Q}$ is given by a binary relation between vectors of $S$ and linear forms belonging to $\hat{S}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article takes the formula for the integrable system defined by Beauville et al on the cotangent bundle of the intersection of two quadrics X, and interprets it in terms of rank 2 quasi parabolic Higgs bundles on the projective line. We then discuss aspects related to the geometric Langlands programme in this simple concrete context. We conclude with a description of the link with the recent paper of Benedetti et al identifying X and its integrable system in terms of invariant Spin(2g) bundles on a hyperelliptic curve of genus g.</description>

      <title>MMP for generalized foliated threefolds of rank one</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the minimal model program (MMP) for generalized foliated threefolds $(X, \mathcal{F}, B, \mathbf{M})$ of rank 1, extending the result of Cascini and Spicer in [CS20]. As an application of the generalized foliated MMP, we prove a base-point-free theorem for foliated triples on threefolds. We also prove the ACC for log canonical thresholds for generalized foliated threefolds of rank 1.</description>

      <title>The Kodaira classification of the moduli space of pointed curves in genus $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We complete the Kodaira classification of the moduli spaces $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ of curves with marked points in genus $g=3$, by proving that $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{3,n}$ is of general type for $n \geq 15$. We prove that the singularities of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{3,n}$ impose no adjunction conditions for $n \geq 1$ and that the canonical class of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{3,n}$ is big for $n \geq 15$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial stability conditions for vector bundles: Positivity, equivariance and blow-ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of P-critical connections for hermitian holomorphic vector bundles over compact balanced manifolds: integrable hermitian connections whose curvature solves a polynomial equation. Such connections include HYM and dHYM connections, as well as solutions to higher rank Monge-Amp\`ere or J-equations, and are a slight generalisation of Dervan-McCarthy-Sektnan's Z-critical connections motivated by Bayer's polynomial Bridgeland stability conditions. The associated equations come with a moment map interpretation, and we provide numerical conditions that are expected to characterise existence of solutions in suitable cases: P-positivity and P-stability. We then provide some devices to check those numerical conditions in practice. First, we observe that P-positivity is equivalent to its equivariant version over T-varieties. In the toric case, we thus obtain an explicit finite set of subvarieties to test P-positivity on, independently on the choice of the polynomial equation. We also introduce equivariant P-stability and discuss its relation to P-stability. Secondly, we show that a uniform version of P-positivity is preserved by pulling back along a blow-up of points. We apply those results to some examples, such as blow-ups of Hirzebruch surfaces, or a Fano 3-fold.</description>

      <title>Bourbaki modules and the module of Jacobian derivations of projective hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two properties of projective hypersurfaces related to the module of Jacobian derivations, namely being tame and being plus-one generated, are discussed in this paper. Tame hypersurfaces are related to Bourbaki ideals, and free hypersurfaces are the simplest examples of tame hypersurfaces. Plus-one generated hypersurfaces are the non free hypersurfaces which are closest to the free ones, and it is an open question whether all of them are tame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.24091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a complete discretely valued field with perfect residue field $k$. If $X \to \mathbb{P}^1_K$ is a $\mathbb{Z}/d$-cover with $\text{char } k \nmid d$, we compute the minimal regular normal crossings model $\mathcal{X}$ of $X$ as the normalization of an explicit normal model $\mathcal{Y}$ of $\mathbb{P}^1_K$ in $K(X)$. The model $\mathcal{Y}$ is given using Mac Lane's description of discrete valuations on the rational function field $K(\mathbb{P}^1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the category of (strictly unital) A$_\infty$-categories, linear over a commutative ring $R$, with strict A$_\infty$-morphisms has a cofibrantly generated model structure. In this model structure every object is fibrant and the cofibrant objects have cofibrant morphisms. As a consequence we prove that the semi-free A$_\infty$-categories (resp. resolutions) are cofibrant objects (resp. resolution) in this model structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A colored Gaussian graphical model is a linear concentration model in which equalities among the concentrations are specified by a coloring of an underlying graph. Marigliano and Davies conjectured that every linear binomial that appears in the vanishing ideal of an undirected colored cycle corresponds to a graph symmetry. We prove this conjecture for 3,5, and 7 cycles and disprove it for colored cycles of any other length. We construct the counterexamples by proving the fact that the determinant of the concentration matrices of two colored paths can be equal even when they are not identical or reflection of each other. We also explore the potential strengthening of the conjecture and prove a revised version of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>A 2-adic automorphy lifting theorem for symplectic groups over totally real fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a new automorphy lifting theorem for certain 2-adic Galois representations $\rho:G_F\longrightarrow {\rm GSp}_{2n}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}_2)$ where $F$ an arbitrary totally real field. This extends the minimal case previously established by Thorne to the non-minimal case. A key ingredient is a detailed analysis for the residual monodromy representations associated to the Dwork family in characteristic two. As an application, combining with the author's previous work with Tsuzuki, we prove the automorphy of certain rank 4 symplectic motives over $F$ coming from the Dwork quintic family under suitable conditions.</description>

Abstract: I consider the problem of existence of intrinsic determinantal equations for plane projective curves and hypersurfaces in projective space and prove that in many cases of interest there exist intrinsic determinantal equations. In particular I prove (1) in characteristic two any ordinary, plane projective curve of genus at least one is given by an intrinsic determinantal equation (2) in characteristic three any plane projective curve is an intrinsic Pfaffian (3) in any positive characteristic any plane projective curve is set theoretically the determinant of an intrinsic matrix (4) in any positive characteristic, any Frobenius split hypersurface in ${\bf P}^n$ is given by set theoretically as the determinant of an intrinsic matrix with homogeneous entries of degree between $1$ and $n-1$. In particular this implies that any smooth, Fano hypersurface is set theoretically given by an intrinsic determinantal equation and the same is also true for any Frobenius split Calabi-Yau hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Derived isogenies and isogenies for abelian surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.08710v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the twisted Fourier-Mukai partners of abelian surfaces. Following the work of Huybrechts [doi:10.4171/CMH/465], we introduce the twisted derived equivalence between abelian surfaces. We show that there is a twisted derived Torelli theorem for abelian surfaces over algebraically closed fields with characteristic $\neq 2,3$. Over complex numbers, the derived isogenies correspond to rational Hodge isometries between the second cohomology groups, which is in analogy to the work of Huybrechts and Fu-Vial on K3 surfaces. Their proof relies on the global Torelli theorem over $\mathbb{C}$, which is missing in positive characteristics. To overcome this issue, we firstly extend a trick given by Shioda on integral Hodge structures, to rational Hodge structures, $\ell$-adic Tate modules and $F$-crystals. Then we make use of Tate's isogeny theorem to give a characterization of the twisted derived equivalences between abelian surfaces via isogenies. As a consequence, we show the two abelian surfaces are principally isogenous if and only if they are derived isogenous.</description>

Abstract: The motivation for this paper is to detect when an irreducible projective variety V is not toric. We do this by analyzing a Lie group and a Lie algebra associated to V. If the dimension of V is strictly less than the dimension of the above mentioned objects, then V is not a toric variety. We provide an algorithm to compute the Lie algebra of an irreducible variety and use it to provide examples of non-toric statistical models in algebraic statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime, $W$ the ring of Witt vectors of a perfect field $k$ of characteristic $p$ and $\zeta$ a primitive $p$th root of unity. We introduce a new notion of calculus over $W$ that we call absolute calculus. It may be seen as a singular version of the $q$-calculus used in previous work, in the sense that the role of the coordinate is now played by $q$ itself. We show that what we call a weakly nilpotent $\mathbb\Delta$-connection on a finite free module is equivalent to a prismatic vector bundle on $W[\zeta]$. As a corollary of a theorem of Bhatt and Scholze, we finally obtain that a $\mathbb\Delta$-connection with a frobenius structure on a finite free module is equivalent to a lattice in a crystalline representation. We also consider the case of de Rham prismatic crystals as well as Hodge-Tate prismatic crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17341v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct polarized Calabi--Yau 3-folds with at worst isolated canonical orbifold points in codimension 4 that can be described in terms of the equations of the Segre embedding of $\mathbb P^2 \times \mathbb P^2$ in $\mathbb P^8$. We investigate the existence of other deformation families in their Hilbert scheme by either studying Tom and Jerry degenerations or by comparing their Hilbert series with those of existing low codimension Calabi--Yau 3-folds. Among other interesting results, we find a family of Calabi--Yau 3-fold with five distinct Tom and Jerry deformation families, a phenomenon not seen for $\mathbb Q$-Fano 3-folds. We compute the Hodge numbers of $\mathbb P^2 \times \mathbb P^2 $ Calabi--Yau 3-folds and corresponding manifolds obtained by performing crepant resolutions. We obtain a manifold with a pair of Hodge numbers that does not appear in the famously known list of 30108 distinct Hodge pairs of Kruzer--Skarke, in the list of 7890 distinct Hodge pairs corresponding to complete intersections in the product of projective spaces and in Hodge paris obtained from Calabi--Yau 3-folds having low codimension embeddings in weighted projective spaces.</description>

Abstract: We give a proof of Mukai's Theorem on the existence of certain exceptional vector bundles on prime Fano threefolds. To our knowledge this is the first complete proof in the literature. The result is essential for Mukai's biregular classification of prime Fano threefolds, and for the existence of semiorthogonal decompositions in their derived categories.
  Our approach is based on Lazarsfeld's construction that produces vector bundles on a variety from globally generated line bundles on a divisor, on Mukai's theory of stable vector bundles on K3 surfaces, and on Brill--Noether properties of curves and (in the sense of Mukai) of K3 surfaces.</description>

We show that while not all the usual definitions of vector bundle agree over semirings, all the usual definitions of line bundle do agree. We also show that the narrow class group of a number field can be recovered as a reflexive Picard group of its subsemiring of totally nonnegative algebraic integers.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Severi varieties parametrizing integral curves of geometric genus one on polarized toric surfaces in characteristic zero and describe their irreducible components. We show that the irreducible components are in natural bijection with certain affine sublattices of the lattice of characters of the toric surface. The sublattices are described explicitly in terms of the polygon defining the polarization of the toric surface.</description>

Abstract: A toric amplitude is a rational function associated to a simplicial polyhedral fan. The definition is inspired by scattering amplitudes in particle physics. We prove algebraic properties of such amplitudes and study the geometry of their zero loci. These hypersurfaces play the role of Warren's adjoint via a dual volume interpretation. We investigate their Fano schemes and singular loci via the nef cone and toric irrelevant ideal of the fan.</description>

Abstract: M. Kontsevich conjectured and T. Bitoun proved that if M is a nonzero holonomic D-module then the p-support of a generic reduction of M to characteristic p&gt;0 is Lagrangian. We provide a new elementary proof of this theorem and also generalize it to q-D-modules. The proofs are based on Bernstein's theorem that any holonomic D-module can be transformed by an element of the symplectic group into a vector bundle with a flat connection, and a q-analog of this theorem. We also discuss potential applications to quantizations of symplectic singularities and to quantum cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>The Spectrum of Stable Infinity Categories with Actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 2000s, Balmer constructed a ringed space from a triangulated category with a tensor structure. It provides a beautiful classification of tensor ideals. However, some categories, such as the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves or the triangulated category of singularities of a scheme, do not have canonical tensor structures. We constructed a ringed space from a stable infinity category with action as an analog. The aforementioned examples have canonical action of the category of perfect complexes, and their associated spaces contain information about the singularities of the scheme.
  Recently, Matsui introduced a ringed space from a triangulated category. However, it can be huge and hard to calculate. Our approach describes subspaces of the Matsui spectrum, which is more manageable due to their fiber decomposition.</description>

      <title>Proper Fourier-Mukai partners of abelian varieties and points outside the Fourier-Mukai loci in Matsui spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any proper Fourier-Mukai partner of an abelian variety is again an abelian variety, by analyzing the Matsui spectrum of the derived category. This result was previously obtained by Huybrechts and Nieper-Wisskirchen in the case of smooth projective varieties. Our proof, however, extends the result to proper schemes using entirely different techniques. More generally, we show that any scheme of finite type that is derived equivalent to an open subscheme of an abelian variety is itself an open subscheme of an abelian variety.
  We also study the structure of the Matsui spectrum outside the Fourier-Mukai locus. For certain proper schemes, we show that the set of points lying outside the Fourier-Mukai locus in the Matsui spectrum has cardinality at least equal to that of the base field. This suggests the existence of additional geometric structures, such as moduli spaces, beyond the derived-equivalent part. As an application, we provide new counterexamples to conjectures of Ito, which predicted that the Serre invariant locus coincides with the Fourier-Mukai locus. While counterexamples involving K3 surfaces of Picard number one were previously given by Hirano-Ouchi, our examples arising from simple abelian varieties of dimension greater than two are the first of their kind.</description>

Abstract: Linear Geometry studies geometric properties which can be expressed via the notion of a line. All information about lines is encoded in a ternary relation called a line relation. A set endowed with a line relation is called a liner. So, Linear Geometry studies liners. Imposing some additional axioms on a liner, we obtain some special classes of liners: regular, projective, affine, proaffine, etc. Linear Geometry includes Affine and Projective Geometries and is a part of Incidence Geometry. The aim of this book is to present a self-contained logical development of Linear Geometry, starting with some intuitive acceptable geometric axioms and ending with algebraic structures that necessarily arise from studying the structure of geometric objects that satisfy those simple and intuitive geometric axioms. We shall meet many quite exotic algebraic structures that arise this way: magmas, loops, ternars, quasi-fields, alternative rings, procorps, profields, etc. We strongly prefer (synthetic) geometric proofs and use tools of analytic geometry only when no purely geometric proof is available. Liner Geometry has been developed by many great mathematicians since times of Antiquity (Thales, Euclides, Proclus, Pappus), through Renaissance (Descartes, Desargues), Early Modernity (Playfair, Gauss, Lobachevski, Bolyai, Poncelet, Steiner, M\"obius), Late Modernity Times (Steinitz, Klein, Hilbert, Moufang, Hessenberg, Jordan, Beltrami, Fano, Gallucci, Veblen, Wedderburn, Lenz, Barlotti) till our contempories (Hartshorne, Hall, Buekenhout, Gleason, Kantor, Doyen, Hubault, Dembowski, Klingenberg, Grundh\"ofer).</description>

Abstract: We revisit the recent theory of Sun-Zhang on general Fano fibration (germs) which emerged from the study of non-compact Kahler-Ricci soliton metrics, primarily from an algebro-geometric perspective. In addition to reviewing the existing framework, we present new results, conjectures, and remarks. These include methods for computing weighted volumes via (restricted) volumes, Laplace transforms, and incomplete Gamma-functions, and a conjectural algebro-geometric construction (``bubbling") of Fano fibration with asymptotically conical base from degenerating Fano fibration.</description>

Abstract: We introduce higher analytic geometry, a novel framework extending Lurie's derived complex analytic spaces. This theory generalizes classical complex analytic geometry, enabling the study of derived K\"ahler spaces with non-trivial higher homotopy groups. We develop derived de Rham and Dolbeault cohomologies, yielding a Hodge decomposition for compact derived K\"ahler spaces, and establish a derived Stokes' theorem, unifying classical results with homotopical structures.</description>

Abstract: We recast the Galois cohomology of the variety $V$ over a number field $k$ in terms of the K-theory of a $C^*$-algebra $\mathscr{A}_V$ connected to $V$. It is proved that $V$ is isomorphic to $V'$ over $k$ (algebraic closure of $k$, resp.) if and only if $\mathscr{A}_V$ is isomorphic (Morita equivalent, resp.) to $\mathscr{A}_{V'}$. In particular, the Morita equivalent $C^*$-algebras $\mathscr{A}_V$ parametrize twists of the variety $V$. The case of rational elliptic curves is considered in detail.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ellipsoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of symmetric convex bodies called generalized ellipsoids of degree $d$ (GE-$d$s), with ellipsoids corresponding to the case of $d=0$. Generalized ellipsoids (GEs) retain many geometric, algebraic, and algorithmic properties of ellipsoids. We show that the conditions that the parameters of a GE must satisfy can be checked in strongly polynomial time, and that one can search for GEs of a given degree by solving a semidefinite program whose size grows only linearly with dimension. We give an example of a GE which does not have a second-order cone representation, but show that every GE has a semidefinite representation whose size depends linearly on both its dimension and degree. In terms of expressiveness, we prove that for any integer $m\geq 2$, every symmetric full-dimensional polytope with $2m$ facets and every intersection of $m$ co-centered ellipsoids can be represented exactly as a GE-$d$ with $d \leq 2m-3$. Using this result, we show that every symmetric convex body can be approximated arbitrarily well by a GE-$d$ and we quantify the quality of the approximation as a function of the degree $d$. Finally, we present applications of GEs to several areas, such as time-varying portfolio optimization, stability analysis of switched linear systems, robust-to-dynamics optimization, and robust polynomial regression.</description>

Abstract: The loop-Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(L)}_{n}$ is a semialgebraic set in the product of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}_{\mathbb{R}}(2,4)^L$. Recently, many aspects of this geometry for the case of $L=1$ have been elucidated, such as its algebraic and face stratification, its residual arrangement and the existence and uniqueness of the adjoint. This paper extends this analysis to the simplest higher loop case given by the two-loop four-point Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(2)}_4$.</description>

      <title>Constructing stable Hilbert bundles via Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On any complex smooth projective curve with positive genus, we construct Hilbert bundles that admit Hermitian--Einstein metrics. Our main constructive step is by investigating the arithmetic property of the upper half plane in Bridgeland's definition of stability conditions and its homological countparts.
  The main analytic ingredient in our proof is a notion called a geometrically well-approximable pair $(X,\theta)$. This notion compares a constant $L(X)$ that can be bounded by the geometric information of the Riemann surface $X$ with a constant $L_0(\theta)$ that depends only on the arithmetic information of the irrational number $\theta$. This notion helps us to apply the Diophantine approximation to Donaldson's functional.
  We further study the continuous structures, smooth structures, and holomorphic structures on such Hilbert bundles. We hope that this construction can shed some new light on the geometric background of quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly compute two kinds of algebraic Belyi functions on Bring's curve. One is related to a congruence subgroup of ${\rm SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ and the other is related to a congruence subgroup of the triangle group $\Delta(2,4,5)\subset \SL_2(\R)$. To carry out the computation, we use elliptic cusp forms of weight 2 for the former case and the automorphism group of Bring's curve for the latter case. We also discuss a suitable base field (a number field) for describing isomorphisms between Hulek-Craig's curve, Bring's curve, and another algebraic model obtained as a modular curve.</description>

Abstract: Mock modular forms, first invented by Ramanujan, provide a beautiful generalization of the usual modular forms. In recent years, it was found that they capture generating functions of the number of microstates of BPS black holes appearing in compactifications of string theory with 8 and 16 supercharges. This review describes these results and their applications which range from the actual computation of these generating functions for both compact and non-compact compactification manifolds (encoding, respectively, Donaldson-Thomas and Vafa-Witten topological invariants) to the construction of new non-commutative structures on moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>
