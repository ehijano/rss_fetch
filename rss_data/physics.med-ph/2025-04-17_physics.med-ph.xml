      <title>FACT: Foundation Model for Assessing Cancer Tissue Margins with Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Accurately classifying tissue margins during cancer surgeries is crucial for ensuring complete tumor removal. Rapid Evaporative Ionization Mass Spectrometry (REIMS), a tool for real-time intraoperative margin assessment, generates spectra that require machine learning models to support clinical decision-making. However, the scarcity of labeled data in surgical contexts presents a significant challenge. This study is the first to develop a foundation model tailored specifically for REIMS data, addressing this limitation and advancing real-time surgical margin assessment. Methods: We propose FACT, a Foundation model for Assessing Cancer Tissue margins. FACT is an adaptation of a foundation model originally designed for text-audio association, pretrained using our proposed supervised contrastive approach based on triplet loss. An ablation study is performed to compare our proposed model against other models and pretraining methods. Results: Our proposed model significantly improves the classification performance, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an AUROC of $82.4\% \pm 0.8$. The results demonstrate the advantage of our proposed pretraining method and selected backbone over the self-supervised and semi-supervised baselines and alternative models. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that foundation models, adapted and pretrained using our novel approach, can effectively classify REIMS data even with limited labeled examples. This highlights the viability of foundation models for enhancing real-time surgical margin assessment, particularly in data-scarce clinical environments.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Evaluation of CT Global Noise Calculation Methods for Clinical Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CMS quality measure for CT mandates compliance with dose and image quality across 18 exam categories, yet the method for calculating global noise (GN) remains undefined, referencing only the Duke and Wisconsin methods. This ambiguity raises concerns about standardization and clinical applicability. We retrospectively analyzed 719 CT exams across seven protocols, comparing five GN metrics derived from the Duke and Wisconsin approaches. Results showed significant variability across metrics and protocols, with Wisconsin_tissue_mean consistently yielding the highest values. Correlation strength varied by protocol, and mode-based metrics demonstrated higher agreement, suggesting dose dependence. In the Chest PE protocol, GN values differed significantly based on reconstruction kernel. These findings underscore the need for a standardized, clinically meaningful GN metric to ensure consistent image quality evaluation and effective implementation of the CMS measure.</description>

      <title>Dual-Energy Cone-Beam CT Using Two Orthogonal Projection Views: A Phantom Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12010v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel imaging and reconstruction framework for dual-energy cone-beam CT (DECBCT) using only two orthogonal X-ray projections at different energy levels (2V-DECBCT). The goal is to enable fast and low-dose DE volumetric imaging with high spectral fidelity and structural accuracy, suitable for DECBCT-guided radiation therapy. We introduce a framework for 2V-DECBCT based on physics-informed dual-domain diffusion models. A cycle-domain training strategy is employed to enforce consistency between projection and volume reconstructions through a differentiable physics-informed module. Furthermore, a spectral-consistency loss is introduced to preserve inter-energy contrast during the generative process. The model is trained and evaluated using 4D XCAT phantom data under realistic anatomical motion. The method produces high-fidelity DECBCT volumes from only two views, accurately preserving anatomical boundaries and suppressing artifacts. Subtraction maps computed from the reconstructed energy volumes show strong visual and numerical agreement with ground truth. This work presents the first diffusion model-based framework for 2V-DECBCT reconstruction, demonstrating accurate structural and spectral recovery from extremely sparse inputs.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Efficient Kidney Stone Fragment Removal via Spinner-Induced Synergistic Circulation and Spiral Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kidney stones can cause severe pain and complications such as chronic kidney disease or kidney failure. Retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS), which uses laser lithotripsy to fragment stones for removal via a ureteroscope, is widely adopted due to its safety and effectiveness. However, conventional fragment removal methods using basketing and vacuum-assisted aspiration are inefficient, as they can capture only 1 to 3 fragments (1--3\,mm in size) per pass, often requiring dozens to hundreds of ureteroscope passes during a single procedure to completely remove the fragments. These limitations lead to prolonged procedures and residual fragments that contribute to high recurrence rates. To address these limitations, we present a novel spinner device that enables ultra-efficient fragment removal through spinning-induced localized suction. The spinner generates a three-dimensional spiral and circulating flow field that dislodges and draws fragments into its cavity even from distances over 20\,mm, eliminating the need to chase fragments. It can capture over 60 fragments (0.5--2\,mm) or over 15 larger fragments (2--3\,mm) in a single pass, significantly improving removal efficiency. In this work, the spinner design is optimized via computational fluid dynamics to maximize suction performance. \textit{In vitro} testing demonstrates near 100\% capture rates for up to 60 fragments in a single operation and superior large-distance capture efficacy compared to vacuum-assisted methods. \textit{Ex vivo} testing of the integrated spinner-ureteroscope system in a porcine kidney confirmed its high performance by capturing 45 fragments in just 4 seconds during a single pass and achieving complete fragment clearance within a few passes.</description>

      <title>Hemodynamic Markers: CFD-Based Prediction of Cerebral Aneurysm Rupture Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of aneurysm evolution on hemodynamic characteristics within the sac region. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), blood flow through the parent vessel and aneurysm sac was analyzed to assess the impact on wall shear stress (WSS), time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), and the oscillatory shear index (OSI), key indicators of rupture risk. Additionally, Relative Residence Time (RRT) and Endothelial Cell Activation Potential (ECAP) were examined to provide a broader understanding of the aneurysm's hemodynamic environment. Six distinct cerebral aneurysm (CA) models, all from individuals of the same gender, were selected to minimize gender-related variability.
  Results showed that unruptured cases exhibited higher WSS and TAWSS, along with lower OSI and RRT values patterns consistent with stable flow conditions supporting vascular integrity. In contrast, ruptured cases had lower WSS and TAWSS, coupled with elevated OSI and RRT, suggesting disturbed and oscillatory flow commonly linked to aneurysm wall weakening. ECAP was also higher in ruptured cases, indicating increased endothelial activation under unstable flow. Notably, areas with the highest OSI and RRT often aligned with vortex centers, reinforcing the association between disturbed flow and aneurysm instability.
  These findings highlight the value of combining multiple hemodynamic parameters for rupture risk assessment. Including RRT and ECAP provides deeper insight into flow endothelium-interactions, offering a stronger basis for evaluating aneurysm stability and guiding treatment decisions.</description>
