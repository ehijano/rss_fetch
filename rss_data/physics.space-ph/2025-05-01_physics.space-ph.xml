      <title>Feasibility assessment of optical communications between ground and satellite on Mars through the simulation of atmospheric effects on signal quality leading to a proposal for a new communications network architecture during extreme weather</title>

Abstract: Mars is the next milestone in human exploration. However, there are still several challenges that must be assessed to ensure appropriate conditions in a future settlement. Communications services will be essential for this task, providing not only a link between Earth and Mars but also supporting Martian weather forecasting and any potential rescue missions. These applications require a robust, high data rate communications network that allows for rapid response, remote sensing and public engagement. This research aims to study the feasibility of ground-to-satellite (and vice versa) optical communications during extreme Martian weather conditions, focusing on the link between a ground station on the surface of Mars and a satellite orbiting the planet. Long-lasting and expansive Martian dust storms, particularly common in the southern hemisphere, pose a considerable challenge when considering the feasibility of optical communications with Mars due to their significant impact in terms of signal attenuation and scattering. The methodology of this study is based on a computer simulation of the system featuring the characterisation of the Martian atmosphere and optical link to measure the attenuation and undesired effects suffered by the data signal when applying different environmental configuration parameters. The flexibility of the approach allows for the prediction of communications link quality in extreme cases such as global dust storms. The simulation is based on atmospheric data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's Mars Climate Sounder instrument and considers the recently launched Laser Communication Relay Demonstration (LCRD). The extreme conditions during dust storms in the southern polar-hood region lead to the proposal of a new communications network architecture to ensure connectivity during these events.</description>

      <title>X-ray Spectroscopy via Temporal Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel way to fit solar flare X-ray spectra that offers more sensitivity to physical flare parameters than traditional approaches to spectroscopy. We decouple physically distinct emission types in solar flare X-ray spectra using timing behaviors, a technique we call time-decomposed spectroscopy. By fitting the shapes of particular time series to others across a time interval, we extract X-ray emission of distinct physical origins before any forward modeling. We perform spectroscopy on the original and time-decomposed spectra and find good agreement, with physical reasons for the few disagreements. In general, the time decomposition technique provides more precise results than those of traditional spectroscopy. The thermal and nonthermal energies are better constrained by more than an order of magnitude using the time decomposition approach, relative to traditional spectroscopy. We explain mathematically how and why the technique works using the multifractal formalism, and show that fractality is one way to choose appropriate light curves for this analysis. We speculate about applications to different wavelengths for solar data analysis, as well as applications to other physics subfields and domains.</description>

      <title>Coalescing MPI communication in 6D Vlasov simulations: solving ghost domains in Vlasiator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance computing is used for diverse simulations, some of which parallelize over the Message Passing Interface (MPI) with ease, whilst others may have challenges related to uniform balancing of computational load and communication between simulation domains. We introduce an alternative approach to solving advection equations, specifically in an application to solving the six-dimensional Vlasov equation for modelling space plasmas. Communicating larger ghost domains around the partition assigned to each MPI task and computing on these ghost cells allows for coalescing several discrete communication calls into one. This approach needs more overall data communication and computation, but provides interesting new avenues for the balancing of computational load between MPI tasks. We discuss this trade-off, how it may assist in developing other algorithmic improvements, and how the transition to heterogeneous CPU-GPU architectures may impact its usefulness.</description>

      <title>An assessment of observational coverage and gaps for robust Sun to heliosphere integrated science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the generation and development of the continuous outflow from the Sun requires tracing the physical conditions from deep in the corona to the heliosphere. Detailed global observations of plasma state variables and the magnetic field are needed to provide critical constraints to the underlying physics driving models of the corona and solar wind. Key diagnostics of the solar wind require measurements at its formation site and during its outflow to continuously track it across rapidly changing regions of space. A unified view of the solar wind is only possible through coordinated remote and in situ observations that probe these different regions. Here, we discuss current observational coverage and gaps of different plasma properties and review recent coordinated studies. We highlight how these efforts may become more routine with the launch of upcoming and planned missions.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Model of Solar Wind Acceleration Driven by Ambipolar Electric Potential and Velocity-Space Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations have revealed that most of the solar wind acceleration occurs very close to the Sun. This acceleration is partly due to the global electric potential originating from the mass disparity between electrons and protons, coupled with the constraints of charge quasi-neutrality and zero-current conditions in the solar wind plasma. However, the exact mechanism that accounts for the remaining acceleration has not yet been identified. We aim to provide a framework that incorporates the electric-field-driven component of the acceleration while also introducing an additional acceleration mechanism via a velocity-space diffusion of the particles. This will help us determine the extent of extra acceleration, beyond the electric-field-driven component, required to fully reproduce the acceleration of the solar wind in theoretical models. We modified an existing kinetic exospheric model to account for the unexplained solar wind acceleration by including velocity-space diffusion. We compared the electric field derived from the sunward deficit of velocity distribution functions observed by PSP between 13.3 and 50 solar radii (Rs) with the electric field found self-consistently by the kinetic exospheric model. The effect of velocity-space diffusion is found to reduce the temperature anisotropy and impact the solar wind acceleration while leaving the electric potential unchanged. The approach described in this work enables the diffusion to be adjusted to effectively reduce or increase the solar wind acceleration. Even without diffusion, the model can reproduce the anticorrelation between the electric potential and the solar wind terminal velocity found by PSP. This suggests that the electric potential might still be of major importance in explaining the solar wind acceleration.</description>
