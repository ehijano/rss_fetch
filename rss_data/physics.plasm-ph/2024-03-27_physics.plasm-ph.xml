      <title>DC-Augmented Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DCA-DBD)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent multiphysics interactions that drive the energy transfer in electromechanical systems are poorly understood. We probe dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) with an external DC-augmented (DCA) field to reveal new mechanistic insights. The biased HV DC electrode influences the interaction between the charged ions and the E-field, surface and space charge, and neutral molecules. Direct force measurement, velocity profiles, and time-resolved electrical and optical measurements of discharge characteristics provide evidence of complex plasma/flow interactions. Negative DCA leads to modest improvements in momentum transfer due to the field-augmented ion acceleration before the system transitions to sliding discharge and a counter jet at the DCA electrode, canceling the gains from positive ion acceleration. Positive DCA monotonically increases the wall-parallel force. A new oscillating residual charge interaction mechanism is identified to explain a greater than 2-fold increase in horizontal thrust, in which the acceleration of positive ions is augmented by the attraction from the residual (negative) charge.</description>

      <title>Global fluid turbulence simulations in the SOL of a stellarator island divertor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isothermal fluid turbulence simulations have been performed in the edge and scrape-off-layer (SOL) of an analytic stellarator configuration with an island divertor, thereby providing numerical insight into edge turbulence in regions around islands in a stellarator. The steady-state transport follows the 1/R curvature drive toward the outboard side, but large fluctuations are present throughout the island divertor region, with the average wavelength of similar size to the island width. The system exhibits a prominent m=2, n=5 mode, although other modes are present. The amplitude and radial extent of the density fluctuations are similar throughout the edge and SOL, but can decrease near island O-points. The fluctuations exhibit a predominantly positive skewness on the outboard midplane, indicating blob-like perturbations for the transport into the outer SOL. It is determined that a point on the separatrix is generally more correlated with regions outside of the SOL than a nearby reference point which does not lie on the separatrix.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of THz Radiation in Laser-Plasma Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of Terahertz (THz) waves has captivated researchers across diverse scientific disciplines such as physics, spectroscopy, chemistry, biology, and engineering, driven by the myriad applications these waves offer. Within this expansive landscape, the development of efficient and reliable THz sources stands as a paramount objective. In the pursuit of this goal, a multitude of approaches have been undertaken, with a notable contender emerging in the form of laser-induced plasma. Harnessing the advancements in ultrafast pulses, laser-induced plasma has proven to be a promising tool for generating THz waves. Its appeal lies in the robust attributes of a high power threshold, intense THz signal, and an broadband THz spectrum. This paper delves into a comprehensive review of the physics and progress underlying THz generation from laser-induced plasmas, exploring scenarios where plasmas are induced in gases, liquids, and solids. The interactions between lasers and plasmas involve complex physical processes, resulting in a variety of laser plasma scenarios for THz generation. In this review, the focus is specifically placed on classifying THz generation based on different physical mechanisms and also examines the characteristics of the emitted THz waves. By categorizing the processes, a deeper understanding of the underlying principles can be attained.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Relativistic Magnetic Reconnection under the Presence of Shear Flow and Guide Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling of the relativistic reconnection outflow speed is studied in the presence of both shear flows parallel to the reconnecting magnetic fields and guide fields pointing out of the reconnection plane. In nonrelativistic reconnection, super-Alfv\'enic shear flows have been found to suppress reconnection. We extend the analytical model of this phenomenon to the relativistic regime and find similar behavior, which is confirmed by particle-in-cell simulations. Unlike the nonrelativistic limit, the addition of a guide field lowers the in-plane Alfv\'en velocity, contributing to slower outflow jets and the more efficient suppression of reconnection in strongly magnetized plasmas.</description>

      <title>On double-layer and reverse discharge creation during long positive voltage pulses in a bipolar HiPIMS discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved Langmuir probe diagnostics at the discharge centerline and at three distances from the target (35mm, 60mm, and 100mm) was carried out during long positive voltage pulses (a duration of 500$\mu$s and a preset positive voltage of 100V) in bipolar High-Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering of a Ti target (a diameter of 100mm) using an unbalanced magnetron. Fast-camera spectroscopy imaging recorded light emission from Ar and Ti atoms and singly charged ions during positive voltage pulses. It was found that during the long positive voltage pulse, the floating and the plasma potentials suddenly decrease, which is accompanied by the presence of anode light located on the discharge centerline between the target center and the magnetic null of the magnetron's magnetic field. These light patterns are related to the ignition of a reverse discharge, which leads to the subsequent rise in the plasma and the floating potentials. The reversed discharge is burning up to the end of the positive voltage pulse, but the plasma and floating potentials have lower values than the values from the initial part of the positive voltage pulse. Secondary electron emission induced by the impinging Ar$^+$ ions to the grounded surfaces in the vicinity of the discharge plasma together with the mirror configuration of the magnetron magnetic field are identified as the probable causes of the charge double-layer structure formation in front of the target and the ignition of the reverse discharge.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of the Large Scale Structures of the Universe as a Phenomenology of a Fractal Turbulence: The Role of the Plasma Component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new perspective on the symmetries that govern the formation of large-scale structures across the Universe, particularly focusing on the transition from the seeds of galaxy clusters to the seeds of galaxies themselves. We address two main features of cosmological fluid dynamics pertaining to both the linear and non-linear regimes. The linear dynamics of cosmological perturbations within the Hubble horizon is characterized by the Jeans length, which separates stable configurations from unstable fluctuations due to the gravitational effect on sufficiently large (and therefore, massive enough) overdensities. On the other hand, the non-linear dynamics of the cosmological fluid is associated with a turbulent behavior once the Reynolds numbers reach a sufficiently high level. This turbulent regime leads to energy dissipation across smaller and smaller scales, resulting in a fractal distribution of eddies throughout physical space. The proposed scenario suggests that the spatial scale of eddy formation is associated with the Jeans length of various levels of fragmentation from an original large-scale structure. By focusing on the fragmentation of galaxy cluster seeds versus galaxy seeds, we arrived at a phenomenological law that links the ratio of the two structure densities to the number of galaxies in each cluster and to the Hausdorff number of the Universe matter distribution. Finally, we introduced a primordial magnetic field and studied its influence on the Jeans length dynamics. The resulting anisotropic behavior of the density contrast led us to infer that the main features of the turbulence could be reduced to a 2D Euler equation. Numerical simulations showed that the two lowest wavenumbers contained the major energy contribution of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>The relative prevalence of wave-packets and coherent structures in the inertial and kinetic ranges of turbulence as seen by Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Solar Orbiter (SO) mission provides the opportunity to study the evolution of solar wind turbulence. We use SO observations of nine extended intervals of homogeneous turbulence to determine when turbulent magnetic field fluctuations may be characterized as: (i) wave-packets and (ii) coherent structures (CS). We perform the first systematic scale-by-scale decomposition of the magnetic field using two wavelets known to resolve wave-packets and discontinuities, the Daubechies 10 (Db10) and Haar respectively. The probability distributions (pdfs) of turbulent fluctuations on small scales exhibit stretched tails, becoming Gaussian at the outer scale of the cascade. Using quantile-quantile plots, we directly compare the wavelet fluctuations pdfs, revealing three distinct regimes of behaviour. Deep within the inertial range (IR) both decompositions give essentially the same fluctuation pdfs. Deep within the kinetic range (KR) the pdfs are distinct as the Haar wavelet fluctuations have larger variance and more extended tails. On intermediate scales, spanning the IR-KR break, the pdf is composed of two populations: a core of common functional form containing $\sim97\%$ of fluctuations, and tails which are more extended for Haar fluctuations than Db10 fluctuations. This establishes a crossover between wave-packet (core) and CS (tail) phenomenology in the IR and KR respectively. The range of scales where the pdfs are $2$-component is narrow at $0.9$ au ($4-16$ s) and broader ($0.5-8$ s) at $0.4$ au. As CS and wave-wave interactions are both candidates to mediate the turbulent cascade, these results offer new insights into the distinct physics of the IR and KR.</description>

      <title>A Method for Determining the Locations and Configurations of Magnetic Reconnection within 3D Turbulent Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Three-dimensional (3D) reconnection is an important mechanism for efficiently releasing energy during astrophysical eruptive events, which is difficult to be quantitatively analyzed especially within turbulent plasmas.
  Aims. In this paper, an efficient method for identifying locations and configurations of 3D reconnection from MHD data is developed.
  Methods. This method analyzes the local nonideal electric field and magnetic structure at an arbitrary position. As only performing algebraical manipulations on the discrete field data and avoiding computationally expensive operations like field-line tracing and root-finding, this method naturally possesses high efficiency. To validate this method, we apply it to the 3D data from a high-resolution simulation of a Harris-sheet reconnection and a data-driven simulation of a coronal flux rope eruption.
  Results. It is shown that this method can precisely identify the local structures of discrete magnetic field. Through the information of nonideal electric field and the geometric attributes of magnetic field, the local structures of reconnection sites can be effectively and comprehensively determined. For fine turbulent processes, both qualitative pictures and quantitative statistical properties of small-scale reconnection structures can be obtained. For large-scale solar simulations, macro-scale magnetic structures such as flux ropes and eruption current sheets can also be recognized.
  Conclusions. We develop a powerful method to analyze multi-scale structures of 3D reconnection. It can be applied not only in MHD simulations but also in kinetic simulations, plasma experiments, and in-situ observations.</description>
