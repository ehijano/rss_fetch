      <title>A Respiratory Motion Analysis for Guiding Stereotactic Arrhythmia Radiotherapy Motion Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stereotactic Arrhythmia Radiotherapy (STAR) treats ventricular tachycardia (VT) but requires internal target volume (ITV) expansions to compensate for cardiorespiratory motion. Current clinical r4DCT imaging methods are limited, and the reconstructed r4DCTs suffer from unmanaged cardiac motion artifacts that affect the quantitative assessment of respiratory motion. A groupwise surface-to-surface deformable image registration (DIR) algorithm, named gCGF, was developed. A novel principal component filtering (PCF) mechanism and a spatial smoothing mechanism were developed and incorporated into gCGF to iteratively register heart contours from an average respiratory-phase CT to ten r4DCT phases while removing random cardiac motion from the cyclic respiratory motion. The performance of the groupwise DIR was quantitatively validated using 8 digital phantoms with simulated cardiac artifacts. An ablation study was conducted to compare gCGF to another comparable state-of-the-art groupwise DIR method. gCGF was applied to r4DCTs of 20 STAR patients to analyze the respiratory motion of the heart. Validation on digital phantoms showed that gCGF achieved a mean target registration error of 0.63+-0.51 mm while successfully achieving phase smoothness and reducing cardiac motion artifacts. Among all STAR patients, the heart's maximum and mean respiratory motion magnitudes ranged from 3.6 to 7.9 mm and 1.0 mm to 2.6 mm. The peak-to-peak motion range was from 6.2 to 14.7 mm. For VT targets, the max and mean motion magnitude ranges were 3.0 to 6.7 mm and 0.8 to 2.9 mm, respectively. The peak-to-peak range was from 4.7 to 11.8 mm. Significant dominance of the first principal component of the motion direction was observed (p = 0).</description>

      <title>Double-Profile Intersection (DoPIo) Ultrasound: Pointwise Shear Elasticity Estimation using Paired Confocal Displacement Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current acoustic radiation force (ARF) based methods for quantifying tissue elasticity primarily rely on shear wave propagation. However, their spatial resolution is limited by the need for spatial averaging, and their accuracy is affected by shear wave guidance, out of plane reflections, and geometric dispersion, which reduce their applicability in mechanically complex tissues. This study introduces a novel technique called Double Profile Intersection (DoPIo) ultrasound, which enables pointwise estimation of shear elastic modulus within the region of ARF excitation by leveraging the scatterer shearing rate. This rate is inferred by tracking ARF induced displacement using two tracking beams with different lateral widths. The wider beam captures scatterers located outside the ARF excitation region that begin to displace as shearing propagates. The time at which the two resulting displacement profiles intersect is mapped to shear elastic modulus using an empirically derived model based on finite element simulations. In silico, DoPIo estimated shear elastic modulus with a median error of -0.02 kPa and a median absolute deviation of 1.98 kPa in elastic materials up to 35 kPa. Experimental validation in vitro and ex vivo demonstrated that DoPIo reliably distinguished softer regions from stiffer ones, and its modulus estimates remained consistent across varying ARF push amplitudes, provided sufficient displacement estimation signal to noise ratio. DoPIo offers a feasible approach for high resolution, on axis shear elasticity estimation and holds promise as a quantitative biomarker that is independent of ARF amplitude.</description>

      <title>Exploring the added value of pretherapeutic MR descriptors in predicting breast cancer pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate the association between pretreatment MRI descriptors and breast cancer (BC) pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Materials \&amp; Methods: Patients with BC treated by NAC with a breast MRI between 2016 and 2020 were included in this retrospective observational single-center study. MR studies were described using the standardized BI-RADS and breast edema score on T2-weighted MRI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess variables association with pCR according to residual cancer burden. Random forest classifiers were trained to predict pCR on a random split including 70% of the database and were validated on the remaining cases. Results: Among 129 BC, 59 (46%) achieved pCR after NAC (luminal (n=7/37, 19%), triple negative (TN) (n=30/55, 55%), HER2+ (n=22/37, 59%). Clinical and biological items associated with pCR were BC subtype (p&lt;0.001), T stage 0/I/II (p=0.008), higher Ki67 (p=0.005) and higher tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes levels (p=0.016). Univariate analysis showed that the following MRI features, oval or round shape (p=0.047), unifocality (p=0.026), non-spiculated margins (p=0.018), no associated non-mass enhancement (NME) (p = 0.024) and a lower MRI size (p = 0.031) were significantly associated with pCR. Unifocality and non-spiculated margins remained independently associated with pCR at multivariable analysis. Adding significant MRI features to clinicobiological variables in random forest classifiers significantly increased sensitivity (0.67 versus 0.62), specificity (0.69 versus 0.67) and precision (0.71 versus 0.67) for pCR prediction. Conclusion: Non-spiculated margins and unifocality are independently associated with pCR and can increase models performance to predict BC response to NAC. Clinical Relevance Statement: A multimodal approach integrating pretreatment MRI features with clinicobiological predictors, including TILs, could be employed to develop machine learning models for identifying patients at risk of non-response. This may enable consideration of alternative therapeutic strategies to optimize treatment outcomes</description>

      <title>Full-Wave Modeling of Transcranial Ultrasound using Volume-Surface Integral Equations and CT-Derived Heterogeneous Skull Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound therapy uses focused acoustic energy to induce therapeutic bioeffects in the brain. Ultrasound must be transmitted through the skull, which is highly attenuating and heterogeneous, causing beam distortion, reducing focal pressure, and shifting the target location. Computational models are frequently used to predict beam aberration, assess cranial heating, and correct the phase of ultrasound transducers. These models often rely on computed tomography (CT) images to build patient-specific geometries and estimate skull acoustic properties. However, the coarse voxel resolution of CT limits accuracy for differential equation solvers at ultrasound frequencies. This paper presents an efficient numerical method based on volume-surface integral equations to model full-wave acoustic propagation through heterogeneous skull bone. We show that our approach effectively simulates transcranial ultrasound, even when using the original CT voxels as the computational mesh, where the 0.5 mm voxel length is relatively coarse compared to the shortest wavelength of 3 mm. The method is validated against a high-resolution boundary element model using an averaged skull representation. Simulations using a CT-based skull model and a bowl transducer reveal significant beam distortion of 7.8 mm attributed to the skull's heterogeneous acoustical properties.</description>

      <title>Integrated Open-Source Framework for Simulation of Transcatheter Pulmonary Valves in Native Right Ventricular Outflow Tracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background - Pulmonary insufficiency is a consequence of transannular patch repair in Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF), leading to late morbidity and mortality. Transcatheter native outflow tract pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) has become common, but assessment of patient candidacy and selection of the optimal device remains challenging. We demonstrate an integrated open-source workflow for simulation of TPVR in image-derived models to inform device selection.
  Methods - Machine learning-based segmentation of CT scans was implemented to define the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). A custom workflow for device positioning and pre-compression was implemented in SlicerHeart. Resulting geometries were exported to FEBio for simulation. Visualization of results and quantification were performed using custom metrics implemented in SlicerHeart and FEBio.
  Results - RVOT model creation and device placement could be completed in under 1 minute. Virtual device placement using FE simulations visually mimicked actual device placement and allowed quantification of vessel strain, stress, and contact area. Regions of higher strain and stress were observed at the proximal and distal end locations of the TPVs where the devices impinge the RVOT wall. No other consistent trends were observed across simulations. The observed variability in mechanical metrics across RVOTS, stents, and locations in the RVOT highlights that no single device performs optimally in all anatomies, thereby reinforcing the need for simulation-based patient-specific assessment.
  Conclusions - This study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel open-source workflow for the rapid simulation of TPVR which with further refinement may inform assessment of patient candidacy and optimal device selection.</description>
