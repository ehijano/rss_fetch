      <title>JingZhao: A Framework for Rapid NIC Prototyping in the Domain-Specific-Network Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The network is becoming Domain-Specific, which requires on-demand design of the network protocols, as well as the microarchitecture of the NIC. However, to develop such a NIC is not that easy. Since the scissor gap between network speed and the growth of CPU frequency is expanding, most of the protocols need to be offloaded to hardware. The process of designing, verifying and optimizing a domain-specific NIC usually takes great effort, which hinders the rapid iteration of new protocols and algorithms. In this paper, we propose JingZhao, an open-sourced framework for NIC prototyping, which could be leveraged to rapidly implement a domain-specific NIC. JingZhao provides several building blocks, as well as a full-fledged RDMA NIC, to help rapidly prototype a high-performance NIC. Our evaluation results show that new network functions can be easily integrated into the framework, and achieve line-rate packet processing.</description>

      <title>Red is Sus: Automated Identification of Low-Quality Service Availability Claims in the US National Broadband Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FCC's National Broadband Map aspires to provide an unprecedented view into broadband availability in the US. However, this map, which also determines eligibility for public grant funding, relies on self-reported data from service providers that in turn have incentives to strategically misrepresent their coverage. In this paper, we develop an approach for automatically identifying these low-quality service claims in the National Broadband Map. To do this, we develop a novel dataset of broadband availability consisting of 750k observations from more than 900 US ISPs, derived from a combination of regulatory data and crowdsourced speed tests. Using this dataset, we develop a model to classify the accuracy of service provider regulatory filings and achieve AUCs over 0.98 for unseen examples. Our approach provides an effective technique to enable policymakers, civil society, and the public to identify portions of the National Broadband Map that are likely to have integrity challenges.</description>

      <title>Goal-Oriented Communications for Real-time Inference with Two-Way Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a goal-oriented communication strategy for remote inference, where an intelligent model (e.g., a pre-trained neural network) at the receiver side predicts the real-time value of a target signal based on data packets transmitted from a remote location. The inference error depends on both the Age of Information (AoI) and the length of the data packets. Previous formulations of this problem either assumed IID transmission delays with immediate feedback or focused only on monotonic relations where inference performance degrades as the input data ages. In contrast, we consider a possibly non-monotonic relationship between the inference error and AoI. We show how to minimize the expected time-average inference error under two-way delay, where the delay process can have memory. Simulation results highlight the significant benefits of adopting such a goal-oriented communication strategy for remote inference, especially under highly variable delay scenarios.</description>

      <title>5G as Enabler for Industrie 4.0 Use Cases: Challenges and Concepts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for highly customized products, as well as flexible production lines, can be seen as trigger for the "fourth industrial revolution", referred to as "Industrie 4.0". Current systems usually rely on wire-line technologies to connect sensors and actuators. To enable a higher flexibility such as moving robots or drones, these connections need to be replaced by wireless technologies in the future. Furthermore, this facilitates the renewal of brownfield deployments to address Industrie 4.0 requirements. This paper proposes representative use cases, which have been examined in the German Tactile Internet 4.0 (TACNET 4.0) research project. In order to analyze these use cases, this paper identifies the main challenges and requirements of communication networks in Industrie 4.0 and discusses the applicability of 5th generation wireless communication systems (5G).</description>

      <title>Smart PRACH Jamming: A Serious Threat for 5G Campus Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart jamming attacks on cellular campus networks represent an enormous potential threat, especially in the industrial environment. In complex production processes, the disruption of a single wireless connected Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is enough to cause a large-scale failure. In this paper, a smart jamming attack on the Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) of a 5G system is modeled. This is followed by a practical implementation of the jammer on a testbed based on Open Air Interface (OAI) and Software Defined Radios (SDRs). It is shown that the designed jammer design can interfere a legitimate transmission of a PRACH preamble with a ratio of more than 99.9%. While less than one percent of the cell resources are interfered compared to broadband jamming. In addition, two different types of jamming signal spectra are compared in relation to their interference capacity. The developed attack can be re-implemented based on publicly available source code and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) hardware.</description>

      <title>OpenWiFiSync: Open Source Implementation of a Clock Synchronization Algorithm using Wi-Fi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise clock synchronization is an important requirement for distributed and networked industrial use cases. As more and more use cases contain mobile devices, clock synchronization has to be performed over wireless communication links. As wireless communication links are currently not as deterministic and reliable as wireline communication systems, novel clock synchronization algorithms have to be investigated. Here, the so-called Reference Broadcast Infrastructure Synchronization Protocol is a well suited solution as it brings up multiple advantages. Most important is the non-invasiveness, meaning it can be used with commercially available components. As a considerably high amount of factories use Wi-Fi as wireless communication system for their mobile use cases, the aforementioned protocol is implemented using Wi-Fi. Furthermore, the usage of Open-Source Software can be seen as driver for highly efficient and interoperable applications. Consequently, the implementation is accessible under the GNU General Public License on GitHub under the designation OpenWiFiSync.
  Besides the details on concept, its implementation, and the used testbed, first results are outlined within this paper. Additionally, future work and the estimated timeline are presented.</description>

      <title>Online Learning for Intelligent Thermal Management of Interference-coupled and Passively Cooled Base Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passively cooled base stations (PCBSs) have emerged to deliver better cost and energy efficiency. However, passive cooling necessitates intelligent thermal control via traffic management, i.e., the instantaneous data traffic or throughput of a PCBS directly impacts its thermal performance. This is particularly challenging for outdoor deployment of PCBSs because the heat dissipation efficiency is uncertain and fluctuates over time. What is more, the PCBSs are interference-coupled in multi-cell scenarios. Thus, a higher-throughput PCBS leads to higher interference to the other PCBSs, which, in turn, would require more resource consumption to meet their respective throughput targets. In this paper, we address online decision-making for maximizing the total downlink throughput for a multi-PCBS system subject to constraints related on operating temperature. We demonstrate that a reinforcement learning (RL) approach, specifically soft actor-critic (SAC), can successfully perform throughput maximization while keeping the PCBSs cool, by adapting the throughput to time-varying heat dissipation conditions. Furthermore, we design a denial and reward mechanism that effectively mitigates the risk of overheating during the exploration phase of RL. Simulation results show that our approach achieves up to 88.6% of the global optimum. This is very promising, as our approach operates without prior knowledge of future heat dissipation efficiency, which is required by the global optimum.</description>

      <title>NetDiff: Deep Graph Denoising Diffusion for Ad Hoc Network Topology Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces NetDiff, an expressive graph denoising diffusion probabilistic architecture that generates wireless ad hoc network link topologies. Such networks, with directional antennas, can achieve unmatched performance when the communication links are designed to provide good geometric properties, notably by reducing interference between these links while respecting diverse physical constraints. How to craft such a link assignment algorithm is yet a real problem. Deep graph generation offers multiple advantages compared to traditional approaches: it allows to relieve the network nodes of the communication burden caused by the search of viable links and to avoid resorting to heavy combinatorial methods to find a good link topology. Denoising diffusion also provides a built-in method to update the network over time. Given that graph neural networks sometimes tend to struggle with global, structural properties, we augment the popular graph transformer with cross-attentive modulation tokens in order to improve global control over the predicted topology. We also incorporate simple node and edge features, as well as additional loss terms, to facilitate the compliance with the network topology physical constraints. A network evolution algorithm based on partial diffusion is also proposed to maintain a stable network topology over time when the nodes move. Our results show that the generated links are realistic, present structural properties similar to the dataset graphs', and require only minor corrections and verification steps to be operational.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Intelligent Reffecting Surface Aided Near-Field THz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) operating in the terahertz (THz) band has recently gained considerable interest due to its high spectrum bandwidth. Due to the exploitation of large scale of IRS, there is a high probability that the transceivers will be situated within the near-field region of the IRS. Thus, the near-field beam split effect poses a major challenge for the design of wideband IRS beamforming, which causes the radiation beam to deviate from its intended location, leading to significant gain losses and limiting the efficient use of available bandwidths. While delay-based IRS has emerged as a potential solution, current beamforming schemes generally assume unbounded range time delays (TDs). In this letter, we first investigate the near-field beam split issue at the IRS. Then, we extend the piece-wise far-field model to the IRS, based on which, a double-layer delta-delay (DLDD) IRS beamforming scheme is proposed. Specifically, we employ an element-grouping strategy and the TD imposed on each sub-surface of IRS is achieved by a series of TD modules. This method significantly reduces the required range of TDs. Numerical results show that the proposed DLDD IRS beamforming scheme can effectively mitigate the near-field beam split and achieve near-optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Progressive Pruning: Estimating Anonymity of Stream-Based Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Streams of data have become the ubiquitous communication model on today's Internet. For strong anonymous communication, this conflicts with the traditional notion of single, independent messages, as assumed e.g. by many mixnet designs. In this work, we investigate the anonymity factors that are inherent to stream communication. We introduce Progressive Pruning}, a methodology suitable for estimating the anonymity level of streams. By mimicking an intersection attack, it captures the susceptibility of streams against traffic analysis attacks. We apply it to simulations of tailored examples of stream communication as well as to large-scale simulations of Tor using our novel TorFS simulator, finding that the stream length, the number of users, and how streams are distributed over the network have interdependent impacts on anonymity. Our work draws attention to challenges that need to be solved in order to provide strong anonymity for stream-based communication in the future.</description>

      <title>Bad Neighbors: On Understanding VPN Provider Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtual Private Network (VPN) solutions are used to connect private networks securely over the Internet. Besides their benefits in corporate environments, VPNs are also marketed to privacy-minded users to preserve their privacy, and to bypass geolocation-based content blocking and censorship. This has created a market for turnkey VPN services offering a multitude of vantage points all over the world for a monthly price. While VPN providers are heavily using privacy and security benefits in their marketing, such claims are generally hard to measure and substantiate. While there exist some studies on the VPN ecosystem, all prior works omit a critical part in their analyses: (i) How well do the providers configure and secure their own network infrastructure? and (ii) How well are they protecting their customers from other customers? To answer these questions, we have developed an automated measurement system with which we conduct a large-scale analysis of VPN providers and their thousands of VPN endpoints. Considering the fact that VPNs work internally using non-Internet-routable IP addresses, they might enable access to otherwise inaccessible networks. If not properly secured, this can inadvertently expose internal networks of these providers, or worse, even other clients connected to their services. Our results indicate a widespread lack of traffic filtering towards internally routable networks on the majority of tested VPN service providers, even in cases where no other VPN customers were directly exposed. We have disclosed our findings to the affected providers and other stakeholders, and offered guidance to improve the situation.</description>

      <title>Cross-chain Sharing of Personal Health Records: Heterogeneous and Interoperable Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of medical informatics, a wealth of valuable personal health records (PHR) has been generated. Concurrently, blockchain technology has enhanced the security of medical institutions. However, these institutions often function as isolated data silos, limiting the potential value of PHRs. As the demand for data sharing between hospitals on different blockchains grows, addressing the challenge of cross-chain data sharing becomes crucial. When sharing PHRs across blockchains, the limited storage and computational capabilities of medical Internet of Things (IoT) devices complicate the storage of large volumes of PHRs and the handling of complex calculations. Additionally, varying blockchain cryptosystems and the risk of internal attacks further complicate the cross-chain sharing of PHRs. This paper proposes a scheme for sharing PHRs across heterogeneous and interoperable blockchains. Medical IoT devices can encrypt and store real-time PHRs in an InterPlanetary File System, requiring only simple operations for data sharing. An enhanced proxy re-encryption(PRE) algorithm addresses the differences in blockchain cryptosystems. Multi-dimensional analysis demonstrates that this scheme offers robust security and excellent performance.</description>

      <title>Hybrid LLM-DDQN based Joint Optimization of V2I Communication and Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have received considerable interest recently due to their outstanding reasoning and comprehension capabilities. This work explores applying LLMs to vehicular networks, aiming to jointly optimize vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and autonomous driving (AD) policies. We deploy LLMs for AD decision-making to maximize traffic flow and avoid collisions for road safety, and a double deep Q-learning algorithm (DDQN) is used for V2I optimization to maximize the received data rate and reduce frequent handovers. In particular, for LLM-enabled AD, we employ the Euclidean distance to identify previously explored AD experiences, and then LLMs can learn from past good and bad decisions for further improvement. Then, LLM-based AD decisions will become part of states in V2I problems, and DDQN will optimize the V2I decisions accordingly. After that, the AD and V2I decisions are iteratively optimized until convergence. Such an iterative optimization approach can better explore the interactions between LLMs and conventional reinforcement learning techniques, revealing the potential of using LLMs for network optimization and management. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that our proposed hybrid LLM-DDQN approach outperforms the conventional DDQN algorithm, showing faster convergence and higher average rewards.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Internet Principles to Build a Quantum Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing an operational architecture for the Quantum Internet is a challenging task in light of both fundamental limitations imposed by the laws of physics and technological constraints. Here, we propose a method to abstract away most of the quantum-specific elements and formulate a best-effort quantum network architecture based on packet-switching, akin to that of the classical Internet. Such reframing provides an opportunity to exploit the many tools and protocols available and well-understood within the Internet. As an illustration, we tailor and adapt classical congestion control and active queue management protocols to quantum networks, comprising an architecture wherein quantum end- and intermediate nodes effectively regulate demand and resource utilization, respectively. Results show that these classical networking tools can be effectively used to combat quantum memory decoherence and keep end-to-end fidelity around a target value.</description>
