      <title>Ferromagnetic and Spin-Glass Finite-Tempeature Order but no Antiferromagetic Order in the d=1 Ising Model with Long-Range Power-Law Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The d=1 Ising ferromagnet and spin glass with long-range power-law interactions J r^-a is studied for all interaction range exponents a by a renormalization-group transformation that simultaneously projects local ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. In the ferromagnetic case, J&gt;0, a finite-temperature ferromagnetic phase occurs for interaction range 0.74&lt;a&lt;2. The second-order phase transition temperature monotonically decreases between these two limits. At a=2, the phase transition becomes first order, as predicted by rigorous results. For a&gt;2, the phase transition temperature discontinuously drops to zero and for a&gt;2 there is no ordered phase above zero temperature, also as predicted by rigorous results. At the other end, on approaching a=0.74 from above, namely increasing the range of the interaction, the phase transition temperature diverges to infinity, meaning that, at all non-infinite temperatures, the system is ferromagnetically ordered. Thus, the equivalent-neighbor interactions regime is entered before (a &gt; 0) the neighbors become equivalent, namely before the interactions become equal for all separations. The critical exponents alpha,beta, gamma,delta,eta,nu are calculated, from a large recursion matrix, varying as function of a. For antiferromagnetic J&lt;0, all triplets of spins at all ranges have competing interactions and this highly frustrated system does not have an ordered phase. In the spin-glass system, where all couplings for all separations are randomly ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic (with probability p), a finite-temperatures spin-glass phase is obtained in the absence of antiferromagnetic phase. In the spin-glass phase, the signature chaotic behavior under scale change occurs in a richer version than previously: In the long-range interaction of this system, the interactions at every separation become chaotic, yielding a piecewise chaotic interaction function.</description>

      <title>Deterministic roughening in the dc-driven precessional regime of domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study the dynamics of extended domain walls in homogeneous ferromagnets driven by a uniform magnetic field at zero temperature. Using both micromagnetic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert simulations and a collective-coordinate model, we show that flat domain walls become linearly unstable above the Walker breakdown field and below a higher threshold, provided their length exceeds a characteristic value. This instability is captured by a quasi-universal spectral diagram, parameterized solely by the Gilbert damping, that predicts the onset of deviations from rigid-wall behavior. Beyond the linear regime, large domain walls with bands of unstable modes exhibit spatiotemporal chaos, intricate Bloch line motion, and deterministic roughening. The system undergoes a dynamical phase transition from a flat to a rough moving phase at a critical field.</description>

      <title>Passive leakage removal unit based on a disordered transmon array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.</description>
