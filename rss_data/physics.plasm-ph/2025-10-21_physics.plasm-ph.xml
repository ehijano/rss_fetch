      <title>Physics insights from a large-scale 2D UEDGE simulation database for detachment control in KSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large-scale database of two-dimensional UEDGE simulations has been developed to study detachment physics in KSTAR and to support surrogate models for control applications. Nearly 70,000 steady-state solutions were generated, systematically scanning upstream density, input power, plasma current, impurity fraction, and anomalous transport coefficients, with magnetic and electric drifts across the magnetic field included. The database identifies robust detachment indicators, with strike-point electron temperature at detachment onset consistently Te around 3-4 eV, largely insensitive to upstream conditions. Scaling relations reveal weaker impurity sensitivity than one-dimensional models and show that heat flux widths follow Eich's scaling only for uniform, low D and Chi. Distinctive in-out divertor asymmetries are observed in KSTAR, differing qualitatively from DIII-D. Complementary time-dependent simulations quantify plasma response to gas puffing, with delays of 5-15 ms at the outer strike point and approximately 40 ms for the low-magnetic-field-side (LFS) radiation front. These dynamics are well captured by first-order-plus-dead-time (FOPDT) models and are consistent with experimentally observed detachment-control behavior in KSTAR [Gupta et al., submitted to Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion (2025)]</description>

      <title>A flexible and differentiable coil proxy for stellarator equilibrium optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balancing plasma performance and coil cost is a significant challenge when designing a stellarator power plant. Most present stellarator designs are produced by two-stage optimization: the first for the equilibrium and the second for a coil design reproducing its magnetic configuration. It is challenging to find a compromise between plasma and coils with this approach. In recent years, single-stage approaches have gained popularity, which attempt to optimize both the plasma and coils simultaneously to improve the plasma-coil balance. In exchange, it can substantially increase the problem's dimensionality and introduce the ill-posedness of filamentary coil optimization to equilibrium optimization. This paper introduces a new ``quasi-single-stage'' method representing a flexible and differentiable coil proxy that directly predicts coil complexity during equilibrium optimization. The proxy is based on the adjoint differentiation of a winding surface coil subproblem. Our proxy can balance coil and plasma performance without introducing new degrees of freedom or ill-posedness. We present initial numerical results that demonstrate the proxy's effectiveness for single-stage optimization.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian estimation of island width threshold for stochasticity onset on edge pedestal top in presence of a resonant magnetic perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study applies the Hamiltonian method to analyze the nonlinear magnetic topology induced by Resonant Magnetic Perturbations (RMPs) in tokamaks. We investigate the system's chaotic behavior by comparing three methods: the renormalization method, Lyapunov exponents (LE), and weighted Birkhoff average (WBA). A strong consistency is found among these methods in predicting the large scale stochasticity threshold. The magnetic island width threshold provides a quantitative criterion for optimizing RMP-based ELM control, bridging a critical gap in plasma control strategies.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Wave Excitation by Laser Pulse in a Magnetized Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of plasma, particularly in applications involving strong laser-plasma interactions, the propagation of a strong electromagnetic wave induces relativistic velocities in the electron flow. Given such conditions, the wave propagating through the plasma experiences modulational instability. In this paper, we investigate this instability using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. In the relativistic limit, the motion of ions can be neglected due to their significant inertia, allowing us to treat the ions as a background fluid. This simplification enables us to apply perturbation techniques to the electron fluid equations, leading to the derivation of the nonlinear wave equation in the form of the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NLSE). We also explore the relationship between wave dispersion and the conditions for instability. We derive the maximum growth rate of the modulational instability and analyze its dependence on plasma parameters and wave intensity in the context of relativistic magnetized plasma, providing quantitative insights into the instability dynamics. Finally, we examine aspects of the perturbed NLSE using the Bogoliubov-Mitropolsky perturbation approach, treating real and imaginary coefficients separately, which explicitly incorporates both Nonlinear Landau Damping (NLLD) and growth-damping effects.</description>

      <title>Probing Flying-Focus Wakefields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flying-focus wakefields, which can propagate with a tunable velocity along the optical axis, are promising solutions to electron dephasing in laser-wakefield accelerators. This is accomplished by a combination of spatio-temporal couplings and focusing with an axiparabola, a specialized optical element which produces a quasi-Bessel beam. If implemented, dephasingless acceleration would allow for a hitherto unachievable mixture of high acceleration gradients and long acceleration lengths. Here, we conduct an in-depth study of the structure and behavior of such a flying-focus wakefield, through a combination of direct imaging and simulations. We show the stability of the wakefield structures, explore how the wakefield evolves with changes of density, study the effects of ionization on the wakefield structure with a variety of gases, and analyze the importance of the focusing position. These insights shed light onto this novel wakefield regime and bring understanding that is important to the realization of dephasingless acceleration.</description>

      <title>Plasma Shape Control via Zero-shot Generative Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional PID controllers have limited adaptability for plasma shape control, and task-specific reinforcement learning (RL) methods suffer from limited generalization and the need for repetitive retraining. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework for developing a versatile, zero-shot control policy from a large-scale offline dataset of historical PID-controlled discharges. Our approach synergistically combines Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) with Hilbert space representation learning to achieve dual objectives: mimicking the stable operational style of the PID data and constructing a geometrically structured latent space for efficient, goal-directed control. The resulting foundation policy can be deployed for diverse trajectory tracking tasks in a zero-shot manner without any task-specific fine-tuning. Evaluations on the HL-3 tokamak simulator demonstrate that the policy excels at precisely and stably tracking reference trajectories for key shape parameters across a range of plasma scenarios. This work presents a viable pathway toward developing highly flexible and data-efficient intelligent control systems for future fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound for inertial confinement fusion target wall thickness measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</description>

      <title>Extended phase-space symplectic integration for electron dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of extended phase-space symplectic integration [M. Tao, Phys. Rev. E 94, 043303 (2016)] for simulating two different classes of electron dynamics. The first one, with one and a half degrees of freedom, comes from plasma physics and describes the classical dynamics of a charged particle in a strong, constant, and uniform magnetic field perturbed by a turbulent electrostatic potential. The second one, with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, comes from physical chemistry and corresponds to Kohn-Sham time-dependent density-functional theory. For both we lay out the extension procedure and stability condition for numerical integration of the dynamics using high-order symplectic split-operator schemes. We also identify a computationally inexpensive metric that can be used for on-the-fly estimation of the accuracy of simulations. Our work paves the way for broad application of symplectic split-operator integration of classical and quantum Hamiltonian systems with finite and infinite number of degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin Representation of the Maxwell-J\"uttner Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations of relativistic gases and plasmas are critical for understanding diverse astrophysical and terrestrial systems, but the accurate construction of the relativistic Maxwellian, the Maxwell-J\"uttner (MJ) distribution, on a discrete simulation grid is challenging. Difficulties arise from the finite velocity bounds of the domain, which may not capture the entire distribution function, as well as errors introduced by projecting the function onto a discrete grid. Here we present a novel scheme for iteratively correcting the moments of the projected distribution applicable to all grid-based discretizations of the relativistic kinetic equation. In addition, we describe how to compute the needed nonlinear quantities, such as Lorentz boost factors, in a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) scheme through a combination of numerical quadrature and weak operations. The resulting method accurately captures the distribution function and ensures that the moments match the desired values to machine precision.</description>
