      <title>CaloHadronic: a diffusion model for the generation of hadronic showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating showers of particles in highly-granular calorimeters is a key frontier in the application of machine learning to particle physics. Achieving high accuracy and speed with generative machine learning models can enable them to augment traditional simulations and alleviate a major computing constraint. Recent developments have shown how diffusion based generative shower simulation approaches that do not rely on a fixed structure, but instead generate geometry-independent point clouds, are very efficient. We present a transformer-based extension to previous architectures which were developed for simulating electromagnetic showers in the highly granular electromagnetic calorimeter of the International Large Detector, ILD. The attention mechanism now allows us to generate complex hadronic showers with more pronounced substructure across both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This is the first time that machine learning methods are used to holistically generate showers across the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter in highly granular imaging calorimeter systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Coefficient of Variation: Assessing the Variability and Forecastability of Solar Irradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a robust framework for quantifying solar irradiance variability and forecastability through the Stochastic Coefficient of Variation (sCV) and the Forecastability (F). Traditional metrics, such as the standard deviation, fail to isolate stochastic fluctuations from deterministic trends in solar irradiance. By considering clear-sky irradiance as a dynamic upper bound of measurement, sCV provides a normalized, dimensionless measure of variability that theoretically ranges from 0 to 1. F extends sCV by integrating temporal dependencies via maximum autocorrelation, thus linking sCV with F. The proposed methodology is validated using synthetic cyclostationary time series and experimental data from 68 meteorological stations (in Spain). Our comparative analyses demonstrate that sCV and F proficiently encapsulate multi-scale fluctuations, while addressing significant limitations inherent in traditional metrics. This comprehensive framework enables a refined quantification of solar forecast uncertainty, supporting improved decision-making in flexibility procurement and operational strategies. By assessing variability and forecastability across multiple time scales, it enhances real-time monitoring capabilities and informs adaptive energy management approaches, such as dynamic outage management and risk-adjusted capacity allocation</description>

      <title>Glitches far from transient gravitational-wave events do not bias inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian noise in gravitational-wave detectors, known as "glitches," can bias the inferred parameters of transient signals when they occur nearby in time and frequency. These biases are addressed with a variety of methods that remove or otherwise mitigate the impact of the glitch. Given the computational cost and human effort required for glitch mitigation, we study the conditions under which it is strictly necessary. We consider simulated glitches and gravitational-wave signals in various configurations that probe their proximity both in time and in frequency. We determine that glitches located outside the time-frequency space spanned by the gravitational-wave model prior and with a signal-to-noise ratio, conservatively, below 50 do not impact estimation of the signal parameters.</description>

      <title>Manifold-based transformation of probability distributions: application to the inverse problem of reconstructing distributions from experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information geometry is a mathematical framework that elucidates the manifold structure of the probability distribution space (p-space), providing a systematic approach to transforming probability distributions (PDs). In this study, we utilized information geometry to address the inverse problems associated with reconstructing PDs from experimental data. Our initial finding is that the Kullback-Leibler divergence, often considered non-metric owing to its asymmetry, can serve as a valid metric under specific geometric conditions on the manifold. Based on this finding, we formulated the manifold-based gradient descent (MBGD) method, which was employed to visualize the internal structures -- represented as PDs -- of two types of systems: those with static constituent elements and those with dynamic state transitions. Through the application of MBGD, we successfully reconstructed the underlying PDs for both types of systems, outperforming the standard gradient descent methods that neglect the manifold structure of p-space. Therefore, the present results demonstrate the essentiality of accounting for the manifold structure of p-space in the inverse problems of reconstructing PDs. The ability of MBGD to accurately reconstruct PDs for systems with dynamic state transitions underscores its potential to provide valuable physical insights by visualizing internal structures.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Algorithm for Model-Independent Searches for New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.02181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel quantum technique to search for unmodeled anomalies in multidimensional binned collider data. We propose associating an Ising lattice spin site with each bin, with the Ising Hamiltonian suitably constructed from the observed data and a corresponding theoretical expectation. In order to capture spatially correlated anomalies in the data, we introduce spin-spin interactions between neighboring sites, as well as self-interactions. The ground state energy of the resulting Ising Hamiltonian can be used as a new test statistic, which can be computed either classically or via adiabatic quantum optimization. We demonstrate that our test statistic outperforms some of the most commonly used goodness-of-fit tests. The new approach greatly reduces the look-elsewhere effect by exploiting the typical differences between statistical noise and genuine new physics signals.</description>

      <title>Deep source separation of overlapping gravitational-wave signals and non-stationary noise artifacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band, detecting signals from a vast number of astrophysical sources embedded in instrumental noise. Extracting individual signals from these overlapping contributions is a fundamental challenge in LISA data analysis and is traditionally addressed using computationally expensive stochastic Bayesian techniques. In this work, we present a deep learning-based framework for blind source separation in LISA data, employing an encoder-decoder architecture commonly used in digital audio processing to isolate individual signals within complex mixtures. Our approach enables signals from massive black-hole binaries, Galactic binaries, and instrumental glitches to be disentangled directly in a single step, circumventing the need for sequential source identification and subtraction. By learning clustered latent space representations, the framework provides a scalable alternative to conventional methods, with applications in both low-latency event detection and full-scale global-fit analyses. As a proof of concept, we assess the model's performance using simulated LISA data in a controlled setting with a limited number of overlapping sources. The results highlight deep source separation as a promising tool for LISA, paving the way for future extensions to more complex datasets.</description>
