      <title>Reconstruction of module categories in the infinite and non-rigid settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By building on the notions of internal projective and injective objects in a module category introduced by Douglas, Schommer-Pries, and Snyder, we extend the reconstruction theory for module categories of Etingof and Ostrik. More explicitly, instead of algebra objects in finite tensor categories, we consider quasi-finite coalgebra objects in locally finite tensor categories. Moreover, we show that module categories over non-rigid monoidal categories can be reconstructed via lax module monads, which generalize algebra objects. For the category of finite-dimensional comodules over a (non-Hopf) bialgebra, we give this result a more concrete form, realizing module categories as categories of contramodules over Hopf trimodule algebras -- this specializes to our tensor-categorical results in the Hopf case. Using lax module functors we give a categorical proof of the variant of the fundamental theorem of Hopf modules which applies to Hopf trimodules. We also give a characterization of fusion operators for a Hopf monad as coherence cells for a module functor structure, using which we similarly reinterpret and reprove the Hopf-monadic fundamental theorem of Hopf modules due to Brugui\`eres, Lack, and Virelizier.</description>

      <title>Central Hopf Monads and Braided Commutative Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ V$ be a braided tensor category and $ C$ a tensor category equipped with a braided tensor functor $G:V\to Z(C)$. For any exact indecomposable $C$-module category $M$, we explicitly construct a right adjoint of the action functor $\rho:Z^V(C)\to C^*_{M}$ afforded by $M$. Here $Z^V(C)$ is the M\"uger's centralizer of the subcategory $G(V)$ inside the center $Z^V(C)$, also known as the relative center. The construction is parallel to the one presented by K. Shimizu, but using instead the relative coend end. This adjunction turns out to be monadic, thus inducing Hopf monads $T_{V}: C\to C$, such that there is a monoidal equivalence of categories $ C_{T_{V}}\simeq Z^V(C).$ If $\bar{\rho}: C^*_{ M}\to Z^V(C)$ is the right adjoint of $\rho,$ then $\bar{\rho}(Id_{M})$ is the braided commutative algebra constructed in [R. Laugwitz and C. Walton. Braided commutative algebras over quantized enveloping algebras, Transform. Groups 26(3) (2021), 957--993]. As a consequence of our construction of these algebras, in terms of the right adjoint to $\rho$, we can provide a recipe to compute them when $C=Rep(H\# T)$ is the category of finite-dimensional representations of a finite-dimensional Hopf algebra $H\# T$ obtained by bosonization, and choosing an arbitrary $Rep(H\# T)$-module category $M$. We show an explicit example in the case of Taft algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The connection between the R-matrix realization and Drinfeld's realization of the quantum loop algebra $U_q(D^{(2)}_n)$ is considered using the Gaussian decomposition approach proposed by J. Ding and I. B. Frenkel. Our main result is a description of the embedding $U_q(D^{(2)}_{n-1})\hookrightarrow U_q(D^{(2)}_n)$ that underlies this connection. Explicit relations between all Gaussian coordinates of the L-operators and the currents are presented.</description>

      <title>Nappi-Witten vertex operator algebra via inverse Quantum Hamiltonian Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The representation theory of the Nappi-Witten VOA was initiated in arXiv:1104.3921 and arXiv:2011.14453. In this paper we use the technique of inverse quantum hamiltonian reduction to investigate the representation theory of the Nappi-Witten VOA $ V^1(\mathfrak h_4)$. We first prove that the quantum hamiltonian reduction of $ V^1(\mathfrak h_4)$ is the Heisenberg-Virasoro VOA $L^{HVir}$ of level zero investigated in arXiv:math/0201314 and arXiv:1405.1707. We invert the quantum hamiltonian reduction in this case and prove that $ V^1(\mathfrak h_4)$ is realized as a vertex subalgebra of $L^{HVir} \otimes \Pi$, where $\Pi$ is a certain lattice-like vertex algebra. Using such an approach we shall realize all relaxed highest weight modules which were classified in arXiv:2011.14453. We show that every relaxed highest weight module, whose top components is neither highest nor lowest weight $\mathfrak h_4$-module, has the form $M_1 \otimes \Pi_{1} (\lambda)$ where $M_1$ is an irreducible, highest weight $L^{HVir}$-module and $\Pi_{1} (\lambda)$ is an irreducible weight $\Pi$-module.
  Using the fusion rules for $L^{HVir}$-modules and the previously developed methods of constructing logarithmic modules we are able to construct a family of logarithmic $V^1(\mathfrak h_4)$-modules. The Loewy diagrams of these logarithmic modules are completely analogous to the Loewy diagrams of projective modules of weight $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}(2))$-modules, so we expect that our logarithmic modules are also projective in a certain category of weight $ V^1(\mathfrak h_4)$-modules.</description>

      <title>Higher categories of push-pull spans, II: Matrix factorizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second part of a project aimed at formalizing Rozansky-Witten models in the functorial field theory framework. In the first part we constructed a symmetric monoidal $(\infty, 3)$-category $\mathscr{CRW}$ of commutative Rozansky-Witten models with the goal of approximating the $3$-category of Kapustin and Rozansky. In this paper we extend work of Brunner, Carqueville, Fragkos, and Roggenkamp on the affine Rozansky-Witten models: we exhibit a functor connecting their $2$-category of matrix factorizations with the homotopy $2$-category of $\mathscr{CRW}$, and calculate the associated TFTs.</description>

      <title>Miraculous cancellations and the quantum Frobenius for $SL_3$ skein modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a quantum Frobenius map for the $SL_3$ skein module of any oriented 3-manifold specialized at a root of unity, and describe the map by way of threading certain polynomials along links. The homomorphism is a higher rank version of the Chebyshev-Frobenius homomorphism of Bonahon-Wong. The strategy builds on a previous construction of the Frobenius map for $SL_3$ skein algebras of punctured surfaces, using the Frobenius map of Parshall-Wang for the quantum group $\mathcal{O}_q(SL_3).$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an equivariant theory of graphs with respect to quantum symmetries and present a detailed exposition of various examples. We portray unitary tensor categories as a unifying framework encompassing all finite classical simple graphs, (quantum) Cayley graphs of finite (quantum) groupoids, and all finite-dimensional quantum graphs. We model a quantum set by a finite-index inclusion of C*-algebras and use the quantum Fourier transform to obtain all possible adjacency operators. In particular, we show every finite-index subfactor can be regarded as a complete quantum graph and describe how to find all its subgraphs. As applications, we prove a version of Frucht's Theorem for finite quantum groupoids, and introduce a version of path spaces for quantum graphs.</description>

      <title>Lie affgebras vis-\`a-vis Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that any Lie affgebra, that is an algebraic system consisting of an affine space together with a bi-affine bracket satisfying affine versions of the antisymmetry and Jacobi identity, is isomorphic to a Lie algebra together with an element and a specific generalised derivation (in the sense of Leger and Luks, [G.F.\ Leger \&amp; E.M.\ Luks, Generalized derivations of Lie algebras, {\em J.\ Algebra} {\bf 228} (2000), 165--203]). These Lie algebraic data can be taken for the construction of a Lie affgebra or, conversely, they can be uniquely derived for any Lie algebra fibre of the Lie affgebra. The close relationship between Lie affgebras and (enriched by the additional data) Lie algebras can be employed to attempt a classification of the former by the latter. In particular, up to isomorphism, a complex Lie affgebra with a simple Lie algebra fibre $\mathfrak{g}$ is fully determined by a scalar and an element of $\mathfrak{g}$ fixed up to an automorphism of $\mathfrak{g}$, and it can be universally embedded in a trivial extension of $\mathfrak{g}$ by a derivation. The study is illustrated by a number of examples that include all Lie affgebras with one-dimensional, nonabelian two-dimensional, $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{l}(2,\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathfrak{s}\mathfrak{o}(3)$ fibres. Extensions of Lie affgebras by cocycles and their relation to cocycle extensions of tangent Lie algebras is briefly discussed too.</description>

      <title>On irreducibility of modules of Whittaker type: twisted modules and nonabelian orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:1811.04649, we extended the Dong-Mason theorem on irreducibility of modules for cyclic orbifold vertex algebras to the entire category weak modules and applied this result to Whittaker modules. In this paper we present further generalizations of these results for nonabelian orbifolds of vertex operator superalgebras. Let $V$ be a vertex superalgebra with a countable dimension and let $G$ be a finite subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(V)$. Assume that $h\in Z(G)$ where $Z(G)$ is the center of the group $G$. For any irreducible $h$-twisted (weak) $V$-module $M$, we prove that if $M\not\cong g\circ M$ for all $g\in G$ then $M$ is also irreducible as $V^G$-module. We also apply this result to examples and give irreducibility of modules of Whittaker type for orbifolds of Neveu-Schwarz vertex superalgebras, Heisenberg vertex algebras, Virasoro vertex operator algebra and Heisenberg-Virasoro vertex algebra.</description>

      <title>Drinfeld rational fractions for affine Kac-Moody quantum symmetric pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13705v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a precise connection between the new Drinfeld presentation of a quantum affine algebra $U_q\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$ and the new Drinfeld presentation of affine coideal subalgebras of split type recently discovered by Lu and Wang. In particular, we establish a ``factorization formula'', expressing the commuting ``Drinfeld-Cartan''-type operators $\Theta_{i,k}$ in a coideal subalgebra in terms of the corresponding Drinfeld generators of $U_q\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$, modulo the ``Drinfeld positive half" of $U_q\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$. We study the spectra of these operators on finite dimensional representations, and describe them in terms of rational functions with an extra symmetry. These results can be seen as the starting point of a $q$-character theory for affine Kac--Moody quantum symmetric pairs. Additionally, we prove a compatibility result linking Lusztig's and the Lu-Wang-Zhang braid group actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $q$-Schur category is a $\mathbb{Z}[q,q^{-1}]$-linear monoidal category closely related to the $q$-Schur algebra. We explain how to construct it from coordinate algebras of quantum $GL_n$ for all $n \geq 0$. Then we use Donkin's work on Ringel duality for $q$-Schur algebras to make precise the relationship between the $q$-Schur category and an integral form for the $U_q\mathfrak{gl}_n$-web category of Cautis, Kamnitzer and Morrison. We construct explicit integral bases for morphism spaces in the latter category, and extend the Cautis-Kamnitzer-Morrison theorem to polynomial representations of quantum $GL_n$ at a root of unity over a field of any characteristic.</description>

      <title>Tracial States and $\mathbb{G}$-Invariant States of Discrete Quantum Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.05176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tracial states and $\mathbb{G}$-invariant states on the reduced $C^*$-algebra $C_r(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ of a discrete quantum group $\mathbb{G}$. Here, we denote its dual compact quantum group by $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$. Our main result is that a state on $C_r(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ is tracial if and only if it is $\mathbb{G}$-invariant. This generalizes a known fact for unimodular discrete quantum groups and builds upon the work of Kalantar, Kasprzak, Skalski, and Vergnioux. As one consequence of this, we find that $C_r(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ is nuclear and admits a tracial state if and only if $\mathbb{G}$ is amenable. This resolves an open problem due to C.-K. Ng and Viselter, and Crann, in the discrete case. As another consequence, we prove that tracial states on $C_r(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ "concentrate" on $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_F$, where $\mathbb{G}_F$ is the cokernel of the Furstenberg boundary. Furthermore, given certain assumptions, we characterize the existence of traces on $C_r(\widehat{\mathbb{G}})$ in terms of whether or not $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_F$ is Kac type. We also characterize the uniqueness of (idempotent) traces in terms of whether not $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}_F$ is equal to the canonical Kac quotient of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$. These results rely on the following, of which we give proofs: So\l tan's canonical Kac quotient construction, whether it is applied to the universal or the reduced CQG $C^*$-algebra of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$ (when the latter admits a trace), yields the maximal Kac type closed quantum subgroup of $\widehat{\mathbb{G}}$.</description>

      <title>A proof of a conjecture of Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13526v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa's conjecture that the Witten-Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants are radial limits of homological blocks, which are $ q $-series introduced by them for plumbed $ 3 $-manifolds with negative definite linking matrices. In our previous work, the author attributed this conjecture to the holomorphy of certain rational functions by developing an asymptotic formula based on the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula. However, it is challenging to prove holomorphy for general plumbed manifolds. In this paper, we address this challenge using induction on a sequence of trees obtained by repeating "pruning trees."</description>

      <title>Semi-Chiral Operators in 4d ${\cal N}=1$ Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the properties of quarter-BPS local operators in four dimensional ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory using the formalism of holomorphic twists. We study loop corrections both to the space of local operators and to algebraic operations which endow the twisted theory with an infinite symmetry algebra. We classify all single-trace quarter-BPS operators in the planar approximation for $SU(N)$ gauge theory and propose a holographic dual description for the twisted theory. We classify perturbative quarter-BPS operators in $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ gauge theories with sufficiently small quantum numbers and discuss possible non-perturbative corrections to the answer. We set up analogous calculations for some theories with matter.</description>

      <title>Cyclic duality between BV algebras and BV modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if an operad is at the same time a cosimplicial object such that the respective structure maps are compatible with the operadic composition in a natural way, then one obtains a Gerstenhaber algebra structure on cohomology, and if the operad is cyclic, even that of a BV algebra. In particular, if a cyclic opposite module over an operad with multiplication is itself a cyclic operad that meets the cosimplicial compatibility conditions, the cohomology of its cyclic dual turns into a BV algebra. This amounts to conditions for when the cyclic dual of a BV module is endowed with a BV algebra structure, a result we exemplify by looking at classical and less classical (co)homology groups in Hopf algebra theory.</description>

      <title>On $F$-Polynomials for Generalized Quantum Cluster Algebras and Gupta's Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the polynomial property of $F$-polynomials for generalized quantum cluster algebras and obtain the associated separation formulas under a mild condition. Along the way, we obtain Gupta's formulas of $F$-polynomials for generalized quantum cluster algebras. These formulas specialize to Gupta's formulas for quantum cluster algebras and cluster algebras respectively. Finally, a generalization of Gupta's formula has also been discussed in the setting of generalized cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Assembly of Constructible Factorization Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a toolbox of extension, gluing, and assembly techniques for factorization algebras.
  Using these tools, we fill various gaps in the literature on factorization algebras on stratified manifolds, the main one being that constructible factorization algebras form a sheaf of symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories. Additionally, we explain how to assemble constructible factorization algebras from the data on the individual strata together with module structures associated to the relative links; thus answering a question by Ayala.
  Along the way, we give detailed proofs of the following facts which are also of independent interest: constructibility is a local condition; the $\infty$-category of disks is a localization of any sufficiently fine poset of disks; constructibility implies the Weiss condition on disks; constructible factorization algebras are algebras for the $\infty$-operad of embedded disks. For each of these, variants or special cases already existed, but they were either incomplete or not general enough.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and provide a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We demonstrate that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model with one rough boundary and one smooth boundary. We also discuss the generalization of the Hopf cluster state model to the Hopf ladder model through symmetry topological field theory. Furthermore, we introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra, which can be used to solve the Hopf cluster state model.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Self-Correcting Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in 2+1d. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in 5+1d with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We use a Peierls argument to demonstrate the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probablistic local cellular-automaton decoder.</description>

      <title>Representation Theory of Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solitons in two-dimensional quantum field theory exhibit patterns of degeneracies and associated selection rules on scattering amplitudes. We develop a representation theory that captures these intriguing features of solitons. This representation theory is based on an algebra we refer to as the "strip algebra", $\textrm{Str}_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathcal{M})$, which is defined in terms of the non-invertible symmetry, $\mathcal{C},$ a fusion category, and its action on boundary conditions encoded by a module category, $\mathcal{M}$. The strip algebra is a $C^*$-weak Hopf algebra, a fact which can be elegantly deduced by quantizing the three-dimensional Drinfeld center TQFT, $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}),$ on a spatial manifold with corners. These structures imply that the representation category of the strip algebra is also a unitary fusion category which we identify with a dual category $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^{*}.$ We present a straightforward method for analyzing these representations in terms of quiver diagrams where nodes are vacua and arrows are solitons and provide examples demonstrating how the representation theory reproduces known degeneracies and selection rules of soliton scattering. Our analysis provides the general framework for analyzing non-invertible symmetry on manifolds with boundary and applies both to the case of boundaries at infinity, relevant to particle physics, and boundaries at finite distance, relevant in conformal field theory or condensed matter systems.</description>
