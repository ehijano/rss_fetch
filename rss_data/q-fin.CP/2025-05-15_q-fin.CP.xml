      <title>FLUXLAYER: High-Performance Design for Cross-chain Fragmented Liquidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Market Makers (AMMs) rely on arbitrage to facilitate passive price updates. Liquidity fragmentation poses a complex challenge across different blockchain networks.
  This paper proposes FluxLayer, a solution to mitigate fragmented liquidity and capture the maximum extractable value (MEV) in a cross-chain environment. FluxLayer is a three-layer framework that integrates a settlement layer, an intent layer, and an under-collateralised leverage lending vault mechanism. Our evaluation demonstrates that FluxLayer can effectively enhance cross-chain MEV by capturing more arbitrage opportunities, reducing costs, and improving overall liquidity.</description>

      <title>Monte-Carlo Option Pricing in Quantum Parallel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial derivative pricing is a significant challenge in finance, involving the valuation of instruments like options based on underlying assets. While some cases have simple solutions, many require complex classical computational methods like Monte Carlo simulations and numerical techniques. However, as derivative complexities increase, these methods face limitations in computational power. Cases involving Non-Vanilla Basket pricing, American Options, and derivative portfolio risk analysis need extensive computations in higher-dimensional spaces, posing challenges for classical computers.
  Quantum computing presents a promising avenue by harnessing quantum superposition and entanglement, allowing the handling of high-dimensional spaces effectively. In this paper, we introduce a self-contained and all-encompassing quantum algorithm that operates without reliance on oracles or presumptions. More specifically, we develop an effective stochastic method for simulating exponentially many potential asset paths in quantum parallel, leading to a highly accurate final distribution of stock prices. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this algorithm can be extended to price more complex options and analyze risk within derivative portfolios.</description>

      <title>Fast Learning in Quantitative Finance with Extreme Learning Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that a broad class of problems in quantitative finance, including those previously addressed using deep neural networks, can be efficiently solved using single-layer neural networks without iterative gradient-based training, namely extreme learning machine (ELM). ELM utilizes a single-layer network with randomly initialized hidden nodes and analytically computed output weights obtained via convex optimization, enabling rapid training and inference. Both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks are explored.
  In supervised learning, ELM is employed to learn parametric option pricing functions, predict intraday stock returns, and complete implied volatility surfaces. Compared with deep neural networks, Gaussian process regression, and logistic regression, ELM achieves higher computational speed, comparable accuracy, and superior generalization.
  In unsupervised learning, ELM numerically solves Black-Scholes-type PDEs, and outperforms Physics-Informed Neural Networks in training speed without losing precision. The approximation and generalization abilities of ELM are briefly discussed.
  The findings establish ELM as a practical and efficient tool for various tasks in quantitative finance.</description>

      <title>Deep-MacroFin: Informed Equilibrium Neural Network for Continuous Time Economic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10368v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Deep-MacroFin, a comprehensive framework designed to solve partial differential equations, with a particular focus on models in continuous time economics. This framework leverages deep learning methodologies, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons and the newly developed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. It is optimized using economic information encapsulated by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and coupled algebraic equations. The application of neural networks holds the promise of accurately resolving high-dimensional problems with fewer computational demands and limitations compared to other numerical methods. This framework can be readily adapted for systems of partial differential equations in high dimensions. Importantly, it offers a more efficient (5$\times$ less CUDA memory and 40$\times$ fewer FLOPs in 100D problems) and user-friendly implementation than existing libraries. We also incorporate a time-stepping scheme to enhance training stability for nonlinear HJB equations, enabling the solution of 50D economic models.</description>
