      <title>Structural Limitations on Constraining the Time Evolution of Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological constraints on a time-varying dark energy equation of state are often interpreted as evidence for a dynamical dark energy. In this Letter, we show that such interpretations are fundamentally limited by the integral structure through which the equation of state enters cosmological observables. The mapping from \omega(z) to distances involves successive integrations, which act as an intrinsic low-pass filter in redshift space. As a result, only a small number of slowly varying modes of \omega(z) are observationally accessible, while rapid or localized temporal variations are irretrievably suppressed. This limitation is independent of any specific parametrization and represents a structural property of Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker cosmology with distance-based probes.</description>

      <title>FrankenStat I: a New Approach to Pulsar Timing Array Data Combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, after more than two decades of searching, pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations around the world announced evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. It was quickly followed by work from the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA), demonstrating that the results of regional collaborations were consistent with each other. The combination of these datasets is still ongoing and represents a significant investment of time and expertise.
  In that IPTA comparison, authors of this letter combined the separate datasets in the standard PTA optimal detection statistic for cross-correlations incoherently, that is, the data was combined without fitting a merged timing model across all PTA datasets, treating datasets of the same pulsar as independent, and neglecting the "same pulsar, different datasets" cross-correlations. This work refines that method by extending its core ideas beyond detection statistics and into a full, general data-combination method. We have demonstrated its efficacy and extreme efficiency on simulated data. This new method, \textit{FrankenStat}, is very similar in sensitivity and parameter-constraining power to traditional data combination methods while completing the full data combination in just a few minutes.</description>

      <title>Constraining Fifth Forces using the Local Distance Ladder: Implications for the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the local distance ladder measurement of the Hubble constant in models where gravity is modified by a fifth force, an additional long-range interaction. In many such theories the force is screened; suppressed in dense environments but potentially active in galaxies used for distance calibration. We model this environmental dependence using three quantities that characterize each galaxy's large-scale gravitational environment: the external gravitational potential $\Phi$, acceleration $a$, and curvature $K$. Our baseline analysis recalibrates the SH0ES-team's Cepheid-supernova distance ladder, incorporating the fifth force via its impact on the Cepheid period-luminosity relation. Across models, a fifth force is strongly constrained, with posteriors concentrated around a null result. The inferred Hubble constant is $H_0 = 73.1 \pm 1.0 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, retaining the Hubble tension at $&gt;5 \, \sigma$. As an additional test, we incorporate four independent Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance datasets into a joint Cepheid-TRGB-supernova calibration. These combined analyses further constrain the magnitude of fifth-force effects. Taken together, our results show that, across the class of screened fifth-force models we analyze, the calibration of the local distance ladder remains essentially unchanged, leaving the Hubble tension intact.</description>

      <title>BASILISK IV. No $S_8$ Tension with Satellite Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a novel technique to probe the $S_8$ tension, using information from the smallest scales of galaxy redshift survey data. Specifically, we use Basilisk, a Bayesian hierarchical tool for forward modeling the kinematics and abundance of satellite galaxies extracted from spectroscopic data, to first constrain the galaxy-halo connection precisely and accurately. We then demand self-consistency in that the galaxy-halo connection predicts the correct galaxy luminosity function, which constrains the halo mass function and thereby cosmology. Crucially, the method accounts for baryonic effects and is free of halo assembly bias issues. We validate the method against realistic SDSS-like mock data, demonstrating unbiased recovery of the input cosmology. Applying it to the SDSS-DR7, we infer that $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.324 \pm 0.012$, $\sigma_8 = 0.775 \pm 0.063$ and $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.81 \pm 0.05$, in perfect agreement with the cosmic microwave background constraints from Planck. The most stringent constraint is with regard to the parameter combination $\sigma_8 (\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3)^2$, which we infer to be $0.91 \pm 0.05$. Hence, unlike many low-redshift analyses of large-scale structure data, we find no indication of $S_8$ tension. We demonstrate that these results are robust to reasonable variation in the implementation of baryonification used to model the host halo's gravitational potentials in response to baryonic processes. We also highlight the importance of correctly modeling the satellite radial profile in any analysis involving small-scale information. Finally, we underscore the hidden potential of this methodology for constraining baryonic physics using data from ongoing and upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>BBNet: accurate neural network emulator for primordial light element abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) predictions of primordial light-element abundances offer a powerful probe of early-Universe physics. However, high-accuracy numerical BBN calculations have become a major computational bottleneck for large-scale cosmological inferences due to the complex nuclear network. Here we present BBNet, a fast and accurate deep learning emulator for primordial abundances. The training data are generated by full numerical calculations using two public BBN codes, PArthENoPE and AlterBBN, modified to accommodate extended cosmologies that include dark radiation and a stiff equation of state. The network employs a residual multi-head architecture to capture convoluted physical relationships. BBNet produces primordial helium-4 and deuterium abundances with negligible errors in milliseconds per sample, achieving a speed-up of up to $10^4$ times relative to first-principles solvers while remaining unbiased over wide parameter ranges. Therefore, our emulator can supersede traditional simplified numerical prescriptions that compromise accuracy for speed. Based on extensive assessments of its performance, we conclude that BBNet is an optimal solution to the theoretical prediction of primordial element abundances. It will serve as a reliable tool for precision cosmology and new-physics searches.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Dark Matter Constraints from NanoHertz Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15292v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) on the mergers of supermassive black holes (SMBH) and the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background. ULDM is based on exceptionally light particles and yields galactic halos with dense central solitons. This increases the drag experienced by binary SMBH, decreasing merger times and potentially suppressing gravitational radiation from the binary at low frequencies. We develop semi-analytic models for the decay of SMBH binaries in ULDM halos and use current pulsar timing array (PTA) measurements to constrain the ULDM particle mass and its fractional contribution to the dark matter content of the universe. We find a median ULDM particle mass of $7. \times 10^{-22}$ eV and show that scaling relations suggest that the drag remains effective at relatively low ULDM fractions, which are consistent with all other constraints on the model. Consequently, future pulsar timing measurements will be a sensitive probe of any ULDM contribution to the overall dark matter content of the universe.</description>

      <title>Beyond Stage IV: Quasar and Galaxy Clustering and the Fundamental Physics of the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stage IV galaxy surveys (DESI, 4MOST, MOONS, Euclid) are establishing precision constraints on cosmological parameters through baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions, yet fundamental questions on neutrino masses, inflationary physics, and the nature of gravity remain beyond their reach. We present a science case for next-generation wide-field spectroscopic surveys targeting $1 &lt; z &lt; 6$ with simultaneous observations of thousands of galaxies, quasars, and emission-line galaxies. Such surveys would deliver transformative advances: (i) cosmological constraints on absolute neutrino masses ($\Sigma m_\nu \lesssim 0.015\,\mathrm{eV}$), three times more stringent than Stage IV, enabling resolution of the neutrino mass hierarchy; (ii) detection of primordial non-Gaussianity at the level of $f_{\mathrm{NL}} \sim 1$, probing multi-field inflation; (iii) measurements of structure growth $f\sigma_8(z)$ spanning cosmic time to constrain dark energy and test gravitational modifications. Achieving these goals requires revolutionary advances in spectroscopic multiplexing ($\mathcal{O}(1000)$ simultaneous spectra), sub-$2\times10^{-4}(1+z)$ redshift precision at scale, and field-level inference techniques exploiting higher-order clustering statistics. We demonstrate that the proposed Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope concept provides a technically feasible and scientifically compelling path to unlock the physics of neutrinos, inflation, and gravity that will remain inaccessible to Stage IV surveys.</description>

      <title>First measurement of the Hubble constant from gravitational wave-galaxy cross-correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure for the first time the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from the cross-correlation of galaxies and gravitational waves (GW), by applying the $\textit{Peak Sirens}$ method. This method consists of finding the peak of the 3D angular cross-spectrum $C_{\ell}(z,D_L)$ between the galaxy redshifts ($z$) and the GW luminosity distances ($D_L$). Using two GW events from the GWTC-3.0 catalog and the GLADE+ galaxy catalog, we make the first detection of the cross-correlation peak at $5.9\sigma$ confidence. This signal comes mostly from the best localized event in the catalog, GW190814, which alone provides a $3.4\sigma$ significance. Adding also the multimessenger event GW170817, but without using its known redshift, we find $H_0 = 67^{+18}_{-15}$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ and the first observational constraint on the GW bias, $b_{\rm gw} &lt; 4.3$ at 95% CI. These measurements set the stage for future novel cosmological constraints with this technique.</description>

      <title>Comparing cosmic shear nulling methods for Stage-IV surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis comparing nulling strategies for reducing the impact of baryon feedback on cosmic shear measurements. We consider three different approaches which aim to `null' the high-$k$ modes using transformations applied to the data vector: the Bernardeau-Nishimichi-Taruya (BNT) transform which operates on the lensing field, a new implementation of an LU factorisation of the discretized Limber integral (LUnul) which operates on the lensing two-point statistics, and finally a method which uses a correlated LSS tracers to suppress contributions from lower redshifts (cross-correlation). We compare these methods to un-nulled (or standard) cosmic shear at the data vector level and assess whether these methods are able to reduce the bias on cosmological constraints using a Fisher forecast. We find that the nulling techniques considered can have a large impact on reducing the bias on $S_8$ and Dark Energy parameters. The cross-correlation method is effective at reducing biases in $S_8$, but requires additional information from galaxy clustering. The LUnul method is the most aggressive of the methods and hence reduces biases most efficiently as $k_{\rm max}$ is increased, although this improvement in accuracy comes at the cost of precision. The BNT approach preserves more information than LUnul, and has a more rigorous theoretical grounding. We demonstrate that all three of these methods are effective at mitigating bias, and can be readily applied in forthcoming lensing analyses.</description>

      <title>The art of simulating the early Universe. Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a discussion on lattice techniques for the simulation of non-canonical field theory circumstances, complementing our previous monograph (arXiv:2006.15122) on canonical cases. We begin by reviewing basic aspects of lattice field theory, including symplectic and non-symplectic evolution algorithms. We then introduce lattice implementations of non-canonical interactions, considering scalars with a non-minimal coupling to gravity, $\phi^2R$, non-minimal scalar kinetic theories, $\mathcal{G}_{ab}(\lbrace\phi_c\rbrace)\partial_\mu\phi^a\partial^\mu\phi^b$, and axion-like particle (ALP) interactions with Abelian gauge fields, $\phi F_{\mu\nu}\tilde F^{\mu\nu}$. Next, we discuss methods to set up special field configurations, including the creation of cosmic defect networks towards scaling (e.g. cosmic strings and domain walls), field configurations based on arbitrary power spectra or spatial profiles, and probabilistic methods as required e.g. for thermal configurations. We further extend the notion of non-canonical theories, discussing the discretization of scalar field dynamics in $d + 1$ dimensions, with $d \neq 3$. Unrelated to non-canonical aspects, we also discuss implementation(s) of gravitational wave (GW) dynamics on the lattice. This document represents the theoretical basis for the non-canonical field theory aspects (interactions, initial conditions, dimensionality) and GW dynamics implemented in ${\mathcal C}$osmo${\mathcal L}$attice v2.0, to be released in 2026.</description>

      <title>Note on bulk viscosity as an alternative to dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk viscosity, which characterizes the irreversible dissipative resistance of a fluid to volume changes, has been proposed as a potential mechanism for explaining both early- and late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. In this work, we investigate two distinct physical scenarios for the origin of bulk viscosity: (1) nonminimal interactions between two fluids, and (2) elastic collisions in an ideal gas. In both cases, we demonstrate that while the associated energy-momentum exchange can significantly influence fluid dynamics, overall energy-momentum conservation precludes such exchange from having any direct gravitational effect in the context of General Relativity. In case (1), we show that the standard bulk viscous energy-momentum tensor can be obtained for the two-fluid system only at the cost of the violation of all classical energy conditions: null, weak, dominant, and strong. In case (2), we consider a single fluid composed of point particles undergoing instantaneous, energy- and momentum-conserving collisions, and find that the proper pressure remains strictly non-negative, with the equation-of-state parameter confined to the interval $[0,1/3]$. In both scenarios, achieving a sufficiently negative effective pressure to drive cosmic acceleration requires assumptions that compromise the physical viability of the model. Our results highlight some of the key physical challenges involved in modeling dark energy through bulk viscous effects.</description>

      <title>Why the Northern Hemisphere Needs a 30-40 m Telescope and the Science at Stake: A Low Surface Brightness Science Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Extragalactic Low Surface Brightness (LSB, $\mu_V\gtrsim 27$ mag/arcsec$^2$) Universe represents a crucial, yet largely unseen, frontier in modern astrophysics. This faint realm holds the keys to completing our understanding of galaxy evolution, hierarchical assembly, and even the fundamental nature of dark matter. Our current theoretical models are inherently incomplete, largely mirroring the properties of the brightest, most easily observed objects. To overcome this critical bias and unlock the secrets of this realm, a transformative leap in observational capability is required. A 30 to 40m class telescope, leveraging unprecedented sensitivity and spatial resolution, especially with adaptive optics, is the essential tool to fundamentally probe these faint, low-density stellar regimes. This white paper details the transformative LSB science that such a facility, strategically positioned in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) to access crucial nearby structures and rich environments, can achieve.</description>

      <title>Void Galaxies and AGN Activity in ZOBOV-identified TNG300 Voids Out to z=3.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study void galaxies in the TNG300 simulation between redshifts $z=3$ and $z=0$. Cosmic void catalogs were constructed using a watershed-based void-finding algorithm, and we define four populations of field galaxies for our investigation: [1] galaxies that are members of a watershed void, [2] galaxies that are located within a radius $r \leq 0.8 R_{\rm eff}$ of the center of a void, [3] galaxies interior to spheres centered on void centers that have underdensity contrasts $&lt;-0.8$, and [4] non-void galaxies. We show that population statistics on void galaxy properties can be recovered from watershed-based void catalogs. Differences between galaxy populations are most pronounced interior to the shell-crossing surface (i.e., population [3]) where densities are intermediate to high. Compared to non-void galaxies at all redshifts, the density controlled galaxies are bluer, smaller, more actively star forming, more massive, and less metal enriched. At redshifts $\geq 1$, these differences are less apparent, likely caused by resolution and selection effects incurred by attempting to define a density-controlled sample from a watershed-based void finding algorithm. Further, we investigate the fraction of galaxies with Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and find that our density controlled population has AGN fractions that are significantly higher than those of non-void galaxy population ($79.8 \pm 0.4$\% higher at $z=0.0$ and $61.5\pm 0.7$\% higher at larger redshifts).</description>

      <title>Non-Thermal Production of Sexaquark Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard thermal freeze-out scenarios with QCD-scale interaction rates predict a $uuddss$ sexaquark relic abundance many orders of magnitude below the observed dark matter density, representing a key challenge for sexaquark dark matter models. Additionally, if the maximum post-inflationary temperature never exceeds the QCD confinement scale, the usual thermal/chemical-equilibrium production of the sexaquark near ${T \sim T_{\rm QCD} \simeq 150 \text{-} 170~\mathrm{MeV}}$ never occurs. In this work we show that non-thermal mechanisms can naturally overcome this obstacle. Using late-decaying reheatons as a representative case (while noting the broader applicability), we demonstrate that the final abundance is determined by two quantities: the branching fraction into strange-quark-rich matter and the coalescence probability into sexaquarks during the matter-dominated or early radiation-dominated epoch. We provide compact expressions and benchmark calculations for reheating temperatures $T_R \in [10, 100]~\mathrm{MeV}$ and reheaton masses above the QCD confinement scale. Unlike the predictive but unsuccessful thermal scenario, non-thermal production is sensitive to injection microphysics, coalescence efficiency, and residual entropy dilution. We delineate the viable parameter space, evaluate collider and precision constraints on representative reheaton models, and derive indirect detection bounds on residual antisexaquark populations. Our results establish non-thermal production as a viable pathway to sexaquark dark matter and highlight broader implications for non-equilibrium mechanisms in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Skykatana: a scalable framework to construct sky masks for the Vera Rubin Observatory and large astronomical surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern wide-field surveys require robust spatial masks to excise bright-star halos, bleed trails, poor-quality regions, and user-defined geometry at scale. We present Skykatana, an open source pipeline that builds and combines boolean HEALPix/HEALSparse maps into science-ready masks and engineered for low-memory operation. Skykatana can efficiently construct, visualize multi-order coverage maps and generate random points in high-resolution masks over half of the celestial sphere with very limited resources and leveraging the hierarchical partition of data the HATS/LSDB framework. We demonstrate two end-to-end applications: (1) a Subaru HSC-WISE composite mask; and (2) Rubin star masks generated on demand in the Rubin Science Platform by querying HATS/LSDB Gaia data and assigning radii from empirical fits to Rubin DP1 data. We release full bright-star masks for various regions of the Rubin footprint and describe performance and scaling. The code, documentation, and examples are publicly available at https://github.com/samotracio/skykatana, and the LSST masks can be obtained from https://osf.io/r5vw6</description>

      <title>A Very Rich Bimodal Galaxy Cluster Merger: RXC J0032.1+1808</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The galaxy cluster RXC J0032.1+1808 has been well-studied with optical imaging and gravitational lensing mass maps, both of which reveal an elongated morphology in the north-south direction. We find that its X-ray morphology is bimodal, suggesting that it is in the process of merging; combined with a previously reported detection of a radio relic, we suggest that the system is seen after first pericenter. We extract the global X-ray temperature and unabsorbed luminosity from archival XMM-Newton data, finding $T_X=8.5^{+1.1}_{-0.9}$ keV and $L_X=1.04 \pm 0.03 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 90\% confidence in the $0.5$--$10.0$ keV energy range. We conduct a redshift survey of member galaxies and find that the line-of-sight relative velocity between the two subclusters is $76\pm364$ km/s. We use publicly available hydrodynamic simulations to show that it cannot be a head-on merger, that it is observed ${\approx}395$--560 Myr after pericenter, and that the viewing angle must be one that foreshortens the apparent subcluster separation by a factor ${\approx}2$.</description>

      <title>Strong lensing cosmography using binary-black-hole mergers: Prospects for the near future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A small fraction of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binary black holes (BBHs) will be gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies and galaxy clusters. Strong lensing will produce multiple identical copies of the GW signal arriving at different times. Jana et al.~\cite{Jana_2023} recently proposed a method to constrain cosmological parameters using strongly lensed GW events detected by next-generation (XG) detectors. The idea is that the number of strongly lensed GW events and the distribution of their lensing time delays encode imprints of the cosmological parameters. From the observed number of lensed GW events (tens of thousands) and their time delay distribution, this method can provide a new probe of cosmology, obtaining information at intermediate redshifts. In this work, we explore the possibility of doing lensing cosmography using upcoming observations of the upgraded LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. This requires incorporating the detector network selection effects in the analysis, which was neglected earlier. We expect dozens of lensed GW events to be detected by upgraded LVK detectors, potentially enabling modest constraints on cosmological parameters. Even with relatively modest numbers of lensed detections, we demonstrate the potential of lensing cosmography. For XG detectors, our revised forecasts are consistent with with the earlier forecasts that neglected the selection effects.</description>

      <title>Spin-filament alignments to unravel galaxy evolution and model intrinsic alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By the 2040s, several all-sky surveys will have transformed our view of the large-scale structure. However, one of the major outstanding questions in astrophysics will remain: understanding how galaxies acquire and evolve their angular momentum and how this connects to the cosmic web. Measuring the alignments between galaxy spins and cosmic filaments across cosmic time, and understanding what this reveals about galaxy evolution, requires surveys that also characterise intrinsic alignments, i.e. correlations in galaxy shapes produced by the cosmic web itself rather than by lensing. Intrinsic alignments are a major source of systematic error in weak-lensing measurements of the fundamental parameters of the Universe. Addressing both questions together will necessitate new types of MOS surveys that combine kinematic information with high-completeness redshifts down to at least 24-25mag. To achieve our science goals, we require a new generation of wide-field spectroscopic facilities that can obtain spin-filament alignment measurements for millions of galaxies while simultaneously delivering sub-Mpc resolution of the cosmic web and spatially-resolved kinematics required to map the spin-filament connection at the level of individual galaxies within their local cosmic environment. Such a program would provide a unique legacy survey of galaxies and cosmic structures from kiloparsec to megaparsec scales, establishing ESO's leadership in bridging the physics of galaxy evolution with the systematic-control requirements for Stage-IV cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Towards ALMA2040: An update from the European community and invitation to contribute</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last 15 years, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionized astrophysics by providing unprecedented resolution and sensitivity in observing the cold universe, including the formation of stars, planets, and galaxies. With groundbreaking discoveries ranging from the first detailed images of protoplanetary disks to the kinematics of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization, ALMA has showcased the vast discovery potential of the (sub-)mm wavelength regime. However, in another 15 years from now--in the 2040s--the science landscape will have changed dramatically as new major observational facilities will have started their operations or have come towards advanced maturity in their scientific outcome (e.g., JWST, Rubin Observatory, ELT, Euclid, Gaia, Plato, Ariel, Roman Space Telescope, SPHEREx, LiteBIRD, LISA, SKA and others). At the same time, ALMA's current Wideband Sensitivity Upgrade will have been in place for ~10 years, and ALMA itself will have been operational for 30 years. To fully exploit this era, the community needs a next-generation facility operating at (sub-)mm wavelengths with capabilities far beyond those possible within ALMA's current infrastructure.
  To this end, ALMA2040 is a community-driven initiative to define the key scientific questions of the 2040s and translate them into a technical vision for a next-generation transformational (sub-)millimeter facility. Our goal with this document is to summarize the current status of the effort, synthesize outcomes from the 2025 workshops, outline next steps toward a reference design concept, and invite broad participation from the global mm/sub-mm community to help shape this future facility.
  In the following we provide details on the process and scope. We invite everyone who wishes to join the effort and/or contribute to the dedicated White Papers planned for 2026.</description>

      <title>The longest known tails of ram-pressure stripped star-forming galaxies are caused by an ICM shock in Abell 1367</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The environment plays an important role in shaping the evolution of cluster galaxies through mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping (RPS), whose effect may be enhanced in merging clusters. We investigate a complex of three galaxies UGC 6697, CGCG 097-073 and CGCG 097-079, that are currently undergoing extreme RPS, as evident from their multi-wavelength-detected tails. The galaxies are members of the nearby ($d=92$ Mpc) merging cluster Abell 1367 and are located in proximity to an intracluster medium (ICM) shock that is traced by X-ray observations and the presence of a radio relic. We analyze LOFAR and MeerKAT observations at frequencies of 54, 144, 817 and 1270 MHz to perform a detailed spectral analysis of the tails. We find that all three tails are significantly more extended than in previous radio studies, with lengths $\geq70$ kpc. For UGC 6697, we detected a tail of 300 kpc, making it the longest known RPS tail of a star-forming galaxy at any wavelength. The length and spectral variations of the tail cannot be explained purely by the spectral aging of stripped cosmic rays. We construct a model of the tail that includes compression and re-acceleration due to the encounter with the nearby ICM shock, which can plausibly account for the extreme RPS as well as the length and spectral variation of the tail. We further discover a radio plume at the leading edge of UGC 6697 that connects to a narrow filament. These sources exhibit extremely steep ($\alpha\approx-1.7$) and highly curved spectra. We speculate that this emission arises from cosmic rays re-energized by UGC 6697's rapid infall which propagate along magnetic filaments in the cluster center. Our findings represent direct evidence of a cluster merger shock impacting the evolution of member galaxies. Furthermore, we report the first tentative detection of particle acceleration at the leading edge of an infalling galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is currently no rigorous definition of gravitational wave strain at second order in cosmological perturbation theory. The usual association of gravitational waves with transverse and traceless fluctuations of the metric on spatial hypersurfaces becomes ambiguous at second order, as it inherently depends on the spacetime slicing. While this poses no practical issues in linearized gravity, it presents a fundamental problem for secondary gravitational waves, especially notorious for gravitational waves induced by primordial fluctuations. We compute, for the first time, the physical effects of gravitational waves at second order, as measured by geodesic observers that emit and receive electromagnetic signals, thereby settling the debate on gauge ambiguities. We find that the measured gravitational wave strain coincides with the transverse-traceless components in the Newton gauge.</description>

      <title>Signatures of inhomogeneous dark matter annihilation on 21-cm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The energy released from dark matter (DM) annihilation leads to additional ionization and heating of the intergalactic gas, impacting the hydrogen 21-cm signal during the cosmic dawn. The dark matter annihilation rate scales with its density squared and becomes inhomogeneously boosted with structure formation. This paper examines the inhomogeneity in DM annihilation rate induced by the growth of DM halo structures, and we show that this effect can significantly amplify the spatial fluctuations in temperature and ionization fraction of the gas. Consequently, the fluctuations in the 21-cm brightness temperature may also be enhanced. We showcase these effects for a DM mass of 100 MeV annihilating into $\rm{e}^-\rm{e}^+$ at a rate of $\left&lt;\sigma v\right&gt;/m_\chi \sim 10^{-27} {\rm cm^3 s^{-1} GeV^{-1}}$, which is consistent with current constraints set by the cosmic microwave background. We find that, compared to the homogeneous calculations, inhomogeneous annihilation can enhance the 21-cm power spectrum by up to a factor of 130 over the scales of $k \in [0.05, 3]\ {\rm{Mpc^{-1}}}$ at redshifts $11-16$. Such signatures could potentially be detected by upcoming radio observatories such as the Square Kilometer Array telescope.</description>

      <title>A halo model approach for mock catalogs of time-variable strong gravitational lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07509v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time delays in both galaxy- and cluster-scale strong gravitational lenses have recently attracted a lot of attention in the context of the Hubble tension. Future wide-field cadenced surveys, such as the LSST, are anticipated to discover strong lenses across various scales. We generate mock catalogs of strongly lensed QSOs and SNe on galaxy-, group-, and cluster-scales based on a halo model that incorporates dark matter halos, galaxies, and subhalos. For the upcoming LSST survey, we predict that approximately 4000 lensed QSOs and 200 lensed SNe with resolved multiple images will be discovered. Among these, about 80 lensed QSOs and 10 lensed SNe will have maximum image separations larger than 10 arcsec, which roughly correspond to cluster-scale strong lensing. We find that adopting the Chabrier stellar IMF instead of the fiducial Salpeter IMF reduces the predicted number of strong lenses approximately by half, while the distributions of lens and source redshifts and image separations are not significantly changed. In addition to mock catalogs of multiple-image lens systems, we create mock catalogs of highly magnified systems, including both multiple-image and single-image systems. We find that such highly magnified systems are typically produced by massive galaxies, but non-negligible fraction of them are located in the outskirt of galaxy groups and clusters. Furthermore, we compare subsamples of our mock catalogs with lensed QSO samples constructed from the SDSS and Gaia to find that our mock catalogs with the fiducial Salpeter IMF reproduce the observation quite well. In contrast, our mock catalogs with the Chabrier IMF predict a significantly smaller number of lensed QSOs compared with observations, which adds evidence that the stellar IMF of massive galaxies is Salpeter-like. Our python code SL-Hammocks as well as the mock catalogs are made available online. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Stronger Constraints on Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Derived from the Thermal Evolution of the Intergalactic Medium over the Last Twelve Billion Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) have been explored as potential dark matter candidates, with various astrophysical observations placing upper limits on the fraction $f_\mathrm{PBH}$ of dark matter in the form of PBHs. However, a largely underutilized probe of PBH abundance is the temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM), inferred from the thermal broadening of absorption lines in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of quasar spectra. PBHs inject energy into the IGM via Hawking radiation, altering its thermal evolution. In this work, we constrain this energy injection by self-consistently modeling its interplay with the cosmological ultraviolet background from galaxies and supermassive black holes. Leveraging IGM temperature measurements spanning the past twelve billion years ($z \sim 0$ to $6$), we derive one of the most stringent constraints on PBH-induced heating from light PBHs within the mass range $10^{15}$-$10^{17}$ g. Specifically, for $M_\mathrm{PBH} = 10^{16}$ g, we find $f_\mathrm{PBH} &lt; 5 \times 10^{-5}$ at 95\% confidence, with the bound scaling approximately as $M_\mathrm{PBH}^{4}$ at other masses. Our inclusion of helium reionization and low-redshift temperature measurements strengthens previous IGM-based PBH constraints by an order of magnitude or more. Compared to other existing limits, our result is among the strongest, second only to the constraints from the 511 keV line from the Galactic Center, but with distinct systematics. More broadly, this study highlights the IGM thermal history as a powerful and independent probe of beyond-standard model physics.</description>

      <title>The Properties of Little Red Dot Galaxies in the ASTRID Simulation</title>

Abstract: We present simulated counterparts of the ``Little Red Dot'' (LRD) galaxies observed with JWST, using the large cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, ASTRID. We create mock observations of the galaxies ($5 \leq z \leq 8$) in ASTRID, and find seventeen which fit the color and size criteria of LRDs. These LRDs are galaxies with high stellar masses ($\rm log(M_*/M_{\odot}) \geq 9.7$), and massive black holes ($\rm log(M_{BH}/M_{\odot}) \geq 6.8$). The host galaxies are dense, with stellar half mass radii ($\rm 325\,pc \leq r_{{\rm half},*} \leq 620\,pc$), and dust attenuation in the F444W band above 1.25. Their star formation has been recently quenched. They host relatively bright AGN that are dust-obscured and contribute significantly to the rest-frame optical red slope and have relatively low luminosity in the rest-frame ultraviolet, where the host galaxy's stars are more dominant. These LRDs are in an evolutionary phase of miniquenching that is the result of AGN feedback from their massive black holes. The LRDs in ASTRID are bright with F444W magnitudes of $23.5-25.5$. The less massive and fainter galaxies in ASTRID lack the dust concentration necessary to produce the red slope of an LRD, though this could be an effect of limited resolution. Most of the highest Eddington black holes are not LRDs due to insufficient dust attenuation from their host galaxies, which are also experiencing relatively high star formation rates. This results in their spectra being too flat, despite their highly accreting black holes.</description>

      <title>Probing Generalized Emergent Dark Energy with DESI DR2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As an update on the initial findings of DESI, the new results provide the first hint of potential deviations from a cosmological constant ($\omega=-1$), which, if confirmed with significance $&gt;(2-4)\sigma$, would challenge the validity of $\Lambda$ within the $\Lambda$CDM model. We explore the Generalized Emergent Dark Energy (GEDE) model using recent BAO measurements from DESI DR2, Type Ia supernova compilations, and CMB distance priors. Employing nested sampling, we constrain the parameter $\Delta$, which characterizes deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Our analysis shows that with CMB+DESI DR2 alone, GEDE tends to prefer positive values of $\Delta$. However, when different SNe Ia calibrations are included, the model favors negative values of $\Delta$, corresponding to an earlier injection of dark energy. The Marginalized constraints on $\omega(z)$ further shows that GEDE sharply emerges but then asymptotes to $\omega=-1$ without crossing it. At $z \sim 1$ data, GEDE provides a better fit than $\Lambda$CDM, while at $z \lesssim 0.5$ the data favor $\omega &gt; -1$, bringing the model deviate from $\Lambda$CDM. Bayesian model comparison shows weak support for GEDE with CMB+DESI DR2 ($\ln BF=1.96$), moderate with PP ($\ln BF=2.65$), weak-to-moderate with Union3 ($\ln BF=2.34$), and weak with DES-SN5Y ($\ln BF=1.44$). Overall, GEDE is consistent with current data and mildly favored when SNe Ia are included, making it a viable extension of $\Lambda$CDM that merits further investigation with future high precision measurements.</description>

      <title>Measuring neutrino masses with joint JWST and DESI DR2 data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early JWST observations reveal an unexpectedly abundant population of high-redshift candidate massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 7$, and recent DESI measurements show a preference for dynamical dark energy, which together present a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In this work, we jointly analyze high-redshift galaxy data from JWST, baryon acoustic oscillations data from DESI DR2, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and ACT, measuring the total neutrino mass $\sum m_{\nu}$. We consider three dark energy models ($\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0w_a$CDM) and three mass hierarchies. Our results indicate that in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, adding JWST data to CMB+DESI tightens the upper limit of $\sum m_{\nu}$ by about $5.8\%-10.2\%$, and we obtain $\sum m_{\nu} &lt; 0.167~\mathrm{eV}$ ($2\sigma$) in the normal hierarchy (NH) case. Furthermore, JWST also offers indicative lower limits on star formation efficiency parameter of $f_{*,10} \gtrsim 0.146-0.161$. Bayesian evidence weakly favors the $w_0w_a$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model relative to the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$(NH) model using CMB+DESI+JWST data. These results suggest that the joint analysis of high-redshift JWST data and low-redshift DESI data provides compelling constraints on neutrino mass and merits further investigation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of 21 cm HI signal: detection prospects at z ~ 1 with uGMRT in galaxy cluster lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00813v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atomic hydrogen HI content of galaxies is intimately related to star formation and galaxy evolution through the baryon cycle, which involves processes such as accretion, feedback, outflows, and gas recycling. While probing the HI gas over cosmic time has improved our understanding, direct HI detection with the redshifted 21 cm line is essentially limited to $z\lesssim 0.42$. Detections beyond this redshift are based on stacking to obtain average HI mass of galaxy populations. Gravitational lensing by the cluster lenses enhances the HI signal and can extend the redshift limit further. In this work, we describe simulations of HI lensing in cluster lenses. We explore the feasibility of detecting strongly lensed HI emission from background galaxies using known $50$ cluster lenses within the uGMRT sky coverage. We demonstrate that certain clusters offer a strong likelihood of HI detection. We also investigate how strong lensing distorts the HI spectral lines. The shape of the HI signal in these lensing models provides useful information and can be used in optimising signal extraction in blind and targeted HI surveys. We find that blind detection of HI signal from galaxies in the redshift range up to $1.58$ requires more than a few hundred hours of observations of individual clusters with the uGMRT. Detecting HI emission in galaxies with strong optical lensing seems promising, with a $5\sigma$ detection potential in less than 50 hours for Abell 370 and 75 hours for Abell 1703 using the uGMRT.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings Gravitational Wave Probe of Leptogenesis: Thermal, Non-thermal, Near-resonant and Flavourful</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breaking a global or local $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ symmetry at high scales simultaneously generates Majorana masses for heavy right-handed neutrinos and produces a network of cosmic strings. The evolution and decay of these strings source a stochastic gravitational-wave background that may be probed by current and future gravitational-wave experiments, while the decays of the resulting massive right-handed neutrinos can generate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe via leptogenesis. We derive analytical bounds for successful leptogenesis with a global and a local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, separately finding an absolute lower bound on the lightest right-handed neutrino mass $M_1 &gt; 1.74 \times 10^{8}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for thermal initial conditions and $M_1 &gt; \mathcal{O}(10^{6})\,\mathrm{GeV}$ for non-thermal initial conditions. Allowing for near-resonant leptogenesis relaxes these bounds to TeV scale in both cases making it a viable target at collider searches complementing the GW signals. Full flavour effects are included, and crucially, we determine the region where successful leptogenesis can be probed through gravitational-wave observations in upcoming experiments such as LISA and Einstein Telescope. Importantly, we find that flavour effects rescue regions of the parameter space that are ruled out due to current CMB or gravitational wave measurements.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the effects of torsion of space-time in the expansion of the Universe as a candidate to dark energy. The analysis is done by reconstructing the torsion function along cosmic evolution by using observational data of Supernovae type Ia, Hubble parameter {and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation} measurements. We have used a kinematic model for the parameterization of the comoving distance and the Hubble parameter, then the free parameters of the models are constrained by observational data. The reconstruction of the torsion function is obtained directly from the data, using the kinematic parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Large neutrino asymmetry from forbidden decay of dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM), in spite of being stable or long-lived on cosmological scales, can decay in the early Universe due to finite-temperature effects. In particular, a first order phase transition (FOPT) in the early Universe can provide a finite window for such decay, guaranteeing DM stability at lower temperatures, consistent with observations. The FOPT can lead to the generation of stochastic gravitational waves (GW) with peak frequencies correlated with DM mass. On the other hand, early DM decay into neutrinos can create a large neutrino asymmetry which can have interesting cosmological consequences in terms of enhanced effective relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\rm eff}$, providing a solution to the recently observed Helium anomaly among others. Allowing DM decay to occur below sphaleron decoupling temperature, thereby avoiding overproduction of baryon asymmetry, forces the FOPT to occur at sub-electroweak scale. This leaves the stochastic GW within range of experiments like LISA, $\mu$ARES, NANOGrav etc.</description>

      <title>WIMP Dark Matter Search using a 3.1 Tonne-Year Exposure of the XENONnT Experiment</title>

Abstract: We report on a search for weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM) via elastic DM-xenon-nucleus interactions in the XENONnT experiment. We combine datasets from the first and second science campaigns resulting in a total exposure of 3.1 tonne-years. In a blind analysis of nuclear recoil events with energies above $3.8\,\mathrm{keV_{NR}}$, we find no significant excess above background. We set new upper limits on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section for WIMP masses above $10\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ with a minimum of $1.7\,\times\,10^{-47}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ at $90\,\%$ confidence level for a WIMP mass of $30\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$. We achieve a best median sensitivity of $1.4\,\times\,10^{-47}\,\mathrm{cm^2}$ for a $41\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ WIMP. Compared to the result from the first XENONnT science dataset, we improve our sensitivity by a factor of up to 1.8.</description>

      <title>Detecting Ultralight Dark Matter with Matter Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight particles, with a mass below the electronvolt scale, exhibit wave-like behavior and have arisen as a compelling dark matter candidate. A particularly intriguing subclass is scalar dark matter, which induces variations in fundamental physical constants. However, detecting such particles becomes highly challenging in the mass range above $10^{-6}\,\text{eV}$, as traditional experiments face severe limitations in response time. In contrast, the matter effect becomes significant in a vast and unexplored parameter space. These effects include (i) a force arising from scattering between ordinary matter and the dark matter wind and (ii) a fifth force between ordinary matter induced by the dark matter background. Using the repulsive quadratic scalar-photon interaction as a case study, we develop a unified framework based on quantum mechanical scattering theory to systematically investigate these phenomena across both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. Our approach not only reproduces prior results obtained through other methodologies but also covers novel regimes with nontrivial features, such as decoherence effects, screening effects, and their combinations. In particular, we highlight one finding related to both scattering and background-induced forces: the descreening effect observed in the non-perturbative region with large incident momentum, which alleviates the decoherence suppression. Furthermore, we discuss current and proposed experiments, including inverse-square-law tests, equivalence principle tests, and deep-space acceleration measurements. Notably, we go beyond the spherical approximation and revisit the MICROSCOPE constraint on the background-induced force in the large-momentum regime, where the decoherence and screening effects interplay. The ultraviolet models realizing the quadratic scalar-photon interaction are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Cosmological effect of coherent oscillation of ultralight scalar fields in a multicomponent universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea that coherent oscillations of a scalar field, oscillating over a time period that is much shorter than the cosmological timescale, can exhibit cold dark matter (CDM) like behavior was previously established. In our work we first show that this equivalence between the oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector is exact only in a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime in the absence of cosmological constant and any other possible matter components in the universe when the mass of the scalar field is very large compared to the Hubble parameter. Then we show how to generalize the equivalence between the coherently oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector in a spatially curved universe with multiple matter components. Using our general method, we will show how a coherently oscillating scalar field model can represent the CDM sector in the presence of non-minimal coupling of the CDM sector with radiation. Our method is powerful enough to work out the dynamics of gravitational collapse in a closed FLRW spacetime where the coherently oscillating scalar field model represents the CDM sector. We have, for the first time, presented a consistent method which specifies how a coherently oscillating scalar field model, where the scalar field is ultralight, acts like the CDM sector in a multicomponent universe.</description>

      <title>Nambu-Goldstone boson phenomenology in Domain-Wall Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Domain-Wall Standard Model (DWSM), a five-dimensional framework in which all Standard Model (SM) particles are localized on a domain wall embedded in a non-compact extra spatial dimension. A distinctive feature of this setup is the emergence of a Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson, arising from the spontaneous breaking of translational invariance in the extra dimension due to the localization of SM chiral fermions. This NG boson couples via Yukawa interactions to SM fermions and their Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitations. We study the phenomenology of this NG boson and derive constraints from astrophysical processes (supernova cooling), Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and collider searches for KK-mode fermions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The strongest limits arise from LHC data: we reinterpret existing mass bounds on squarks and sleptons in simplified supersymmetric models (assuming a massless lightest neutralino), as well as limits on exotic hadrons containing long-lived squarks or long-lived charged sleptons in the regime of extremely small Yukawa couplings. From this analysis, we obtain a conservative lower bound of 1 TeV on the masses of KK-mode quarks and charged leptons. Finally, we discuss the prospects for producing KK-mode fermions at future high-energy lepton colliders and outline strategies to distinguish their signatures from those of sfermions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Schwarzschild solutions in $f(R)$ gravity and their observable effects on the photon sphere of black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00702v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate asymptotic Schwarzschild exterior solutions in the context of modified gravity theories, specifically within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, where the asymptotic behavior recovers the standard Schwarzschild solution of General Relativity. Unlike previous studies that rely mainly on analytical approximations, our approach combines asymptotic analysis with numerical integration of the underlying differential equations. Using these solutions, we analyze strong lensing effects to obtain the photon sphere radius and the corresponding capture parameter. Considering rings produced by total reflection, we define the photon sphere width as the difference between the first total reflection and the capture parameter; and study how it is modified in the $f(R)$ scenario. Our results show that the photon sphere width increases in the presence of $f(R)$-type modifications, indicating deviations from GR that could be observable in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>A unified model of dark energy and inflation from the Markov-Mukhanov action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified model of dark energy and inflation through the Markov-Mukhanov modification of the Einstein-Hilbert action, where the matter sector is coupled to gravity via a scalar coupling function depending only on the energy density of the matter content. We assume that the coupling function encodes the UV corrections to the standard model of cosmology and we determine the form of the coupling that allows for the dark energy component to be dynamical and act as the inflaton field in the early universe. Interestingly we show that our model, in order to account for inflation, prefers a dark energy equation of state with $w$ close but not equal to $-1$ in agreement with the latest DESI data.</description>

      <title>A Fast Earth-scattering Formalism for Light Dark Matter with Dark Photon Mediators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Dark Matter (DM) is typically assumed to interact only very weakly with the particles of the Standard Model, many direct detection experiments are currently exploring regions of parameter space where DM can have a large scattering cross section. In this scenario, DM may scatter in the atmosphere and Earth before reaching the detector, leading to a distortion of the DM flux and a daily modulation of the signal rate as the detector is shielded by more or less of the Earth at different times of day. This modulation is a distinctive signature of strongly-interacting DM and provides a powerful method of discriminating against time-independent backgrounds. However, the calculation of these Earth-scattering effects by Monte Carlo methods is computationally intensive, inhibiting a systematic exploration of the DM parameter space. Here, we present a semi-analytic formalism for calculating Earth-scattering effects, for models of MeV-mass DM which interacts via a dark photon mediator, and release the associated code Verne2. This formalism assumes that DM travels along straight-line trajectories until it scatters and is reflected back along its incoming path, along us to taking into account the affects of both attenuation and reflection in the Earth. We compare this formalism with the results of full Monte Carlo simulations for cross sections within reach of current and future DM-electron scattering searches. We find that Verne2 is accurate to better than 10-30%, making it suitable for performing signal modeling in the search for daily modulation, while reducing the computational cost by a factor of $\sim10^4$ compared to full Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Single-field D-type inflation in the minimal supergravity in light of Planck-ACT-SPT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimal supergravity framework is applied to a construction of new D-type single-field models of inflation in agreement with precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation by Planck Collaboration, BICEP/Keck Collaboration, Atacama Cosmology Telescope and South Pole Telescope. The inflaton potential, the power spectrum of scalar perturbations, the cosmological observables and the reconstruction procedure can be very simple when using the e-folds as the running variable.</description>

      <title>HALO I: Photometric continuum reverberation mapping of Fairall 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the origin of inter-band continuum time delays in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to study the structure and properties of their accretion disks. We aim to measure the inter-band continuum time delays through photometric monitoring of Seyfert galaxy Fairall 9 to construct the lag-spectrum. Additionally, we explain the observed features in the Fairall 9 lag-spectrum and discuss the potential drivers behind them, based on our newly collected data from the Obserwatorium Cerro Murphy (OCM) telescope. We initiated a long-term, continuous AGN photometric monitoring program in 2024, titled 'Hubble constant constraints through AGN Light curve Observations' (HALO) using intermediate and broad band filters. Here, we present the first results from HALO, focusing on photometric light curves and continuum time-delay measurements for Fairall 9. To complement these observations and extend the wavelength coverage of the lag-spectrum, we also reanalyzed archival Swift light curves and spectroscopic data available in the literature. Using HALO and Swift light curves, we measured inter-band continuum delays to construct the lag-spectrum of Fairall 9. Excess lags appear in the $u$ and $U$ bands (Balmer continuum contamination) and in the $I$ band (Paschen jump/dust emission from the torus). Overall, the lag-spectrum deviates significantly from standard disk model predictions. We find that inter-band delays deviate from the power-law, $\tau_{\lambda} \propto \lambda^{\beta}$ due to BLR scattering, reprocessing, and dust contributions at longer wavelengths. Power-law fits are therefore not well suited for characterizing the nature of the time delays.</description>
