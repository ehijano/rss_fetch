      <title>Epistemic Boundaries and Quantum Uncertainty: What Local Observers Can (Not) Predict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09121v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of quantum theory's salient features is its apparent indeterminism, i.e. measurement outcomes are typically probabilistic. We formally define and address whether this uncertainty is unavoidable or whether post-quantum theories can offer a predictive advantage while conforming to the Born rule on average. We present a no-go claim combining three aspects: predictive advantage, no-signalling, and reliable intersubjectivity between quantum observers. The results of the analysis lead to the conclusion that there exists a fundamental limitation on genuine predictive advantage. However, we uncover a fascinating possibility: When the assumption of reliable intersubjectivity between different observers is violated, subjective predictive advantage can, in principle, exist. This, in turn, entails an epistemic boundary between different observers of the same theory. The findings reconcile us to quantum uncertainty as an aspect of limits on Nature's predictability.</description>

      <title>Bell vs Bell: a ding-dong battle over quantum incompleteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Does determinism (or even the incompleteness of quantum mechanics) follow from locality and perfect correlations? In a 1964 paper John Bell gave the first demonstration that quantum mechanics is incompatible with local hidden variables. Since then a vigorous debate has rung out over whether he relied on an assumption of determinism or instead, as he later claimed in a 1981 paper, derived determinism from assumptions of locality and perfect correlation. This paper aims to bring clarity to the debate via simple examples and rigorous results. It is first recalled, via quantum and classical counterexamples, that the weakest statistical form of locality consistent with Bell's 1964 paper (parameter independence) is insufficient for the derivation of determinism. Attention is then turned to critically assess Bell's appealing to the Einstein-Rosen-Podolsky (EPR) incompleteness argument to support his claim. It is shown this argument is itself incomplete, via counterexamples that expose two logical gaps. Closing these gaps via a strong "counterfactual" reality criterion enables a rigorous derivation of both determinism and parameter independence, and in this sense justifies Bell's claim. Conversely, however, it is noted that whereas the EPR argument requires a weaker "measurement choice" assumption than Bell's demonstration, it nevertheless leads to a similar incompatibility with quantum predictions rather than to quantum incompleteness.</description>
