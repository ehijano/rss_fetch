      <title>Comparison of filament properties in real-size GBS simulations and experiments of TCV-X21</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A direct quantitative comparison of Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) filament properties from fluid turbulence simulations using the GBS code and from experiments on the TCV tokamak is performed within the TCV-X21 validation case. This comparison is made possible by extending the open TCV-X21 dataset with 2D turbulence measurements obtained with Gas Puff Imaging (GPI), providing critical information on the size, velocity, and other key characteristics of turbulent filaments at the outboard midplane and in the divertor region. For the comparison, GBS simulations of TCV-X21 are analyzed using a dedicated synthetic GPI diagnostic that models the neutral helium-plasma interaction and emission processes and accounts for line-integration effects. Poloidal and radial filament velocities are found to be in good agreement between simulations and experiments, while the simulations overestimate the filament radial and poloidal sizes and underestimate the relative fluctuation levels. The simulations further indicate that filaments in the SOL are predominantly represented by density perturbations rather than temperature perturbations, consistent with previous assumptions in experimental analyses of cross-field turbulent transport from GPI data. The poloidal velocity direction of the filaments agrees with the time-averaged $\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$ direction at the outboard midplane and X-point region, but not in the divertor leg. Possible explanations are proposed and discussed, highlighting the influence of the instantaneous $\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$ velocity components in both poloidal and radial directions. This study provides new insights into turbulent filament behavior and contributes to guiding future efforts to improve first-principles simulations of the boundary plasma.</description>

      <title>Fast electrostatic microinstability evaluation in arbitrary toroidal magnetic geometry using a variational approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-scale turbulence originating from microinstabilities limits the energy confinement time in magnetic confinement fusion. Here we develop a semi-analytical dispersion relation based on lowest-order solutions to the gyrokinetic equations in an asymptotic expansion in the ratio of transit (bounce) frequency to the mode frequency for ions (electrons), capable of describing two common instabilities: the ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode and trapped-electron mode (TEM), in the electrostatic limit. The dispersion relation, which is valid in arbitrary toroidal geometry, takes into account resonances with the magnetic ion and bounce-averaged electron drifts, incorporates non-local effects along the magnetic field line, is valid for arbitrary sign of the growth rate and magnetic curvature, and is shown to satisfy a variational property. Several common approximation models are introduced for both the magnetic drift and finite Larmor radius (FLR) damping, with the Pad\'e approximation for FLR effect in particular resulting in remarkable agreement with the baseline dispersion relation model at significantly reduced costs. The baseline model is verified by comparing solutions of the dispersion relation model to high-fidelity linear gyrokinetic simulations, where the exact eigenfunction of the electrostatic potential from simulations is used as a trial function, showing good quantitative agreement for ITGs and TEMs in (shaped) tokamaks as well as low-magnetic-shear stellarators.</description>

      <title>Modeling the effect of MHD activity on runaway electron generation during SPARC disruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities and runaway electrons (REs) interact in several ways, making it important to self-consistently model these interactions for accurate predictions of RE generation and the design of mitigation strategies, such as massive gas injection (MGI). Using M3D-C1 - an extended MHD code with a RE fluid model - we investigate the effects of 3-D nonlinear MHD activity, material injection, and 2-D axisymmetric vertical displacement events (VDEs) on RE evolution during disruptions on SPARC - a high-field, high-current tokamak designed to achieve a fusion gain Q &gt; 1. Several cases, comprising different combinations of neon (Ne) and deuterium ($\text{D}_2$) injection, are considered. Our results demonstrate key effects that arise from the self-consistent RE + MHD coupling, such as an initial increase in RE generation due to MHD instability growth, decreased saturation energies of the m/n = 1/1 mode driving sawteeth-like activity, RE losses in stochastic magnetic fields, and subsequent RE confinement and plateau formation due to re-healing of flux surfaces. Large RE plateaus (&gt;5 MA) are obtained with Ne-only injection ($2-5 \times 10^{21}$ atoms), while combined $\text{D}_2$ + Ne injection ($2 \times 10^{21}$ Ne atoms; $1.8 \times 10^{22} \, \text{D}_2$ molecules) produces a lower RE current (&lt;2 MA). With $\text{D}_2$ + Ne injection, a post thermal quench "cold" VDE terminates the RE beam, preventing a steady plateau. These simulations couple REs, 3-D MHD instabilities, MGI, and axisymmetric VDEs for the first time in SPARC disruption simulations and represent a crucial step in understanding RE generation and mitigation in high-current devices like SPARC.</description>

      <title>Computer simulations of the Stark effect in the helium-beta complex of krypton in ICF conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an ongoing interest in using spectroscopy in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments, where dopants such as krypton can provide vital information about the temperature and density of the imploding plasma. While the most advanced tools for calculating Stark profiles are computer simulation models (CSMs), their application to complex lineshapes under the extreme conditions of ICF experiments is computationally challenging. In this manuscript, we present results of several CSM realizations applied to the Stark shape of the krypton He-beta line and its satellites at ICF-relevant conditions (ne = 1e24 to 1e25 cm-3, Te = 3keV). We demonstrate that codes with the same underlying physics but different numerical approaches yield identical results and analyze the differences in the line profile caused by various physical effects.</description>

      <title>Transverse envelope dynamics of beam slices in a uniform charged ellipsoidal model of the plasma bubble regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a pair of driver/witness electron bunches propagating in an ionized gas background a configuration similar to the one produced in a capillary discharge where a plasma oscillation has been excited by a driving pulse. We assume as in the plasma nonlinear regime that the plasma electrons behind the driver are completely expelled and an ellipsoidal cavity filled with ions only is formed. The fields are linear in both longitudinal and transverse directions, at least in the region of interest for particle acceleration, as the one produced by a uniform ion distribution within a uniformly charged ellipsoidal volume. The fields produced by the ions and experienced by a witness electron beam are purely electrostatic, being the ions at rest in the laboratory frame on the time scale of interest and it can be represented with the field distribution produced by a 3D charged ellipsoidal. The energy spread and emittance degradation has been studied by slicing the bunch in an array of cylinders and solving envelope equations for each bunch slice. The properties of transverse envelope and emittance oscillations and energy spread degradation have been analyzed together with the related matching conditions for optimal transport and acceleration.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Shear Equilibration During Magnetic Reconnection Onset in Mixed-Equilibrium Current Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic shear across the polarity inversion line (PIL) plays an important role in the explosive nature of reconnection onset and in the equilibration of current sheets, acting as a source of free energy that can enhance or inhibit the onset process under certain conditions. In this study, we use a 2D PIC simulation to examine the local interaction between the reconnection guide field and thermodynamic variables during reconnection onset in a region of initially depleted thermal energy and enhanced magnetic energy in a large guide field background. We identify critical stages of the equilibration process, characterize intervals based on whether the pressure evolution is driven by changes in density or temperature, and discuss what these intervals imply about the evolution of local heat and work density. Finally, we examine power densities associated with electromagnetic field time evolution and electromagnetic energy transfer and compare to those related to thermodynamic changes.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian versus Eulerian Methods for Toroidally-Magnetized Isothermal Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number of simulations have seen the emergence of strongly-toroidally-magnetized accretion disks from interstellar medium inflows. Recently, Guo et al. 2025 (G25) studied an idealized test problem of toroidally-magnetized disks in isothermal ideal MHD with an Eulerian static-mesh method, and argued the midplane behavior changes qualitatively (with a significant loss of toroidal magnetic flux) when the the thermal scale-length is resolved ($\Delta x &lt; H_{\rm thermal}$). We rerun the G25 test problem with two Lagrangian methods: meshless finite-mass, and meshless finite-volume. We show that Lagrangian methods reproduce the high-resolution ($\Delta x \ll H_{\rm thermal}$) Eulerian G25 results. At low resolution ($\Delta x \gg H_{\rm thermal}$), behaviors differ: Lagrangian methods still lose flux and evolve 'as close as possible' to the converged solution, while Eulerian methods show no evolution. We argue this difference in convergence behavior is related to the ability of Lagrangian codes to follow flows to an arbitrarily thin midplane layer, analogous to the well-studied difference in Jeans fragmentation problems. This and results from other higher-resolution simulations and different codes suggest that the sustained midplane toroidal fields seen in recent Lagrangian multi-scale, multi-physics simulations cannot be a numerical resolution effect, and some physical difference between those simulations and the G25 test problem explains their different behaviors.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Discontinuous Galerkin Algorithm for Particle Kinetics on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel, conservative discontinuous Galerkin algorithm is presented for particle kinetics on manifolds. The motion of particles on the manifold is represented using using both canonical and non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations. Our schemes apply to either formulations, but the canonical formulation results in a particularly efficient scheme that also conserves particle density and energy exactly. The collisionless update is coupled to a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator that provides a simplified model for relaxation to local thermodynamic equilibrium. An iterative scheme is constructed to ensure collisional invariants (density, momentum and energy) are preserved numerically. Rotation of the manifold is incorporated by modifying the Hamiltonian while ensuring a canonical formulation. Several test problems, including a kinetic version of the classical Sod-shock problem, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the surfaces of a sphere and a paraboloid, with and without rotations, is presented. A prospectus for further development of this approach to simulation of kinetic theory in general relativity is presented.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and Magnetic Reconnection in Relativistic Multispecies Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulations of relativistic plasmas traditionally focus on the dynamics of two-species mixtures of charged particles under the influence of external magnetic fields and those generated by particle currents. However, the extreme conditions of astrophysical plasmas near compact objects such as black holes and neutron stars are often characterized by mixtures of electrons, protons, and positrons, whose dynamics can differ significantly because of the considerable mass contrast. We present the first two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of relativistic turbulence and magnetic reconnection in a three-species plasma, varying the relative abundance of electrons, protons, and positrons while employing realistic mass ratios to achieve unprecedented accuracy. We find that turbulence leads to the formation of magnetic islands, current sheets, and plasmoids. Reconnection occurs between these structures, with plasma composition playing a key role in determining the number of reconnection sites and their energy-conversion efficiency. In particular, as the proton fraction increases, very small-scale features of the turbulence are washed out, while global dissipative effects are amplified. Finally, using a novel generalization of Ohm's law for a relativistic multi-species plasma, we find that the reconnection rate is primarily governed by the electric fields associated to the divergence of the positron and electron pressure tensors. These results provide new insights into dissipation and particle acceleration in turbulent relativistic plasmas, such as those near black holes and neutron stars, and can be used to interpret their high-energy emission and phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic waves in astrophysical Druyvesteyn plasmas: I. Langmuir waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmas in various astrophysical systems are in non-equilibrium states as evidenced by direct in-situ measurements in the solar wind, solar corona and planetary environments as well as by indirect observations of nonthermal sources of waves and emissions. Specific to observed non-equilibrium plasmas are non-Maxwellian velocity distributions with suprathermal tails, most often described by Kappa (power-law) distributions. In this paper, we introduce an alternative modeling for linear waves in plasmas described by the generalized Druyvesteyn distribution model. This model can reproduce not only high-energy tails, but also low-energy flat-tops of velocity distributions, like those of electrons in interplanetary shocks and the solar transition region. The wave dispersion relation of longitudinal waves is derived in terms of the newly introduced Druyvesteyn dispersion function. The dispersion curves as well as damping rates of high-frequency Langmuir waves are numerically computed for the isotropic case, and their analytical approximations are provided in the limit of weak damping. We thus offer a new tool for modeling longitudinal waves, and in particular Langmuir waves under the specific conditions of Druyvesteyn distributions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-preserving semi-implicit finite volume scheme for Extended Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Finite Volume (FV) scheme is developed for solving the extended magnetohydrodynamic (XMHD) equations, yielding accurate results in the ideal, resistive, and Hall MHD limits. This is accomplished by first re-writing the XMHD equations such that it allows the algorithm to retain the use of ideal MHD Riemann solvers and the constrained transport method to preserve divergence-free magnetic fields. Incorporation of electron inertia and displacement current introduces additional numerical stiffness which motivates a semi-implicit FV scheme that re-formulates the XMHD model as a relaxation system. The equations are then advanced in time using an explicit 2nd-order Runge-Kutta scheme with operator splitting applied to the implicit source term updates at each sub-stage. For additional numerical stability, a density-dependent slope limiter is implemented to increase flux diffusivity at low density regions where non-ideal effects become significant. The algorithm is subsequently implemented in a scalable adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework. As the new algorithm retains many aspects of the ideal MHD formulations, it asymptotes naturally to the ideal MHD limit. Moreover, it shows promising results at the resistive and Hall MHD limits. This is verified against reference test problems for ideal, resistive and Hall MHD.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Neural Operator Learning for Nonlinear Grad-Shafranov Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence emerges as a transformative enabler for fusion energy commercialization, fast and accurate solvers become increasingly critical. In magnetic confinement nuclear fusion, rapid and accurate solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) is essential for real-time plasma control and analysis. Traditional numerical solvers achieve high precision but are computationally prohibitive, while data-driven surrogates infer quickly but fail to enforce physical laws and generalize poorly beyond training distributions. To address this challenge, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) that directly learns the GSE solution operator, mapping shape parameters of last closed flux surface to equilibrium solutions for realistic nonlinear current profiles. Comprehensive benchmarking of five neural architectures identifies the novel Transformer-KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) Neural Operator (TKNO) as achieving highest accuracy (0.25% mean L2 relative error) under supervised training (only data-driven). However, all data-driven models exhibit large physics residuals, indicating poor physical consistency. Our unsupervised training can reduce the residuals by nearly four orders of magnitude through embedding physics-based loss terms without labeled data. Critically, semi-supervised learning--integrating sparse labeled data (100 interior points) with physics constraints--achieves optimal balance: 0.48% interpolation error and the most robust extrapolation performance (4.76% error, 8.9x degradation factor vs 39.8x for supervised models). Accelerated by TensorRT optimization, our models enable millisecond-level inference, establishing PINO as a promising pathway for next-generation fusion control systems.</description>

      <title>Mode Composition Shapes Magnetic Anisotropy in Solar Wind Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulence is a ubiquitous process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales, thereby influencing particle transport and heating. Recent progress has improved our understanding of the anisotropy of turbulence with respect to the mean magnetic field; however, its exact form and implications for magnetic topology and energy transfer remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the nature of magnetic anisotropy in compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence within low-$\beta$ solar wind using measurements from the Cluster spacecraft. By decomposing small-amplitude fluctuations into Alfv\'en and compressible modes, we reveal that magnetic anisotropy is largely mode dependent: Alfvenic fluctuations are broadly distributed in propagation angle, whereas compressible fluctuations are concentrated near the quasi-parallel (slab) direction, a feature closely linked to collisionless damping of compressible modes. For $\beta\rightarrow0$, compressible modes become dominant within the slab component at smaller scales. These findings advance our understanding of magnetic anisotropy in solar wind turbulence and offer a new perspective on the three-dimensional turbulence cascade, with broad implications for particle transport, acceleration, and magnetic reconnection.</description>

Abstract: We present a GPU-portable implementation of a real-space density functional theory (DFT) code ``QUMASUN'' and benchmark it on the new Plasma Simulator featuring Intel Xeon 6980P CPUs, and AMD MI300A GPUs. Additional tests were performed on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU. In particular MI300A supports unified memory and GH200 supports coherent memory interconnect, simplifying GPU porting. A lightweight C++ lambda-based layer enables CPU, CUDA, and HIP execution without OpenMP/OpenACC preprocessor directives. For diamond (216 atoms) and tungsten (128 atoms) systems, MI300A and GH200 achieve 2.0-2.8 $\times$ and 2.3-2.4 $\times$ speedups over a 256-core Xeon node. The compute-bound kernels, which are fast Fourier transforms (FFT), dense matrix-matrix multiplications (GEMM) and eigenvalue solver, show substantial acceleration on both GPUs, indicating that the present GPU-portable approach can benefit a wide range of plasma-fusion simulation codes beyond DFT.</description>
