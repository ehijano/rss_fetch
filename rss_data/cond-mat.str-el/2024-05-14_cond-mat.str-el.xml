      <title>Combining complex conjugation, time-reversal, and spin symmetry projection of coupled cluster wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex conjugation symmetry breaking and restoration generate two non-orthogonal configurations at the Hartree-Fock level that can capture static correlation naturally. In conjunction with broken spin-symmetry coupled cluster theory, the symmetry-projected wave function shows good agreement with full configuration interaction in beryllium hydride insertion, lithium fluoride dissociation, and symmetric stretching of tetrahedral H$_4$. By adding spin flip projection, we can also recover time reversal symmetry in the same coupled cluster framework.</description>

      <title>Finite-size corrections to the energy spectra of gapless one-dimensional systems in the presence of boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the finite-size scaling theory of one-dimensional quantum critical systems in the presence of boundaries. While the finite-size spectrum in the conformal limit, namely of a conformal field theory with conformally invariant boundary conditions, is related to the dimensions of boundary operators by Cardy, the actual spectra of lattice models are affected by both bulk and boundary perturbations and contain non-universal boundary energies. We obtain a general expression of the finite-size energy levels in the presence of bulk and boundary perturbations. In particular, a generic boundary perturbation related to the energy-momentum tensor gives rise to a renormalization of the effective system size. We verify our field-theory formulation by comparing the results with the exact solution of the critical transverse-field Ising chain and with accurate numerical results on the critical three-state Potts chain obtained by Density-Matrix Renormalization Group.</description>

      <title>Direct visualization of the impurity occupancy roadmap in Ni-substituted van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impurity substitution is a general strategy to study the intrinsic properties of a quantum material. However, when the target element has more than one Wyckoff position in the lattice, it is a big challenge but with extreme necessity to know the exact position and order of the occupancy of impurity atoms. Via comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations, we establish herein the roadmap for Ni substitution in Fe3GaTe2, a van der Waals ferromagnet with the Curie temperature TC even reaching ~ 380 K. The results unambiguously reveal that in (Fe1-xNix)3GaTe2, Ni atoms initially form an van der Waals interlayer gap Ni3 sites when x &lt; 0.1, and then gradually occupy the Fe2 sites. After replacing the Fe2 sites at x of ~ 0.75, they start to substitute for the Fe1 sites and eventually realize a full occupation at x = 1.0. Accordingly, TC and saturation magnetic moments of (Fe1-xNix)3GaTe2 both show nonlinear decrease, which is tightly tied to the Ni occupancy order as well as the different roles of Ni3, Fe1 and Fe2 sites in the spin Hamiltonian. The results not only yield fruitful insights into the essential roles of different Fe sites in producing the above room temperature high TC, but also set a paradigm for future impurity substitution study on other quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lehmann representation of three-point functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) to three-point correlation and vertex functions in imaginary time and Matsubara frequency. The representation takes the form of a linear combination of judiciously chosen exponentials in imaginary time, and products of simple poles in Matsubara frequency, which are universal for a given temperature and energy cutoff. We present a systematic algorithm to generate compact sampling grids, from which the coefficients of such an expansion can be obtained by solving a linear system. We show that the explicit form of the representation can be used to evaluate diagrammatic expressions involving infinite Matsubara sums, such as polarization functions or self-energies, with controllable, high-order accuracy. This collection of techniques establishes a framework through which methods involving three-point objects can be implemented robustly, with a substantially reduced computational cost and memory footprint.</description>

      <title>The structural-size effect, aging time, and pressure-dependent functional properties of Mn-containing perovskite nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of nanoparticles are determined by their size and structure. When exposed to external pressure P, their structural properties can change. The improvement or degradation of the properties of the samples depending on time is particularly interesting. The knowledge of the influence of structural-size effect, aging time, and pressure on the behavior of the compounds is essential for fundamental and applied purposes.Therefore, the first attempts have been made to shed light on how the functional properties of the Mn-containing perovskites change depending on them. The nanoparticles of different sizes, from 20 to 70 nm, have been obtained. After 3 years, their structural properties underwent significant changes, including an increase in particle size, bandwidth, and microstrains, as well as a reduction in dislocation density.The greatest change in the structure is observed for the smallest nanoparticles. The phase transition temperatures increase with nanoparticle size, time, and pressure. The aging time has the strongest influence on the changing Curie temperature for the smallest and most magnetically inhomogeneous nanoparticles with dTc/dP = 100 K / GPa. Conversely, the structural-size effect and external pressure have the greatest influence on the biggest and most magnetically uniform nanoparticles with dTc/dP = 91 and 16 K / GPa, respectively. After 3 years, the biggest nanoparticles demonstrate the most stable phase transition temperatures with improved magnetocaloric parameters near room temperature. These structural-size effect, aging time, and pressure are powerful instruments to tune the phase transition temperatures and magnetocaloric effect of the nanoparticles. These outcomes may have implications for the whole class of perovskites and could initiate a new mainstream.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced phase transition in pyrochlore iridates (Sm$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$)$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ ($x =$ 0, 0.02, and 0.10): Raman and X-ray diffraction studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pyrochlore iridates, A$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, show a wide variety of structural, electronic, and magnetic properties controlled by the interplay of different exchange interactions, which can be tuned by external pressure. In this work, we report pressure-induced phase transitions at ambient temperature using synchrotron-based X-ray diffraction (up to ~ 20 GPa) and Raman-scattering measurements (up to ~ 25 GPa) of the pyrochlore series (Sm$_{1-x}$Bi$_x$)$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ ($x =$ 0, 0.02, and 0.10). Our Raman and X-ray data suggest an iso-structural transition in Sm$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ at Pc ~ 11.2 GPa associated with the rearrangement of IrO6 octahedra in the pyrochlore lattice. The transition pressure decreases to ~ 10.2 and 9 GPa for $x =$ 0.02 and 0.10, respectively. For all the samples, the linewidth of three phonons associated with Ir-O-Ir (A1g and Eg) and Ir-O (T$_2$g$_4$) vibrations show anomalous decrease up to Pc, due to decrease in electron-phonon interaction.</description>

      <title>Simulating Floquet scrambling circuits on trapped-ion quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum many-body dynamics spread initially localized quantum information across the entire system. Information scrambling refers to such a process, whose simulation is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We demonstrate the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the interferometric protocol for calculating out-of-time-ordered correlators to study the scrambling property of a one-dimensional kicked-Ising model on 20-qubit trapped-ion quantum processors. The simulated quantum circuits have a geometrically local structure that exhibits the ballistic growth of entanglement, resulting in the circuit depth being linear in the number of qubits for the entire state to be scrambled. We experimentally confirm the growth of signals in the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the decay of out-of-time-ordered correlators at late times. As an application of the created scrambling circuits, we also experimentally demonstrate the calculation of the microcanonical expectation values of local operators adopting the idea of thermal pure quantum states.</description>

      <title>Screening the organic materials database for superconducting metal-organic frameworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing financial and environmental cost of many inorganic materials has motivated study into organic and "green" alternatives. However, most organic compounds contain a large number of atoms in the primitive unit cell, posing a significant barrier to high-throughput screening for functional properties. In this work, we attempt to overcome this challenge and identify superconducting candidates among the metal-organic-frameworks in the organic materials database using a recently proposed proxy for the electron-phonon coupling. We then isolate the most promising candidate for in-depth analysis, C$_{9}$H$_{8}$Mn$_{2}$O$_{11}$, providing evidence for superconductivity below $100$mK.</description>

      <title>How much entanglement is needed for emergent anyons and fermions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that particles with exotic properties can emerge in systems made of simple constituents such as qubits, due to long-range quantum entanglement. In this paper, we provide quantitative characterizations of entanglement necessary for emergent anyons and fermions by using the geometric entanglement measure (GEM) which quantifies the maximal overlap between a given state and any short-range entangled states. For systems with emergent anyons, based on the braiding statistics, we show that the GEM scales linearly in the system size regardless of microscopic details. The phenomenon of emergent anyons can also be understood within the framework of quantum error correction (QEC). Specifically, we show that the GEM of any 2D stabilizer codes must be at least quadratic in the code distance. Our proof is based on a generic prescription for constructing string operators, establishing a rigorous and direct connection between emergent anyons and QEC. For systems with emergent fermions, despite that the ground state subspaces could be exponentially huge and their coding properties could be rather poor, we show that the GEM also scales linearly in the system size. Our results also establish an intriguing link between quantum anomaly and entanglement: a quantum state respecting anomalous $1$-form symmetries, be it pure or mixed, must be long-range entangled, offering a non-trivial class of intrinsically mixed state phases.</description>

      <title>Ordered States in Heisenberg Pyrochlore Antiferromagnets with Dipole-Dipole Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical Heisenberg model with both a nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction and long-range dipole-dipole interactions is investigated by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation. The ground state of the model without the dipole-dipole interactions is known to be a classical spin liquid and the system does not order at all temperature because of strong frustration. On the other hand, the ordered state of the model with weak dipolar interactions is known to be the so-called Palmer-Chalker (PC) state, in which a pair of spins and another pair of spins are antiparallel and the former is perpendicular to the latter for each tetrahedron of the lattice. Here ordered states of the model are obtained for various values of the relative strength of the two kinds of the interactions. Besides the spin liquid state and the PC-like state, states that might be considered as glassy state, states of period 8, states of period 4, and states of period of 4 on one sublattice and 8 on other three sublattices are realized. Among the states with period 4 or (and) 8, multi-{\bf K} structures are observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach to tame the growth of entanglement during time evolution by tensor network methods. It combines time evolution in the complex plane with a perturbative and controlled reconstruction of correlation functions on the real-time axis. We benchmark our approach on the single impurity Anderson model. Compared to purely real-time evolution, the complex time evolution significantly reduces the required bond dimension to obtain the spectral function. Notably, our approach yields self-energy results with high precision at low frequencies, comparable to numerical renormalization group (NRG) results, and it successfully captures the exponentially small Kondo energy scale.</description>

Abstract: The recently discovered superconductivity with critical temperature $T_c$ up to 80 K in the double-layer Nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$ under pressure has drawn great attention. Here we report the positive muon spin relaxation ($\mu^+$SR) study of polycrystalline La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{6.92}$ under ambient pressure. Zero-field $\mu^+$SR experiments reveal the existence of magnetic order in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{6.92}$ with $T_{N}=154\ \rm{K}$. The weak transverse field $\mu^+$SR measurements confirms the bulk nature of magnetism. In addition, a small quantity of oxygen deficiencies can greatly broaden the internal magnetic field distribution sensed by muons.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics in higher-dimensional Holstein models: Insights from Truncated Wigner Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge-density wave phases in quantum materials stem from the complex interplay of electronic and lattice degrees of freedom. Nowadays, various time-resolved spectroscopy techniques allow to actively manipulate such phases and monitor their dynamics in real time. Modeling such nonequilibrium dynamics theoretically is a great challenge and exact methods can usually only treat a small number of atoms and finitely many phonons. We approach the melting of charge-density waves in a Holstein model after a sudden switch-on of the electronic hopping from two perspectives: We prove that in the non-interacting and in the strong-coupling limit, the CDW order parameter on high-dimensional hypercubic lattices obeys a factorization relation for long times, such that its dynamics can be reduced to the one-dimensional case. Secondly, we present numerical results from semiclassical techniques based on the Truncated Wigner Approximation for two spatial dimensions. A comparison with exact data obtained for a Holstein chain shows that a semiclassical treatment of both the electrons and phonons is required in order to correctly describe the phononic dynamics. This is confirmed, in addition, for a quench in the electron-phonon coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Order-by-disorder in the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ transverse-field Ising model on the ruby lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum phase diagram of the $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the ruby lattice. In the low-field limit we derive an effective quantum dimer model, analyzing how the extensive ground-state degeneracy at zero field is lifted by an order-by-disorder scenario. We support our analysis by studying the gap-closing of the high-field phase using series expansions. For $J_2&gt;J_3$, we find a columnar phase at low fields, followed by a clock-ordered phase stabilized by resonating plaquettes at intermediate field values, and an emergent 3d-XY quantum phase transition to the polarized high-field phase. For $J_3&gt;J_2$, an order-by-disorder mechanism stabilizes a distinct $k=(0,0)$ order and a quantum phase transition in the 3d-Ising universality class is observed. Further, we discuss the possible implementation of the columnar- and clock-ordered phase in existing Rydberg atom quantum simulators. When taking into account the full algebraically decaying long-range interactions on the ruby lattice, we find that long-range interactions favor the same ground state as the quantum fluctuations induced by a transverse field, which could make the ruby lattice a promising candidate for the realization of a clock-ordered phase.</description>

Abstract: We present a minimally entangled typical thermal state (METTS) quantum impurity solver for general multi-orbital systems at finite temperatures. We introduce an improved estimator for the single-particle Green's function that strongly reduces the large fluctuations at long imaginary time and low temperature, which were a severe limitation of the original algorithm. In combination with the fork tensor product states ansatz, we obtain a dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) quantum impurity solver, which we benchmark for single and three-band models down to low temperatures, including the effect of spin-orbit coupling in a realistic DMFT computation for the Hund's metal Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ down to low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of binary alloys Ni1-xMox and Ni1-yCuy close to critical concentrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for the ferromagnetic quantum critical point (FM QCP) has always been a captivating research topic in the scientific community. In pursuit of this goal, we introduced nonmagnetic transition metals to alloy with elemental nickel, and studied the magnetic properties of nickel binary alloys Ni1-xMox and Ni1-yCuy as a function of x and y up to the critical concentrations x_{cr} and y_{cr} at which the FM transition T_C disappears. T_C-x(y) phase diagrams were constructed via the Arrott-Noakes scaling of magnetization data. An enhanced Sommerfeld coefficient (the value of C/T as T \rightarrow 0) is observed near y_{cr}, manifesting the effect of quantum fluctuations near the quantum phase transition. It is evident that C/T diverges with -logT down to 0.1 K in the vicinity of y_{cr}, suggests the plausible FM QCP in Ni1-yCuy. However, in the case of Ni1-xMox, although the enhancement of the Sommerfeld coefficient is also observed near x_{cr}, the spin glass behavior is identified through the ac magnetic susceptibility measurement. This observation rules out the possibility of the existence of the FM QCP in Ni1-xMox.</description>

      <title>Hasse Diagrams for Gapless SPT and SSB Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss (1+1)d gapless phases with non-invertible global symmetries, also referred to as categorical symmetries. This includes gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, known as gapless SPT (or gSPT) phases; and gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped spontaneous symmetry broken (SSB) phases, that we refer to as gapless SSB (or gSSB) phases. We fit these gapless phases, along with gapped SPT and SSB phases, into a phase diagram describing possible deformations connecting them. This phase diagram is partially ordered and defines a so-called Hasse diagram. Based on these deformations, we identify gapless phases exhibiting symmetry protected criticality, that we refer to as intrinsically gapless SPT (igSPT) and intrinsically gapless SSB (igSSB) phases. This includes the first examples of igSPT and igSSB phases with non-invertible symmetries. Central to this analysis is the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where each phase corresponds to a condensable algebra in the Drinfeld center of the symmetry category. On a mathematical note, gSPT phases are classified by functors between fusion categories, generalizing the fact that gapped SPT phases are classified by fiber functors; and gSSB phases are classified by functors from fusion to multi-fusion categories. Finally, our framework can be applied to understand gauging of trivially acting non-invertible symmetries, including possible patterns of decomposition arising due to such gaugings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the magnetic structure and properties of a thiocyanate-based honeycomb magnet [Na(OH$_2$)$_3$]Mn(NCS)$_3$ which crystallises in the unusual low-symmetry trigonal space group $P\overline{3}$. Magnetic measurements on powder samples show this material is an antiferromagnet (ordering temperature ($T_\mathrm{N,mag} = 18.1(6)\,$)K) and can be described by nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic interactions $J=-11.07(4)\,$K. A method for growing neutron-diffraction sized single crystals (\textgreater10 mm$^3$) is demonstrated. Low temperature neutron single crystal diffraction shows that the compound adopts the collinear antiferromagnetic structure with $T_\mathrm{N,neut}= 18.94(7)\,$K, magnetic space group $P \bar{3}'$. Low temperature second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements provide no evidence of breaking of the centre of symmetry.</description>

      <title>Anomaly of Subsystem Symmetries in Exotic and Foliated $BF$ Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the mixed 't Hooft anomaly of the subsystem symmetries in the exotic $BF$ theory and the foliated $BF$ theory in 2+1 dimensions, both of which are fractonic quantum field theories describing the equivalent physics. In the anomaly inflow mechanism, the 't Hooft anomaly of the subsystem symmetries can be canceled by combining a subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phase in one dimension higher. In this work, we construct the exotic and foliated $BF$ theories with background gauge fields, and the exotic and foliated forms of the SSPT phases using the foliated-exotic duality. In the foliated form, we see that the non-topological defect that describes a fracton can be viewed as a symmetry-like operator. We also newly construct the foliated and exotic SSPT phases with different foliation structures via the foliated-exotic duality. We can show that the SSPT phases with different foliation structures cancel the same anomaly. This may provide a clue to the characterization of the 't Hooft anomaly of subsystem symmetries.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations, layer distinction, and electron doping in the alternating single-layer trilayer La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ polymorph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory framework to investigate the correlated electronic structure of the alternating single-layer trilayer (1313) polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure. At ambient pressure, the single-layer is in a Mott insulating regime and the low-energy physics is dominated by the trilayer block. Under pressure, the gap in the single-layer block closes due to orbital-selective physics, enabling charge transfer into the trilayer block. This change in effective doping of the trilayer block is likely linked to the higher T$_c$ obtained in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-1313 ($\sim$ 80 K) when compared to the nominal trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ ($\sim$ 30 K). We conclude that correlation-driven layer differentiation is crucial in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-1313 polymorph and that its low-energy physics aligns closely with the trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ compound (in spite of the apparent differences in nominal filling) rather than with the conventional bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Weak integrability breaking perturbations of integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum integrable system slightly perturbed away from integrability is typically expected to thermalize on timescales of order $\tau\sim \lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength. We here study classes of perturbations that violate this scaling, and exhibit much longer thermalization times $\tau\sim \lambda^{-2\ell}$ where $\ell&gt;1$ is an integer. Systems with these "weak integrability breaking" perturbations have an extensive number of quasi-conserved quantities that commute with the perturbed Hamiltonian up to corrections of order $\lambda^\ell$. We demonstrate a systematic construction to obtain families of such weak perturbations of a generic integrable model for arbitrary $\ell$. We then apply the construction to various models, including the Heisenberg, XXZ, and XYZ chains, the Hubbard model, models of spinless free fermions, and the quantum Ising chain. Our analytical framework explains the previously observed evidence of weak integrability breaking in the Heisenberg and XXZ chains under certain perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for families of 1d lattice systems in an invertible phase, the cohomology class of the higher Berry curvature can be refined to an integral degree-3 class on the parameter space. Similarly, for families of U(1)-invariant 2d lattice systems in an invertible phase, the higher Thouless pump can be refined to an integral degree-2 class on the parameter space. We show that the 2d Thouless pump can be identified with an excess Berry curvature of a flux insertion.</description>

      <title>Robustness and eventual slow decay of bound states of interacting microwave photons in the Google Quantum AI experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrable models are characterized by the existence of stable excitations that can propagate indefinitely without decaying. This includes multi-magnon bound states in the celebrated XXZ spin chain model and its integrable Floquet counterpart. A recent Google Quantum AI experiment [A. Morvan et al., Nature 612, 240 (2022)] realizing the Floquet model demonstrated the persistence of such collective excitations even when the integrability is broken: this observation is at odds with the expectation of ergodic dynamics in generic non-integrable systems. We here study the spectrum of the model realized in the experiment using exact diagonalization and physical arguments. We find that isolated bands corresponding to the descendants of the exact bound states of the integrable model are clearly observable in the spectrum for a large range of system sizes. However, our numerical analysis of the localization properties of the eigenstates suggests that the bound states become unstable in the thermodynamic limit. A perturbative estimate of the decay rate agrees with the prediction of an eventual instability for large system sizes.</description>

      <title>Plasmon dispersion in bilayer cuprate superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The essential building blocks of cuprate superconductors are two-dimensional CuO$_2$ sheets interspersed with charge reservoir layers. In bilayer cuprates, two closely spaced CuO$_2$ sheets are separated by a larger distance from the subsequent pair in the next unit cell. In contrast to single-layer cuprates, prior theoretical work on bilayer systems has predicted two distinct acoustic plasmon bands for a given out-of-plane momentum transfer. Here we report random phase approximation (RPA) calculations for bilayer systems which corroborate the existence of two distinct plasmons bands. We find that the intensity of the lower-energy band is negligibly small, whereas the higher-energy band carries significant spectral weight. We also present resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) experiments at the O $K$-edge on the bilayer cuprate Y$_{0.85}$Ca$_{0.15}$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (Ca-YBCO), which show only one dispersive plasmon branch, in agreement with the RPA calculations. In addition, the RPA results indicate that the dispersion of the higher-energy plasmon band in Ca-YBCO is not strictly acoustic, but exhibits a substantial energy gap of approximately 250 meV at the two-dimensional Brillouin zone center.</description>

      <title>Photon absorption in twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate one- and two-photon absorption in twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) by examining the effects of tuning the twist angle $ \theta $ and the excitation energy $ E_l $ on their corresponding absorption coefficients $ \alpha_{i=1,2}$. We find that $ \alpha_1 $ shows distinct peaks as a function of $ E_l $ which correspond to the van Hove singularities (vHS) of TBLG. In contrast to single- (SLG) and AB bilayer graphene (BLG), $ \alpha_1 $ is substantially enhanced by $\sim 2$ and $\sim 1$ orders of magnitude, respectively, in the visible range. On the other hand, $\alpha_2 $ exhibits a remarkable increase of $\sim 11$ and $\sim 9$ orders of magnitude. Interestingly, as $\theta$ increases, the resonant features exhibited by $\alpha_{i=1,2}$ \textit{vs.} $ E_l $ shift progressively from the infrared to the visible. On doping TBLG, both $\alpha_1 $ and $ \alpha_2 $ remain essentially unchanged \textit{vs.} $ E_l $ but with a minor red-shift in their resonant peaks. Additionally, we explore various polarization configurations for TPA and determine the conditions under which $\alpha_2$ becomes extremal.</description>

      <title>A High Resolution Dilatometer Using Optical Fiber Interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16641v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a high performance differential dilatometer based on an all-fiber Michelson interferometer at cryogenic temperature with $10^{-10}$ resolution in $\delta L/L$. It resolve the linear thermal expansion coefficient by measuring the oscillating changes of sample thickness and sample temperature with the interferometer and in-situ thermometer, respectively. By measuring the linear thermal expansion coefficient $\alpha$ near the antiferromagnetic transition region of BaFe$_2$As$_2$ as a demonstration, we show our dilatometer is able to measure thin samples with sub-pm-level length change resolution and mK-level temperature resolution. Despite there is residual background thermal expansion of a few nm/K in measurement result, our new dilatometer is sitll a powerful tool for study of phase transition in condensed matter physics, especially significant advantages in fragile materials with sub-100$\mu$m thickness and being integrated with multiple synchronous measurements and tuning thanks to the extremely high resolution and contactless nature. The prototype design of this setup can be further improved in many aspects for specific applications.</description>

      <title>Gapped nodal planes drive a large topological Nernst effect in a chiral lattice antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic structure of compensated antiferromagnets (CAF) has drawn attention for its ability to create large responses, reminiscent of ferromagnets and suitable for data storage and readout, despite (nearly) net-zero spontaneous magnetization. Many of the striking experimental signatures predicted for CAF, such as giant thermoelectric Nernst effects, are enhanced when two or more electronic bands are nearly degenerate in vicinity of the Fermi energy. Here, we use thermoelectric and electric transport experiments to study the electronic structure of the layered, chiral metal CoNb3S6 in its all-in-all-out CAF ground state and report near-degeneracies of electron bands at the upper and lower boundaries of the first Brillouin zone. Considering non-symmorphic spin-space group symmetries in the non-relativistic approximation for the ordered phase, these near-degeneracies are approximately protected by a lattice translation combined with spin rotation, and are vestiges of nodal planes enforced by a screw axis symmetry in the paramagnetic state. Hot spots of emergent, or fictitious, magnetic fields are formed at the slightly gapped nodal plane, generating the spontaneous Hall and Nernst effects in this CAF. Taking into account more than six hundred Wannier orbitals, our model quantitatively reproduces the observed spontaneous Nernst effect, emphasizes the role of proximate symmetries in the emergent responses of CAF, and demonstrates the promise of ab-initio search for functional responses in a wide class of materials with reconstructed unit cells due to spin or charge order.</description>

      <title>Anomaly and invertible field theory with higher-form symmetry: Extended group cohomology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of invertible symmetry, the topological approach based on classifying spaces dominates the classification of 't Hooft anomalies and symmetry protected topological phases. We explore the alternative algebraic approach based on cochains that directly characterize the lattice lagrangian of invertible field theories and the anomalous phase factor of topological operator rearrangements. In the current literature, the algebraic approach has been systematically described for only finite 0-form symmetries. In this initial work, we generalize it to finite higher-form symmetries with trivial higher-group structure. We carefully analyze the algebraic cochains and abstract a purely algebraic structure that naturally generalizes group cohomology. Using techniques from simplicial homotopy theory, we show its isomorphism to the cohomology of classifying spaces. The proof is based on an explicit construction of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces and their products.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport in the quantum East-West kinetically constrained model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a chaotic particle-conserving kinetically constrained model, with a single parameter which allows us to break reflection symmetry. Through extensive numerical simulations we find that the domain wall state shows a variety of dynamical behaviors from localization all the way to ballistic transport, depending on the value of the reflection breaking parameter. Surprisingly, such anomalous behavior is not mirrored in infinite-temperature dynamics, which appear to scale diffusively, in line with expectations for generic interacting models. However, studying the particle density gradient, we show that the lack of reflection symmetry affects infinite-temperature dynamics, resulting in an asymmetric dynamical structure factor. This is in disagreement with normal diffusion and suggests that the model may also exhibit anomalous dynamics at infinite temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we observe low-entangled eigenstates in the spectrum of the model, a telltale sign of quantum many body scars.</description>
