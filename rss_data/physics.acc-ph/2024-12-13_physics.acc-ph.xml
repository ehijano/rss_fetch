      <title>To the vacuum conditions that provided the process of electromagnetic waves generated by a relativistic magnetron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The powerful EHF radiation generated in a relativistic high-voltage pulsed magnetron of the 8 mm range is experimentally investigated. The factors that negatively affect the generation of EHF radiation are experimentally investigated and analyzed. It is determined that the processes that reduce the efficiency and duration of the generation pulse also include low pressure in the vacuum diode of the magnetron. It is known that the main residual gases in the vacuum diode of a magnetron are air components. During magnetron operation, there is a significant increase in the pressure of the residual atmosphere: hydrocarbons, water vapor, and hydrogen. A vacuum system was designed to evacuate these gases to ensure optimal operation of the magnetron. For the new vacuum system, a cryogenic condensation-adsorption pump was developed and applied, which allowed to increase the rate of pumping out the main residual gases. The peculiarity of the developed pump is that the pumping element with the adsorbent has a working surface that is twice as large as the one in the corrugated form of the sorption cartridge. Another feature of the pump is its efficiency, which is achieved through the use of nitrogen vapor for cooling the inter-wall gap. The use of cryogenic pumping means made it possible to obtain a pressure of 1E-6 Torr, which led to a 25 percent increase in the EHF radiation of the relativistic magnetron.</description>

      <title>Performance of the prototype beam drift chamber for LAMPS at RAON with proton and Carbon-12 beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beam Drift Chamber (BDC) is designed to reconstruct the trajectories of incident rare isotope beams provided by RAON (Rare isotope Accelerator complex for ON-line experiments) into the experimental target of LAMPS (Large Acceptance Multi-Purpose Spectrometer). To conduct the performance test of the BDC, the prototype BDC (pBDC) is manufactured and evaluated with the high energy ion beams from HIMAC (Heavy Ion Medical Accelerator in Chiba) facility in Japan. Two kinds of ion beams, 100 MeV proton, and 200 MeV/u $^{12}$C, have been utilized for this evaluation, and the track reconstruction efficiency and position resolution have been measured as the function of applied high voltage. This paper introduces the construction details and presents the track reconstruction efficiency and position resolution of pBDC.</description>

      <title>Anomalous pinch in electron-electron beam collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that an anomalous pinch can occur in ultrarelativistic electron-electron or positron-positron beam interaction, caused by the combined interplay of collective beam motion (disruption) and strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED). The locally created electron-positron pairs, from SF-QED effects, screen the self-fields of the beams and can invert the polarity of the Lorentz force resulting in a pinch of the beams. A theoretical model predicts the pinch condition and is confirmed by first-principles 3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. This anomalous pinch enhances density compression, increases the collision luminosity, and amplifies the local magnetic fields and the quantum parameter of the beam particles by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Excitation of quasi-monochromotic waves by a high-voltage pulse in a ferrite coaxial line with the periodic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental data and results of numerical simulations are presented, concerning excitation of narrowband gigahertz-range wave trains in coaxial guiding structures that are partially filled with ferromagnetic material and may involve periodically arranged metal inserts. The experiments performed confirm the possibility of exciting weakly damped electromagnetic waves by feeding high voltage, unilateral electromagnetic pulses of short duration into the line. The coax line was of outer diameter 50.5 mm, filled with an isotropic dielectric (relative dielectric constant {\epsilon} = 2.25) and a set of ferrite rings with {\epsilon}=16 and saturated-state {\mu} about 4 to 5. With a peak voltage of the primary pulse close to 160 kV and a magnetizing field of 17.5 kA/m, the parameters of the waves excited reached magnitudes as: frequency 1.89 GHz to 2.1 GHz; bandwidth 16%; VHF power at the output about 20 MW.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Beam-Plasma Interactions Through Jitter Analysis Using Start-to-End Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional accelerators, while effective, suffer from extensive spatial and financial demands, necessitating the exploration of compact alternatives like PWFA, which significantly reduces the necessary accelerator length by utilizing the wake generated by a high-speed pulse traveling through plasma. Our research focuses on mitigating instabilities, particularly timing jitter, which critically impacts the quality of accelerated beams. Through the deployment of Impact-T, Bmad, and Tao simulation tools at the FACET-II facility, we examined how timing jitter influences key beam parameters, including peak currents and emittance, over various simulation scenarios. The findings reveal that even minute variations in accelerator settings can significantly influence beam characteristics, underscoring the importance of precise control in beam dynamics. The outcomes contribute to enhancing the reliability and precision of PWFA systems, promising improved applications in both scientific research and medical therapies. Future research directions include integrating machine learning techniques to refine control strategies further and reduce experimental redundancies, highlighting the evolving synergy between accelerator physics and computational data science.</description>
