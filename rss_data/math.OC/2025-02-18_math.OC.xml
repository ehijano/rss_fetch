      <title>Hierarchical Control for the Wave Equation with a Moving Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the study of the hierarchical control for the one-dimensional wave equation in intervals with a moving boundary. This equation models the motion of a string where an endpoint is fixed and the other one is moving. When the speed of the moving endpoint is less than the characteristic speed, the controllability of this equation is established. We assume that we can act on the dynamic of the system by a hierarchy of controls. According to the formulation given by H. von Stackelberg (Marktform und Gleichgewicht, Springer, Berlin, 1934), there are local controls called followers and global controls called leaders. In fact, one considers situations where there are two cost (objective) functions. One possible way is to cut the control into two parts, one being thought of as ``the leader" and the other one as ``the follower". This situation is studied in the paper, with one of the cost functions being of the controllability type. We present the following results: the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium, the approximate controllability with respect to the leader control, and the optimality system for the leader control.</description>

      <title>A review of minimum cost box searching games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of zero-sum search games in which a Hider hides one or more target among a set of $n$ boxes. The boxes may require differing amount of time to search, and detection may be imperfect, so that there is a certain probability that a target may not be found when a box is searched, even when it is there. A Searcher must choose how to search the boxes sequentially, and wishes to minimize the expected time to find the target(s), whereas the Hider wishes to maximize this payoff. We review some known solutions to different cases of this game.</description>

      <title>Efficient Stabilization of Hybrid Coulomb Spacecraft Formations using Control Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A control allocation algorithm using control Lyapunov functions to determine stabilizing charges and thrusts of hybrid Coulomb spacecraft formations (HCSFs) is presented. The goal is to stabilize a desired configuration while minimizing the thruster actuation and maximizing Coulomb actuation to minimize propellant usage. A proportion of the decrease of the control Lyapunov function is designated for Coulomb actuation and the rest is performed by thrusters. Simulations show that an 85% reduction of propellant compared to using solely thrusters is attainable using the proposed algorithm. It is shown that the best role for thrusters in a HCSF is to provide small corrections that cannot be provided by Coulomb actuation.</description>

      <title>Time Parameterized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal transport has gained significant attention in recent years due to its effectiveness in deep learning and computer vision. Its descendant metric, the Wasserstein distance, has been particularly successful in measuring distribution dissimilarities. While extensive research has focused on optimal transport and its regularized variants (such as entropy, sparsity, and capacity constraints) the role of time has been largely overlooked. However, time is a critical factor in real world transport problems.
  In this work, we introduce a time parameterized formulation of the optimal transport problem, incorporating a time variable t to represent sequential steps and enforcing specific constraints at each step. We propose a systematic method to solve a special subproblem and develop a heuristic search algorithm that achieves nearly optimal solutions while significantly reducing computational time.</description>

      <title>An adaptive switch strategy for acquisition functions in Bayesian optimization of wind farm layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind farm layout optimization (WFLO), which seeks to maximizing annual energy production by strategically adjusting wind turbines' location, is essential for the development of large-scale wind farms. While low-fidelity methods dominate WFLO studies, high-fidelity methods are less commonly applied due to their significant computational costs. This paper introduces a Bayesian optimization framework that leverages a novel adaptive acquisition function switching strategy to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of WFLO using high-fidelity modeling methods. The proposed switch acquisition functions strategy alternates between MSP and MES acquisition functions, dynamically balancing exploration and exploitation. By iteratively retraining the Kriging model with intermediate optimal layouts, the framework progressively refines its predictions to accelerate convergence to optimal solutions. The performance of the switch-acquisition-function-based Bayesian optimization framework is first validated using 4- and 10-dimensional Ackley benchmark functions, where it demonstrates superior optimization efficiency compared to using MSP or MES alone. The framework is then applied to WFLO problems using Gaussian wake models for three varying wind farm cases. Results show that the switch-acquisition-function-based Bayesian optimization framework outperforms traditional heuristic algorithms, achieving near-optimal annual energy output with significantly fewer calculations. Finally, the framework is extended to high-fidelity WFLO by coupling it with CFD simulations, where turbine rotors are modeled as actuator disks. The novel switch-acquisition-function-based Bayesian optimization enables more effective exploration to achieve higher annual energy production in WFLO, advancing the design of more effective wind farm layouts.</description>

      <title>Sparse learning with concave regularization: relaxation of the irrepresentable condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning sparse models from data is an important task in all those frameworks where relevant information should be identified within a large dataset. This can be achieved by formulating and solving suitable sparsity promoting optimization problems. As to linear regression models, Lasso is the most popular convex approach, based on an $\ell_1$-norm regularization. In contrast, in this paper, we analyse a concave regularized approach, and we prove that it relaxes the irrepresentable condition, which is sufficient and essentially necessary for Lasso to select the right significant parameters. In practice, this has the benefit of reducing the number of necessary measurements with respect to Lasso. Since the proposed problem is non-convex, we also discuss different algorithms to solve it, and we illustrate the obtained enhancement via numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Time-consistent portfolio selection with strictly monotone mean-variance preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to time-consistent control problems of portfolio selection with strictly monotone mean-variance preferences. These preferences are variational modifications of the conventional mean-variance preferences, and remain time-inconsistent as in mean-variance optimization problems. To tackle the time-inconsistency, we study the Nash equilibrium controls of both the open-loop type and the closed-loop type, and characterize them within a random parameter setting. The problem is reduced to solving a flow of forward-backward stochastic differential equations for open-loop equilibria, and to solving extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations for closed-loop equilibria. In particular, we derive semi-closed-form solutions for these two types of equilibria under a deterministic parameter setting. Both solutions are represented by the same function, which is independent of wealth state and random path. This function can be expressed as the conventional time-consistent mean-variance portfolio strategy multiplied by a factor greater than one. Furthermore, we find that the state-independent closed-loop Nash equilibrium control is a strong equilibrium strategy in a constant parameter setting only when the interest rate is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Optimal Placement of Nature-Based Solutions for Urban Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increased urbanization and climate change intensify urban heat islands and degrade air quality, making current mitigation strategies insufficient. Nature-based solutions (NBSs), such as parks, green walls, roofs, and street trees, offer a promising means to regulate urban temperatures and enhance air quality. However, determining their optimal placement to maximize environmental benefits remains a pressing challenge. Leveraging Operational Research (OR) tools, we propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model that integrates multiple factors, including urban challenges, physical constraints, clustering techniques, convolution theory, and fairness considerations. This model determines the optimal placement of NBSs by addressing metrics such as ground temperature, air quality, and accessibility to green spaces. Through several case study analyses, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving environmental and social indicators. This research holds implications for policy and practice, empowering urban planners and policymakers to make informed decisions regarding NBS implementation. Such decisions ensure that investments in urban greening yield maximum environmental, social, and economic benefits.</description>

      <title>Maximum Power Transfer for Nonlinear State Space Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Maximum Power Transfer theorem of linear electrical network theory is generalized to the setting of a nonlinear state space system connected to a source. This yields a state space version of the input-output operator results of Wyatt (1988). Key tool in the analysis is the formulation of a Hamiltonian input-output system, which is closely related to Pontryagin's Maximum principle. The adjoint variational system incorporated in this system defines an optimal load. The structure of such an optimal load is investigated for classes of physical systems.</description>

      <title>Towards high-fidelity wind farm layout optimization using polynomial chaos expansion and Kriging model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a wind farm layout optimization framework that integrates polynomial chaos expansion, a Kriging model, and the expected improvement algorithm. The proposed framework addresses the computational challenges associated with high-fidelity wind farm simulations by significantly reducing the number of function evaluations required for accurate annual energy production predictions. The polynomial chaos expansion-based prediction method achieves exceptional accuracy with reduced computational cost for over 96%, significantly lowering the expense of training the ensuing surrogate model. The Kriging model, combined with a genetic algorithm, is used for surrogate-based optimization, achieving comparable performance to direct optimization at a much-reduced computational cost. The integration of the expected improvement algorithm enhances the global optimization capability of the framework, allowing it to escape local optima and achieve results that are either nearly identical to or even outperform those obtained through direct optimization. The feasibility of the polynomial chaos expansion-Kriging framework is demonstrated through four case studies, including the optimization of wind farms with 8, 16, and 32 turbines using low-fidelity wake models, and a high-fidelity case using computational fluid dynamics simulations. The results show that the proposed framework is highly effective in optimizing wind farm layouts, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining or improving the accuracy of annual energy production predictions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Randomized Stochastic Accelerated Gradient (RSAG) method, utilizing either constant or adaptive step sizes, for stochastic optimization problems with generalized smooth objective functions. Under relaxed affine variance assumptions for the stochastic gradient noise, we establish high-probability convergence rates of order $\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\log(1/\delta)/T}\right)$ for function value gaps in the convex setting, and for the squared gradient norms in the non-convex setting. Furthermore, when the noise parameters are sufficiently small, the convergence rate improves to $\tilde{O}\left(\log(1/\delta)/T\right)$, where $T$ denotes the total number of iterations and $\delta$ is the probability margin.</description>

      <title>Error Bound Analysis for the Regularized Loss of Deep Linear Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11152v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization foundations of deep linear networks have received significant attention lately. However, due to the non-convexity and hierarchical structure, analyzing the regularized loss of deep linear networks remains a challenging task. In this work, we study the local geometric landscape of the regularized squared loss of deep linear networks, providing a deeper understanding of its optimization properties. Specifically, we characterize the critical point set and establish an error-bound property for all critical points under mild conditions. Notably, we identify the sufficient and necessary conditions under which the error bound holds. To support our theoretical findings, we conduct numerical experiments demonstrating that gradient descent exhibits linear convergence when optimizing the regularized loss of deep linear networks.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimization of Inventory at Large-scale Supply Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's global supply chains face growing challenges due to rapidly changing market conditions, increased network complexity and inter-dependency, and dynamic uncertainties in supply, demand, and other factors. To combat these challenges, organizations employ Material Requirements Planning (MRP) software solutions to set inventory stock buffers - for raw materials, work-in-process goods, and finished products - to help them meet customer service levels. However, holding excess inventory further complicates operations and can lock up millions of dollars of capital that could be otherwise deployed. Furthermore, most commercially available MRP solutions fall short in considering uncertainties and do not result in optimal solutions for modern enterprises.
  At C3 AI, we fundamentally reformulate the inventory management problem as a constrained stochastic optimization. We then propose a simulation-optimization framework that minimizes inventory and related costs while maintaining desired service levels. The framework's goal is to find the optimal reorder parameters that minimize costs subject to a pre-defined service-level constraint and all other real-world operational constraints. These optimal reorder parameters can be fed back into an MRP system to drive optimal order placement, or used to place optimal orders directly. This approach has proven successful in reducing inventory levels by 10-35 percent, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars of economic benefit for major enterprises at a global scale.</description>

      <title>Provable and Practical Online Learning Rate Adaptation with Hypergradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the convergence properties of the hypergradient descent method (HDM), a 25-year-old heuristic originally proposed for adaptive stepsize selection in stochastic first-order methods. We provide the first rigorous convergence analysis of HDM using the online learning framework of [Gao24] and apply this analysis to develop new state-of-the-art adaptive gradient methods with empirical and theoretical support. Notably, HDM automatically identifies the optimal stepsize for the local optimization landscape and achieves local superlinear convergence. Our analysis explains the instability of HDM reported in the literature and proposes efficient strategies to address it. We also develop two HDM variants with heavy-ball and Nesterov momentum. Experiments on deterministic convex problems show HDM with heavy-ball momentum (HDM-HB) exhibits robust performance and significantly outperforms other adaptive first-order methods. Moreover, HDM-HB often matches the performance of L-BFGS, an efficient and practical quasi-Newton method, using less memory and cheaper iterations.</description>

      <title>An Interior-Point Algorithm for Continuous Nonlinearly Constrained Optimization with Noisy Function and Derivative Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An algorithm based on the interior-point methodology for solving continuous nonlinearly constrained optimization problems is proposed, analyzed, and tested. The distinguishing feature of the algorithm is that it presumes that only noisy values of the objective and constraint functions and their first-order derivatives are available. The algorithm is based on a combination of a previously proposed interior-point algorithm that allows inexact subproblem solutions and recently proposed algorithms for solving bound- and equality-constrained optimization problems with only noisy function and derivative values. It is shown that the new interior-point algorithm drives a stationarity measure below a threshold that depends on bounds on the noise in the function and derivative values. The results of numerical experiments show that the algorithm is effective across a wide range of problems.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-Time and Hyperexponential Concurrent Learning with Partially Corrupted Datasets: A Hybrid Dynamical Systems Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of concurrent learning (CL) algorithms designed to solve parameter estimation problems with convergence rates ranging from hyperexponential to prescribed-time while utilizing alternating datasets during the learning process. The proposed algorithm employs a broad class of dynamic gains, from exponentially growing to finite-time blow-up gains, enabling either enhanced convergence rates or user-prescribed convergence time independent of the dataset's richness. The CL algorithm can handle applications involving switching between multiple datasets that may have varying degrees of richness and potential corruption. The main result establishes convergence rates faster than any exponential while guaranteeing uniform global ultimate boundedness in the presence of disturbances, with an ultimate bound that shrinks to zero as the magnitude of measurement disturbances and corrupted data decreases. The stability analysis leverages tools from hybrid dynamical systems theory, along with a dilation/contraction argument on the hybrid time domains of the solutions. The algorithm and main results are illustrated via a numerical example.</description>

      <title>SPLD polynomial optimization and bounded degree SOS hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new class of structured polynomials, which we dub the {\it separable plus lower degree {\rm (SPLD in short)} polynomials}, is introduced. The formal definition of an SPLD polynomial, which extends the concept of the SPQ polynomial (Ahmadi et al. in Math Oper Res 48:1316--1343, 2023), is defined. A type of bounded degree SOS hierarchy (BSOS-SPLD) is proposed to efficiently solve the optimization problems with SPLD polynomials, and several numerical examples are performed much better than the bounded degree SOS hierarchy (Lasserre et al. in EURO J Comput Optim 5:87--117, 2017). An exact SOS relaxation for a class of convex SPLD polynomial optimization problems is proposed. Finally, an application of SPLD polynomials to polynomial regression problems in statistics is presented.</description>

      <title>Simulation-Based Optimization for Policy Incentives and Planning of Hybrid Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transitioning to renewable power generation is often difficult for remote or isolated communities, due to generation intermittency and high cost barriers. Our paper presents a simulation-based optimization approach for the design of policy incentives and planning of microgrids with renewable energy sources, targeting isolated communities. We propose a novel framework that integrates stochastic simulation to account for weather uncertainty and system availability while optimizing mi- crogrid configurations and policy incentives. Utilizing the mixed- variable Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (MSPSA) algorithm, our method demonstrates a significant reduction in Net Present Cost (NPC) for microgrids, achieving a 68.1% reduction in total costs in a case study conducted on Popova Island. The results indicate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the economic viability of microgrids while promoting cleaner energy solutions. Future research directions include refining uncertainty models and exploring applications in grid-connected microgrids.</description>

      <title>Weak Closed-loop Solvability for Discrete-time Linear-Quadratic Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the open-loop, closed-loop, and weak closed-loop solvability for discrete-time linear-quadratic (LQ) control problem is considered due to the fact that it is always open-loop optimal solvable if the LQ control problem is closed-loop optimal solvable but not vice versa. The contributions are two-fold. On the one hand, the equivalent relationship between the closed-loop optimal solvability and the solution of the generalized Riccati equation is given. On the other hand, when the system is merely open-loop solvable, we have found the equivalent existence form of the optimal solution by perturbation method, which is said to be a weak closed-loop solution. Moreover, it obtains that there is an open-loop optimal control with a linear feedback form of the state. The essential technique is to solve the forward and backward difference equations by iteration. An example sheds light on the theoretical results established.</description>

      <title>A New Lyapunov-like Stability Inequality with an \textit{Asymmetric} Matrix and Application to Suboptimal LQ Control Design (to be corrected)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyapunov inequality is an indispensable tool for stability analysis in the linear control theory. This work proposes a new variant of this inequality where-in the constituent matrix is allowed to be asymmetric. After developing the stability conditions based on the proposed inequality for a class of linear systems, we utilize these conditions to derive new results for the suboptimal linear quadratic control problem where we characterize the cost of the stabilizing controllers. We also demonstrate, by a numerical example, that the proposed results can be easily molded for the structured suboptimal consensus protocol design for multi-agent system where we also see that the asymmetry condition of the design matrix turns up inherently.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of the jump set and jump amplitudes in one-dimensional TV denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of denoising a one-dimensional scalar-valued function by minimizing the sum of an $L^2$ fidelity term and the total variation, scaled by a regularization parameter. This study focuses on proving that the jump set of solutions, corresponding to discontinuities or edges, as well as the amplitude of the jumps are nonincreasing as the regularization parameter increases. Our results apply to input functions in $L^\infty$ with left and right approximate limits everywhere, extending beyond the traditional setting of functions of bounded variation. The proof leverages competitor constructions and convexity properties of the taut string problem, a well-known equivalent formulation of the TV model. Such a monotonicity property reflects that the extent to which geometric and topological features of the original signal are preserved is consistent with the amount of smoothing desired when formulating the denoising method.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimization of Rank-Dependent Models with Uncertain Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies distributionally robust optimization for a large class of risk measures with ambiguity sets defined by $\phi$-divergences. The risk measures are allowed to be non-linear in probabilities, are represented by a Choquet integral possibly induced by a probability weighting function, and include many well-known examples (for example, CVaR, Mean-Median Deviation, Gini-type). Optimization for this class of robust risk measures is challenging due to their rank-dependent nature. We show that for many types of probability weighting functions including concave, convex and inverse $S$-shaped, the robust optimization problem can be reformulated into a rank-independent problem. In the case of a concave probability weighting function, the problem can be further reformulated into a convex optimization problem with finitely many constraints that admits explicit conic representability for a collection of canonical examples. While the number of constraints in general scales exponentially with the dimension of the state space, we circumvent this dimensionality curse and provide two types of upper and lower bounds algorithms.They yield tight upper and lower bounds on the exact optimal value and are formally shown to converge asymptotically. This is illustrated numerically in two examples given by a robust newsvendor problem and a robust portfolio choice problem.</description>

      <title>On Data-Driven Robust Optimization With Multiple Uncertainty Subsets: Unified Uncertainty Set Representation and Mitigating Conservatism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing uncertainty sets as unions of multiple subsets has emerged as an effective approach for creating compact and flexible uncertainty representations in data-driven robust optimization (RO). This paper focuses on two separate research questions. The first concerns the computational challenge in applying these uncertainty sets in RO-based predictive control. To address this, a monolithic mixed-integer representation of the uncertainty set is proposed to uniformly describe the union of multiple subsets, enabling the computation of the worst-case uncertainty scenario across all subsets within a single mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The second research question focuses on mitigating the conservatism of conventional RO formulations by leveraging the structure of the uncertainty set. To achieve this, a novel objective function is proposed to exploit the uncertainty set structure and integrate the existing RO and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) formulations, yielding less conservative solutions than conventional RO formulations while avoiding the high-dimensional continuous uncertainty distributions and incurring high computational burden typically associated with existing DRO formulations. Given the proposed formulations, numerically efficient computation methods based on column-and-constraint generation (CCG) are also developed. Extensive simulations across three case studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.</description>

Abstract: Recently, domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability has been the central assumption %in order robustness results on the to ensure robustness in the sense of exponential decay of spatially localized perturbations in optimally controlled evolution equations. In the present paper we analyze a chain of transport equations with boundary and point controls with regard to this property. Both for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary and coupling conditions, we show a necessary and sufficient criterion on control domains which allow for the domain-uniform stabilization of this equation. We illustrate the results by means of a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Feasibility Evaluation of Quadratic Programs for Constrained Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a computationally-efficient method for evaluating the feasibility of Quadratic Programs (QPs) for online constrained control. Based on the duality principle, we first show that the feasibility of a QP can be determined by the solution of a properly-defined Linear Program (LP). Our analysis yields a LP that can be solved more efficiently compared to the original QP problem, and more importantly, is simpler in form and can be solved more efficiently compared to existing methods that assess feasibility via LPs. The computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing methods for feasibility evaluation is demonstrated in comparative case studies as well as a feasible-constraint selection problem, indicating its promise for online feasibility evaluation of optimization-based controllers.</description>

      <title>Planning minimum regret $CO_2$ pipeline networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to a low-carbon economy necessitates effective carbon capture and storage (CCS) solutions, particularly for hard-to-abate sectors. Herein, pipeline networks are indispensable for cost-efficient $CO_2$ transportation over long distances. However, there is deep uncertainty regarding which industrial sectors will participate in such systems. This poses a significant challenge due to substantial investments as well as the lengthy planning and development timelines required for $CO_2$ pipeline projects, which are further constrained by limited upgrade options for already built infrastructure. The economies of scale inherent in pipeline construction exacerbate these challenges, leading to potential regret over earlier decisions. While numerous models were developed to optimize the initial layout of pipeline infrastructure based on known demand, a gap exists in addressing the incremental development of infrastructure in conjunction with deep uncertainty. Hence, this paper introduces a novel optimization model for $CO_2$ pipeline infrastructure development, minimizing regret as its objective function and incorporating various upgrade options, such as looping and pressure increases. The model's effectiveness is also demonstrated by presenting a comprehensive case study of Germany's cement and lime industries. The developed approach quantitatively illustrates the trade-off between different options, which can help in deriving effective strategies for $CO_2$ infrastructure development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monotonicity of a mapping implies its pseudomonotonicity and hence quasimonotonocity, the converse is not true. In this note we intend to study the situations under which quasimono tonicity of a mapping implies its monotonicity. Thus we generalize some results in the literature related to the connection between monotonocity and its generalized classes for multi-valued mappings via translation maps in real topological spaces. No differentiability assumption is required but continuity assumption is imposed.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Lantana camara: An Entropy-Based Sustainable Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Framing control policies to mitigate the impact of invasive plants on indigenous biodiversity within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) framework is the primary objective of this work. Using reported ecological dynamics of the invasive species \textit{Lantana camara}, we develop a minimal three-species network model, where each node follows generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) dynamical equations. Employing Lie algebra and network control theory, we establish the model's controllability and accessibility criteria. Through nonlinear optimization programming, we derive sustainable policies for controlling abundances of \textit{Lantana camara}. We also have used Shannon entropy as an indicator to assess the sustainability of these optimal policies. The analysis of the sensitivity measured using this technique reveals that the control strategy is critically dependent on the ratio of the intrinsic growth rates of the \textit{Lantana camara} and the control plant. Thus, we get a modular algorithmic decision support mechanism for designing control policies to manage \textit{Lantana camara} abundances.</description>

      <title>Efficient Ptychography Reconstruction using the Hessian operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ptychography reconstruction is typically performed using first-order methods, such as gradient descent, due to their computational efficiency. Higher-order methods, while potentially more accurate, are often prohibitively expensive in terms of computation. In this study, we present a mathematical formulation for reconstruction using second-order information, derived from an efficient computation of the bilinear Hessian and Hessian operator. The formulation is provided for both Gaussian and Poisson models, enabling the simultaneous reconstruction of the object, probe, and positions. Synthetic data tests, along with experimental near-field ptychography data processing, demonstrate an 10x performance improvement compared to first-order methods. The derived formulas for computing the Hessians, along with the strategies for incorporating them into optimization schemes, are well-structured and easily adaptable to various ptychography problem formulations.</description>

      <title>Which Features are Best for Successor Features?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, universal successor features (SFs) are a way to provide zero-shot adaptation to new tasks at test time: they provide optimal policies for all downstream reward functions lying in the linear span of a set of base features. But it is unclear what constitutes a good set of base features, that could be useful for a wide set of downstream tasks beyond their linear span. Laplacian eigenfunctions (the eigenfunctions of $\Delta+\Delta^\ast$ with $\Delta$ the Laplacian operator of some reference policy and $\Delta^\ast$ that of the time-reversed dynamics) have been argued to play a role, and offer good empirical performance.
  Here, for the first time, we identify the optimal base features based on an objective criterion of downstream performance, in a non-tautological way without assuming the downstream tasks are linear in the features. We do this for three generic classes of downstream tasks: reaching a random goal state, dense random Gaussian rewards, and random ``scattered'' sparse rewards. The features yielding optimal expected downstream performance turn out to be the \emph{same} for these three task families. They do not coincide with Laplacian eigenfunctions in general, though they can be expressed from $\Delta$: in the simplest case (deterministic environment and decay factor $\gamma$ close to $1$), they are the eigenfunctions of $\Delta^{-1}+(\Delta^{-1})^\ast$.
  We obtain these results under an assumption of large behavior cloning regularization with respect to a reference policy, a setting often used for offline RL. Along the way, we get new insights into KL-regularized\option{natural} policy gradient, and into the lack of SF information in the norm of Bellman gaps.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Feedback Linearization and LQG/LTR Control: A Comparative Study for a Single-Machine Infinite-Bus System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of three advanced control strategies for a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system: the nonlinear feedback linearizing controller (NFLC), the integral-NFLC (INFLC), and the linear-quadratic-Gaussian/loop transfer recovery (LQG/LTR) control. The NFLC and INFLC techniques use exact feedback linearization to precisely cancel the SMIB system nonlinearities, enabling the use of decentralized, linear, and optimal controllers for the decoupled generator and turbine-governor systems while remaining unaffected by the SMIB system's internal dynamics and operating conditions. In contrast, the LQG/LTR approach employs an enhanced Kalman filter, designed using the LTR procedure and a detailed frequency-domain loop-shaping analysis, to achieve a reasonable trade-off between optimal performance, noise/disturbance rejection, robustness recovery, and stability margins for the SMIB system. We provide a control synthesis framework for constructing practical, verifiable, scalable, and resilient linear and nonlinear controllers for SMIB and multi-machine power systems by utilizing a high-fidelity plant model for validation, a reduced-order control-design model, and the correlations between the two models' control inputs. Rigorous simulations and comparative analysis of the proposed controllers and a full-state linear-quadratic regulator show the benefits, constraints, and trade-offs of each controller in terms of transient response, steady-state error, robustness, rotor angle stability, frequency control, and voltage regulation under different operating conditions. Ultimately, this study aims to guide the selection of appropriate control strategies for large-scale power systems, enhancing the overall resilience and reliability of the electric grid.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Policy Mirror Descent Beyond Compatible Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern policy optimization methods roughly follow the policy mirror descent (PMD) algorithmic template, for which there are by now numerous theoretical convergence results. However, most of these either target tabular environments, or can be applied effectively only when the class of policies being optimized over satisfies strong closure conditions, which is typically not the case when working with parametric policy classes in large-scale environments. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for PMD for general policy classes where we replace the closure conditions with a strictly weaker variational gradient dominance assumption, and obtain upper bounds on the rate of convergence to the best-in-class policy. Our main result leverages a novel notion of smoothness with respect to a local norm induced by the occupancy measure of the current policy, and casts PMD as a particular instance of smooth non-convex optimization in non-Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Span-Agnostic Optimal Sample Complexity and Oracle Inequalities for Average-Reward RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of finding an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a generative model. The minimax optimal span-based complexity of $\widetilde{O}(SAH/\varepsilon^2)$, where $H$ is the span of the optimal bias function, has only been achievable with prior knowledge of the value of $H$. Prior-knowledge-free algorithms have been the objective of intensive research, but several natural approaches provably fail to achieve this goal. We resolve this problem, developing the first algorithms matching the optimal span-based complexity without $H$ knowledge, both when the dataset size is fixed and when the suboptimality level $\varepsilon$ is fixed. Our main technique combines the discounted reduction approach with a method for automatically tuning the effective horizon based on empirical confidence intervals or lower bounds on performance, which we term horizon calibration. We also develop an empirical span penalization approach, inspired by sample variance penalization, which satisfies an oracle inequality performance guarantee. In particular this algorithm can outperform the minimax complexity in benign settings such as when there exist near-optimal policies with span much smaller than $H$.</description>

      <title>Towards identifying possible fault-tolerant advantage of quantum linear system algorithms in terms of space, time and energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11239v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing, a prominent non-Von Neumann paradigm beyond Moore's law, can offer superpolynomial speedups for certain problems. Yet its advantages in efficiency for tasks like machine learning remain under investigation, and quantum noise complicates resource estimations and classical comparisons. We provide a detailed estimation of space, time, and energy resources for fault-tolerant superconducting devices running the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, a quantum linear system solver relevant to linear algebra and machine learning. Excluding memory and data transfer, possible quantum advantages over the classical conjugate gradient method could emerge at $N \approx 2^{33} \sim 2^{48}$ or even lower, requiring ${O}(10^5)$ physical qubits, ${O}(10^{12}\sim10^{13})$ Joules, and ${O}(10^6)$ seconds under surface code fault-tolerance with three types of magic state distillation (15-1, 116-12, 225-1). Key parameters include condition number, sparsity, and precision $\kappa, s\approx{O}(10\sim100)$, $\epsilon\sim0.01$, and physical error $10^{-5}$. Our resource estimator adjusts $N, \kappa, s, \epsilon$, providing a map of quantum-classical boundaries and revealing where a practical quantum advantage may arise. Our work quantitatively determine how advanced a fault-tolerant quantum computer should be to achieve possible, significant benefits on problems related to real-world.</description>

      <title>Learning Surrogate Potential Mean Field Games via Gaussian Processes: A Data-Driven Approach to Ill-Posed Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) describe the collective behavior of large populations of interacting agents. In this work, we tackle ill-posed inverse problems in potential MFGs, aiming to recover the agents' population, momentum, and environmental setup from limited, noisy measurements and partial observations. These problems are ill-posed because multiple MFG configurations can explain the same data, or different parameters can yield nearly identical observations. Nonetheless, they remain crucial in practice for real-world scenarios where data are inherently sparse or noisy, or where the MFG structure is not fully determined. Our focus is on finding surrogate MFGs that accurately reproduce the observed data despite these challenges. We propose two Gaussian process (GP)-based frameworks: an inf-sup formulation and a bilevel approach. The choice between them depends on whether the unknown parameters introduce concavity in the objective. In the inf-sup framework, we use the linearity of GPs and their parameterization structure to maintain convex-concave properties, allowing us to apply standard convex optimization algorithms. In the bilevel framework, we employ a gradient-descent-based algorithm and introduce two methods for computing the outer gradient. The first method leverages an existing solver for the inner potential MFG and applies automatic differentiation, while the second adopts an adjoint-based strategy that computes the outer gradient independently of the inner solver. Our numerical experiments show that when sufficient prior information is available, the unknown parameters can be accurately recovered. Otherwise, if prior information is limited, the inverse problem is ill-posed, but our frameworks can still produce surrogate MFG models that closely match observed data.</description>

      <title>On the kernel learning problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical kernel ridge regression problem aims to find the best fit for the output $Y$ as a function of the input data $X\in \mathbb{R}^d$, with a fixed choice of regularization term imposed by a given choice of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, such as a Sobolev space. Here we consider a generalization of the kernel ridge regression problem, by introducing an extra matrix parameter $U$, which aims to detect the scale parameters and the feature variables in the data, and thereby improve the efficiency of kernel ridge regression. This naturally leads to a nonlinear variational problem to optimize the choice of $U$. We study various foundational mathematical aspects of this variational problem, and in particular how this behaves in the presence of multiscale structures in the data.</description>

      <title>Double Momentum and Error Feedback for Clipping with Fast Rates and Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong Differential Privacy (DP) and Optimization guarantees are two desirable properties for a method in Federated Learning (FL). However, existing algorithms do not achieve both properties at once: they either have optimal DP guarantees but rely on restrictive assumptions such as bounded gradients/bounded data heterogeneity, or they ensure strong optimization performance but lack DP guarantees. To address this gap in the literature, we propose and analyze a new method called Clip21-SGD2M based on a novel combination of clipping, heavy-ball momentum, and Error Feedback. In particular, for non-convex smooth distributed problems with clients having arbitrarily heterogeneous data, we prove that Clip21-SGD2M has optimal convergence rate and also near optimal (local-)DP neighborhood. Our numerical experiments on non-convex logistic regression and training of neural networks highlight the superiority of Clip21-SGD2M over baselines in terms of the optimization performance for a given DP-budget.</description>

      <title>Computing and Learning Mean Field Equilibria with Scalar Interactions: Algorithms and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean field equilibrium (MFE) has emerged as a computationally tractable solution concept for large dynamic games. However, computing MFE remains challenging due to nonlinearities and the absence of contraction properties, limiting its reliability for counterfactual analysis and comparative statics. This paper focuses on MFE in dynamic models where agents interact through a scalar function of the population distribution, referred to as the \textit{scalar interaction function}. Such models naturally arise in a wide range of applications in operations and economics, including quality ladder models, inventory competition, online marketplaces, and heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic models. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce iterative algorithms that leverage the scalar interaction structure and are guaranteed to converge to the MFE under mild assumptions. Unlike existing approaches, our algorithms do not rely on monotonicity or contraction properties, significantly broadening their applicability. Furthermore, we provide a model-free algorithm that learns the MFE by employing simulation and reinforcement learning techniques such as Q-learning and policy gradient methods without requiring prior knowledge of payoff or transition functions. We establish finite-time performance bounds for this algorithm under technical Lipschitz continuity assumptions. We apply our algorithms to classic models of dynamic competition, such as capacity competition, and to competitive models motivated by online marketplaces, including ridesharing, dynamic reputation, and inventory competition, as well as to social learning models. Using our algorithms, we derive reliable comparative statics results that illustrate how key market parameters influence equilibrium outcomes in these stylized models, providing insights that could inform the design of competitive systems in these contexts.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Thinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal in thinning is to summarize a dataset using a small set of representative points. Remarkably, sub-Gaussian thinning algorithms like Kernel Halving and Compress can match the quality of uniform subsampling while substantially reducing the number of summary points. However, existing guarantees cover only a restricted range of distributions and kernel-based quality measures and suffer from pessimistic dimension dependence. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a new low-rank analysis of sub-Gaussian thinning that applies to any distribution and any kernel, guaranteeing high-quality compression whenever the kernel or data matrix is approximately low-rank. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the techniques, we design practical sub-Gaussian thinning approaches that improve upon the best known guarantees for approximating attention in transformers, accelerating stochastic gradient training through reordering, and distinguishing distributions in near-linear time.</description>

      <title>Fractional Sobolev paths on Wasserstein spaces and their energy-minimizing particle representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of Kantorovich's optimal transportation problem. Given a prescribed family of time-dependent probability measures $(\mu_t)$, we aim to find, among all path-continuous stochastic processes whose one-dimensional time marginals coincide with $(\mu_t)$ (if there is any), a process that minimizes a given energy. After discussing a sufficient condition for the energy to ensure the existence of a minimizer, we investigate fractional Sobolev energies. Given a deterministic path $(\mu_t)$ on a $p$-Wasserstein space with fractional Sobolev regularity $W^{\alpha,p}$, where $1/p &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, we provide conditions under which we prove the existence of a process that minimizes the energy and construct a process that realizes the regularity of $(\mu_t)$. While continuous paths of low regularity on Wasserstein spaces naturally appear in stochastic analysis, they can also arise deterministically as solutions to the continuity equation. This paper is devoted to the deterministic setting to gain some understanding of the required conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell heterogeneity plays an important role in patient responses to drug treatments. In many cancers, it is associated with poor treatment outcomes. Many modern drug combination therapies aim to exploit cell heterogeneity, but determining how to optimise responses from heterogeneous cell populations while accounting for multi-drug synergies remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce and analyse a general optimal control framework that can be used to model the treatment response of multiple cell populations that are treated with multiple drugs that mutually interact. In this framework, we model the effect of multiple drugs on the cell populations using a system of coupled semi-linear ordinary differential equations and derive general results for the optimal solutions. We then apply this framework to three canonical examples and discuss the wider question of how to relate mathematical optimality to clinically observable outcomes, introducing a systematic approach to propose qualitatively different classes of drug dosing inspired by optimal control.</description>

      <title>Safe continual learning in model predictive control with prescribed bounds on the tracking error</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10910v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a three-component Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm to achieve output-reference tracking with prescribed performance for continuous-time nonlinear systems. One component is so-called funnel MPC, which achieves reference tracking with prescribed performance for the model output for suitable models. Recently, this MPC algorithm has been combined with a model-free reactive feedback controller (second component) to account for model-plant mismatches, bounded disturbances, and uncertainties. By construction, this two-component controller defines a robust funnel MPC algorithm. It achieves output-reference tracking within prescribed bounds on the tracking error for a class of unknown nonlinear systems. In this paper, we extend the robust funnel MPC by a machine learning component to adapt the underlying model to the system data and, thus, improve the contribution of MPC. We derive sufficient structural conditions to define a class of models for funnel MPC, and provide a characterization of suitable learning schemes. Since robust funnel MPC is inherently robust and the evolution of the tracking error in the prescribed performance funnel is guaranteed, the additional learning component is able to perform the learning task online -- even without an initial model or offline training.</description>

      <title>Assortment Optimization with Visibility Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in e-retail and online advertising, we study the problem of assortment optimization under visibility constraints, that we refer to as APV. Here, we are given a universe of substitutable products and a stream of customers. The objective is to determine the optimal assortment of products to offer to each customer in order to maximize the total expected revenue, subject to exogenously-given visibility constraints, stating that each product should be shown to a minimum number of customers. We assume that customer choices follow a Multinomial Logit model (MNL). We provide a structural characterization of optimal assortments and present a linear time algorithm for solving APV. To this end, we introduce a novel function called the ``expanded revenue" of an assortment and establish its supermodularity; our algorithm takes advantage of this structural property. Additionally, we prove that APV can be formulated as a compact linear program. Next, we consider APV with cardinality constraints, which limit the maximum number of products that can be included in an assortment. We prove this problem to be strongly NP-hard and not admitting a Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS), even when all products have identical prices. Subsequently, we devise a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) for APV under cardinality constraints with identical prices. We also examine the revenue loss resulting from the enforcement of visibility constraints, comparing it to the unconstrained problem. To offset this loss, we propose a novel strategy to distribute the loss incurred among the products subject to visibility constraints, charging each vendor an amount proportional to their product's contribution to the revenue loss.</description>

      <title>On the Value of Linear Quadratic Zero-sum Difference Games with Multiplicative Randomness: Existence and Achievability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a wireless networked control system (WNCS) with multiple controllers and multiple attackers. The dynamic interaction between the controllers and the attackers is modeled as a linear quadratic (LQ) zero-sum difference game with multiplicative randomness induced by the the multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) wireless fading. The existence of the game value is of significant importance to the LQ zero-sum game. If it exists, the value characterizes the minimum loss that the controllers can secure against the attackers' best possible strategies. However, if the value does not exist, then there will be no Nash equilibrium policies for the controllers and attackers. Therefore, we focus on analyzing the existence and achievability of the value of the LQ zero-sum game. In stark contrast to existing literature, where the existence of the game value depends heavily on the controllability of the closed-loop systems, the multiplicative randomness induced by the MIMO wireless channel fading may destroy closed-loop controllability and introduce intermittent controllability or almost sure uncontrollability. We first establish a general sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of the game value. This condition relies on the solvability of a modified game algebraic Riccati equation (MGARE) under an implicit concavity constraint, which is generally difficult to verify due to the multiplicative randomness. We next introduce a novel positive semidefinite (PSD) kernel decomposition method induced by multiplicative randomness. A verifiable tight sufficient condition is then obtained by applying the proposed PSD kernel decomposition to the constrained MGARE. Under the existence condition, we finally construct a closed-form saddle-point policy based on the minimal solution to the constrained MGARE, which is able to achieve the game value in a certain class of admissible policies.</description>

      <title>Fast projection onto the intersection of simplex and singly linear constraint and its generalized Jacobian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving the distributional worst-case in the distributionally robust optimization problem is equivalent to finding the projection onto the intersection of simplex and singly linear inequality constraint. This projection is a key component in the design of efficient first-order algorithms. This paper focuses on developing efficient algorithms for computing the projection onto the intersection of simplex and singly linear inequality constraint. Based on the Lagrangian duality theory, the studied projection can be obtained by solving a univariate nonsmooth equation. We employ an algorithm called LRSA, which leverages the Lagrangian duality approach and the secant method to compute this projection. In this algorithm, a modified secant method is specifically designed to solve the piecewise linear equation. Additionally, due to semismoothness of the resulting equation, the semismooth Newton (SSN) method is a natural choice for solving it. Numerical experiments demonstrate that LRSA outperforms SSN algorithm and the state-of-the-art optimization solver called Gurobi. Moreover, we derive explicit formulas for the generalized HS-Jacobian of the projection, which are essential for designing second-order nonsmooth Newton algorithms.</description>

      <title>qPOTS: Efficient batch multiobjective Bayesian optimization via Pareto optimal Thompson sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical evolutionary approaches for multiobjective optimization are quite accurate but incur a lot of queries to the objectives; this can be prohibitive when objectives are expensive oracles. A sample-efficient approach to solving multiobjective optimization is via Gaussian process (GP) surrogates and Bayesian optimization (BO). Multiobjective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) involves the construction of an acquisition function which is optimized to acquire new observation candidates sequentially. This ``inner'' optimization can be hard due to various reasons: acquisition functions being nonconvex, nondifferentiable and/or unavailable in analytical form; batch sampling usually exacerbates these problems and the success of MOBO heavily relies on this inner optimization. This, ultimately, affects their sample efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Thompson sampling (TS) based approach ($q\texttt{POTS}$). Whereas TS chooses candidates according to the probability that they are optimal, $q\texttt{POTS}$ chooses candidates according to the probability that they are Pareto optimal. Instead of a hard acquisition function optimization, $q\texttt{POTS}~$ solves a cheap multiobjective optimization on the GP posteriors with evolutionary approaches. This way we get the best of both worlds: accuracy of evolutionary approaches and sample-efficiency of MOBO. New candidates are chosen on the posterior GP Pareto frontier according to a maximin distance criterion. $q\texttt{POTS}~$ is endowed with theoretical guarantees, a natural exploration-exploitation trade-off, and superior empirical performance.</description>

      <title>On convergence analysis of feedback control with integral action and discontinuous relay perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider third-order dynamic systems which have an integral feedback action and discontinuous relay disturbance. More specifically for the applications, the focus is on the integral plus state-feedback control of the motion systems with discontinuous Coulomb-type friction. We recall the stiction region is globally attractive where the resulting hybrid system has also solutions in Filippov sense, while the motion trajectories remain in that idle state (called in tribology as stiction) until the formulated sliding-mode condition is violated by the growing integral feedback quantity. We analyze the conditions for occurrence of the slowly converging stick-slip cycles. We also show that the hybrid system is globally but only asymptotically stable, and almost always not exponentially. A particular case of the exponential convergence can appear for some initial values, assuming the characteristic equation of the linear subsystem has dominant real roots. Illustrative numerical examples are provided alongside with the developed analysis. In addition, a laboratory example is shown with experimental evidence to support the convergence analysis provided.</description>

      <title>Anytime Solvers for Variational Inequalities: the (Recursive) Safe Monotone Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09527v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper synthesizes anytime algorithms, in the form of continuous-time dynamical systems, to solve monotone variational inequalities. We introduce three algorithms that solve this problem: the projected monotone flow, the safe monotone flow, and the recursive safe monotone flow. The first two systems admit dual interpretations: either as projected dynamical systems or as dynamical systems controlled with a feedback controller specified by a quadratic program derived using techniques from safety-critical control. The third flow bypasses the need to solve quadratic programs along the trajectories by incorporating a dynamics whose equilibria precisely correspond to such solutions, and interconnecting the dynamical systems on different time scales. We perform a thorough analysis of the dynamical properties of all three systems. For the safe monotone flow, we show that equilibria correspond exactly with critical points of the original problem, and the constraint set is forward invariant and asymptotically stable. The additional assumption of convexity and monotonicity allows us to derive global stability guarantees, as well as establish the system is contracting when the constraint set is polyhedral. For the recursive safe monotone flow, we use tools from singular perturbation theory for contracting systems to show KKT points are locally exponentially stable and globally attracting, and obtain practical safety guarantees. We illustrate the performance of the flows on a two-player game example and also demonstrate the versatility for interconnection and regulation of dynamical processes of the safe monotone flow in an example of a receding horizon linear quadratic dynamic game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly study tilt stability and Lipschitz stability of convex optimization problems. Our characterizations are geometric and fully computable in many important cases. As a result, we apply our theory to the group Lasso problem and the nuclear norm minimization problem and reveal that the Lipschitz stability of the solution mapping in these problems is automatic whenever the solution mapping is single-valued.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Over-Relaxation Heavy-Ball Method: Achieving Global Accelerated Convergence with Broad Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The heavy-ball momentum method accelerates gradient descent with a momentum term but lacks accelerated convergence for general smooth strongly convex problems. This work introduces the Accelerated Over-Relaxation Heavy-Ball (AOR-HB) method, the first variant with provable global and accelerated convergence for such problems. AOR-HB closes a long-standing theoretical gap, extends to composite convex optimization and min-max problems, and achieves optimal complexity bounds. It offers three key advantages: (1) broad generalization ability, (2) potential to reshape acceleration techniques, and (3) conceptual clarity and elegance compared to existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a template to derive convergence rates for the following popular versions of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm on polytopes: vanilla Frank-Wolfe, Frank-Wolfe with away steps, Frank-Wolfe with blended pairwise steps, and Frank-Wolfe with in-face directions. Our template shows how the convergence rates follow from two affine-invariant properties of the problem, namely, error bound and extended curvature. These properties depend solely on the polytope and objective function but not on any affine-dependent object like norms. For each one of the above algorithms, we derive rates of convergence ranging from sublinear to linear depending on the degree of the error bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a novel $Q$-learning algorithm allowing to solve distributionally robust Markov decision problems for which the ambiguity set of probability measures can be chosen arbitrarily as long as it comprises only a finite amount of measures. Therefore, our approach goes beyond the well-studied cases involving ambiguity sets of balls around some reference measure with the distance to reference measure being measured with respect to the Wasserstein distance or the Kullback--Leibler divergence. Hence, our approach allows the applicant to create ambiguity sets better tailored to her needs and to solve the associated robust Markov decision problem via a $Q$-learning algorithm whose convergence is guaranteed by our main result. Moreover, we showcase in several numerical experiments the tractability of our approach.</description>

      <title>Regularization of Stationary Second-order Mean Field Game Partial Differential Inclusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean field Game (MFG) Partial Differential Inclusions (PDI) are generalizations of the system of Partial Differential Equations (PDE) of Lasry and Lions to situations where players in the game may have possibly nonunique optimal controls, and the resulting Hamiltonian is not required to be differentiable. We study second-order MFG PDI with convex, Lipschitz continuous, but possibly nondifferentiable Hamiltonians, and their approximation by systems of classical MFG PDE with regularized Hamiltonians. Under very broad conditions on the problem data, we show that, up to subsequences, the solutions of the regularized problems converge to solutions of the MFG PDI. In particular, we show the convergence of the value functions in the $H^1$-norm and of the densities in $L^q$-norms. Under stronger hypotheses on the problem data, we also show rates of convergence between the solutions of the original and regularized problems, without requiring any higher regularity of the solutions. We give concrete examples that demonstrate the sharpness of several aspects of the analysis.</description>

      <title>A Non-convex Optimization Approach of Searching Algebraic Degree Phase-type Representations for General Phase-type Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a continuous-time phase-type distribution, starting with its Laplace-Stieltjes transform, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for its minimal phase-type representation to have the same order as the algebraic degree of the Laplace-Stieltjes transform. To facilitate finding this minimal representation, we transform this condition equivalently into a quadratic nonconvex optimization problem, which can be effectively addressed using an alternating minimization algorithm. The algorithm convergence is also proved. Moreover, the method we develop for the continuous-time phase-type distributions can be directly used to the discrete-time phase-type distributions after establishing an equivalence between the minimal representation problems for continuous-time and discrete-times phase-type distributions.</description>

      <title>Normalizations of factorizations over convex cones and their effects on extension complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Factorizations over cones and their duals play central roles for many areas of mathematics and computer science. One of the reasons behind this is the ability to find a representation for various objects using a well-structured family of cones, where the representation is captured by the factorizations over these cones. Several major questions about factorizations over cones remain open even for such well-structured families of cones as non-negative orthants and positive semidefinite cones. Having said that, we possess a far better understanding of factorizations over non-negative orthants and positive semidefinite cones than over other families of cones. One of the key properties that led to this better understanding is the ability to normalize factorizations, i.e., to guarantee that the norms of the vectors involved in the factorizations are bounded in terms of an input and in terms of a constant dependent on the given cone. Our work aims at understanding which cones guarantee that factorizations over them can be normalized, and how this effects extension complexity of polytopes over such cones.</description>

      <title>The greedy side of the LASSO: New algorithms for weighted sparse recovery via loss function-based orthogonal matching pursuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a class of greedy algorithms for weighted sparse recovery by considering new loss function-based generalizations of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). Given a (regularized) loss function, the proposed algorithms alternate the iterative construction of the signal support via greedy index selection and a signal update based on solving a local data-fitting problem restricted to the current support. We show that greedy selection rules associated with popular weighted sparsity-promoting loss functions admit explicitly computable and simple formulas. Specifically, we consider $ \ell^0 $- and $ \ell^1 $-based versions of the weighted LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), the Square-Root LASSO (SR-LASSO) and the Least Absolute Deviations LASSO (LAD-LASSO). Through numerical experiments on Gaussian compressive sensing and high-dimensional function approximation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and empirically show that they inherit desirable characteristics from the corresponding loss functions, such as SR-LASSO's noise-blind optimal parameter tuning and LAD-LASSO's fault tolerance. In doing so, our study sheds new light on the connection between greedy sparse recovery and convex relaxation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15557v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel non-parametric learning paradigm for the identification of drift and diffusion coefficients of multi-dimensional non-linear stochastic differential equations, which relies upon discrete-time observations of the state. The key idea essentially consists of fitting a RKHS-based approximation of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation to such observations, yielding theoretical estimates of non-asymptotic learning rates which, unlike previous works, become increasingly tighter when the regularity of the unknown drift and diffusion coefficients becomes higher. Our method being kernel-based, offline pre-processing may be profitably leveraged to enable efficient numerical implementation, offering excellent balance between precision and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Efficient Alternating Minimization with Applications to Weighted Low Rank Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04169v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weighted low rank approximation is a fundamental problem in numerical linear algebra, and it has many applications in machine learning. Given a matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, a non-negative weight matrix $W \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{n \times n}$, a parameter $k$, the goal is to output two matrices $X,Y\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$ such that $\| W \circ (M - X Y^\top) \|_F$ is minimized, where $\circ$ denotes the Hadamard product. It naturally generalizes the well-studied low rank matrix completion problem. Such a problem is known to be NP-hard and even hard to approximate assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis [GG11, RSW16]. Meanwhile, alternating minimization is a good heuristic solution for weighted low rank approximation. In particular, [LLR16] shows that, under mild assumptions, alternating minimization does provide provable guarantees. In this work, we develop an efficient and robust framework for alternating minimization that allows the alternating updates to be computed approximately. For weighted low rank approximation, this improves the runtime of [LLR16] from $\|W\|_0k^2$ to $\|W\|_0 k$ where $\|W\|_0$ denotes the number of nonzero entries of the weight matrix. At the heart of our framework is a high-accuracy multiple response regression solver together with a robust analysis of alternating minimization.</description>

      <title>On diffusion-based generative models and their error bounds: The log-concave case with full convergence estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13584v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide full theoretical guarantees for the convergence behaviour of diffusion-based generative models under the assumption of strongly log-concave data distributions while our approximating class of functions used for score estimation is made of Lipschitz continuous functions avoiding any Lipschitzness assumption on the score function. We demonstrate via a motivating example, sampling from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean, the powerfulness of our approach. In this case, explicit estimates are provided for the associated optimization problem, i.e. score approximation, while these are combined with the corresponding sampling estimates. As a result, we obtain the best known upper bound estimates in terms of key quantities of interest, such as the dimension and rates of convergence, for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the data distribution (Gaussian with unknown mean) and our sampling algorithm.
  Beyond the motivating example and in order to allow for the use of a diverse range of stochastic optimizers, we present our results using an $L^2$-accurate score estimation assumption, which crucially is formed under an expectation with respect to the stochastic optimizer and our novel auxiliary process that uses only known information. This approach yields the best known convergence rate for our sampling algorithm.</description>

      <title>Multi-Player Resource-Sharing Games with Fair Reward Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05300v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers an online multi-player resource-sharing game with bandit feedback. Multiple players choose from a finite collection of resources in a time slotted system. In each time slot, each resource brings a random reward that is equally divided among the players who choose it. The reward vector is independent and identically distributed over the time slots. The statistics of the reward vector are unknown to the players. During each time slot, for each resource chosen by the first player, they receive as feedback the reward of the resource and the number of players who chose it, after the choice is made. We develop a novel Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm that learns the mean rewards using the feedback and maximizes the worst-case time-average expected reward of the first player. The algorithm gets within $\mathcal{O}(\log(T)/\sqrt{T})$ of optimality within $T$ time slots. The simulations depict fast convergence of the learnt policy in comparison to the worst-case optimal policy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An underdetermined generalized absolute value equation (GAVE) may have no solution, one solution, finitely many or infinitely many solutions. This paper is concerned with sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of solutions to an underdetermined GAVE. Particularly, sufficient conditions are established for an underdetermined GAVE to have infinitely many solutions with no zero entry that possess a particular or any given sign pattern. Iterative methods are proposed for the case when the underdetermined GAVE does have a solution. Some existing results for square GAVE are also extended.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of T\^atonnement for Linear Fisher Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: T\^atonnement is a simple, intuitive market process where prices are iteratively adjusted based on the difference between demand and supply. Many variants under different market assumptions have been studied and shown to converge to a market equilibrium, in some cases at a fast rate. However, the classical case of linear Fisher markets have long eluded the analyses, and it remains unclear whether t\^atonnement converges in this case. We show that, for a sufficiently small step size, the prices given by the t\^atonnement process are guaranteed to converge to equilibrium prices, up to a small approximation radius that depends on the stepsize. To achieve this, we consider the dual Eisenberg-Gale convex program in the price space, view t\^atonnement as subgradient descent on this convex program, and utilize last-iterate convergence results for subgradient descent under error bound conditions. In doing so, we show that the convex program satisfies a particular error bound condition, the quadratic growth condition, and that the price sequence generated by t\^atonnement is bounded above and away from zero. We also show that a similar convergence result holds for t\^atonnement in quasi-linear Fisher markets. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the theoretical linear convergence aligns with empirical observations.</description>

      <title>Disintegrated optimal transport for metric fiber bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a new two-parameter family of metrics on a subset of Borel probability measures on a general metric fiber bundle, called the $ \textit{disintegrated Monge--Kantorovich metrics}$. This family of metrics contains the classical Monge-Kantorovich metrics, linearized optimal transport distance, and generalizes the sliced and max-sliced Wasserstein metrics. We prove these metrics are complete, separable (except an endpoint case), geodesic spaces, with a dual representation. Additionally, we prove existence and duality for an associated barycenter problem, and provide conditions for uniqueness of the barycenter. These results on barycenter problems for the disintegrated Monge--Kantorovich metrics also yield the corresponding existence, duality, and uniqueness results for classical Monge--Kantorovich barycenters in a wide variety of spaces, including a uniqueness result on any connected, complete Riemannian manifold, with or without boundary; this is the first and only result with absolutely no restriction on the geometry of the manifold (such as on curvatures or injectivity radii). Our results cannot be obtained by applying the theory of $L^q$ maps valued in spaces of probability measures, in fact the $L^q$ map case can be recovered from our results by taking the underlying bundle as a trivial product bundle.</description>

      <title>Using Linearized Optimal Transport to Predict the Evolution of Stochastic Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01857v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an Euler-type method to predict the evolution of a time-dependent probability measure without explicitly learning an operator that governs its evolution. We use linearized optimal transport theory to prove that the measure-valued analog of Euler's method is first-order accurate when the measure evolves ``smoothly.'' In applications of interest, however, the measure is an empirical distribution of a system of stochastic particles whose behavior is only accessible through an agent-based micro-scale simulation. In such cases, this empirical measure does not evolve smoothly because the individual particles move chaotically on short time scales. However, we can still perform our Euler-type method, and when the particles' collective distribution approximates a measure that \emph{does} evolve smoothly, we observe that the algorithm still accurately predicts this collective behavior over relatively large Euler steps. We specifically demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by showing that our algorithm vastly reduces the number of micro-scale steps needed to correctly approximate long-term behavior in two illustrative examples, reflected Brownian motion and a model of bacterial chemotaxis.</description>

      <title>Non-convergence to global minimizers in data driven supervised deep learning: Adam and stochastic gradient descent optimization provably fail to converge to global minimizers in the training of deep neural networks with ReLU activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods - consisting of a class of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method - are nowadays key tools to solve data driven supervised learning problems. Despite the great success of SGD methods in the training of DNNs, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to explain the success and the limitations of such methods in rigorous theoretical terms. In particular, even in the standard setup of data driven supervised learning problems, it remained an open research problem to prove (or disprove) that SGD methods converge in the training of DNNs with the popular rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function with high probability to global minimizers in the optimization landscape. In this work we answer this question negatively. Specifically, in this work we prove for a large class of SGD methods that the considered optimizer does with high probability not converge to global minimizers of the optimization problem. It turns out that the probability to not converge to a global minimizer converges at least exponentially quickly to one as the width of the first hidden layer of the ANN and the depth of the ANN, respectively, increase. The general non-convergence results of this work do not only apply to the plain vanilla standard SGD method but also to a large class of accelerated and adaptive SGD methods such as the momentum SGD, the Nesterov accelerated SGD, the Adagrad, the RMSProp, the Adam, the Adamax, the AMSGrad, and the Nadam optimizers.</description>

      <title>A numerical method for solving the generalized tangent vector of hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the computation of the first-order variation for one-dimensional hyperbolic partial differential equations. In the case of shock waves the main challenge is addressed by developing a numerical method to compute the evolution of the generalized tangent vector introduced by Bressan and Marson (1995). Our basic strategy is to combine the conservative numerical schemes and a novel expression of the interface conditions for the tangent vectors along the discontinuity. Based on this, we propose a simple numerical method to compute the tangent vectors for general hyperbolic systems. Numerical results are presented for Burgers' equation and a 2 x 2 hyperbolic system with two genuinely nonlinear fields.</description>

      <title>Quadratic-form Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the framework of quadratic-form optimal transport (QOT), whose transport cost has the form $\iint c\,\mathrm{d}\pi \otimes\mathrm{d}\pi$ for some coupling $\pi$ between two marginals. Interesting examples of quadratic-form transport cost and their optimization include inequality measurement, the variance of a bivariate function, covariance, Kendall's tau, the Gromov--Wasserstein distance, quadratic assignment problems, and quadratic regularization of classic optimal transport. QOT leads to substantially different mathematical structures compared to classic transport problems and many technical challenges. We illustrate the fundamental properties of QOT and provide several cases where explicit solutions are obtained. For a wide class of cost functions, including the rectangular cost functions, the QOT problem is solved by a new coupling called the diamond transport, whose copula is supported on a diamond in the unit square.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear port-Hamiltonian system identification from input-state-output data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A framework for identifying nonlinear port-Hamiltonian systems using input-state-output data is introduced. The framework utilizes neural networks' universal approximation capacity to effectively represent complex dynamics in a structured way. We show that using the structure helps to make long-term predictions compared to baselines that do not incorporate physics. We also explore different architectures based on MLPs, KANs, and using prior information. The technique is validated through examples featuring nonlinearities in either the skew-symmetric terms, the dissipative terms, or the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Learning Framework for Solving Non-Markovian Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integer-order calculus often falls short in capturing the long-range dependencies and memory effects found in many real-world processes. Fractional calculus addresses these gaps via fractional-order integrals and derivatives, but fractional-order dynamical systems pose substantial challenges in system identification and optimal control due to the lack of standard control methodologies. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal control via linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for fractional-order linear time-invariant (FOLTI) systems and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework based on this theoretical foundation. Our approach establishes a rigorous mathematical model, derives analytical solutions, and incorporates deep learning to achieve data-driven optimal control of FOLTI systems. Our key contributions include: (i) proposing an innovative system identification method control strategy for FOLTI systems, (ii) developing the first end-to-end data-driven learning framework, Fractional-Order Learning for Optimal Control (FOLOC), that learns control policies from observed trajectories, and (iii) deriving a theoretical analysis of sample complexity to quantify the number of samples required for accurate optimal control in complex real-world problems. Experimental results indicate that our method accurately approximates fractional-order system behaviors without relying on Gaussian noise assumptions, pointing to promising avenues for advanced optimal control.</description>

      <title>Modelling hydrogen integration in energy system models: Best practices for policy insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of hydrogen in long-term energy strategies requires a broad understanding on how hydrogen is currently modelled in national energy system models. This study provides a review on hydrogen representation within selected energy system models that are tailored towards providing policy insights. The paper adopts a multi-layered review approach and selects eleven notable models for the review. The review covers hydrogen production, storage, transportation, trade, demand, modeling strategies, and hydrogen policies. The review suggests existing models would often opt for a simplified representation that can capture each stage of the hydrogen supply chain. This approach allows models to strike a balance between accuracy and preserving computational resources. The paper provides several suggestions for modeling hydrogen in national energy system models.</description>

      <title>A finite element scheme for an optimal control problem on steady Navier-Stokes-Brinkman equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous finite element framework for solving an optimal control problem governed by the steady Navier-Stokes-Brinkman equations, focusing on identifying a scalar permeability parameter $\gamma$ from local velocity observations. Three different finite element discretization schemes are proposed, and a priori error estimates are proven under appropriate regularity assumptions for each one. A key contribution of this paper is the development of residual-based a posteriori error estimators for both fully discrete and semi-discrete schemes, guiding adaptive mesh refinement to achieve comparable accuracy with fewer degrees of freedom. The method of manufactured solutions is used for numerical experiments to validate the theoretical findings, to demonstrate optimal convergence rates and the effectivity index is evaluated to measure their reliability. The framework offers insights into flow control mechanisms and paving the way for extensions to time-dependent, stochastic, or multiphysics problems.</description>
