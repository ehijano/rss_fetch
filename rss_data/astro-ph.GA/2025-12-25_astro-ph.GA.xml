      <title>BASS.L. Near-infrared Data Release 3: A Spectral Atlas and Characterization of AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of near-infrared (NIR) emission-line properties, AGN diagnostics, and circumnuclear gas dynamics for 453 hard X-ray selected (14$-$195 keV) AGN from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) NIR Data Release 3 (DR3; $\langle z \rangle=0.036$, $z&lt;1.0$). This dataset is the largest compilation of rest-frame NIR spectroscopic observations of hard-X-ray-selected AGN and includes the full DR2 sample. Observations were obtained with VLT X-shooter, a multiwavelength (0.3$-$2.5$\mu$m) spectrograph ($R$ = 4,000$-$18,000), using a $\geq 2 \sigma$ detection threshold, enabling broad analysis of emission features. We find that NIR coronal lines, particularly SiVI $\lambda1.964$, are more reliable tracers of AGN luminosity than optical [OIII], showing a tighter correlation with hard X-ray luminosity ($\sigma=0.25$dex) than [OIII] $\lambda5007$ ($\sigma=0.55$dex). Broad Paschen lines (Pa$\alpha$ and Pa$\beta$) are detected in 12% of Seyfert 2 and 57% of Seyfert 1.9, consistent with previous hidden BLR studies. We introduce a refined NIR diagnostic diagram (FeII $\lambda1.257$$\mu$m/Pa$\beta$ and H$_2$ $\lambda 2.122$$\mu$m/Br$\gamma$) that effectively distinguishes AGN, star-forming, and composite sources even when contamination limits individual diagnostics or only upper limits are available. Additionally, we find a moderate correlation ($p \approx 7.4 \times 10^{-3}$) between hot molecular gas mass (traced by H$_2$ 2.121$\mu$m) and X-ray luminosity, while its relation with Eddington ratio is weaker. The hot-to-cold gas mass ratio spans four orders of magnitude, averaging $\sim 3 \times 10^{-7}$, indicating diverse molecular gas excitation processes likely driven by star formation and AGN feedback. Our results underscore the value of NIR spectroscopy in probing AGN activity, obscured BLRs, and the complex interactions between AGN and their circumnuclear environments.</description>

      <title>Mid-IR luminosity functions: inferred dusty cosmic star-formation and black hole accretion histories from the JWST SMILES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared (mid-IR) observations are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution, tracing star formation, and active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity via dust emission. This work presents mid-IR galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 6$, derived from the JWST Systematic Mid-infrared Instrument Legacy Extragalactic Survey (SMILES) program. We combine 8 MIRI bands ($5-25$ $\mu$m) of SMILES and archival 23-band HST+JWST NIRCam photometry to construct an extensive catalog containing 2,813 galaxies with sub-$\mu$Jy level completeness in the mid-IR. We obtain monochromatic (in 5.6, 7.7, 10, 12.8, 15, 18, 21, and 25.5 $\mu$m), $L_{\rm IR}$, and AGN LFs, with a limiting luminosity down to $10^{9.5}$ $L_\odot$ at $z=0.5-1.0$, $\sim10^{10.5}$ $L_\odot$ at $z=2.0-4.0$, and to $\sim10^{11}$ $L_\odot$ at $z=4.0-6.0$. With the unprecedented sensitivity and resolution of JWST, here we better constrain the faint-end slope and its evolution of the mid-IR LFs, quantifying the dusty cosmic star formation and black hole accretion histories out to $z \sim 5$. These results provide essential insights to refine our understanding of the obscured star formation and galaxy-AGN co-evolution over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Bar Formation in Disc Galaxies: Internal Kinematics and Environmental Influence in MaNGA Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how the physical properties of disc galaxies relate to the presence of bars using data from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. By combining internal kinematical properties and environmental diagnostics, we find that barred galaxies are more frequently associated with centrally concentrated stellar mass distributions (within 1 and 2 effective radii) and exhibit lower values of the stellar angular momentum $\lambda_{Re}$. At fixed total stellar mass, barred galaxies exhibit: (i) higher stellar mass, and (ii) lower angular momentum, both in their inner regions than their unbarred counterparts. We find a bimodal dependence of the bar fraction on tidal interactions produced by the nearest neighbour. Specifically, the bar fraction peaks in the most isolated galaxies, where bars form unequivocally through internal secular processes, decreases at intermediate interaction strengths, and rises again in the strong interaction regime, likely reflecting the role of dense environments in sustaining or triggering bars. Our results suggest that internal gravitational instabilities are the primary driver of bar formation. External tidal perturbations play a secondary role, capable of triggering or enhancing bar formation in galaxies that are already internally predisposed. Our findings provide robust observational validation of theoretical bar formation and evolution models in galaxies.</description>

      <title>CORINOS IV: Quantifying Baseline-Fitting Uncertainties in SO$_2$ Ice Measurements with JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sulfur dioxide (SO$_2$) ice has been tentatively detected in protostellar envelopes, but its reliability as a solid-state sulfur reservoir remains unclear. We present new measurements of SO$_2$ ice from 6.8-8.5 $\mu$m toward four Class 0 protostars observed with JWST's Mid-Infrared (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer, as part of the COMs ORigin Investigated by the Next-generation Observatory in Space (CORINOS) program. The sample spans a luminosity range from 1 $L_\odot$ (B335, IRAS 15398-3359) to 10 $L_\odot$ (L483, Ser-emb~7). To assess continuum placement uncertainty in absorption spectra, we apply randomized polynomial fits over the restricted region. We fit laboratory spectra from the Leiden Ice Database for Astrochemistry (LIDA) using the open-source Python library Omnifit. We detect the 7.7 $\mu$m CH$_4$ band in all sources and find its column density robust to baseline choice, providing a reference for evaluating the weaker SO$_2$ feature on its blue shoulder and quantifying baseline-related uncertainty. Three SO$_2$ laboratory ices were tested: pure SO$_2$ ice yields 0.3-1.2% of volatile sulfur may be locked in SO$_2$ ice (lower and upper limits); CH$_3$OH:SO$_2$ ice gives 0.02-0.18%, but with lower quality fitting. The best-fitting H$_2$O:SO$_2$ ice yields 0.2-0.9%, which we consider the most realistic. These ranges define plausible bounds on SO$_2$ ice abundances in our sample. We find evidence for SO$_2$ in Ser-emb 7, L483, and IRAS 15398-3359, but emphasize the noisy spectrum of B335 prevents a definitive detection. Comparing SO$_2$ ice abundances across the different environments, we assess how conditions influence role of SO$_2$ as a potential sulfur reservoir and implications for the longstanding ``missing sulfur'' problem.</description>

      <title>Effects of External Magnetic Fields on the Multi-mode Rayleigh-Taylor Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magneto-Rayleigh-Taylor instability (mRTI) is a key process in inertial confinement fusion and is thought to be widespread in the interstellar medium, where it can concentrate plasma into discrete structures. We present resistive MHD simulations of the nonlinear evolution of multi-mode mRTI in both two and three dimensions, examining the effects of uniform external magnetic fields oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the initial interface. In both 2-D and 3-D, weak parallel fields enhance mixing-zone growth, whereas stronger fields suppress it. For perpendicular fields, growth is initially inhibited but becomes enhanced at later times. These behaviors arise from magnetic tension, which modifies flow anisotropy, buoyancy, drag, and vortex dynamics. The interplay of these mechanisms governs the distinct ways in which magnetic fields influence mRTI evolution.</description>

      <title>Expanding Asteroseismic Studies in Star Clusters Using NASA's TESS and ESA's Gaia Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star clusters have long been central to the study of stellar evolution due to their chemically and chronologically homogeneous populations. Asteroseismology, the analysis of stellar oscillations and pulsations, provides precise information about properties such as masses, radii, and ages of stars in the field. However, these stars lack calibration to an absolute scale, and so this project seeks to utilize the data from NASA's TESS mission and ESA's Gaia mission to identify additional cluster stars suitable for asteroseismic analysis and calibration. In this work we analyze 14 stars belonging to 3 well-populated clusters, 5 additional stars that are the only detected oscillators in their respective clusters, and 3 detected oscillators of unknown cluster membership. By significantly expanding the number of clusters with measured oscillating giants, this project increases the opportunity for cross-validation between classical stellar models and asteroseismic methods, allowing for improvements in both calibration techniques and age estimations across the galaxy.</description>

      <title>GW241011 and GW241110: Hints of Hierarchical Mergers from the Merger Entropy Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GW241011 and GW241110 both exhibit extremely asymmetric masses, high primary spins, and significant spin-orbit misalignment, which challenge the formation of first-generation binary black hole mergers formed from stellar collapse. This implies that these two gravitational wave events might originate from the hierarchical merger mechanism, with at least one of the black holes being the remnant of a previous merger. Here we investigate the origin of hierarchical mergers for GW241011 and GW241110 using the merger entropy index which measures the efficiency of entropy transfer for binary black hole mergers in general relativity. We find that GW241011 is consistent with hierarchical mergers in dense star clusters. The origin of GW241110 remains under debate due to its large distribution uncertainty, which leads to method-dependent inference and should be taken into account when interpreting this event in terms of hierarchical mergers.</description>

      <title>IMPACTX: An X-ray Spectral Model for Polar Dust and Clumpy Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a generic X-ray spectral model for the reflection component from the clumpy torus and dusty gas in the polar region (polar dusty gas) in an active galactic nucleus (AGN), designated as Inclusive spectral energy distribution Model of Polar dust And Clumpy Torus for X-ray (IMPACTX). To calculate the spectra, we utilize the Monte-Carlo based, 3-dimensional radiative transfer code SKIRT. The adopted geometry is the same as that of the IMPACT model (Ogawa et al. in prep.), consisting of a clumpy torus defined by Nenkova et al. (2008) and paraboloid-shell polar dusty gas launched at the inner radius of the torus. We discuss the dependence of the X-ray spectrum on geometrical parameters in comparison with the conventional torus-only model (XCLUMPY). As an example, we have simultaneously applied the IMPACTX and IMPACT models to the X-ray and infrared spectra of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 4388, and have found a solution that can well reproduce both spectra. This demonstrates the importance of using both X-ray and infrared data to constrain the nuclear structure of an AGN.</description>

      <title>DRAGNs in the Forest: Identifying Artifacts with Random Forest Models in the VLASS DRAGNs Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quick Look data products from the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) contain widespread imaging artifacts arising from the simplified imaging algorithm used in their production. The catalog of double radio sources associated with active galactic nuclei (DRAGNs) found in the VLASS first epoch Quick Look release using the DRAGNhunter algorithm suffers from contamination from these artifacts. These sources contain two or three individual components, each of which can be an artifact. We train random forest models to classify these DRAGNs based on the number of artifacts they contain, ranging from zero to three artifacts. We optimize our models and mitigate the class imbalance of our dataset with judicious training set selection, and the best of our models achieves a weighted F1 score of $97.01\%^{+1.12\%}_{-1.32\%}$. Using our classifications, we produce a catalog of VLASS DRAGNs from which an estimated 99.3% complete catalog of 97.7% artifact-free sources can be extracted.</description>

      <title>Acetaldehyde as a molecule for testing variations of electron-to-proton mass ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the quantum-mechanical calculations of the dimensionless sensitivity coefficients Q to small changes in the fundamental physical constant mu = m_e/m_p - the electron-to-proton mass ratio - for a number of low-frequency (1-50 GHz) transitions of the acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) molecule. The calculations show that Q varies in the range from 0.62 to 3.61. An example of the practical use of the CH3CHO and CH3OH lines tracing the same regions in three molecular clouds, located at large galactocentric distances (D_GC ~ 8 kpc) is considered. This results in a limit on the mu variations of Delta mu/mu = (0.1 +/- 0.4)*10^(-7) which is in line with previously obtained most stringent upper limits on changes in mu based on other molecules and methods. The limit obtained restricts hypothetical violations of the Einstein principle of the local position invariance at the level of 4*10^(-8) in the Galactic disk at large galactocentric distances.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2 follow-up: Characterization of subluminous Type Ia supernovae in the ZTF DR2 full sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 2 (ZTF DR2) includes a total of 3,628 Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), providing the largest and most complete sample of spectroscopically confirmed SNe~Ia at low redshift to date. In this paper, we present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 124 subluminous SNe~Ia, the largest sample of spectroscopically classified subluminous SNe~Ia observed with a single instrument, comprising 87 91bg-like, 12 86G-like, 18 04gs-like, and 7 02es-like events. We complement the published DR2 SALT2 light-curve parameters with new parameters obtained using template-based fits from SNooPy. Expansion velocities and pseudo-equivalent widths pEW of key spectral features are measured using Spextractor, and spectral averages are constructed for each subluminous subtype, binned by phase. We also analyze the host galaxy environments, both global and local, in terms of $g - z$ color, stellar mass, and directional light radius $d_{DLR}$. We find that all subluminous SNe~Ia (except the 02es-like subtype) are intrinsically red. This is evident by separating extrinsic from intrinsic color components. Since SALT2 is not trained on subluminous SNe~Ia, it compensates for their redder colors by inflating the $c$ parameter, thus extending the luminosity-width relation to negative values of x1. As expected, all subluminous SNe~Ia fall within the Cool region of the Branch et al. (2006) diagram, with the exception of 02es-like events, which show lower Si II 5972 pEW values. All subluminous subtypes tend to occur in more massive, redder host galaxies, and in the reddest local environments. Notably, 91bg- and 86G-like SNe~Ia explode at significantly larger normalized galactocentric distances. Finally, we identify the $pEW$ of the blended Ti II+Si II+Mg II absorption feature at 4300~A, along with s_BV, as robust and sufficient indicators for subclassifying subluminous SNe~Ia.</description>

      <title>Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) XXII. Chandra observations of narrow-line quasar candidates at z&gt;6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on Chandra X-ray observations of four narrow-line quasar candidates at z~6, selected from the SHELLQs project, based on the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey. These objects are characterised by narrow (FWHM&lt;310 km/s), luminous (&gt;1e44 erg/s) Lya and faint UV continuum (M_1450 = -22 - -21), prompting us to examine whether they are obscured luminous AGN at the epoch of reionization. However, none of these objects were detected by Chandra, giving an upper limit to their rest-frame 2-10 keV luminosity (Lx) of 2e44 erg/s (2 sigma), assuming a spectral slope Gamma=2. Subsequent rest-frame optical spectroscopy of these objects by the JWST-NIRSpec, presented in a companion paper, show weak broad Balmer emission at the base of narrow cores. With the scaling relation for low-redshift AGN, the observed strong [OIII]5007 flux of these sources would predict Lx to be around 1e45 erg/s, which is well above the Chandra upper limits. These optical spectra and X-ray quietness are reminiscent of JWST-selected broad-line AGN. We attribute the weak broad Balmer emission to the broad-line regions hidden partially by optically-thick obscuring matter which also hides the optical and X-ray continuum emission from the accretion disc. Compton-thick obscuration, which would strongly suppress X-ray emission, could be due to a dense inter-stellar medium that is often present in galaxies at high redshifts. Alternatively, the same effect could be obtained from an inflated disc at the innermost radii in a supercritical accretion flow, when the disc is viewed at inclined angles.</description>

Abstract: We investigated Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage globular cluster samples and studied their orbital and dynamical evolution over cosmological timescales in external time-variable potential. We estimated the limits of distribution of the escaped stars from the globular clusters' orbital evolution in energy angular momentum space. To reconstruct the orbital evolution of the known globular clusters of the dwarf galaxy Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage, we used the parallel $N$-body code $\varphi$-GPU. We investigated the relationship between globular clusters and their progenitor by analysing their orbital parameters and phase-space distribution during 9 Gyr of evolution in the past. We created a $N$-body model of Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage globular clusters and analysed their dynamical evolution and distribution of the escaped stars today. We summarised the samples of the Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage globular clusters and created two main categories: `most probable' and `tentative', with 15 and 9 clusters, respectively. We analysed the evolution of their kinematic, orbital, and phase-space parameters in the external time-variable potential. We defined phase-space distribution limits of stars that escape from globular clusters during 9 Gyr of evolution: a specific energy from -18 to -12.2 $\times10^4$ km$^2$ s$^{-2}$, L$_{\rm z}$ from -0.98 to 0.72 $\times10^3$ kpc km s$^{-1}$, and L$_{\rm perp}$ from 0 to 1.8 $\times10^3$ kpc km s$^{-1}$. The limits of the GE/S debris in Galactic area based on orbital parameters of the GC's escaped stars are: for apocentre and pericetre distances of 10--28 and 1--4 kpc, &lt; 18 kpc in Galactocentric radius and &lt; |15| kpc in the Z direction. Generally we compared the phase-space distribution of escaped stars from the GCs GE/S debris energy-angular momentum limits with the observed very metal-poor stars, which belong to the GE/S itself and produce consistent results.</description>

      <title>Calcium versus silicon ejecta velocities and decline rates in supernovae Ia: The role of high-velocity features</title>

Abstract: Photospheric and high-velocity features (PVFs and HVFs) of Si II $\lambda$6355 and Ca II IR3 lines in supernova Ia (SN Ia) spectra provide insights into ejecta structure, energetics, and circumstellar interaction, yet their interplay remains poorly understood. We analyse a representative sample of 145 nearby SNe Ia observed within $\pm$5 days of B-band maximum light, including normal, 91T-, and 91bg-like events with measured light-curve decline rates ($\Delta m_{15}$) and Si II and Ca II line properties from the literature. We model PVF and HVF velocity distributions using Gaussian Mixture Models, compare Si II and Ca II PVF velocity distributions, assess Ca II HVF properties, and test correlations between Si II PVF velocities and $\Delta m_{15}$, with emphasis on HVF effects. For the first time, we show that the Ca II PVF velocity distribution, measured for the same events at the same phases as Si II, is predominantly unimodal, in contrast to the well-known bimodal Si II PVF distribution that supports the high-velocity/normal-velocity division. This contrast likely reflects a subclass-dependent formation depth of the Ca II line, as supported by a positive correlation ($&gt;3.3\sigma$) between $\Delta m_{15}$ and the velocity offset between Ca II and Si II PVFs, particularly in faster-declining SNe Ia. Importantly, HVFs do not significantly bias PVF velocity distributions. A significant negative correlation ($&gt;3.3\sigma$) between Si II PVF velocity and $\Delta m_{15}$ is found only for HVF-weak SNe Ia, consistent with more energetic explosions yielding faster ejecta, while this trend vanishes in HVF-strong events, likely due to circumstellar interaction. These results underscore the critical role of HVFs and SN Ia subclass in interpreting ejecta kinematics in both models and observations.</description>

      <title>AGN X-ray Reflection Spectroscopy with ML MYTORUS:Neural Posterior Estimation with Training on Observation-Driven Parameter Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12155</link>

Abstract: X-ray spectroscopy of active galactic nuclei (AGN) reveals key information about circumnuclear geometry. Many AGN show a narrow Fe K-alpha line at 6.4 keV and associated Compton-scattered continua, produced by primary continuum scattering in cold, neutral material far from the central supermassive black hole. We present a novel approach based on Simulation-Based Inference with Neural Posterior Estimation (SBI-NPE) to train a machine-learning (ML) model using NuSTAR spectral fitting results from the literature, adopting the physically motivated MYTORUS-decoupled model, which separates line-of-sight and global equivalent hydrogen column densities (NH_Z and NH_S). To overcome limitations of traditional frequentist fitting such as local minima, limited automation, reproducibility, and computational cost, we employ normalizing flows and autoregressive networks to learn flexible posterior distributions from simulated spectra. From 34 NuSTAR spectral fits, we generate 34,000 synthetic spectra using uniform and Gaussian parameter distributions, showing that the latter is more strongly observationally driven. The network is trained to infer four MYTORUS parameters: NH_Z, NH_S, the photon index Gamma, and the relative normalization AS. Mutual information analysis identifies optimal spectral regions and motivates the inclusion of redshift, exposure time, and Galactic absorption. The observation-based grid significantly outperforms uniform sampling, achieving predictive accuracies above 90 percent for NH_S and AS, 89 percent for NH_Z, and 82 percent for Gamma within one sigma, with a joint accuracy of 70 percent for all parameters. We publicly release ML MYTORUS with a web interface enabling fast, reproducible inference from NuSTAR spectra. An application to NGC 4388 illustrates the promise of this approach.</description>
