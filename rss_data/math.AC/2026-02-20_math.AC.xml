      <title>Neural codes via homological invariants of polarized neural ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a neural code $\mathcal{C}\subseteq\mathbb{F}_2^n$, polarizing the canonical form generators of the neural ideal $J_{\mathcal{C}}$ yields a squarefree monomial ideal $\mathcal{P}(J_{\mathcal{C}})\subset k[x_1,\dots,x_n,y_1,\dots,y_n]$, the polarized neural ideal, and an associated simplicial complex $\Delta_{\mathcal{C}}$, the polar complex. We study the graded invariants $\operatorname{pd}(\mathcal{P}(J_{\mathcal{C}}))$ and $\operatorname{reg}(\mathcal{P}(J_{\mathcal{C}}))$ via the topology of $\Delta_{\mathcal{C}}$, showing that simple geometric features of the Hamming cube $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ (with Hamming distance) organize their extremal behavior. We prove $\operatorname{reg}(\mathcal{P}(J_{\mathcal{C}}))\le 2n-1$, with equality precisely when $\mathcal{C}$ is obtained from $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ by deleting an antipodal pair. Using connectedness properties of induced subcomplexes of $\Delta_{\mathcal{C}}$, we obtain $\operatorname{pd}(\mathcal{P}(J_{\mathcal{C}}))\le 2n-3$, and we give an explicit family of codes attaining equality, each consisting of antipodal pairs. At the opposite end, we identify the cube geometry behind the smallest values: $\operatorname{reg}(\mathcal{P}(J_{\mathcal{C}}))=1$ forces $\mathcal{C}$ to be a coordinate subcube of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$, while $\operatorname{pd}(\mathcal{P}(J_{\mathcal{C}}))=0$ forces $\mathcal{C}$ to be the complement of one. Finally, we construct families realizing large regions of the $(\operatorname{pd},\operatorname{reg})$-plot for fixed $n$.</description>

      <title>Serre depth and local cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fundamental homological invariant, called \emph{Serre depth}, which stratifies Serre's conditions in the same way that depth stratifies the Cohen-Macaulay property. We study the Serre depths of modules over arbitrary Noetherian local rings and over standard graded algebras over a field, extending the polynomial ring case due to Muta and Terai. Under mild hypotheses, we show that the $r$-th Serre depth of a finitely generated module $M$ measures the deviation of $M$ from satisfying Serre's condition $(S_r)$. The main results of the paper can be summarized as follows:
  (i) We establish the basic properties of Serre depth and prove that it is invariant under completion.
  (ii) If the base ring $R$ is a homomorphic image of a Gorenstein ring, we show that a finitely generated $R$-module $M$ is equidimensional and satisfies $(S_r)$ if and only if its $r$-th Serre depth equals its Krull dimension. Analogous statements are obtained for schemes.
  (iii) For a homogeneous ideal in a standard graded polynomial ring over a field, we compare its Serre depths with those of its initial ideal.
  (iv) We characterize the Serre depths of a monomial ideal in terms of its skeletons and prove that the Serre depths of sufficiently large powers of a monomial ideal stabilize; the proof uses Presburger arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Classifying binary quadratic forms using Clifford invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We functorially identify similarity classes of line-bundle-valued quadratic forms on rank two vector bundles with isomorphism classes of pairs consisting of the degree zero and the degree one parts of the associated generalized Clifford algebras. As applications, we generalize the Gauss Composition and explore connections with Picard groups of quadratic algebras.</description>

      <title>Translational surfaces and iterated resultants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A translational surface is a tensor product surface constructed from two space curves by translating one along the other. These surfaces are common within geometric modeling and, since their description is parametric, it is desirable to obtain the implicit equation of such a surface. These surfaces have been studied thoroughly by Goldman and Wang, where a particular set of syzygies was identified and shown to yield the implicit equation through an inhomogeneous resultant. As this method may fail in the presence of ill-behaved basepoints of the parameterization, we offer an alternative method in this article using iterated homogeneous resultants. The algorithm presented here involves smaller Sylvester matrices overall, potentially resulting in faster computation, and succeeds in many instances where the previous method cannot be applied.</description>

      <title>Symmetric (co)homology polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetric edge polytopes are a recent and well-studied family of centrally symmetric polytopes arising from graphs. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of this family to arbitrary simplicial complexes. We show how topological properties of a simplicial complex can be translated into geometric properties of such polytopes, and vice versa. We study the integer decomposition property, facets and reflexivity of these polytopes. Using Gr\"obner basis techniques, we obtain a (not necessarily unimodular) triangulation of these polytopes. Due to the tools we use, most of our results hold in the more general setting of arbitrary centrally symmetric polytopes.</description>

      <title>$(S_2)$-ifications, semi-Nagata rings, and the lifting problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a two-part article. In the first part, we study an alternative notion to Nagata rings. A Nagata ring is a Noetherian ring $R$ such that every finite $R$-algebra that is an integral domain has finite normalization. We replace the normalization by an $(S_2)$-ification, study new phenomena, and prove parallel results. In particular, we show a Nagata domain has a finite $(S_2)$-ification. In the second part, we study the local lifting problem. We show that for a semilocal Noetherian ring $R$ that is $I$-adically complete for an ideal $I$, if $R/I$ has $(S_k)$ (resp. Cohen--Macaulay, Gorenstein, lci) formal fibers, so does $R$. As a consequence, we show if $R/I$ is a quotient of a Cohen--Macaulay ring, so is $R$. We also discuss difficulties in lifting geometrically $(R_k)$ formal fibers.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Davenport Constant of the Second Kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13532v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a ring invariant which is closely related to the Davenport constant of a group. In particular, we will calculate this invariant for a certain class of rings of integers and their orders and use it to understand factorization properties of the latter. To this end, we also examine the well-behaved class of Galois-invariant orders.</description>

      <title>Commutative algebra in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop some foundations of commutative algebra, with a view towards algebraic geometry, in symmetric tensor categories. Most results establish analogues of classical theorems, in tensor categories which admit a tensor functor to some tensor category verifying specific conditions. This is in line with the current program which aims to describe tensor categories by their tensor functors to incompressible categories. We place particular emphasis on the notion of observable subgroups of affine group schemes in tensor categories, which in particular leads to some further insight into observability for classical affine group schemes.</description>

      <title>On silting complexes associated to n-silting modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any (n+1)-term silting complex whose intermediate cohomology vanishes gives rise to an n-silting module, as recently introduced by Mao. Specializing to commutative noetherian rings, we show that this assignment induces a bijection on the respective equivalence classes. Furthermore, we prove in the same setting that the n-silting modules always correspond to a tilting complex, that is, the associated t-structure is of derived type. We use this to exhibit new examples of tilting complexes in the setting of Commutative Algebra and also to show that the finite type property for n-silting modules, as formulated by Mao, can in general fail.</description>
