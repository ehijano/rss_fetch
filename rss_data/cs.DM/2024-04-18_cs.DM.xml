      <title>Lifting maps between graphs to embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study conditions for the existence of an embedding $\widetilde{f} \colon P \to Q \times \mathbb{R}$ such that $f = \mathrm{pr}_Q \circ \widetilde{f}$, where $f \colon P \to Q$ is a piecewise linear map between polyhedra. Our focus is on non-degenerate maps between graphs, where non-degeneracy means that the preimages of points are finite sets.
  We introduce combinatorial techniques and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the general case. Using these results, we demonstrate that the problem of the existence of a lifting reduces to testing the satisfiability of a 3-CNF formula. Additionally, we construct a counterexample to a result by V. Po\'{e}naru on lifting of smooth immersions to embeddings.
  Furthermore, by establishing connections between the stated problem and the approximability by embeddings, we deduce that, in the case of generic maps from a tree to a segment, a weaker condition becomes sufficient for the existence of a lifting.</description>

      <title>Triangle-free $2$-matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13590v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a maximum size triangle-free $2$-matching in a graph $G$. A $2$-matching is any subset of the edges such that each vertex is incident to at most two edges from the subset. We present a fast combinatorial algorithm for the problem. Our algorithm and its analysis are dramatically simpler than the very complicated result by Hartvigsen from 1984.
  In the design of this algorithm we use several new concepts. It has been proven before that for any triangle-free $2$-matching $M$ which is not maximum the graph contains an $M$-augmenting path, whose application to $M$ results in a bigger triangle-free $2$-matching. It was not known how to efficiently find such a path. A new observation is that the search for an augmenting path $P$ can be restricted to so-called {\em amenable} paths that go through any triangle $t$ contained in $P \cup M$ a limited number of times. To find an augmenting path that is amenable and hence whose application does not create any triangle we forbid some edges to be followed by certain others. This operation can be thought of as using gadgets, in which some pairs of edges get disconnected. To be able to disconnect two edges we employ {\em half-edges}. A {\em half-edge} of edge $e$ is, informally speaking, a half of $e$ containing exactly one of its endpoints. This is another novel application of half-edges which were previously used for TSP and other matching problems. Additionally, gadgets are not fixed during any augmentation phase, but are dynamically changing according to the currently discovered state of reachability by amenable paths.</description>
