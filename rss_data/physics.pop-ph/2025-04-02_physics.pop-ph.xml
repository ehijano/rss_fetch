      <title>Meat, Vegetable, Soup -- The First Successful Attempt to Classify Everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a novel classification scheme for all items, objects, concepts, and crucially -- things -- in the known and unknown universe. Our definitions of meat, soup and vegetable are near-exhaustive and represent a new era of scientific discovery within the rapidly-developing field of Arbitrary Classification. While the definitions of vegetable (growing in the ground), meat (growing in an animal) and soup (containing both vegetable and meat) may appear simple at first, we discuss a range of complex cases in which progress is rapidly being made, and provide definitions and clarifications for as many objects as a weekend of typing will allow.</description>

      <title>Higher multipoles of the cow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spherical cow approximation is widely used in the literature, but is rarely justified. Here, I propose several schemes for extending the spherical cow approximation to a full multipole expansion, in which the spherical cow is simply the first term. This allows for the computation of bovine potentials and interactions beyond spherical symmetry, and also provides a scheme for defining the geometry of the cow itself at higher multipole moments. This is especially important for the treatment of physical processes that are suppressed by spherical symmetry, such as the spindown of a rotating cow due to the emission of gravitational waves. I demonstrate the computation of multipole coefficients for a benchmark cow, and illustrate the applicability of the multipolar cow to several important problems.</description>

      <title>Orientation of Entrance and Burial Chamber in the Pyramids of the Egyptian Fourth and Fifth Dynasties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work, arxiv:2412.20407, we have mentioned two Egyptian kings, Shepseskaf and Userkaf, of the IV and V Dynasties. Here we continue discussing their burial places, that is their pyramids, in a new framework based on the study of orientation of pyramid substructures (entrances, corridors, burial chambers). Shepseskaf and Userkaf opted for the same architectonic solutions, exhibiting a continuity in funerary architecture. After showing the substructure orientations of the pyramids of the IV and V Dynasties, we will stress that the substructure in the Shepseskaf's pyramid, the Mastabat Fara'un, is oriented as in the Fourth Dynasty architecture of pyramids and that it has a layout which is closer to that used by the following Fifth Dynasty. In our discussion, we will start with the first ruler of the Fourth Dynasty, Snefru, who introduced a new form of external and internal layout of the burial complexes of the king, through an evolution based on four attempts, the Seila, Meidum, Bent and Red pyramids. In the final model, the Snefru's Red pyramid, the substructure has a north entrance and a burial chamber east-west oriented. This orientation persisted in the pyramids of the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties, and beyond. The Sekhemkhet (Djoserty) pyramid of the Third Dynasty is also illustrated for comparison, such as some earlier burial monuments. In the discussion here proposed the position of sarcophagus and of the body inside it is also investigated. The sarcophagus has its axis north-south. The body of the deceased king was lying on its left side, extended, head to the north, face towards the east. In this framework, we propose again what we told in arXiv 2016, arxiv:1604.05963, and the layout of pyramids with respect to sunrise on solstices.</description>
