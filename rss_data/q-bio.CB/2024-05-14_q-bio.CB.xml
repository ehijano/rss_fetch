      <title>Cellular dynamics of host-parasitoid interactions: Insights from the encapsulation process in a partially resistant host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cotesia typhae is an eastern African endoparasitoid braconid wasp that targets the larval stage of the lepidopteran stem borer, Sesamia nonagrioides, a maize crop pest in Europe. The French host population is partially resistant to the Makindu strain of the wasp, allowing its development in only 40% of the cases. Resistant larvae can encapsulate the parasitoid and survive the infection. This interaction provides a very interesting frame for investigating the impact of parasitism on host cellular resistance. We characterized the parasitoid ovolarval development in a permissive host and studied the encapsulation process in a resistant host by dissection and histological sectioning compared to that of inert chromatography beads. We measured the total hemocyte count in parasitized and bead-injected larvae over time to monitor the magnitude of the immune reaction. Our results show that parasitism of resistant hosts delayed encapsulation but did not affect immune abilities towards inert beads. Moreover, while bead injection increased total hemocyte count, it remained constant in resistant and permissive larvae. We conclude that while Cotesia spp virulence factors are known to impair the host immune system, our results suggest that passive evasion could also occur.</description>

      <title>Emergent Simplicities in the Living Histories of Individual Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organisms maintain the status quo, holding key physiological variables constant to within an acceptable tolerance, and yet adapt with precision and plasticity to dynamic changes in externalities. What organizational principles ensure such exquisite yet robust control of systems-level "state variables" in complex systems with an extraordinary number of moving parts and fluctuating variables? Here we focus on these issues in the specific context of intra- and intergenerational life histories of individual bacterial cells, whose biographies are precisely charted via high-precision dynamic experiments using the SChemostat technology. We highlight intra- and intergenerational scaling laws and other "emergent simplicities" revealed by these high-precision data. In turn, these facilitate a principled route to dimensional reduction of the problem, and serve as essential building blocks for phenomenological and mechanistic theory. Parameter-free data-theory matches for multiple organisms validate theory frameworks, and explicate the systems physics of stochastic homeostasis and adaptation.</description>
