      <title>HARD: A Performance Portable Radiation Hydrodynamics Code based on FleCSI Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics And Radiation Diffusion} (HARD) is an open-source application for high-performance simulations of compressible hydrodynamics with radiation-diffusion coupling. Built on the FleCSI (Flexible Computational Science Infrastructure) framework, HARD expresses its computational units as tasks whose execution can be orchestrated by multiple back-end runtimes, including Legion, MPI, and HPX. Node-level parallelism is delegated to Kokkos, providing a single, portable code base that runs efficiently on laptops, small homogeneous clusters, and the largest heterogeneous supercomputers currently available. To ensure scientific reliability, HARD includes a regression-test suite that automatically reproduces canonical verification problems such as the Sod and LeBlanc shock tubes and the Sedov blast wave, comparing numerical solutions against known analytical results. The project is distributed under an OSI-approved license, hosted on GitHub, and accompanied by reproducible build scripts and continuous integration workflows. This combination of performance portability, verification infrastructure, and community-focused development makes HARD a sustainable platform for advancing radiation hydrodynamics research across multiple domains.</description>

      <title>An Improved Rapid Performance Analysis Model for Solenoidal Magnetic Radiation Shields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronauts participating in deep-space exploration missions will be exposed to significantly greater amounts of radiation than is typically encountered on Earth or in low Earth orbit (LEO), which poses significant risks to crew health and mission safety. Active magnetic radiation shields based on the Lorentz deflection of charged particles have the potential to reduce astronaut doses with lower mass costs than passive shielding techniques. Typically, active shielding performance is evaluated using high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations, which are too computationally expensive to evaluate an entire trade space of shield designs. A rapid, semi-analytical model based on the High Charge and Energy Transport code (HZETRN) developed in 2014 provided an alternative method by which to evaluate the performance of solenoidal shields. However, various simplifying assumptions made in the original model have limited its accuracy, and therefore require evaluation and correction. In this work, a number of aspects of the original semi-analytical model are updated and validated by Monte Carlo simulation, then used to recharacterize the design trade space of solenoidal magnetic shields. The updated model predicts improved performance for weaker shields as compared to the original model, but greatly diminished performance for strong shields with bending powers greater than 20 T-m. Overall, the results indicate that magnetic shields enable significant mass savings over passive shields for mission scenarios where the requisite dose reduction is greater than about 60% relative to free space, which includes most exploration missions longer than one year with significant time spent outside LEO.</description>

      <title>An Interval Type-2 Version of Bayes Theorem Derived from Interval Probability Range Estimates Provided by Subject Matter Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference is widely used in many different fields to test hypotheses against observations. In most such applications, an assumption is made of precise input values to produce a precise output value. However, this is unrealistic for real-world applications. Often the best available information from subject matter experts (SMEs) in a given field is interval range estimates of the input probabilities involved in Bayes Theorem. This paper provides two key contributions to extend Bayes Theorem to an interval type-2 (IT2) version. First, we develop an IT2 version of Bayes Theorem that uses a novel and conservative method to avoid potential inconsistencies in the input IT2 MFs that otherwise might produce invalid output results. We then describe a novel and flexible algorithm for encoding SME-provided intervals into IT2 fuzzy membership functions (MFs), which we can use to specify the input probabilities in Bayes Theorem. Our algorithm generalizes and extends previous work on this problem that primarily addressed the encoding of intervals into word MFs for Computing with Words applications.</description>

      <title>Simulating Organogenesis in COMSOL Multiphysics: Tissue Patterning with Directed Cell Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a COMSOL Multiphysics implementation of a continuum model for directed cell migration, a key mechanism underlying tissue self-organization and morphogenesis. The model is formulated as a partial integro-differential equation (PIDE), combining random motility with non-local, density-dependent guidance cues to capture phenomena such as cell sorting and aggregation. Our framework supports simulations in one, two, and three dimensions, with both zero-flux and periodic boundary conditions, and can be reformulated in a Lagrangian setting to efficiently handle tissue growth and domain deformation. We demonstrate that COMSOL Multiphysics enables a flexible and accessible implementation of PIDEs, providing a generalizable platform for studying collective cell behavior and pattern formation in complex biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling of elastic waves in thin shells with grid-characteristic method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of strength and non-destructive testing of complex structures such as buildings, space rockets or oil reservoirs often involves calculations on extremely large grids. The modeling of elastic wave processes in solids places limitations on the grid element size because resolving different elastic waves requires at least several grid elements for the characteristic size of the modeled object. For a thin plate, the defining size is its thickness, and a complex structure that contains large-scale thin objects requires a large-scale grid to preserve its uniformity. One way to bypass this problem is the theory of thin plates and shells that replaces a simple material model on a fine three-dimensional mesh with a more complex material model on a coarser mesh. This approach loses certain fine effects inside the thin plate, but allows us to model large and complex thin objects with a reasonable size calculation grid and resolve all the significant wave types. In this research, we take the Kirchhoff-Love material model and derive a hyperbolic dynamic system of equations that allows for a physical interpretation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The system is solved numerically with a grid-characteristic method. Numerical results for several model statements are compared with three-dimensional calculations based on grid-characteristic method for a three dimensional elasticity.</description>

      <title>Virtual staining for 3D X-ray histology of bone implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional X-ray histology techniques offer a non-invasive alternative to conventional 2D histology, enabling volumetric imaging of biological tissues without the need for physical sectioning or chemical staining. However, the inherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical specificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital pathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in simulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study, we extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image translation to generate artificially stained slices from synchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image pairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant samples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired data. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of the CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The model incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms, producing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving high-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard CycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the model can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D datasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation. While features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some variability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need for further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining to 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative, label-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research.</description>

      <title>Electronic order induced symmetry breaking in lattice dynamics of Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the molecular Berry curvature (MBC) framework, we develop an \textit{ab initio} algorithm to capture the quantitative effects of magnetic order on lattice dynamics. Using the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ as a prototype, we show that electronic-order-driven phonon symmetry breaking requires spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and leads to an MBC term that breaks both time-reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and mirror symmetries. We demonstrate that mirror-symmetry breaking is essential to account for the experimentally observed phonon splitting, $\mathcal{T}$-breaking alone is insufficient. The MBC is widely distributed across the Brillouin zone, giving rise to significant off-$\Gamma$ effects. Our results agree well with experiments and establish a framework for predicting large phonon magnetism in magnetic materials with strong spin-orbit coupling and electron-phonon coupling. This work also suggests new avenues for controlling non-reciprocal phonon transport.</description>

      <title>Neural Transformer Backflow for Solving Momentum-Resolved Ground States of Strongly Correlated Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly correlated materials, such as twisted transition-metal dichalcogenide homobilayers, host a variety of exotic quantum phases but remain notoriously difficult to solve due to strong interactions. We introduce a powerful neural network ansatz, Neural Transformer Backflow (NTB), formulated within a multi-band projection framework. It naturally enforces momentum conservation and enables efficient calculations of momentum-resolved ground states. NTB attains high accuracy on small systems and scales to higher bands and larger system sizes far beyond the reach of exact diagonalization. By evaluating observables such as the structure factor and momentum distribution, we show that NTB captures diverse correlated states in tMoTe$_2$, including charge density waves, fractional Chern insulators, and anomalous Hall Fermi liquids, within a unified framework. Our approach paves the way for understanding and discovering novel phases of matter in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Vorticity Packing Effects on Turbulent Transport in Decaying 2D Incompressible Navier-Stokes Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the role of initial vorticity packing fractions on the transport properties of decaying incompressible two-dimensional Navier-Stokes turbulence at very high Reynolds numbers and spatial resolutions. Turbulence is initiated via the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and evolves through nonlinear inverse energy cascades, forming large-scale coherent structures that dominate the flow over long eddy turnover times. The initial vorticity packing fraction and circulation direction lead to qualitatively distinct turbulence dynamics and transport behaviors. Tracer particle trajectories are computed in the fluid field obtained using the Eulerian framework, with transport and mixing quantified using statistical measures such as absolute dispersion, position probability distribution functions (PDFs), and velocity PDFs. In the early stages, the onset of turbulence is primarily governed by the instability growth rate, which increases with vorticity packing fraction. As the flow evolves, transport exhibits a range of behaviors-subdiffusive, diffusive, or superdiffusive-and transitions between anisotropic and isotropic regimes, depending on the initial vorticity packing, flow structure, and stage of evolution. At later times, transport is dominated by the motion of large-scale coherent vortices, whose dynamics are also influenced by the initial vorticity packing ranging from subdiffusive trapping rotational motion and random walks, and L\'evy flight-like events. These findings offer insights into transport in quasi-2D systems-ranging from laboratory-scale flows to geophysical phenomena and astrophysical structures-through analogies with 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence.</description>

      <title>Exploring the magnetic landscape of easily-exfoliable two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic materials often exhibit complex energy landscapes with multiple local minima, each corresponding to a self-consistent electronic structure solution. Finding the global minimum is challenging, and heuristic methods are not always guaranteed to succeed. Here, we apply a recently developed automated workflow to systematically explore the energy landscape of 194 magnetic monolayers obtained from the Materials Cloud 2D crystals database and determine their ground-state magnetic order. Our approach enables effective control and sampling of orbital occupation matrices, allowing rapid identification of local minima. We find a diverse set of self-consistent collinear metastable states, further enriched by Hubbard-corrected energy functionals, when the $U$ parameters have been computed from first principles using linear-response theory. We categorise the monolayers by their magnetic ordering and highlight promising candidates. Our results include 109 ferromagnetic, 83 antiferromagnetic, and 2 altermagnetic monolayers, along with 12 novel ferromagnetic half-metals with potential for spintronics technologies.</description>

      <title>Numerical modelling of a partially loaded intermodal container freight train passing through a tunnel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bluff nature of a freight train locomotive, coupled with large gaps created between different wagon formations and loaded goods, influence the overall pressure wave pattern generated as the train passes through a tunnel. Typically, 1D models are used to predict the patterns and properties of tunnel pressure wave formations. However, accurate modelling of regions of separation at the head of the blunted containers and at unloaded gap sections is essential for precise predictions of pressure magnitudes. This has traditionally been difficult to capture with 1D models. Furthermore, achieving this accuracy through 3D computational methods demands exceptional mesh quality, significant computational resources, and the careful selection of numerical models. This paper evaluates various numerical models to capture these complexities within regions of flow separation. Findings have supported the development of a new 1D programme to calculate the pressure wave generated by a freight locomotive entering a tunnel, and is here further extended to consider the discontinuities of the train body created by intermodal container loading patterns, by implementing new mesh system and boundary conditions into the 1D programme. A parameterisation study for different loading configurations is also presented to improve the overall programme adaptability, and the relationship between predetermined parameters and gap length is investigated. We validate the effectiveness of the improved 1D model through comprehensive Large Eddy Simulation (LES) results and conduct an extensive parameterisation study to enhance its applicability across various loading configurations. Consequently, this research bridges the gap in freight train tunnel aerodynamics, offering a versatile 1D numerical tool for accurate pressure wave prediction.</description>

Abstract: Extracting information from big data sets, both real and simulated, is a modern hallmark of the physical sciences. In practice, students face barriers to learning ``Big Data'' methods in undergraduate physics and astronomy curricula. As an attempt to alleviate some of these challenges, we present a simple, farm-to-table data analysis pipeline that can collect, process, and plot data from the 800k entries common to the arXiv preprint repository and the bibliographical database inSpireHEP. The pipeline employs contemporary research practices and can be implemented using open-sourced Python libraries common to undergraduate courses on Scientific Computing. To support the use such pipelines in classroom contexts, we make public an example implementation, authored by two undergraduate physics students, that runs on off-the-shelf laptops. For advanced students, we discuss applications of the pipeline, including for online DAQ monitoring and commercialization.</description>

Abstract: In high energy density physics (HEDP) and inertial confinement fusion (ICF), predictive modeling is complicated by uncertainty in parameters that characterize various aspects of the modeled system, such as those characterizing material properties, equation of state (EOS), opacities, and initial conditions. Typically, however, these parameters are not directly observable. What is observed instead is a time sequence of radiographic projections using X-rays. In this work, we define a set of sparse hydrodynamic features derived from the outgoing shock profile and outer material edge, which can be obtained from radiographic measurements, to directly infer such parameters. Our machine learning (ML)-based methodology involves a pipeline of two architectures, a radiograph-to-features network (R2FNet) and a features-to-parameters network (F2PNet), that are trained independently and later combined to approximate a posterior distribution for the parameters from radiographs. We show that the estimated parameters can be used in a hydrodynamics code to obtain density fields and hydrodynamic shock and outer edge features that are consistent with the data. Finally, we demonstrate that features resulting from an unknown EOS model can be successfully mapped onto parameters of a chosen analytical EOS model, implying that network predictions are learning physics, with a degree of invariance to the underlying choice of EOS model.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Insights into the Chain-Length-Dependent Antifreeze Activity of Oligoprolines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ice recrystallization inhibition (IRI) activity of polymers generally increases with chain length. However, for polyproline (PPro), a highly potent cryoprotectant, the IRI activity varies nonmonotonically with the degree of polymerization (DP), i.e., DP=8 (P8) &gt; DP=15 (P15) &gt; DP=3 (P3). Herein, we employ molecular dynamics simulations to reveal the microscopic mechanism behind this nonmonotonic effect in PPro. Our findings indicate that the population of the PPII helix structure, which increases with DP, is not the primary reason for this effect. Instead, both single-molecule conformation and multi-molecule aggregation play critical roles. At the single-molecule level, PPro exhibits two types of thermodynamically stable conformations:linear (L) and coil (C), with the latter demonstrating enhanced IRI potency due to its stronger hydrophobicity and ice-binding capability. Notably, P8 has a higher content of the C conformation compared to P15, accounting for its superior IRI activity. Aligning with the conventional understandings, P3's lowest activity stems from its excessively small volume/coverage area on the ice surface. At the multi-molecule level, P15 shows a significantly higher tendency to aggregate than P8, which limits the ability of PPro molecules to fully spread at the ice-water interface and reduces their effective coverage of the ice surface, thereby diminishing its effectiveness. And P15's aggregation becomes significantly pronounced at high concentrations, amplifying the nonmonotonic effect. This work provides an atomistic insight into the nonmonotonic relationship between IRI activity and DP in PPro, offering valuable insights for the rational design of novel biocompatible antifreeze polymers.</description>
