      <title>Decision-Focused Bias Correction for Fluid Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid approximation is a widely used approach for solving two-stage stochastic optimization problems, with broad applications in service system design such as call centers and healthcare operations. However, replacing the underlying random distribution (e.g., demand distribution) with its mean (e.g., the time-varying average arrival rate) introduces bias in performance estimation and can lead to suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we investigate how to identify an alternative point statistic, which is not necessarily the mean, such that substituting this statistic into the two-stage optimization problem yields the optimal decision. We refer to this statistic as the decision-corrected point estimate (time-varying arrival rate). For a general service network with customer abandonment costs, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a corrected point estimate and propose an algorithm for its computation. Under a decomposable network structure, we further show that the resulting decision-corrected point estimate is closely related to the classical newsvendor solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decision-focused correction method compared to the traditional fluid approximation.</description>

      <title>A Context-Free Smart Grid Model Using Complex System Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy and pollution are urging problems of the 21th century. By gradually changing the actual power grid system, smart grid may evolve into different systems by means of size, elements and strategies, but its fundamental requirements and objectives will not change such as optimizing production, transmission, and consumption. Studying the smart grid through modeling and simulation provides us with valuable results which cannot be obtained in real world due to time and cost related constraints. Moreover, due to the complexity of the smart grid, achieving global optimization is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose a complex system based approach to the smart grid modeling, accentuating on the optimization by combining game theoretical and classical methods in different levels. Thanks to this combination, the optimization can be achieved with flexibility and scalability, while keeping its generality.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via Event-Triggered Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.</description>

      <title>A cartel-fringe model in a nonrenewable resource economy with many fringe firms extracting from a common deposit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model of a nonrenewable resource market, e.g. crude oil market. This market consists of a cartel with market power and a fringe consisting of many small firms, whose deposits are interrelated. In addition, the firms face constraints on extraction. Besides the nonrenewable resource, there is also its sustainable substitute, which constrains the price. We fully characterize the resulting Stackelberg equilibrium. Besides typical solution, in which initially the cartel and fringe extract simultaneously, we find that for some model parameters and initial capacities, the cartel may also deter the fringe from extraction, or it may refrain from extraction until the fringe depletes their deposit. We conduct sensitivity analysis and study the conditions when one of those counterintuitive solutions is optimal.</description>

      <title>Existence of Solutions for Non-monotone VIs and Implications for Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of solutions in non-monotone variational inequalities (VIs) through the normal mapping properties. In particular, we show that when the normal mapping $F_K^{\rm nor}(\cdot)$ is norm coercive over a set $K$, and the generalized Jacobian of the normal mapping has a full rank at points $x$ where $F_K^{\rm nor}(x)\ne0$, then the VI$(K,F)$ has a solution. We then investigate conditions on the mapping $F(\cdot)$ and its Jacobian that imply the full rank condition for the generalized Jacobian, such as the uniform P-function and the uniform P-matrix condition. Subsequently, we focus on VIs arising from games and interpret our main result in a game setting. Based on the P$_\Upsilon$-matrix condition, we provide a sufficient condition for a game to have a Nash equilibrium. Additionally, through examples we show that our sufficient conditions can be used to assert the existence of a solution to a VI, or a quasi-Nash in a game, while the existing results relying on the uniform P-function property or the P$_\Upsilon$-matrix condition cannot be employed.</description>

      <title>Distributed Online Economic Dispatch With Time-Varying Coupled Inequality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the distributed online economic dispatch problem for power systems with time-varying coupled inequality constraints. The problem is formulated as a distributed online optimization problem in a multi-agent system. At each time step, each agent only observes its own instantaneous objective function and local inequality constraints; agents make decisions online and cooperate to minimize the sum of the time-varying objectives while satisfying the global coupled constraints. To solve the problem, we propose an algorithm based on the primal-dual approach combined with constraint-tracking. Under appropriate assumptions that the objective and constraint functions are convex, their gradients are uniformly bounded, and the path length of the optimal solution sequence grows sublinearly, we analyze theoretical properties of the proposed algorithm and prove that both the dynamic regret and the constraint violation are sublinear with time horizon T. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a time-varying economic dispatch problem in power systems using both synthetic data and Australian Energy Market data. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs effectively in terms of tracking performance, constraint satisfaction, and adaptation to time-varying disturbances, thereby providing a practical and theoretically well-supported solution for real-time distributed economic dispatch.</description>

      <title>Classical solution to second-order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and optimal feedback control for linear-convex problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the classical solvability of a class of second-order Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations (HJB equations) arising from stochastic optimal control problems with linear dynamics and uniformly convex cost functionals. By introducing the Hamiltonian system and extending the gradient descent method to a Hilbert space, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control under the uniform convexity condition. The regularity of the solution to the Hamiltonian system is obtained, including the derivatives with respect to the initial state and the Malliavin derivatives. The connection between the Hamiltonian system and the value function is subsequently proven, enabling us to derive regularity properties of the value function via probabilistic techniques. Finally, by the dynamic programming principle, the value function is verified to be the unique classical solution to the HJB equation and the optimal feedback control is provided. These results generalize the classical linear-quadratic theory and provide a new insight into the regularity of the value function.</description>

      <title>Continuized Nesterov Acceleration for Non-Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In convex optimization, continuous-time counterparts have been a fruitful tool for analyzing momentum algorithms. Fewer such examples are available when the function to minimize is non-convex. In several cases, discrepancies arise between the existing discrete-time results, namely those obtained for momentum algorithms, and their continuous-time counterparts, with the latter typically yielding stronger guarantees. We argue that the continuized framework (Even et al., 2021), mixing continuous and discrete components, can tighten the gap between known continuous and discrete results. This framework relies on computations akin to standard Lyapunov analyses, from which are deduced convergence bounds for an algorithm that can be written as a Nesterov momentum algorithm with stochastic parameters. In this work, we extend the range of applicability of the continuized framework, e.g. by allowing it to handle non-smooth Lyapunov functions. We then strengthen its trajectory-wise guarantees for linear convergence rate, deriving finite time bounds with high probability and asymptotic almost sure bounds. We apply this framework to the non-convex class of strongly quasar convex functions. Adapting continuous-time results that have weaker discrete equivalents to the continuized method, we improve by a constant factor the known convergence rate, and relax the existing assumptions on the set of minimizers.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Global Convergence of PPO-Clip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained attention for aligning large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The actor-only variants of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are widely applied for their efficiency. These algorithms incorporate a clipping mechanism to improve stability. Besides, a regularization term, such as the reverse KL-divergence or a more general \(f\)-divergence, is introduced to prevent policy drift. Despite their empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the problem and the algorithm's properties is limited. This paper advances the theoretical foundations of the PPO-Clip algorithm by analyzing a deterministic actor-only PPO algorithm within the general RL setting with \(f\)-divergence regularization under the softmax policy parameterization. We derive a non-uniform Lipschitz smoothness condition and a {\L}ojasiewicz inequality for the considered problem. Based on these, a non-asymptotic linear convergence rate to the globally optimal policy is established for the forward KL-regularizer. Furthermore, stationary convergence and local linear convergence are derived for the reverse KL-regularizer.</description>

      <title>Muon is Provably Faster with Momentum Variance Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent empirical research has demonstrated that deep learning optimizers based on the linear minimization oracle (LMO) over specifically chosen Non-Euclidean norm balls, such as Muon and Scion, outperform Adam-type methods in the training of large language models. In this work, we show that such optimizers can be provably improved by replacing their vanilla momentum by momentum variance reduction (MVR). Instead of proposing and analyzing MVR variants of Muon and Scion separately, we incorporate MVR into the recently proposed Gluon framework, which captures Muon, Scion and other specific Non-Euclidean LMO-based methods as special cases, and at the same time works with a more general smoothness assumption which better captures the layer-wise structure of neural networks. In the non-convex case, we incorporate MVR into Gluon in three different ways. All of them improve the convergence rate from ${\cal O} (\frac{1}{K^{1/4}})$ to ${\cal O} (\frac{1}{K^{1/3}})$. Additionally, we provide improved rates in the star-convex case. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments that verify the superior performance of our proposed algorithms in terms of iteration complexity.</description>

      <title>The Bi-objective Electric Autonomous Dial-a-Ride Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric autonomous dial-a-ride problem (E-ADARP) introduces electric, autonomously driving vehicles and their unique requirements into the classic dial-a-ride problem, where people are transported between pickup and drop-off locations. Next to an electric autonomous vehicle fleet, in the literature, a weighted-sum objective function, which combines the classic routing cost-oriented objective with a user-oriented objective function, has usually been considered. The user-oriented objective function minimizes the total excess user ride time. In this work, we treat them as two separate objective functions, which are optimized concurrently. In order to address the resulting bi-objective E-ADARP, we develop a novel exact framework (called fragment-based checker), whose core part is a smart ``select-and-check" algorithm that iteratively constructs feasible solutions using fragments. Several enhancements are proposed to enforce the computational efficiency of the proposed method. In the computational experiments, we evaluate several variants of our checker algorithm by leveraging a previously developed branch-and-price algorithm. We benchmark the checker-based framework against state-of-the-art criterion space frameworks as well as a generalized branch-and-price algorithm. Numerical results on both bi-objective DARP and E-ADARP instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. With our proposed approaches, 21 out of 38 instances are solved optimally, where small-to-medium-sized instances are solved within seconds. On larger-scale instances, especially those requiring high battery end levels are computationally challenging to solve, our approaches provide high-quality approximations of the Pareto frontiers. Efficient solutions with varying energy restrictions are compared and we obtain valuable managerial insights for different kinds of service providers.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for ranking-based pivot rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a polynomial pivot rule for the simplex method for linear programming, policy iteration for Markov decision processes, and strategy improvement for parity games each are prominent open problems in their respective fields. While numerous natural candidates for efficient rules have been eliminated, all existing lower bound constructions are tailored to individual or small sets of pivot rules. We introduce a unified framework for formalizing classes of rules according to the information about the input that they rely on. Within this framework, we show lower bounds for \emph{ranking-based} classes of rules that base their decisions on orderings of the improving pivot steps induced by the underlying data. Our first result is a superpolynomial lower bound for strategy improvement, obtained via a family of sink parity games, which applies to memory-based generalizations of Bland's rule that only access the input by comparing the ranks of improving edges in some global order. Our second result is a subexponential lower bound for policy iteration, obtained via a family of Markov decision processes, which applies to memoryless rules that only access the input by comparing improving actions according to their ranks in a global order, their reduced costs, and the associated improvements in objective value. Both results carry over to the simplex method for linear programming.</description>

      <title>A survey of the orienteering problem: model evolution, algorithmic advances, and future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orienteering problem (OP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that seeks a path visiting a subset of locations to maximize collected rewards under a limited resource budget. This article presents a systematic PRISMA-based review of OP research published between 2017 and 2025, with a focus on models and methods that have shaped subsequent developments in the field. We introduce a component-based taxonomy that decomposes OP variants into time-, path-, node-, structure-, and information-based extensions. This framework unifies classical and emerging variants -- including stochastic, time-dependent, Dubins, Set, and multi-period OPs -- within a single structural perspective. We further categorize solution approaches into exact algorithms, heuristics and metaheuristics, and learning-based methods, with particular emphasis on matheuristics and recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning and neural networks, which enhance scalability in large-scale and information-rich settings. Building on this unified view, we discuss how different components affect computational complexity and polyhedral properties and identify open challenges related to robustness, sustainability, and AI integration. The survey thus provides both a consolidated reference for existing OP research and a structured agenda for future theoretical and applied work.</description>

      <title>DiscoverDCP: A Data-Driven Approach for Construction of Disciplined Convex Programs via Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose DiscoverDCP, a data-driven framework that integrates symbolic regression with the rule sets of Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) to perform system identification. By enforcing that all discovered candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules, we ensure that the output expressions are globally convex by construction, circumventing the computationally intractable process of post-hoc convexity verification. This approach allows for the discovery of convex surrogates that exhibit more relaxed and accurate functional forms than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions (e.g., quadratic functions). The proposed method produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks.</description>

Abstract: Traditional ethical frameworks often struggle to model decision-making under uncertainty, treating it as a simple constraint on action. This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).
  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda &gt; 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.
  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk.</description>

      <title>Optimization Techniques in Quantum Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on the intersection of mathematical and computational optimization and quantum information. Main contributions are open-source software code: A hybrid approach mixing "traditional" nonconvex and convex methods can make difficult problems more accessible. A demonstration of how to efficiently implement such an algorithm, avoiding interfacial bottlenecks, is provided, finding optimal protocols to establish entanglement through a lossy channel. The central software package developed addresses polynomial optimization problems. Many problems naturally involve only a polynomial objective and constraint polynomials. Such problems can automatically be cast into semidefinite programs that provide a hierarchy of outer approximations. The resulting problems are often so large and scale so unfavorably with respect to the variable number and degree involved that the boundary of the doable is reached quickly. However, technical progress both in hardware and algorithms has pushed this boundary - but software frameworks for polynomial optimization have not followed in the same manner, often now making them the bottleneck that before was the solver. The package PolynomialOptimization.jl developed during this thesis aims to fill the gap and provide a very resource-efficient intermediate layer together with a wide number of algorithms to reduce the problem size, and naturally supporting complex numbers and semidefinite constraints ubiquitous in quantum information problems. Its application on an entanglement distribution problem is demonstrated, showing that even relaxations with semidefinite matrices of three- and four-digit size can be solved conveniently. Finally, a new way to calculate interior-point barriers for the cone of sums-of-squares matrices in a nearly time-optimal way is developed, whose efficient implementation has the potential of further reducing resource consumption.</description>

Abstract: We study the locus of square matrices having at least one eigenvector on a prescribed algebraic variety $X$. When $X$ is a linear subspace, this data locus is known as the Kalman variety of $X$ and was studied first by Ottaviani and Sturmfels. Motivated by recent applications to quantum chemistry and optimization, in this work, we focus on nonlinear Kalman varieties, that is, Kalman varieties relative to arbitrary projective varieties $X$. We study the basic invariants of these varieties, such as their dimensions, degrees, and singularities. Furthermore, Ottaviani and Sturmfels provide determinantal equations in the linear case. We generalize their result to Kalman varieties of hypersurfaces by providing a determinantal-like description of their equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study continuous-time persuasion where a sender controls both how informative a signal is over time and when to stop providing information to a receiver. Given an exogenous signal process, the sender can both garble the evolving signal path and delay the receiver's decision at a convex, increasing cost of time. We show that, although both instruments are available, any optimal persuasion scheme is fully transparent: the sender keeps the signal fully informative and persuades solely by choosing when to stop.</description>

      <title>Bilevel linear optimization belongs to NP and admits polynomial-size KKT-based reformulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06639v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a well-known result that bilevel linear optimization is NP-hard. In many publications, reformulations as mixed-integer linear optimization problems are proposed, which suggests that the decision version of the problem belongs to NP. However, to the best of our knowledge, a rigorous proof of membership in NP has never been published, so we close this gap by reporting a simple but not entirely trivial proof. A related question is whether a large enough "big M" for the classical KKT-based reformulation can be computed efficiently, which we answer in the affirmative. In particular, our big M has polynomial encoding length in the original problem data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inducibility of a graph represents its maximum density as an induced subgraph over all possible sequences of graphs of size growing to infinity. This invariant of graphs has been extensively studied since its introduction in $1975$ by Pippenger and Golumbic. In $2017$, Czabarka, Sz\'ekely and Wagner extended this notion to leaf-labeled rooted binary trees, which are objects widely studied in the field of phylogenetics. They obtain the first results and bounds for the densities and inducibilities of such trees. Following up on their work, we apply Razborov's flag algebra theory to this setting, introducing the flag algebra of rooted leaf-labeled binary trees. This framework allows us to use polynomial optimization methods, based on semidefinite programming, to efficiently obtain new upper bounds for the inducibility of trees and to improve existing ones. Additionally, we obtain the first outer approximations of profiles of trees, which represent all possible simultaneous densities of a pair of trees in a sequence of trees of growing sizes. Finally, we are able to prove the non-convexity of some of these profiles.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic regularity of a generalised stochastic Halpern scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide abstract, general and highly uniform rates of asymptotic regularity for a generalized stochastic Halpern-style iteration, which incorporates a second mapping in the style of a Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. This iteration is general in two ways: First, it incorporates stochasticity completely abstractly, rather than fixing a sampling method; second, it includes as special cases stochastic versions of various schemes from the optimization literature, including Halpern's iteration as well as a Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration with Tikhonov regularization terms in the sense of Bo\c{t}, Csetnek and Meier (where this stochastic variant of the latter is considered for the first time in this paper). For these specific cases, we obtain linear rates of asymptotic regularity, matching (or improving) the currently best known rates for these iterations in stochastic optimization, and quadratic rates of asymptotic regularity are obtained in the context of inner product spaces for the general iteration. We conclude by discussing how variance can be managed in practice through sampling methods in the style of minibatching, how our convergence rates can be adapted to provide oracle complexity bounds, and by sketching how the schemes presented here can be instantiated in the context of reinforcement learning to yield novel methods for Q-learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Second-order methods are of great importance for composite convex optimization problems due to their local super-linear convergence rates (under appropriate assumptions). However, the presence of even a simple nonsmooth function in the model most often renders the subproblems in proximal Newton methods computationally difficult to solve in high dimensions. We introduce a novel approach based on a \textit{weak proximal Newton oracle} (WPNO), which only requires solving such subproblems to accuracy that is comparable to that of the \emph{optimal solution of the global problem}, while maintaining local super-linear convergence under standard assumptions. Mainly, unlike classical inexact proximal Newton schemes, the complexity of our WPNO is not tied to (approximately) minimizing each subproblem; instead, we establish that when the optimal solution of the global problem admits a sparse structure, the inner subproblem can be solved by specialized first-order methods whose cost scales directly with the sparsity of this solution rather than with the ambient dimension.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by recent interest in graphon mean field games and their applications, this paper provides a comprehensive probabilistic analysis of graphon mean field control (GMFC) problems, where the controlled dynamics are governed by a graphon mean field stochastic differential equation with heterogeneous mean field interactions. We formulate the GMFC problem with general graphon mean field dependence and establish the existence and uniqueness of the associated graphon mean field forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). We then derive a version of the Pontryagin stochastic maximum principle tailored to GMFC problems. Furthermore, we analyze the solvability of the GMFC problem for linear dynamics and study the continuity and stability of the graphon mean field FBSDEs under the optimal control profile. Finally, we show that the solution to the GMFC problem provides an approximately optimal solution for large systems with heterogeneous mean field interactions, based on a propagation of chaos result.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to study the relationship between the maximum principle and the dynamic programming principle for recursive optimal control problem of stochastic evolution equations, where the control domain is not necessarily convex and the value function may be nonsmooth. By making use of the notion of conditionally expected operator-valued backward stochastic integral equations, we establish a connection between the first and second-order adjoint processes in MP and the general derivatives of the value function. Under certain additional assumptions, the value function is shown to be $C^{1,1}$-regular. Furthermore, we discuss the smooth case and present several applications of our results.</description>

      <title>Hull Clustering with Blended Representative Periods for Energy System Optimization Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing integration of renewable energy sources into power systems requires planning models to account for not only demand variability but also fluctuations in renewable availability during operational periods. Capturing this temporal detail over long planning horizons can be computationally demanding or even intractable. A common approach to address this challenge is to approximate the problem using a reduced set of selected time periods, known as representative periods (RPs). However, using too few RPs can significantly degrade solution quality. In this paper, we propose the method of hull clustering with blended RPs to enhance traditional clustering-based RP approaches in two key ways. First, instead of selecting typical cluster centers (e.g., centroids or medoids) as RPs, our method is based on extreme points, which are more likely to be constraint-binding. Second, it represents base periods as weighted combinations of RPs (e.g., convex or conic blends), approximating the full time horizon more accurately and with fewer RPs. Through two case studies based on data from the European network operators, we demonstrate that hull clustering with blended RPs outperforms traditional RP techniques in both regret and computational efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Control theory of dynamical systems offers a powerful framework for tackling challenges in deep neural networks and other machine learning architectures. We show that concepts such as simultaneous and ensemble controllability offer new insights into the classification and representation properties of deep neural networks, while the control and optimization of static systems can be employed to better understand the performance of shallow networks. Inspired by the classical concept of turnpike, we also explore the relationship between dynamic and static neural networks, where depth is traded for width, and the role of transformers as mechanisms for accelerating classical neural network tasks. We also exploit the expressive power of neural networks (exemplified, for instance, by the Universal Approximation Theorem) to develop a novel hybrid modeling methodology, the Hybrid-Cooperative Learning (HYCO), combining mechanics and data-driven methods in a game-theoretic setting. Finally, we describe how classical properties of diffusion processes, long established in the context of partial differential equations, contribute to explaining the success of modern generative artificial intelligence (AI). We present an overview of our recent results in these areas, illustrating how control, machine learning, numerical analysis, and partial differential equations come together to motivate a fertile ground for future research.</description>

Abstract: We revisit random search for stochastic optimization, where only noisy function evaluations are available. We show that the method works under weaker smoothness assumptions than previously considered, and that stronger assumptions enable improved guarantees. In the finite-sum setting, we design a variance-reduced variant that leverages multiple samples to accelerate convergence. Our analysis relies on a simple translation invariance property, which provides a principled way to balance noise and reduce variance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Second-order methods promise faster convergence but are rarely used in practice because Hessian computations and decompositions are far more expensive than gradients. We propose a \emph{split-client} framework where gradients and curvature are computed asynchronously by separate clients. This abstraction captures realistic delays and inexact Hessian updates while avoiding the manual tuning required by Lazy Hessian methods. Focusing on cubic regularization, we show that our approach retains strong convergence guarantees and achieves a provable wall-clock speedup of order $\sqrt{\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the relative time needed to compute and decompose the Hessian compared to a gradient step. Since $\tau$ can be orders of magnitude larger than one in high-dimensional problems, this improvement is practically significant. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm the theory: asynchronous curvature consistently outperforms vanilla and Lazy Hessian baselines, while maintaining second-order accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines aspirational requirements for software addressing mixed-integer optimization problems constrained by the nonlinear Shallow Water partial differential equations (PDEs), motivated by applications such as river-flow management in hydropower cascades. Realistic deployment of such software would require the simultaneous treatment of nonlinear and potentially non-smooth PDE dynamics, limited theoretical guarantees on the existence and regularity of control-to-state mappings under varying boundary conditions, and computational performance compatible with operational decision-making. In addition, practical settings motivate consideration of uncertainty arising from forecasts of demand, inflows, and environmental conditions. At present, the theoretical foundations, numerical optimization methods, and large-scale scientific computing tools required to address these challenges in a unified and tractable manner remain the subject of ongoing research across the associated research communities. Rather than proposing a complete solution, this work uses the problem as a case study to identify and organize the mathematical, algorithmic, and computational components that would be necessary for its realization. The resulting framework highlights open challenges and intermediate research directions, and may inform both more circumscribed related problems and the design of future large-scale collaborative efforts aimed at addressing such objectives.</description>

      <title>A preconditioned second-order convex splitting algorithm with extrapolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonconvex optimization problems are widespread in modern machine learning and data science. We introduce an extrapolation strategy into a class of preconditioned second-order convex splitting algorithms for nonconvex optimization problems. The proposed algorithms combine second-order backward differentiation formulas (BDF2) with an extrapolation method. Meanwhile, the implicit-explicit scheme simplifies the subproblem through a preconditioned process. As a result, our approach solves nonconvex problems efficiently without significant computational overhead. Theoretical analysis establishes global convergence of the algorithms using Kurdyka-\L ojasiewicz properties. Numerical experiments include a benchmark problem, the least squares problem with SCAD regularization, and an image segmentation problem. These results demonstrate that our algorithms are highly efficient, as they achieve reduced solution times and competitive performance.</description>

Abstract: Historical information, such as past function values or gradients, has significant potential to enhance decentralized optimization methods for two key reasons: first, it provides richer information about the objective function, which also explains its established success in centralized optimization; second, unlike the second-order derivative or its alternatives, historical information has already been computed or communicated and requires no additional cost to acquire. Despite this potential, it remains underexploited. In this work, we employ a proximal bundle framework to incorporate the function values and gradients at historical iterates and adapt the framework to the proximal decentralized gradient descent method, resulting in a Decentralized Proximal Bundle Method (DPBM). To broaden its applicability, we further extend DPBM to the asynchronous and stochastic setting. We theoretically analysed the convergence of the proposed methods. Notably, both the asynchronous DPBM and its stochastic variant can converge with fixed step-sizes that are independent of delays, which is superior to the delay-dependent step-sizes required by most existing asynchronous optimization methods, as it is easier to determine and often leads to faster convergence. Numerical experiments on classification problems demonstrate that by using historical information, our methods yield faster convergence and stronger robustness in the step-sizes.</description>

      <title>Optimization with Access to Auxiliary Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.00395v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental optimization question of minimizing a target function $f$, whose gradients are expensive to compute or have limited availability, given access to some auxiliary side function $h$ whose gradients are cheap or more available. This formulation captures many settings of practical relevance, such as i) re-using batches in SGD, ii) transfer learning, iii) federated learning, iv) training with compressed models/dropout, Et cetera. We propose two generic new algorithms that apply in all these settings; we also prove that we can benefit from this framework under the Hessian similarity assumption between the target and side information. A benefit is obtained when this similarity measure is small; we also show a potential benefit from stochasticity when the auxiliary noise is correlated with that of the target function.</description>

      <title>Control of McKean--Vlasov SDEs with Contagion Through Killing at a State-Dependent Intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a novel McKean--Vlasov control problem with contagion through killing of particles and common noise. Each particle is killed at an exponential rate according to an intensity process that increases whenever the particle is located in a specific region. The removal of a particle pushes others towards the removal region, which can trigger cascades that see particles exiting the system in rapid succession. We study the control of such a system by a central agent who intends to preserve particles at minimal cost. Our theoretical contribution is twofold. Firstly, we rigorously justify the McKean--Vlasov control problem as the limit of a corresponding sequences of controlled finite particle systems. Our proof is based on a controlled martingale problem and tightness arguments. Secondly, we connect our framework with models in which particles are killed once they hit the boundary of the removal region. We show that these models appear in the limit as the exponential rate tends to infinity. As a corollary, we obtain new existence results for McKean--Vlasov SDEs with singular interaction through hitting times which extend those in the established literature. We conclude the paper with numerical investigations of our model applied to government control of systemic risk in financial systems.</description>

      <title>Provable optimal transport with transformers: The essence of depth and prompt engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite their empirical success, the internal mechanism by which transformer models align tokens during language processing remains poorly understood. This paper provides a mechanistic and theoretical explanation of token alignment in LLMs. We first present empirical evidences showing that, in machine translation, attention weights progressively align translated word pairs across layers, closely approximating Optimal Transport (OT) between word embeddings. Building on this observation, we prove that softmax self-attention layers can simulate gradient descent on the dual of the entropy-regularized OT problem, providing a theoretical foundation for the alignment. Our analysis yields a constructive convergence bound showing that transformer depth controls OT approximation accuracy. A direct implication is that standard transformers can sort lists of varying lengths without any parameter adjustment, up to an error term vanishing with transformers depth.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Portfolio Optimization with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid-quantum classical optimization has emerged as a promising direction for addressing financial decision problems under current quantum hardware constraints. In this work we present a practical end-to-end portfolio optimization pipeline that combines (i) a continuous mean-variance and Sharpe-ratio formulation, (ii) a QUBO/CQM-based discrete asset selection stage solved using D-Wave's hybrid quantum annealing solver, (iii) classical convex optimization for computing optimal asset weights, and (iv) a quarterly rebalancing mechanism. Rather than claiming quantum advantage, our goal is to evaluate the feasibility and integration of these components within a deployable financial workflow. We empirically compare our hybrid pipeline against a fund manager in real time and indexes used in Indian stock market. The results indicate that the proposed framework can construct diversified portfolios and achieve competitive returns. We also report computational considerations and scalability observations drawn from the hybrid solver behaviour. While the experiments are limited to moderate sized portfolios dictated by current annealing hardware and QUBO embedding constraints, the study illustrates how quantum assisted selection and classical allocation can be combined coherently in a real-world setting. This work emphasizes methodological reproducibility and practical applicability, and aims to serve as a step toward larger-scale financial optimization workflows as quantum annealers continue to mature.</description>

      <title>Joint Power Allocation and Reflecting-Element Activation for Energy Efficiency Maximization in IRS-Aided Communications Under CSI Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the joint power allocation and reflecting element (RE) activation to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) in communication systems assisted by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), taking into account imperfections in channel state information (CSI). The robust optimization problem is mixed integer, i.e., the optimization variables are continuous (transmit power) and discrete (binary states of REs). In order to solve this challenging problem we develop two algorithms. The first one is an alternating optimization (AO) method that attains a suboptimal solution with low complexity, based on the Lambert W function and a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. The second one is a branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) method that uses AO as its subroutine and is formally guaranteed to achieve a globally optimal solution. Both algorithms do not require any external optimization solver for their implementation. Furthermore, numerical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the baseline schemes, AO achieves near-optimal performance in most cases, and B&amp;B has low computational complexity on average.</description>

      <title>Network-Optimised Spiking Neural Network for Event-Driven Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-critical networking requires low-latency decisions from sparse and bursty telemetry, where fixed-step neural inference waste computation. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a two-state neuron whose variables correspond to normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource. NOS combines a saturating excitability nonlinearity for finite buffers, service and damping leaks, graph-local inputs with per-link gates and delays, and differentiable resets compatible with surrogate gradients and neuromorphic deployment. We establish existence and uniqueness of subthreshold equilibria, derive Jacobian-based local stability tests, and obtain a scalar network stability threshold that separates topology from node physics through a Perron-mode spectral condition. A stochastic arrival model aligned with telemetry smoothing links NOS responses to classical queueing behaviour while explaining increased variability near stability margins. Across chain, star, and scale-free graphs, NOS improves early-warning F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and temporal-GNN baselines under a common residual-based protocol, while providing practical calibration and stability rules suited to resource-constrained networking deployments.

      <title>Improved High-probability Convergence Guarantees of Decentralized SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convergence in high-probability (HP) has been receiving increasing interest, due to its attractive properties, such as exponentially decaying tail bounds and strong guarantees for each individual run of an algorithm. While HP guarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is understood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in decentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded gradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap between assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the mean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic Gradient Descent ($\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized settings, where it is known that $\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same conditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence. Motivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\mathtt{DSGD}$ in the presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in HP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing uniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while simultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly convex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the number of users, demonstrating that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong performance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved results stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest (norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap between users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on the variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more fine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of independent interest.</description>

      <title>N2N: A Parallel Framework for Large-Scale MILP under Distributed Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18723v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallelization has emerged as a promising approach for accelerating MILP solving. However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&amp;B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the internal and boundary stabilization of the Cahn-Hilliard and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations under saturated feedback control. We conduct our study through the spectral analysis of the associated linear operator. We identify a finite number of eigenvalues related to the unstable part of the system and then design a stabilization strategy based on modal decomposition, linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), and geometric conditions on the saturation function. Local exponential stabilization in $H^{2}$ is established.</description>
