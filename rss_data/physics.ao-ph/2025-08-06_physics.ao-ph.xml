      <title>Perturbing the surface energy balance to emulate the historical pattern of tropical Pacific sea surface temperature trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strengthening of the zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient observed in the tropical Pacific in recent decades is a regional climate change signal that may be outside the range of historical simulations with comprehensive climate models. Given the important role that this change has on other aspects of climate, a series of idealized surface energy balance calculations with imposed parameters is performed to build a baseline understanding of the sensitivities that govern these changes. I quantify the requisite magnitudes of five perturbations that reach a new equilibrium with a mean-SST warming of about $0.5 \, \mathrm{K}$ and about $0.4 \, \mathrm{K}$ more west Pacific warming than east Pacific warming, based approximately on observed trends. A characteristic magnitude of zonal asymmetry in a surface energy tendency that can bring changes in line with observed trends is $\approx 3 \, \mathrm{W \, m^{-2}}$. Strengthened zonal SST gradients can arise from a more zonally asymmetric ocean heat flux that increases by $\approx 20\% \, \mathrm{K}^{-1}$ using that implied by ERA5's surface fluxes, a spatially varying radiative forcing with a west--east contrast of $\approx 3.3 \, \mathrm{W \, m^{-2}}$, a more amplifying surface radiative feedback in the west than the east with a contrast of $\approx 4 \, \mathrm{W \, m^{-2} \, K^{-1}}$, a surface-air relative humidity (RH) contrast that increases RH in the west and decreases it in the east by $\approx 0.5 \% \, \mathrm{K^{-1}}$, or a more zonally asymmetric wind speed that increases by $\approx 16 \% \, \mathrm{K^{-1}}$. The ``storylines'' of forced surface energy budget change identified here are valuable in determining the plausibility of mechanisms that may be absent or underestimated in coupled climate model simulations.</description>

      <title>A Summer Meridional Subsurface Temperature Dipole Mode in the South China Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ocean heat content variability in the South China Sea (SCS) plays a pivotal role in regional climate and extreme weather events, such as tropical cyclones. Using high-resolution ocean reanalysis data, we show that the SCS exhibits a summer subsurface temperature dipole mode that controls the interannual variability of ocean heat content in the upper SCS. This dipole mode manifests as warm anomalies in the north and cold anomalies in the south during strong monsoon years, and a reversed pattern during weak monsoons years. The monsoon variability is linked to large-scale climate variability associated with El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation transitions. Heat budget analysis indicates that this dipole pattern is primarily driven by vertical heat transport linked to opposite wind stress curl anomalies in the northern and southern basin. Accompanying the vertical heat transports is a shallow meridional overturning circulation that redistributes heat between the northern and southern SCS.</description>

      <title>Investigating a Characteristic Time Lag in the Ionospheric F-region's Response to Solar Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray and EUV solar flare emission cause increases in the Earth's dayside ionospheric electron density. While the response of the lower ionosphere to X-rays is well studied, the delay between EUV flare emission and the response of the ionospheric F-region has not been investigated. Here, we calculate the delays between incident He II 304 Angstrom emission, and the TEC response for 10 powerful solar flares, all of which exhibit delays under 1 minute. We assess these delays in relation to multiple solar and geophysical factors, and find a strong negative correlation (-0.85) between delay and He II flux change and a moderate negative correlation (-0.55) with rate of increase in He II flux. Additionally, flare magnitude and the X-ray-to-He II flux ratio at peak He II emission show strong negative correlations (-0.80 and -0.75, respectively). We also identify longer delays for flares occurring closer to the summer solstice. These results may have applications in upper-ionospheric recombination rate calculations, atmospheric modelling, and other solar-terrestrial studies. We highlight the importance of incident EUV and X-ray flux parameters on the response time of the ionospheric electron content, and these findings may also have implications for mitigating disruptions in communication and navigation systems.</description>

      <title>NeuralOM: Neural Ocean Model for Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-term, high-fidelity simulation of slow-changing physical systems, such as the ocean and climate, presents a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. Traditional autoregressive machine learning models often fail in these tasks as minor errors accumulate and lead to rapid forecast degradation. To address this problem, we propose NeuralOM, a general neural operator framework designed for simulating complex, slow-changing dynamics. NeuralOM's core consists of two key innovations: (1) a Progressive Residual Correction Framework that decomposes the forecasting task into a series of fine-grained refinement steps, effectively suppressing long-term error accumulation; and (2) a Physics-Guided Graph Network whose built-in adaptive messaging mechanism explicitly models multi-scale physical interactions, such as gradient-driven flows and multiplicative couplings, thereby enhancing physical consistency while maintaining computational efficiency. We validate NeuralOM on the challenging task of global Subseasonal-to-Seasonal (S2S) ocean simulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuralOM not only surpasses state-of-the-art models in forecast accuracy and long-term stability, but also excels in simulating extreme events. For instance, at a 60-day lead time, NeuralOM achieves a 13.3% lower RMSE compared to the best-performing baseline, offering a stable, efficient, and physically-aware paradigm for data-driven scientific computing.
