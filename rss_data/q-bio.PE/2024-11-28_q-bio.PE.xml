      <title>Concepts and methods for predicting viral evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12684</link>

Abstract: The seasonal human influenza virus undergoes rapid evolution, leading to significant changes in circulating viral strains from year to year. These changes are typically driven by adaptive mutations, particularly in the antigenic epitopes, the regions of the viral surface protein haemagglutinin targeted by human antibodies. Here we describe a consistent set of methods for data-driven predictive analysis of viral evolution. Our pipeline integrates four types of data: (1) sequence data of viral isolates collected on a worldwide scale, (2) epidemiological data on incidences, (3) antigenic characterization of circulating viruses, and (4) intrinsic viral phenotypes. From the combined analysis of these data, we obtain estimates of relative fitness for circulating strains and predictions of clade frequencies for periods of up to one year. Furthermore, we obtain comparative estimates of protection against future viral populations for candidate vaccine strains, providing a basis for pre-emptive vaccine strain selection. Continuously updated predictions obtained from the prediction pipeline for influenza and SARS-CoV-2 are available on the website https://previr.app.</description>

      <title>A stochastic field theory for the evolution of quantitative traits in finite populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinitely many distinct trait values may arise in populations bearing quantitative traits, and modeling their population dynamics is thus a formidable task. While classical models assume fixed or infinite population size, models in which the total population size fluctuates due to demographic noise in births and deaths can behave qualitatively differently from constant or infinite population models due to density-dependent dynamics. In this paper, I present a stochastic field theory for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of finite populations bearing one-dimensional quantitative traits. I derive stochastic field equations that describe the evolution of population densities, trait frequencies, and the mean value of any trait in the population. These equations recover well-known results such as the replicator-mutator equation, Price equation, and gradient dynamics in the infinite population limit. For finite populations, the equations describe the intricate interplay between natural selection, noise-induced selection, eco-evolutionary feedback, and neutral genetic drift in determining evolutionary trajectories. My work uses ideas from statistical physics, calculus of variations, and SPDEs, providing alternative methods that complement the measure-theoretic martingale approach that is more common in the literature.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of macroscopic dynamics by fine-grained disorder in many-species ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large systems are often coarse-grained in order to study their low-dimensional macroscopic dynamics, yet microscopic complexity can in principle disrupt these predictions in many ways. We first consider one form of fine-grained complexity, heterogeneity in the time scales of microscopic dynamics, and show by an algebraic approach that it can stabilize macroscopic degrees of freedom. We then show that this time scale heterogeneity can arise from other forms of complexity, in particular disordered interactions between microscopic variables, and that it can drive the system's coarse-grained dynamics to transition from nonequilibrium attractors to fixed points. These mechanisms are demonstrated in a model of many-species ecosystems, where we find a quasi-decoupling between the low- and high-dimensional facets of the dynamics, interacting only through a key feature of ecological models, the fact that species' dynamical time scales are controlled by their abundances. We conclude that fine-grained disorder may enable a macroscopic equilibrium description of many-species ecosystems.</description>

      <title>An iterated learning model of language change that mixes supervised and unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The iterated learning model is an agent model which simulates the transmission of of language from generation to generation. It is used to study how the language adapts to pressures imposed by transmission. In each iteration, a language tutor exposes a na\"ive pupil to a limited training set of utterances, each pairing a random meaning with the signal that conveys it. Then the pupil becomes a tutor for a new na\"ive pupil in the next iteration. The transmission bottleneck ensures that tutors must generalize beyond the training set that they experienced. Repeated cycles of learning and generalization can result in a language that is expressive, compositional and stable. Previously, the agents in the iterated learning model mapped signals to meanings using an artificial neural network but relied on an unrealistic and computationally expensive process of obversion to map meanings to signals. Here, both maps are neural networks, trained separately through supervised learning and together through unsupervised learning in the form of an autoencoder. This avoids the computational burden entailed in obversion and introduces a mixture of supervised and unsupervised learning as observed during language learning in children. The new model demonstrates a linear relationship between the dimensionality of meaning-signal space and effective bottleneck size and suggests that internal reflection on potential utterances is important in language learning and evolution.</description>
