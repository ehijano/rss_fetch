      <title>To the theory of helical waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It makes sense to consider a helical waveguide with a fine pitch approximately, replacing the turns with anisotropic conductivity: infinite along the turns and zero across them. This approach has been known for a long time, but calculation formulas within it have only been obtained for the case where the winding does not contain a dielectric core. This paper addresses this gap in the theory: calculation formulas are obtained for the case where the waveguide contains a dielectric with a certain permittivity and magnetic permeability. An equation determining the slowing factor is found, and a method for its numerical solution is proposed. Explicit formulas are obtained for the wave impedance.</description>

      <title>Does a Curved Mirror Honestly Reflect Your Identity? A Study of Multipole Images in Front of a Grounded Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of image charges is a powerful and elegant technique in electrostatics, commonly used to determine the electric field generated by point charges near conductors of various shapes. While standard problems focus on single charges interacting with conductors, the behavior of multipoles in such configurations has received comparatively less attention, particularly beyond the well-studied case of a flat plane. In this paper, we explore the image formation of electric dipoles and quadrupoles near a conducting sphere and uncover a wonderful result: the image of a given multipole is not necessarily of the same type. Instead, alongside the expected multipole image, the resulting image configuration also includes lower-order multipole contributions. This finding broadens the understanding of electrostatic images and offers new insights into the interaction of multipoles with conducting boundaries.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Al-Si-Cu alloys as phase change materials for high temperature thermal energy storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work explores the suitability of Al-Cu-Si ternary alloys as hightemperature metallic phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage systems (TESS) operating between 550__C and 850__C. While prior research has primarily focused on thermodynamic modeling or thermal property characterization below 600{\textdegree}C, this work provides a comprehensive experimental assessment of selected invariant compositions within the Al-Cu-Si system. CALPHAD calculations were performed using FactSage 8.2 software (SGTE and FTLite database) to guide alloy selection, followed by synthesis and detailed characterization of melting point, latent heat, specific heat, thermal diffusivity, and thermal conductivity. Critically, the thermal reliability of these materials was evaluated under repeated solid-liquid cycling up to 100 cycles in oxidizing atmospheres, revealing their stability and degradation profiles. Additionally, dilatometry and density analysis were conducted to provide an in-depth understanding of the alloys and practical properties for end users. Among the tested alloys, several demonstrated high volumetric energy densities (over 500 kWh/m${}^3$ for a temperature difference of 300{\textdegree}C) and good thermal durability, establishing Al-Cu-Si alloys as promising PCM candidates for industrial-scale high-temperature energy storage applications. This study fills a notable gap in the literature by combining phase selection, comprehensive thermophysical property evaluation, and long-term cycling analysis above 600{\textdegree}C.</description>

      <title>Mathematical and numerical study of a model for navigation in stratified waters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a linear model of navigation in a two-layer fluid with a variable velocity of the ship. A spectral version of the model including a Rayleigh damping term is analyzed. We prove that the Cauchy problem has a unique solution if the velocity and if the initial data are sufficiently regular. The case of a constant speed is thoroughly investigated and the importance of a critical speed which separates two types of regimes is pointed out. We propose a numerical scheme based on the discrete Fourier transform for the space discretization and on an exponential integrator for the time discretization. We prove an error estimate for the exponential integrator. Numerical experiments in one and two space dimensions complete the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Heteroclinic for a 6-dimensional reversible system occuring in orthogonal domain walls in convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A six-dimensional reversible normal form system occurs in B{\'e}nard-Rayleigh convection between parallel planes, when we look for domain walls intersecting orthogonally (see Buffoni et al [1]). On the truncated system, we prove analytically the existence, local uniqueness, and analyticity in parameters, of a heteroclinic connection between two equilibria, each corresponding to a system of convective rolls. We prove that the 3-dimensional unstable manifold of one equilibrium, intersects transversally the 3-dimensional stable manifold of the other equilibrium, both manifolds lying on a 5-dimensional invariant manifold. We also study the linearized operator along the heteroclinic, allowing to prove (in [9]) the persistence under reversible perturbation, of the heteroclinic obtained in [1].</description>

      <title>Projective Transformations for Regularized Central-Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22681v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central-force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called "projective decomposition". The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy for nanometric layer thickness imaging with GHz elastic plate resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanometric layer thickness imaging is crucial for fundamental research and characterization of micro fabricated devices. Here, we assess the potential of a non-contact opto-acoustic frequency domain laser ultrasound (FreDomLUS) microscopy technique for imaging nanometric thickness variations via GHz zero-group velocity (ZGV) elastic plate resonances. The method exploits the ZGV's lateral energy confinement that leads to sharp resonance peaks which can be effectively probed with the FreDomLUS technique at GHz acoustic frequencies. For demonstration purposes we introduced sub-10 nm height variation patterns in the topmost layer of solidly mounted bulk-acoustic wave resonators with a design frequency of around 1.7 GHz. They are raster-scanned to retrieve ZGV-frequencies from local acoustic spectra as a contrast quantity for imaging. We show how to retrieve quantitative height information by numerically calibrating the factor which inversely relates ZGV frequency change with the layer thickness change. Height variations in stacks with nominal thickness changes of 8 nm, 4 nm, and 1 nm can be resolved and indicate sub-nanometer depth resolution capabilities. The lateral resolution is studied by measuring the method's step edge function and it is found to be in the micrometer range. Atomic force microscopy imaging is used to validate the results.</description>
