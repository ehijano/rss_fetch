      <title>Lyndon interpolation property for extensions of $\mathbf{S4}$ and intermediate propositional logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Lyndon interpolation property (LIP) and the uniform Lyndon interpolation property (ULIP) for extensions of $\mathbf{S4}$ and intermediate propositional logics. We prove that among the 18 consistent normal modal logics of finite height extending $\mathbf{S4}$ known to have CIP, 11 logics have LIP and 7 logics do not. We also prove that for intermediate propositional logics, the Craig interpolation property, LIP, and ULIP are equivalent.</description>

      <title>The reverse mathematics of the pigeonhole hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The infinite pigeonhole principle for $k$ colors ($\mathsf{RT}_k$) states, for every $k$-partition $A_0 \sqcup \dots \sqcup A_{k-1} = \mathbb{N}$, the existence of an infinite subset~$H \subseteq A_i$ for some~$i &lt; k$. This seemingly trivial combinatorial principle constitutes the basis of Ramsey's theory, and plays a very important role in computability and proof theory. In this article, we study the infinite pigeonhole principle at various levels of the arithmetical hierarchy from both a computability-theoretic and reverse mathematical viewpoint. We prove that this hierarchy is strict over~$\mathsf{RCA}_0$ using an elaborate iterated jump control construction, and study its first-order consequences. This is part of a large meta-mathematical program studying the computational content of combinatorial theorems.</description>

      <title>A Reflection Principle for Potential Infinite Models of Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denotational models of type theory, such as set-theoretic, domain-theoretic, or category-theoretic models use (actual) infinite sets of objects in one way or another. The potential infinite, seen as an extensible finite, requires a dynamic understanding of the infinite sets of objects. It follows that the type $nat$ cannot be interpreted as a set of all natural numbers, $\lbrack\!\lbrack nat \rbrack\!\rbrack = \mathbb{N}$, but as an increasing family of finite sets $\mathbb{N}_i = \{0, \dots, i-1\}$. Any reference to $\lbrack\!\lbrack nat \rbrack\!\rbrack$, either by the formal syntax or by meta-level concepts, must be a reference to a (sufficiently large) set $\mathbb{N}_i$.
  We present the basic concepts for interpreting a fragment of the simply typed $\lambda$-calculus within such a dynamic model. A type $\varrho$ is thereby interpreted as a process, which is formally a factor system together with a limit of it. A factor system is very similar to a direct or an inverse system, and its limit is also defined by a universal property. It is crucial to recognize that a limit is not necessarily an unreachable end beyond the process. Rather, it can be regarded as an intermediate state within the factor system, which can still be extended.
  The logical type $bool$ plays an important role, which we interpret classically as the set $\{true, false\}$. We provide an interpretation of simply typed $\lambda$-terms in these factor systems and limits. The main result is a reflection principle, which states that an element in the limit has a ``full representative'' at a sufficiently large stage within the factor system. For propositions, that is, terms of type $bool$, this implies that statements about the limit are true if and only if they are true at that sufficiently large stage.</description>

      <title>Field Knowledge as a Dual to Distributed Knowledge: A Characterization by Weighted Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of group knowledge concepts such as mutual, common, and distributed knowledge is well established within the discipline of epistemic logic. In this work, we incorporate epistemic abilities of agents to refine the formal definition of distributed knowledge and introduce a formal characterization of field knowledge. We propose that field knowledge serves as a dual to distributed knowledge. Our approach utilizes epistemic logics with various group knowledge constructs, interpreted through weighted models. We delve into the eight logics that stem from these considerations, explore their relative expressivity and develop sound and complete axiomatic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the irreducible affine Coxeter groups are first-order rigid and deduce from this that they are profinitely rigid in the absolute sense. We then show that the first-order theory of any irreducible affine Coxeter group does not have a prime model. Finally, we prove that universal Coxeter groups of finite rank are homogeneous, and that the same applies to every hyperbolic (in the sense of Gromov) one-ended right-angled Coxeter group.</description>

      <title>Around first-order rigidity of Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By the work of Sela, for any free group $F$, the Coxeter group $W_ 3 = \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \ast \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z} \ast \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ is elementarily equivalent to $W_3 \ast F$, and so Coxeter groups are not closed under elementary equivalence among finitely generated groups. In this paper we show that if we restrict to models which are generated by finitely many torsion elements (finitely torsion-generated), then we can recover striking rigidity results. Our main result is that if $(W, S)$ is a Coxeter system whose irreducible components are either spherical, or affine or (Gromov) hyperbolic, and $G$ is finitely torsion-generated and elementarily equivalent to $W$, then $G$ is itself a Coxeter group. This combines results of the second author et al. from [MPS22, PS23] with the following main hyperbolic result: if $W$ is a Coxeter hyperbolic group and $G$ is $\mathrm{AE}$-equivalent to $W$ and finitely torsion-generated, then $G$ belongs to a finite collection of Coxeter groups (modulo isomorphism). Furthermore, we show that there are two hyperbolic Coxeter groups $W$ and $W'$ which are non-isomorphic but $\mathrm{AE}$-equivalent. We also show that, on other hand, if we restrict to certain specific classes of Coxeter groups then we can recover the strongest possible form of first-order rigidity, which we call first-order torsion-rigidity, namely the Coxeter group $W$ is the only finitely torsion-generated model of its theory. Crucially, we show that this form of rigidity holds for the following classes of Coxeter groups: even hyperbolic Coxeter groups and free products of one-ended or finite hyperbolic Coxeter groups. We conjecture that the same kind of phenomena occur for the whole class of Coxeter groups. In this direction, we prove that if $W$ and $W'$ are even Coxeter groups which are elementarily equivalent, then they are isomorphic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1808.09088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, I investigate several combinatorial properties of Borel (or co-analytic) ideals on countable sets. I extend a theorem presented in M. Hru\v{s}\'{a}k, D. Meza-Alc\'antara, E. Th\"ummel, and C. Uzc\'ategui, \emph{Ramsey Type Properties of Ideals}, and also find an $F_\sigma$ tall ideal in which player II has a winning strategy in the Cut and Choose Game, which was a question posed by J. Zapletal. In the second section, I present some Ramsey properties of ideals, such as the previously known fact that the random graph ideal is critical for the Ramsey property (for subsets of size two and colorings with two colors) and construct a critical ideal for every Ramsey property. The third section includes comments on the Solecki ideal, and in the fourth section, I discover an $F_\sigma$ tall $K$-uniform ideal that is not equivalent to $\mathcal{ ED }_{fin}$, which is a question from Michael Hru\v{s}\'ak's.</description>

      <title>Bi-intermediate logics of trees and co-trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bi-Heyting algebra validates the G\"odel-Dummett axiom $(p\to q)\vee (q\to p)$ iff the poset of its prime filters is a disjoint union of co-trees (i.e., order duals of trees). Bi-Heyting algebras of this kind are called bi-G\"odel algebras and form a variety that algebraizes the extension $\mathsf{bi}$-$\mathsf{LC}$ of bi-intuitionistic logic axiomatized by the G\"odel-Dummett axiom. In this paper we initiate the study of the lattice $\Lambda(\mathsf{bi}$-$\mathsf{LC})$ of extensions of $\mathsf{bi}$-$\mathsf{LC}$.
  We develop the methods of Jankov-style formulas for bi-G\"odel algebras and use them to prove that there are exactly continuum many extensions of $\mathsf{bi}$-$\mathsf{LC}$. We also show that all these extensions can be uniformly axiomatized by canonical formulas. Our main result is a characterization of the locally tabular extensions of $\mathsf{bi}$-$\mathsf{LC}$. We introduce a sequence of co-trees, called the finite combs, and show that a logic in $\mathsf{bi}$-$\mathsf{LC}$ is locally tabular iff it contains at least one of the Jankov formulas associated with the finite combs. It follows that there exists the greatest non-locally tabular extension of $\mathsf{bi}$-$\mathsf{LC}$ and consequently, a unique pre-locally tabular extension of $\mathsf{bi}$-$\mathsf{LC}$. These results contrast with the case of the intermediate logic axiomatized by the G\"odel-Dummett axiom, which is known to have only countably many extensions, all of which are locally tabular.</description>

Abstract: Kim's Lemma is a key ingredient in the theory of forking independence in simple theories. It asserts that if a formula divides, then it divides along every Morley sequence in type of the parameters. Variants of Kim's Lemma have formed the core of the theories of independence in two orthogonal generalizations of simplicity - namely, the classes of NTP2 and NSOP1 theories. We introduce a new variant of Kim's Lemma that simultaneously generalizes the NTP2 and NSOP1 variants. We explore examples and non-examples in which this lemma holds, discuss implications with syntactic properties of theories, and ask several questions.</description>

      <title>Free algebras and coproducts in varieties of G\"odel algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: G\"odel algebras are the Heyting algebras satisfying the axiom $(x \to y) \vee (y \to x)=1$. We utilize Priestley and Esakia dualities to dually describe free G\"odel algebras and coproducts of G\"odel algebras. In particular, we realize the Esakia space dual to a G\"odel algebra free over a distributive lattice as the, suitably topologized and ordered, collection of all nonempty closed chains of the Priestley dual of the lattice. This provides a tangible dual description of free G\"odel algebras without any restriction on the number of free generators, which generalizes known results for the finitely generated case. A similar approach allows us to characterize the Esakia spaces dual to coproducts of arbitrary families of G\"odel algebras. We also establish analogous dual descriptions of free algebras and coproducts in every variety of G\"odel algebras. As consequences of these results, we obtain a formula to compute the depth of coproducts of G\"odel algebras and show that all free G\"odel algebras are bi-Heyting algebras.</description>

      <title>Proof complexity of positive branching programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.06673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the proof complexity of systems based on positive branching programs, i.e. non-deterministic branching programs (NBPs) where, for any 0-transition between two nodes, there is also a 1-transition. Positive NBPs compute monotone Boolean functions, just like negation-free circuits or formulas, but constitute a positive version of (non-uniform) NL, rather than P or NC1, respectively.
  The proof complexity of NBPs was investigated in previous work by Buss, Das and Knop, using extension variables to represent the dag-structure, over a language of (non-deterministic) decision trees, yielding the system eLNDT. Our system eLNDT+ is obtained by restricting their systems to a positive syntax, similarly to how the 'monotone sequent calculus' MLK is obtained from the usual sequent calculus LK by restricting to negation-free formulas.
  Our main result is that eLNDT+ polynomially simulates eLNDT over positive sequents. Our proof method is inspired by a similar result for MLK by Atserias, Galesi and Pudl\'ak, that was recently improved to a bona fide polynomial simulation via works of Je\v{r}\'abek and Buss, Kabanets, Kolokolova and Kouck\'y. Along the way we formalise several properties of counting functions within eLNDT+ by polynomial-size proofs and, as a case study, give explicit polynomial-size poofs of the propositional pigeonhole principle.</description>

Abstract: For every $n &gt;0$, we show the existence of a CNF tautology over $O(n^2)$ variables of width $O(\log n)$ such that it has a Polynomial Calculus Resolution refutation over $\{0,1\}$ variables of size $O(n^3polylog(n))$ but any Polynomial Calculus refutation over $\{+1,-1\}$ variables requires size $2^{\Omega(n)}$. This shows that Polynomial Calculus sizes over the $\{0,1\}$ and $\{+1,-1\}$ bases are incomparable (since Tseitin tautologies show a separation in the other direction) and answers an open problem posed by Sokolov [Sok20] and Razborov.</description>
