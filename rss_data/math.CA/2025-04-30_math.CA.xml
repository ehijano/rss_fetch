      <title>Contiguity relations for finite families of orthogonal polynomials in the Askey scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper classifies the contiguity relations for finite families of polynomials within the ($q$-)Askey scheme. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of these contiguity relations are presented first. These conditions are then solved, yielding a comprehensive list of contiguity relations for these various families of polynomials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all contiguity relations correspond to spectral transforms.</description>

      <title>Differential symmetry breaking operators for the pair $(\operatorname{GL}_{n+1}(\mathbb{R}),\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{R}))$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study differential symmetry breaking operators between principal series representations induced from minimal parabolic subgroups for the pair $(\operatorname{GL}_{n+1}(\mathbb{R}),\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{R}))$. Using the source operator philosophy we construct such operators for generic induction parameters of the representations and establish that this approach yields all possible operators in this setting. We show that these differential operators occur as residues of a family of symmetry breaking operators that depends meromorphically on the parameters. Finally, in the $n=2$ case we classify and construct all differential symmetry breaking operators for any parameters, including the non-generic ones.</description>

      <title>A compact $T1$ theorem for Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators associated with Zygmund dilations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a compact version of $T1$ theorem for singular integrals of Zygmund type on $\mathbb{R}^3$. More specifically, if a $(D_{\theta}, \delta_1, \delta_{2, 3})$-Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operator $T$ associated with Zygmund dilations admits the compact full and partial kernel representations, and satisfies the weak compactness property and the cancellation condition, then $T$ can be extended to a compact operator on $L^p(w)$ whenever (i) $p \in (1, \infty)$, $w \in A_{p, \mathcal{R}}$, and $\theta, \delta_1, \delta_{2, 3} \in (0, 1]$, or (ii) $p \in (1, \infty)$, $w \in A_{p, \mathcal{Z}}$, $\theta = \delta_1 = 1$, and $\delta_{2, 3} \in (0, 1]$. Here $A_{p, \mathcal{R}}$ and $A_{p, \mathcal{Z}}$ respectively denote the class of of strong $A_p$ weights and the class of Zygmund $A_p$ weights. Beyond that, under similar bilinear assumptions, we prove bilinear Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators associated with Zygmund dilations are compact from $L^{p_1}(\mathbb{R}^3) \times L^{p_2}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ to $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $p_1, p_2 \in (1, \infty)$, where $\frac1p = \frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2}$. The core of the proof is a compact dyadic representation, which asserts that under the hypotheses above, a (bilinear) Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operator associated with Zygmund dilations can be represented an average of some compact (bilinear) dyadic shifts of Zygmund nature. This further deepens our understanding of the compactness of singular integral operators.</description>

      <title>Evolution of weights on a connected finite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a connected finite graph, we propose an evolution of weights including Ollivier's Ricci flow as a special case. During the evolution process, on each edge, the speed of change of weight is exactly the difference between the Wasserstein distance related to two probability measures and certain graph distance. Here the probability measure may be chosen as an $\alpha$-lazy one-step random walk, an $\alpha$-lazy two-step random walk, or a general probability measure. Based on the ODE theory, we show that the initial value problem has a unique global solution.
  A discrete version of the above evolution is applied to the problem of community detection. Our algorithm is based on such a discrete evolution, where probability measures are chosen as $\alpha$-lazy one-step random walk and $\alpha$-lazy two-step random walk respectively. Note that the later measure has not been used in previous works [2, 16, 21, 24]. Here, as in [21], only one surgery needs to be performed after the last iteration. Moreover, our algorithm is much easier than those of [2, 16, 21], which were all based on Lin-Lu-Yau's Ricci curvature. The code is available at https://github.com/mjc191812/Evolution-of-weights-on-a-connected-finite-graph.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions for Legendre functions via differential equations having coalescing turning points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear second-order linear ordinary differential equations equations of the form $d^{2}w/dz^{2}=\{u^{2}f(a,z)+g(z)\}w$ are considered for large values of the real parameter $u$, $z$ being a complex variable ranging over a bounded or unbounded complex domain $Z$, and $a_{0} \leq a \leq a_{1} &lt; \infty$. It is assumed that $f(a,z)$ and $g(z)$ are analytic within $Z$. Furthermore, $f(a,z)$ has exactly two real simple zeros in $Z$ for $a&gt;a_{0}$ that depend continuously on $a$, and coalesce into a double zero as $a \to a_{0}$. Uniform asymptotic expansions are derived for solutions of the equation which involve parabolic cylinder functions and their derivatives, along with certain slowly varying coefficient functions. The new results involve readily computable coefficients and explicit error bounds, and are then applied to provide new asymptotic expansions for the associated Legendre functions when both the degree $\nu$ and order $\mu$ are large.</description>
