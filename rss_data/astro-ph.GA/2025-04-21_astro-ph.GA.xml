      <title>Using Lyman Alpha Absorption to Measure the Intensity and Variability of $z \sim 2.4$ Ultraviolet Background Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements of $z \sim 2.4$ ultraviolet background light using Lya absorption from galaxies at $z \sim 2-3$ in the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) database. Thanks to the wide area of this survey, we also measure the variability of this light across the sky. The data suggest an asymmetric geometry where integrated ultraviolet light from background galaxies is absorbed by \ion{H}{1} within the halo of a foreground galaxy, in a configuration similar to damped Lya systems. Using stacking analyses of over 400,000 HETDEX LAE spectra, we argue that this background absorption is detectable in our data. We also argue that the absorption signal becomes negative due to HETDEX's sky subtraction procedure. The amount that the absorption is over-subtracted is representative of the $z \sim 2.4$ UV contribution to the overall extragalactic background light (EBL) at Lya. Using this method, we determine an average intensity (in $\nu J_{\nu}$ units) of $12.9 \pm 3.7$ nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at a median observed wavelength of 4134 angstroms, or a rest-frame UV background intensity of $508 \pm 145$ nW m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$ at $z\sim2.4$. We find that this flux varies significantly depending on the density of galaxies in the field of observation. Our estimates are consistent with direct measurements of the overall EBL.</description>

      <title>The effect of dynamical states on galaxy clusters populations. II. Comparison of galaxy properties and fundamental relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters provide a unique environment to study galaxy evolution. The role of cluster dynamical states in shaping the physical and morphological properties of member galaxies remains an open question. We aim to assess the impact of the dynamical state of massive ($M_{500} \geq 1.5 \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$) galaxy clusters on the physical and structural properties of their member galaxies, and also in their fundamental relations in the redshift range $0.10 &lt; z &lt; 0.35$. We use a mass-matched sample of galaxies from relaxed and disturbed clusters. Morphological types are assigned using both parametric and non-parametric methods, while physical properties are derived through SED fitting. Galaxies are further divided into subpopulations to investigate trends with cluster dynamical states. The dynamical state of galaxy clusters does not alter their fundamental relations at low redshift (such as color-magnitude, mass-size, morphology-density, and SF-density relations), nor does it significantly affect the mean or dispersion of galaxy properties. However, it does impact the distributions at the level of third and fourth order moments, introducing asymmetries and heavier tails in the properties of galaxies. The greatest effects are observed in low-mass and red sequence galaxies. These findings suggest that, at low redshift, the fundamental relations of massive galaxy clusters are already well-established and resilient to recent dynamical activity. Nonetheless, the influence of the dynamical state on the higher-order moments of galaxy properties indicates that environmental processes associated with disturbed clusters still leave measurable imprints, particularly on low-mass and red sequence galaxies. This is consistent with the idea that galaxy evolution is shaped both by early pre-processing and by subsequent interactions within dynamically active environments.</description>

      <title>Hidden Figures in the Sky: Evolution of low-surface brightness galaxies from a hydro-dynamical perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) are defined as galaxies with central surface brightness levels fainter than the night sky, making them challenging to observe. A key open question is whether their faint appearance arises from intrinsic properties or stochastic events in their formation histories. We aim to trace the formation histories of LSBGs to assess whether their evolutionary paths differ from those of high-surface brightness galaxies (HSBGs), and to identify the key physical drivers behind these differences. We present a fast and efficient method to estimate stellar surface brightness densities in hydro-dynamical simulations and a statistically robust exploration of over 150 properties in the reference run \textsc{Ref-L0100N1504} of the \texttt{EAGLE} simulation. To minimise biases, we carefully match the stellar and halo mass distributions of the selected LSB and HSB samples. At $z=0$, LSBGs are typically extended, rotation-supported systems with lower stellar densities, older stellar populations, reduced star formation activity, and higher specific stellar angular momenta $j_*$ than their HSBG counterparts. They also exhibit larger radii of maximum circular velocity ($R_{\mathrm{Vmax}}$). We identify key transition redshifts that mark the divergence of LSBG and HSBG properties: $j_*$ diverges at $z\sim5-7$ and $R_{\mathrm{Vmax}}$ at $z\sim2-3$. Star formation activity and large-scale environment seem to play only a minimal role in the development of LSB features. LSBGs follow mass-dependent evolutionary pathways, where early rapid formation and later slowdowns, combined with their distinct structural properties, influence their response to external factors like mergers and gas accretion. Their LSB nature emerges from intrinsic dynamical and structural factors rather than environmental influences, with angular momentum as a key driver of divergence at high redshifts.</description>

      <title>Resolving the black hole sphere of influence in a hyper-luminous obscured quasar at redshift 4.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) imprint gravitational signatures on the matter within their sphere of influence (SoI). Nuclear gas dynamics can hence be used to accurately measure the mass of an SMBH, yet such measurements remain elusive in the early Universe. We report the first dynamical measurement of an SMBH mass at $z &gt;$ 2, based on high spatial resolution observations of the [C II] emission line that resolve the SoI in an obscured quasar at $z$ = 4.6. The velocity dispersion rises radially toward the center, requiring the presence of a 6.3$~\pm~0.14$ $\times$ 10$^9~\rm M_{\odot}$ SMBH. We propose that obscured quasars allow [C II] survivability in the inner regions, and may be ideal targets for increasing dynamical SMBH mass estimates in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Clump-fed black hole growth in the first billion years of the universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how supermassive black holes (SMBHs) form in the early universe is one of the most challenging problems in astrophysics. Their high abundance in the first billion years, as observed by the James Webb Space Telescope, hints towards black hole seeds that accrete mass rapidly. The origin of this accreted mass is not known. Here, we consider a billion solar mass clumpy galaxy at z=5.48 with a 30 million solar mass black hole in the center. We show that the clumps should migrate to the central region because of torques from dynamical friction with the halo, funneling in at least 14 solar masses per year. This is fast enough to grow the observed SMBH, with only 1% of the accreted mass getting in and the rest going to a bulge. Clump-fed accretion could explain most young SMBHs because young galaxies are highly irregular with massive star-forming clumps.</description>

      <title>Detecting Intermediate-mass Black Holes Using Quasar Microlensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that numerous intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) may wander undetected across the Universe, emitting little radiation. These IMBHs largely preserve their birth masses, offering critical insights into the formation of heavy black hole seeds and the dynamical processes driving their evolution. We propose that such IMBHs could produce detectable microlensing effects on quasars. Their Einstein radii, comparable to the scale of quasar broad-line regions, magnify radiation from the accretion disk and broad emission lines, making these quasars outliers in flux scaling relations. Meanwhile, the microlensing causes long-term, quasi-linear variability that is distinguishable from the stochastic variability of quasars through its coherent multi-wavelength behavior. We develop a matched-filtering technique that effectively separates the long-term lensing signal from the intrinsic quasar variability, with sensitivity tripling each time the observational time span doubles. Moreover, as IMBHs are often surrounded by dense star clusters, their combined gravitational field produces substantial extended, concentric caustics. These caustics induce significant variability in optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray bands over decade timescales, alongside hour-to-day-scale flux fluctuations in broad emission lines. We predict a substantial number of detectable events in the upcoming surveys by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, considering recent IMBH mass density estimates. Even in the absence of positive detections, searches for these microlensing signals will place meaningful constraints on the cosmological mass density of IMBHs, advancing our understanding of their role in cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>Laboratory rotational spectra of cyanocyclohexane and its siblings (1- and 4-cyanocyclohexene) using a compact CP-FTMW spectrometer for interstellar detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave (CP-FTMW) spectroscopy is a versatile technique to record broadband gas-phase rotational spectra, enabling detailed investigations of molecular structure, dynamics, and hyperfine interactions. Here, we present the development and application of a CP-FTMW spectrometer operating in the 6.5-18 GHz frequency range, studying cyanocyclohexane, 1-cyanocyclohexene, and 4-cyanocyclohexene using a heated pulsed supersonic expansion source. The dynamic range, experimental resolution, and high sensitivity enable observation of multiple conformers, precise measurements of hyperfine splitting arising from nuclear quadrupole coupling due to the nitrogen atom in the cyano group, as well as the observation of singly $^{13}$C- and $^{15}$N-substituted isotopic isomers in natural abundance. Using the latter, precise structures for the molecules are derived. The accurate rotational spectra enabled a search for these species toward the dark, cold molecular cloud TMC-1; no signals are found, and we discuss the implications of derived upper limits on the interstellar chemistry of the cyanocyclohexane family.</description>

      <title>Molecular Clouds at the Edge of the Galaxy I. Variation of CO J=2-1/1-0 Line Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic edge at Galactocentric distances of 14\,--\,22\,kpc provides an ideal laboratory to study molecular clouds in an environment that is different from the solar neighborhood, due to its lower gas density, lower metallicity, and little or no perturbation from the spiral arms. Observations of CO\,($J$\,=\,2--1) spectral lines were carried out towards 72 molecular clouds located at the Galactic edge using the IRAM\,30\,m telescope. Combined with CO\,($J$\,=\,1--0) data from the MWISP project, we investigate the variations of $R_{21}$ across these Galactic edge clouds, with $R_{21}$ representing CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) integrated intensity ratios. These are found to range from 0.3 to 3.0 with a mean of 1.0\,$\pm$\,0.1 in the Galactic edge clouds. The proportions of very low ratio gas (VLRG; $R_{21}$\,&lt;\,0.4), low ratio gas (LRG; 0.4\,$\le$\,$R_{21}$\,&lt;\,0.7), high ratio gas (HRG; 0.7\,$\le$\,$R_{21}$\,&lt;\,1.0), and very high ratio gas (VHRG; $R_{21}$\,$\ge$\,1.0) are 6.9\%, 29.2\%, 26.4\%, and 37.5\%, respectively, indicating a significant presence of high $R_{21}$ ratio molecular gas within these regions. In our Galaxy, the $R_{21}$ ratio exhibits a gradient of initial radial decline followed by a high dispersion with increasing Galacticentric distance and a prevalence for high ratio gas. There is no apparent systematic variation within the Galactocentric distance range of 14 to 22\,kpc. A substantial proportion of HRG and VHRG is found to be associated with compact clouds and regions displaying star-forming activity, suggesting that the high $R_{21}$ ratios may stem from dense gas concentrations and recent episodes of star formation.</description>

      <title>Darkness in the Crust: Searching for the truly "Dark" Subhalos with Paleo-detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos are pivotal in understanding the small-scale structure of the universe, thereby offering a sensitive method to discriminate between different cosmological models. In this study, we estimate the local number density of cold DM subhalos in the solar neighborhood, and demonstrate that their sparse distribution makes their detection via direct detection experiments highly improbable. However, it is plausible to expect that an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ number of subhalos could be detected by Paleo-detectors, a proposed new technique to look for DM by reading out damage tracks left by past DM interactions in minerals, due to their extended exposure times. Hence, we explore how Paleo-detectors can serve as effective probes for the properties of low-mass subhalos, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}-10^8) M_{\odot}$. We find that Paleo-detectors might be able to constrain certain regions of the subhalo mass-concentration relation (for subhalo masses of $10-10^4 M_\odot$ if DM has a mass of $\sim5$GeV). This is a new and complementary type of study that seeks to combine information from the particle nature of DM to that of small scale structures.</description>

      <title>JWST Discovery of a High-Redshift Tidal Disruption Event Candidate in COSMOS-Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13248v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rates and properties of tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide valuable insights into their host galaxy central stellar densities and the demographics of their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs). TDEs have been observed only at low redshifts ($z \lesssim 1$), due to the difficulty in conducting deep time-domain surveys. In this work, we present the discovery of a high-redshift TDE candidate, HZTDE-1, in the COSMOS-Web survey with JWST's NIRCam, using a novel selection technique based on color and morphology. We first outline a methodology for identifying high-z TDEs in deep infrared imaging surveys, leveraging their unique spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of these transients. We apply this technique to COSMOS-Web in filters F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W, and identify HZTDE-1, a transient point source relative to archival UltraVISTA infrared observations. If we assume it is a TDE, we estimate its photometric redshift to be $z=5.02^{+1.32}_{-1.11}$. HZTDE-1 cannot be explained by reasonable supernova or AGN models. However, we cannot rule out a superluminous supernova at $z\gtrsim3$. If confirmed with follow-up observations, HZTDE-1 would represent the highest-redshift TDE discovery to date, and would suggest an enhancement of the TDE rate in the high-redshift universe. Our method, which can be applied to future deep surveys with JWST and Roman, offers a pathway to identify TDEs at $z&gt;4$ and probe black hole demographics at early cosmic times.</description>

      <title>Surface brightness-colour relations of Cepheids calibrated by optical interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface brightness-colour relations (SBCRs) are widely used to determine the angular diameters of stars. They are in particular used in the Baade-Wesselink (BW) method of distance determination of Cepheids. However, the impact of the SBCR on the BW distance of Cepheids is about 8%, depending on the choice of SBCR considered in the literature. We aim to calibrate a precise SBCR dedicated to Cepheids using the best quality interferometric measurements available as well as different photometric bands, including the Gaia bands. We selected interferometric and photometric data in the literature for seven Cepheids covering different pulsation periods. From the phased photometry in the different bands (VJHKG$\mathrm{G_{BP}G_{RP}}$) corrected from extinction and the interferometric limb-darkened angular diameters, we calculated the SBCR associated with each combination of colours. We first find that the seven Cepheids have consistent SBCRs as long as the two magnitudes considered are not too close in wavelengths. For the SBCR ($\mathrm{F_{V},V-K}$): $\mathrm{F_{V} = -0.1336_{\pm 0.0009}(V-K)_{0}+3.9572_{\pm 0.0015}}$, we obtain a root mean square (RMS) of 0.0040 mag, which is three times lower than the latest estimate from 2004. Also, for the first time, we present an SBCR dedicated to Cepheids based on Gaia bands only: $\mathrm{F_{G_{BP}} = -0.3001_{\pm 0.0030}(G_{BP}-G_{RP})_{0}+3.9977_{\pm 0.0029}}$, with an excellent RMS of 0.0061 mag. However, using theoretical models, we show that this SBCR is highly sensitive to metallicity. From this empirical multi-wavelength approach, we also show that the impact of the CircumStellar Environment (CSE) of Cepheids emission is not negligible and should be taken into account in the future.</description>

Abstract: The discovery of the most metal-poor stream, C-19, provides us with a fossil record of a stellar structure born very soon after the Big Bang. In this work, we search for new C-19 members over the whole sky by combining two complementary stream-searching algorithms, STREAMFINDER and StarGO,, and utilizing low-metallicity star samples from the Pristine survey as well as Gaia BP/RP spectro-photometric catalogues. We confirm twelve new members, spread over more than 100$^\circ$, using velocity and metallicity information from a set of spectroscopic follow-up programs that targeted a quasi-complete sample of our bright candidates ($G \lesssim 16.0$). From the updated set of stream members, we confirm that the stream is wide, with a stream width of $\sim200$ pc, and dynamically hot, with a derived velocity dispersion of $10.9^{+2.1}_{-1.5}$ km/s. The tension remains between these quantities and a purely baryonic scenario in which the relatively low-mass stream (even updated to a few $10^4M_{\odot}$) stems from a globular cluster progenitor, as suggested by its chemical abundances. Some heating mechanism, such as preheating of the cluster in its own dark matter halo or through interactions with halo sub-structures appears necessary to explain the tension. The impact of binaries on the measured dispersion also remains unknown. Detailed elemental abundances of more stream members as well as multi-epoch radial velocities from spectroscopic observations are therefore crucial to fully understand the nature and past history of the most metal-poor stream of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>JWST's little red dots: an emerging population of young, low-mass AGN cocooned in dense ionized gas</title>

Abstract: JWST has uncovered large numbers of compact galaxies at high redshift with broad hydrogen/helium lines. These include the enigmatic population known as "little red dots" (LRDs). Their nature is debated, but they are thought to be powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) or intense star formation. They exhibit unusual properties for SMBHs, such as black holes that are overmassive for their host galaxies and extremely weak X-ray and radio emission. Using the highest-quality JWST spectra, we show here that the lines are broadened by electron scattering with a narrow intrinsic line core. The data require high electron column densities and compact sizes (light days), which, when coupled with their high luminosities can only be explained by SMBH accretion. The narrow intrinsic cores of the lines imply upper limits on the black hole masses of $10^{5-7}$ $M_{\odot}$, two orders of magnitude lower than previous estimates. These are among the lowest mass SMBHs known at high redshift and suggest that this is a population of young, rapidly growing SMBHs. They are enshrouded in a dense cocoon of ionized gas, probably related to their youth, from which they are accreting close to the Eddington limit. Reprocessed nebular emission from the dense cocoon dominates the optical spectrum, explaining most LRD spectral characteristics and helping to suppress radio and X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>On the presence of a fifth force at the Galactic Center</title>

Abstract: Aims: The presence of a Yukawa-like correction to Newtonian gravity is investigated at the Galactic Center, leading to a new upper limit for the intensity of such a correction. Methods: We perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis using the astrometric and spectroscopic data of star S$2$ collected at the Very Large Telescope by GRAVITY, NACO and SINFONI instruments, covering the period from $1992$ to $2022$. Results: The precision of the GRAVITY instrument allows us to derive the most stringent upper limit at the Galactic Center for the intensity of the Yukawa contribution ($\propto \, \alpha e^{- \lambda r}$) to be $|\alpha| &lt; 0.003$ for a scale length $\lambda = 3 \cdot 10^{13}\, \rm m\, (\sim 200 \, \rm AU)$. This improves by roughly one order of magnitude all estimates obtained in previous works.</description>

      <title>Galactic warps: from cosmic noon to the current epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximately half of all disc galaxies exhibit appreciable warps in both their stellar and HI discs. The typical warp amplitude is small (a few degrees), and only becomes noticeable at the periphery of the galaxy disc. As a result, warps remain a relatively poorly studied phenomenon. In this study, we investigate a large sample of distant edge-on galaxies (approximately 1,000 objects) in order to examine the frequency and characteristics of stellar disc warps up to a redshift of $z \sim 2$. For the selected galaxies, we utilize HST data from the Cosmic Evolution Survey field and JWST observations from the Cosmic Dawn Center Archive. We measured the properties of disc warps and investigate their evolution as a function of redshift. Our results indicate a potential evolution in the observed frequency of strong S-shaped warps (with an amplitude greater than 4$^\circ$) in stellar discs as a function of redshift. At $z \approx 2$, the frequency of strong warps reaches approximately 50%, while at $z \approx 0$, this fraction decreases to around 10-15%. We attribute the observed evolution in the occurrence of strong warps to the changing frequency of galaxy interactions and mergers. If galaxy interactions represent one of the primary mechanisms responsible for the formation of warps, then the prevalence of vertical disc deformations should increase in tandem with the rising interaction and merger rate.</description>
