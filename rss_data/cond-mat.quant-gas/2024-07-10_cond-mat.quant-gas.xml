      <title>Josephson oscillations of two weakly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical experiment based on a particle number-conserving quantum field theory is performed for two initially independent Bose-Einstein condensates that are coherently coupled at two temperatures. The present model illustrates ab initio that the initial relative phase of each of the two condensates doesn't remain random, but is distributed around integer multiple values of $2\pi$ from the interference and thermalization of forward and backward propagating matter waves at the Boltzmann equilibrium, that intrinsically measures zero average phases for each of the two independent condensates. Following this approach, focus is put on the original Gedanken experiment of Anderson on whether a Josephson current between two initially separated Bose-Einstein condensates occurs in a deterministic way or not, depending on the initial phase distribution.</description>

      <title>Universal relations in Bose gases with power-law interactions in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive universal relations between thermodynamic quantities and the pair distribution function for bosons interacting via power-law interactions in three and two dimensions. We find beyond mean-field expressions for Tan's contact and establish new connections between the chemical potential and potential energy per particle, characteristic of systems with finite-range interactions. The obtained results are relevant for dipoles, quadrupoles, Rydberg atoms, excitons, van der Waals atoms, and other systems in the dilute limit.</description>

      <title>Finite size analysis for interacting bosons at the 2D-1D Dimensional Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the analysis of interacting bosons at 2D-1D dimensional crossover for finite size and temperature by using field-theory approach (bosonization) and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Stemming from the fact that finite size low-dimensional systems are allowed only to have quasi-ordered phase, we consider the self-consistent harmonic approximation to compute the fraction of quasi-condensate and its scaling with the system size. It allows us to understand the important role played by finite size and temperature across the dimensional crossover for deciding the condensate nature. Furthermore, we consider a mean-field approximation to compute the finite size effect on the crossover temperature for both weak and strong interaction. All the physical quantities we discuss here provide essential information for quantum gas at dimensional crossover and are directly detectable in cold atom experiments</description>

      <title>Supersolidity of polariton condensates in photonic crystal waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condensation of exciton-polaritons has been recently observed in one-dimensional photonic crystal waveguides, exploiting the interplay of long-lived gap confined eigenmodes and negative mass polariton branches. Here we focus on the theoretical emergence of a second emission threshold, in addition to the one associated with condensation at zero-momentum, due to the nonlinear polariton scattering from the condensate into finite momentum eigenmodes. The physics of this spatially modulated condensate is related to a spontaneous breaking of both phase and translational symmetries simultaneously, bearing strong similarities with the highly sought supersolid phase in Helium and ultracold atomic gases but with a novel mechanism typical of the driven-dissipative scenario. We then propose clear-cut and unequivocal experimental signatures that would allow to identify supersolidity phenomena in polariton condensates</description>

      <title>Hamiltonians for Quantum Systems with Contact Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of constructing self-adjoint and lower bounded Hamiltonians for a system of $n&gt;2$ non-relativistic quantum particles in dimension three with contact (or zero-range or $\delta$) interactions. Such interactions are described by (singular) boundary conditions satisfied at the coincidence hyperplanes, \emph{i.e.}, when the coordinates of two particles coincide. Following the line of recent works appeared in the literature, we introduce a boundary condition slightly modified with respect to usual boundary condition one has in the one-body problem. With such new boundary condition we can show that the instability property due to the fall to the center phenomenon described by Minlos and Faddeev in 1962 is avoided. Then one obtains a physically reasonable Hamiltonian for the system. We apply the method to the case of a gas of $N$ interacting bosons and to the case of $N$ distinguishable particles of equal mass $M$ interacting with a different particle. In the latter case we also discuss the limit of the model for $M \longrightarrow +\infty$. We show that in the limit one obtains the one-body Hamiltonian for the light particle subject to $N$ (non-local) point interactions placed at fixed positions. We will verify that such non-local point interactions do not exhibit the ultraviolet pathologies that are present in the case of standard local point interactions.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodicity protects quantized transport in disordered systems without gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The robustness of topological properties, such as adiabatic quantized currents, generally depends on the existence of gaps surrounding the relevant energy levels or symmetry-forbidden transitions. We uncover a new mechanism for topological protection via the observation of quantized currents which survive the addition of bounded local disorder large enough to close the relevant instantaneous energy gaps in a driven Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper chain, a prototypical model of quasiperiodic systems. Using a local picture in configuration-space based on Landau-Zener transitions, we show that in this case the topological protection does not depend on the spectral gaps, but rather on the number of states in an occupied band and the position of the band in configuration space. Moreover, we propose a protocol, realizable in cold atoms or photonic experiments, which leverages this stability to prepare topological many-body states with high Chern number and open new experimental avenues for the study of both the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects.</description>

      <title>An atomic boson sampler</title>

Abstract: A boson sampler implements a restricted model of quantum computing. It is defined by the ability to sample from the distribution resulting from the interference of identical bosons propagating according to programmable, non-interacting dynamics. Here, we demonstrate a new combination of tools for implementing boson sampling using ultracold atoms in a two-dimensional, tunnel-coupled optical lattice. These tools include fast and programmable preparation of large ensembles of nearly identical bosonic atoms ($99.5^{+0.5}_{-1.6}\;\%$ indistinguishability) by means of rearrangement with optical tweezers and high-fidelity optical cooling, propagation for variable evolution time in the lattice with low loss ($5.0(2)\;\%$, independent of evolution time), and high fidelity detection of the atom positions after their evolution (typically $99.8(1)\;\%$). With this system, we study specific instances of boson sampling involving up to $180$ atoms distributed among $\sim 1000$ sites in the lattice. Direct verification of a given boson sampling distribution is not feasible in this regime. Instead, we introduce and perform targeted tests to determine the indistinguishability of the prepared atoms, to characterize the applied family of single particle unitaries, and to observe expected bunching features due to interference for a large range of atom numbers. When extended to interacting systems, our work demonstrates the core capabilities required to directly assemble ground and excited states in simulations of various Hubbard models.</description>

      <title>Universal dynamics of the entropy of work distribution in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driving a quantum many-body system across the quantum phase transition (QPT) in the finite time has been concerned in different branches of physics to explore various fundamental questions. Here, we analyze how the underlying QPT affects the work distribution $P(W)$, when the control parameter of a ferromagnetic spinor Bose-Einstein condensates is tuned through the critical point in the finite time. We show that the work distribution undergoes a dramatic change with increasing the driving time $\tau$. To capture the characteristics of the work distribution, we analyze the entropy of $P(W)$ and find three different regions in the evolution of entropy as a function of $\tau$. Specifically, the entropy is insensitive to the driving time in the region of very short $\tau$, while it exhibits a universal power-law decay in the region with intermediate value of $\tau$. In particular, the power-law scaling of the entropy is according with the well-known Kibble-Zurek mechanism. For the region with large $\tau$, the validity of the adiabatic perturbation theory leads to the entropy decay as $\tau^{-2}\ln\tau$. Our results verify the usefulness of the entropy of the work distribution for understanding the critical dynamics and provide an alternative way to experimentally study nonequilibrium properties in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity detection of large-scale atom arrays in an optical lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04717v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulation based on neutral atoms have largely benefited from high-resolution, single-atom sensitive imaging techniques. A variety of approaches have been developed to achieve such local detection of atoms in optical lattices or optical tweezers. For alkaline-earth and alkaline-earth-like atoms, the presence of narrow optical transitions opens up the possibility of performing novel types of Sisyphus cooling, where the cooling mechanism originates from the capability to spatially resolve the differential optical level shifts in the trap potential. Up to now, it has been an open question whether high-fidelity imaging could be achieved in a "repulsive Sisyphus" configuration, where the trap depth of the ground state exceeds that of the excited state involved in cooling. Here, we demonstrate high-fidelity ($99.971(1)\%$) and high-survival ($99.80(5)\%$) imaging of strontium atoms using repulsive Sisyphus cooling. We use an optical lattice as a pinning potential for atoms in a large-scale tweezer array with up to $399$ tweezers and show repeated, high-fidelity lattice-tweezer-lattice transfers. We furthermore demonstrate loading the lattice with approximately 10000 atoms directly from the MOT and scalable imaging over $&gt;10000$ lattice sites with a combined survival probability and classification fidelity better than $99.2\%$. Our lattice thus serves as a locally addressable and sortable reservoir for continuous refilling of optical tweezer arrays in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14546v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare two quantum Hamiltonian algorithms that address the maximum independent set problem: one based on emergent non-abelian gauge matrix in adiabatic evolution of an energetically isolated manifold of states; and one based on designed application of single-qubit operations. We demonstrate that they are mathematically equivalent, though at first sight they appear quite different. Despite their mathematical equivalence, their most straightforward physical implementations are different. Our numerical simulations show significant differences in performance, and suggest improved experimental protocols.Intriguingly, this equivalence unveils a deeper connection. We also demonstrate that the PXP model, recently prominent in quantum dynamics research, arises as the non-abelian gauge matrix governing quantum diffusion over the median graph of all independent sets.</description>

      <title>Non-universal surface magnetoelectric response in antiferromagnetic topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic ground state of a three-dimensional (3D) band insulator with time-reversal ($\Theta$) symmetry or time-reversal times a discrete translation ($\Theta T_{1/2}$) symmetry is classified by a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-valued topological invariant and characterized by quantized magnetoelectric response. Here we demonstrate by explicit calculation in model $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ topological insulator thin-films that whereas the magnetoelectric response is localized at the surface in the $\Theta$ symmetry (non-magnetic) case, it is non-universally partitioned between surface and interior contributions in the $\Theta T_{1/2}$ (anti-ferromagnetic) case, while remaining quantized. Within our model the magnetic field induced polarization arises entirely from an anomalous ${\cal N}=0$ Landau level subspace within which the projected Hamiltonian is a generalized Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model whose topological properties are consistent with those of the starting 3D model. We identify a novel connection between the ground state geometry of that 3D model and surface-interior-partitioning in thin films.</description>

      <title>Probing Site-Resolved Current in Strongly Interacting Superconducting Circuit Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport measurements are fundamental for understanding condensed matter phenomena, from superconductivity to the fractional quantum Hall effect. Analogously, they can be powerful tools for probing synthetic quantum matter in quantum simulators. Here we demonstrate the measurement of in-situ particle current in a superconducting circuit lattice and apply it to study transport in both coherent and bath-coupled lattices. Our method utilizes controlled tunneling in a double-well potential to map current to on-site density, revealing site-resolved current and current statistics. We prepare a strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard lattice at different lattice fillings, and observe the change in current statistics as the many-body states transition from superfluid to Mott insulator. Furthermore, we explore non-equilibrium current dynamics by coupling the lattice to engineered driven-dissipative baths that serve as tunable particle source and drain. We observe steady-state current in discrete conduction channels and interaction-assisted transport. These results establish a versatile platform to investigate microscopic quantum transport in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Michael E. Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros have been used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. The success of Fisher zeros however seems limited, and it is unclear how they can be employed to shed light on quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the (analytically continued) one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude and the scaling of recurrence time at the quantum critical point. We further point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The analytical results are corroborated by numerical tensor renormalization group which elevates the approach outlined here to a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>
