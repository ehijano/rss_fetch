      <title>From {\tt Ferminet} to PINN. Connections between neural network-based algorithms for high-dimensional Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we establish some connections between standard (data-driven) neural network-based solvers for PDE and eigenvalue problems developed on one side in the applied mathematics and engineering communities (e.g. Deep-Ritz and Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN)), and on the other side in quantum chemistry (e.g. Variational Monte Carlo algorithms, {\tt Ferminet} or {\tt Paulinet}). In particular, we re-formulate a PINN algorithm as a {\it fitting} problem with data corresponding to the solution to a standard Diffusion Monte Carlo algorithm initialized thanks to a neural network-based Variational Monte Carlo (e.g. {\tt Ferminet}). Connections at the level of the optimization algorithms are also established.</description>

      <title>Simulation of 24,000 Electrons Dynamics: Real-Time Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) with the Real-Space Multigrids (RMG)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the theory, implementation, and benchmarking of a real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) module within the RMG code, designed to simulate the electronic response of molecular systems to external perturbations. Our method offers insights into non-equilibrium dynamics and excited states across a diverse range of systems, from small organic molecules to large metallic nanoparticles. Benchmarking results demonstrate excellent agreement with established TDDFT implementations and showcase the superior stability of our time-integration algorithm, enabling long-term simulations with minimal energy drift. The scalability and efficiency of RMG on massively parallel architectures allow for simulations of complex systems, such as plasmonic nanoparticles with thousands of atoms. Future extensions, including nuclear and spin dynamics, will broaden the applicability of this RT-TDDFT implementation, providing a powerful toolset for studies of photoactive materials, nanoscale devices, and other systems where real-time electronic dynamics is essential.</description>

      <title>Combined WENO schemes for increasing the accuracy of the numerical solution of conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a new method which allows utilizing all the available sub-stencils of a WENO scheme to increase the accuracy of the numerical solution of conservation laws while preserving the non-oscillatory property of the scheme. In this method, near a discontinuity, if there is a smooth sub-stencil with higher-order of accuracy, it is used in the reconstruction procedure. Furthermore, in smooth regions, all the sub-stencils of the same order of accuracy form the stencil with the highest order of accuracy as the conventional WENO scheme. The presented method is assessed using several test cases of the linear wave equation and one- and two-dimensional Euler's equations of gas dynamics. In addition to the original weights of WENO schemes, the WENO-Z approach is used. The results show that the new method increases the accuracy of the results while properly maintaining the ENO property.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed AI and ML-based sparse system identification algorithm for discovery of PDE's representing nonlinear dynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse system identification of nonlinear dynamic systems is still challenging, especially for stiff and high-order differential equations for noisy measurement data. The use of highly correlated functions makes distinguishing between true and false functions difficult, which limits the choice of functions. In this study, an equation discovery method has been proposed to tackle these problems. The key elements include a) use of B-splines for data fitting to get analytical derivatives superior to numerical derivatives, b) sequentially regularized derivatives for denoising (SRDD) algorithm, highly effective in removing noise from signal without system information loss, c) uncorrelated component analysis (UCA) algorithm that identifies and eliminates highly correlated functions while retaining the true functions, and d) physics-informed spline fitting (PISF) where the spline fitting is updated gradually while satisfying the governing equation with a dictionary of candidate functions to converge to the correct equation sequentially. The complete framework is built on a unified deep-learning architecture that eases the optimization process. The proposed method is demonstrated to discover various differential equations at various noise levels, including three-dimensional, fourth-order, and stiff equations. The parameter estimation converges accurately to the true values with a small coefficient of variation, suggesting robustness to the noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the open source code PHOEBUS (phifty one ergs blows up a star) for astrophysical general relativistic radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations. PHOEBUS is designed for, but not limited to, high energy astrophysical environments such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, black-hole accretion disks, and similar phenomena. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamics are modeled in the Valencia formulation with conservative finite volume methods. Neutrino radiation transport is included with Monte Carlo and moment methods. PHOEBUS is built on the PARTHENON (Grete et al. 2022) performance portable adaptive mesh refinement framework, uses a GPU first development strategy, and is capable of modeling a large dynamic range in space and time. PHOEBUS utilizes KOKKOS for on-node parallelism and supports both CPU and GPU architectures. We describe the physical model employed in PHOEBUS, the numerical methods used, and demonstrate</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic coil optimization for reduced Lorentz forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reduction of magnetic forces on electromagnetic coils is an important consideration in the design of high-field devices such as the stellarator or tokamak. Unfortunately, these forces may be too time-consuming to evaluate by conventional finite element modeling within an optimization loop. Although mutual forces can be computed rapidly by approximating large-bore coils as infinitely thin, this approximation does not hold for self-forces as it leads to an unphysical divergence. Recently, a novel reduced model for the self-field, self-force, and self-inductance of electromagnetic coils based on filamentary models was rigorously derived and demonstrated to be highly accurate and numerically efficient to evaluate. In this paper, we present an implementation of the reduced self-force model employing automatic differentiation within the SIMSOPT stellarator design software and use it in derivative-based coil optimization for a quasi-axisymmetric stellarator. We show that it is possible to significantly reduce point-wise forces throughout the coils, though this comes with trade-offs to fast particle losses and the minimum distance between coils and the plasma surface. The trade-off between magnetic forces and coil-surface distance is mediated by the minimum coil-coil distance for coils near the inboard side of the "bean" cross-section of the plasma. The relationship between forces and fast particle losses is mediated by the normal field error. Coil forces can be lowered to a threshold with minimal deterioration to losses. Importantly, the magnet optimization approach here can be used also for tokamaks, other fusion concepts, and applications outside of fusion.</description>

      <title>Microstructural Geometry Revealed by NMR Lineshape Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a technique for extracting microstructural geometry from NMR lineshape analysis in porous materials at angstrom-scale resolution with the use of weak magnetic field gradients. Diverging from the generally held view of FID signals undergoing simple exponential decay, we show that a detailed analysis of the line shape can unravel structural geometry on much smaller scales than previously thought. While the original q-space PFG NMR relies on strong magnetic field gradients in order to achieve high spatial resolution, our current approach reaches comparable or higher resolution using much weaker gradients. As a model system, we simulated gas diffusion for xenon confined within carbon nanotubes over a range of temperatures and nanotube diameters in order to unveil manifestations of confinement in the diffusion behavior. We report a multiscale scheme that couples the above MD simulations with the generalized Langevin equation to estimate the transport properties of interest for this problem, such as diffusivity coefficients and NMR lineshapes, using the Green-Kubo correlation function to correctly evaluate time-dependent diffusion. Our results highlight how NMR methodologies can be adapted as effective means towards structural investigation at very small scales when dealing with complicated geometries. This method is expected to find applications in materials science, catalysis, biomedicine and other areas.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck Central Moment Lattice Boltzmann Method for Effective Simulations of Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new formulation of the central moment lattice Boltzmann (LB) method based on a continuous Fokker-Planck (FP) kinetic model, originally proposed for stochastic diffusive-drift processes (e.g., Brownian dynamics), by adapting it as a collision model for the continuous Boltzmann equation (CBE) for fluid dynamics. The FP collision model has several desirable properties, including its ability to preserve the quadratic nonlinearity of the CBE, unlike that based on the common Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook model. Rather than using an equivalent Langevin equation as a proxy, we construct our approach by directly matching the changes in different discrete central moments independently supported by the lattice under collision to those given by the CBE under the FP-guided collision model. This can be interpreted as a new path for the collision process in terms of the relaxation of the various central moments to 'equilibria', which we term as the Markovian central moment attractors that depend on a diffusion coefficient tensor. The construction of the method using central moments rather than via distribution functions facilitates its numerical implementation and analysis. We show its consistency to the Navier-Stokes equations via a Chapman-Enskog analysis and elucidate the choice of the diffusion coefficient based on the second order moments in accurately representing flows at relatively low viscosities. We will demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our new central moment FP-LB formulation, termed as the FPC-LBM, using the D3Q27 lattice for simulations of a variety of flows, including wall-bounded turbulent flows. We show that the FPC-LBM is more stable than other existing LB schemes based on central moments, while avoiding numerical hyperviscosity effects in flow simulations at relatively very low physical fluid viscosities through a refinement to a model founded on kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Kinetically Trapped Nanocrystals with Symmetry-Preserving Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shape of nanocrystals is crucial in determining their surface area, reactivity, optical properties, mechanical strength, and self-assembly behavior. Traditionally, shape control has been achieved through empirical methods, highlighting the need for a more refined theoretical framework. A comprehensive model should account for the kinetic factors at distinct stages of the shape-formation process to identify the key determinants of nanocrystal morphology. By modulating kinetics at terraces, ledges, and kinks, we reveal that the primary factors are the adatom nucleation energies and the geometry of growth islands. Transient sites dominate the growth process, leading to kinetically trapped, metastable shapes. We illustrate these concepts with face-centered cubic nanocrystals, demonstrating diverse shape evolutions, including surface roughening and the preservation of crystal symmetry in cubes, octahedra, rhombic dodecahedra, and their truncated variants. This study reveals the mechanisms driving the formation of cubic nanocrystal shapes and offers guidance for their precise synthesis.</description>

      <title>A Higher-order Hybridisable Discontinuous Galerkin IMEX method for the incompressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The incompressible Euler equations are an important model system in computational fluid dynamics. Fast high-order methods for the solution of this time-dependent system of partial differential equations are of particular interest: due to their exponential convergence in the polynomial degree they can make efficient use of computational resources. To address this challenge we describe a novel timestepping method which combines a hybridised Discontinuous Galerkin method for the spatial discretisation with IMEX timestepping schemes, thus achieving high-order accuracy in both space and time. The computational bottleneck is the solution of a (block-) sparse linear system to compute updates to pressure and velocity at each stage of the IMEX integrator. Following Chorin's projection approach, this update of the velocity and pressure fields is split into two stages. As a result, the hybridised equation for the implicit pressure-velocity problem is reduced to the well-known system which arises in hybridised mixed formulations of the Poisson- or diffusion problem and for which efficient multigrid preconditioners have been developed. Splitting errors can be reduced systematically by embedding this update into a preconditioned Richardson iteration. The accuracy and efficiency of the new method is demonstrated numerically for two time-dependent testcases that have been previously studied in the literature.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Propagator for Partially Coherent Wave Fields in the Spatial Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of wave fields and their interactions with matter are important for established and emerging fields in optical sciences. Efficient methods for predicting such behaviour have been employed routinely for coherent sources. However, most real world optical systems exhibit partial coherence, for which the present mathematical description involves high dimensional complex functions and hence poses challenges for numerical implementations. This demands significant computational resources to determine the properties of partially coherent wavefields. Here, we describe the novel Phase-Space (PS) propagator, an efficient and self-consistent technique for free space propagation of wave fields which are partially coherent in the spatial domain. The PS propagator makes use of the fact that the propagation of a wave field in free space is equivalent to a shearing of the corresponding PSD function. Computationally, this approach is simpler and the need for using different propagation methods for near and far-field regions is removed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a numerical simulation of a quantum electron confined in a 10 nm potential well, using the Crank-Nicolson numerical technique to solve the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The results capture the evolution of the electron's wave function at the 2000th time step, illustrating distinct standing wave patterns and probability densities that align with quantum mechanical predictions. Additionally, both 2D and 3D simulations across multiple time steps reveal the dynamic nature of quantum superposition and interference within the well. These findings highlight the method's stability and accuracy, offering a valuable tool for exploring quantum phenomena in constrained quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems using Koopman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of causality in dynamical systems using Koopman operators. Our theory is grounded on a rigorous definition of causal mechanism in dynamical systems given in terms of flow maps. In the Koopman framework, we prove that causal mechanisms manifest as particular flows of observables between function subspaces. While the flow map definition is a clear generalization of the standard definition of causal mechanism given in the structural causal model framework, the flow maps are complicated objects that are not tractable to work with in practice. By contrast, the equivalent Koopman definition lends itself to a straightforward data-driven algorithm that can quantify multivariate causal relations in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems. The coupled Rossler system provides examples and demonstrations throughout our exposition. We also demonstrate the utility of our data-driven Koopman causality measure by identifying causal flow in the Lorenz 96 system. We show that the causal flow identified by our data-driven algorithm agrees with the information flow identified through a perturbation propagation experiment. Our work provides new theoretical insights into causality for nonlinear dynamical systems, as well as a new toolkit for data-driven causal analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce tensor involved peridynamics, a unified framework for simulating both isotropic and anisotropic materials. While traditional peridynamics models effectively simulate isotropic materials, they face challenges with anisotropic materials and are prone to instability caused by zero energy modes. Our novel model extend the linear bond based peridynamics framework by incorporating the elastic tensor into the micrmodulus function, thereby ensuring stability for anisotropic materials without the need for additional corrections. For isotropic materials. the model mantains compatibility with conventional bond based peridynamics, assuming Possion's rations of 1/4 in 3D and 1/3 in 2D.Numerical experiments confirm the model's stability and accuracy across various scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a damage model for isotropic materials. validating its performance in predicting crack propagation paths in a 2D plate. The results show superior alignment with experimental date compared to traditional model.</description>

      <title>Dual-Path Mechanism of Amino Acid Racemization Mediated by Quantum Mechanical Tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The racemization of amino acids constitutes one of the most elemental and critical reactions, holding primitive significance for understanding the life's origin and maintenance. Nevertheless, its mechanism at the atomic level has been persistently misunderstood for more than a century. In this work, we demonstrate that the racemization of amino acid molecules in aqueous environments can occur simultaneously by two pathways via the carboxyl (COOH) and amino (NH2) groups. Behind this result, the quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) effect plays a pivotal role, as evidenced by the tunneling hindrance of the NH2 reaction and the tunneling enhancement of the COOH reaction. Notably, the disparity in the QMT effect leads to a crossover between the COOH and NH2 reactions within 200-257 K, such that NH2 reactions dominate at high temperatures and COOH reactions dominate at low temperatures. Our work emphasizes the significance of QMT effect in the racemization of amino acids and therefore introduces a dual-path coexistence mechanism, offering valuable insights into the origin of homochirality in extreme environments of the early Earth.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Sparse Galaxy Simulations via Out-of-Distribution Detection and Amortized Bayesian Model Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations are a powerful tool to advance our understanding of galaxy formation and many simulations model key properties of real galaxies. A question that naturally arises for such simulations in light of high-quality observational data is: How close are the models to reality? Due to the high-dimensionality of the problem, many previous studies evaluate galaxy simulations using simplified summary statistics of physical properties. In this work, we combine simulation-based Bayesian model comparison with a novel misspecification detection technique to compare simulated galaxy images of 6 hydrodynamical models observations. Since cosmological simulations are computationally costly, we address the problem of low simulation budgets by first training a $k$-sparse variational autoencoder (VAE) on the abundant dataset of SDSS images. The VAE learns to extract informative latent embeddings and delineates the typical set of real images. To reveal simulation gaps, we then perform out-of-distribution detection (OOD) based on the logits of classifiers trained on the embeddings of simulated images. Finally, we perform amortized Bayesian model comparison using probabilistic classification, identifying the relatively best-performing model along with partial explanations through SHAP values.</description>

      <title>Discrete element method model of soot aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14254v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soot is a component of atmospheric aerosols that affects climate by scattering and absorbing the sunlight. Soot particles are fractal aggregates composed of elemental carbon. In the atmosphere, the aggregates acquire coatings by condensation and coagulation, resulting in significant compaction of the aggregates that changes the direct climate forcing of soot. Currently, no models exist to rigorously describe the process of soot restructuring, reducing prediction accuracy of atmospheric aerosol models. We develop a discrete element method contact model to simulate restructuring of fractal soot aggregates, represented as assemblies of spheres joined by cohesion and by sintered necks. The model is parametrized based on atomic force spectroscopy data and is used to simulate soot restructuring, showing that the fraction of necks in aggregates determines the restructuring pathway. Aggregates with fewer necks undergo local compaction, while aggregates with nearly-full necking prefer global compaction. Additionally, full compaction occurs within tens of nanoseconds, orders of magnitude faster than the time scale of soot aging through condensation. An important implication is that in atmospheric soot aggregates, the rate of condensation determines how many necks are fractured simultaneously, affecting the restructuring pathway, e.g., producing highly compact, thinly-coated soot as observed in recent studies.</description>

      <title>Rapid Geological CO2 Storage Forecast and Optimization: A Data-driven Dynamic Mode Decomposition Model Order Reduction Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data driven and non-intrusive DMDc and DMDspc models successfully expedite the reconstruction and forecasting of CO2 fluid flow with acceptable accuracy margins, aiding in the rapid optimization of geological CO2 storage forecast and optimization. DMDc and DMDspc models were trained with weekly, monthly, and yearly ECLIPSE 300 simulation pressure and CO2 saturation fields. The domain of interest is a large scale, offshore highly heterogeneous reservoir model with over 100000 cells. DMD snapshot reconstruction significantly reduced simulation times from several hours to mere minutes. DMDspc reduced the number of DMD modes for pressure without losing accuracy while sometimes even improving accuracy. Two operation cases were considered: 1. CO2 injection, 2. CO2 injection and water production for pressure maintenance. For pressure, DMDspc achieved a slightly higher than DMDc average error by removing several modes. On the other hand, DMDspc showed limited success in reducing modes for CO2 saturation. The forecast performance of DMD models was evaluated using percent change error, mean absolute error, and Pearson R correlation coefficient metrics. Almost all DMD pressure models managed to successfully forecast pressure fields while a smaller number of DMD models managed to forecast CO2 saturation. While forecast errors have a considerable range only DMD models with errors below 5% PCE for pressure or 0.01 MAE for saturation were considered acceptable for geological CO2 storage optimization. Optimized CO2 injection and water production amounts were consistent across selected DMD models and all time scales. The DMDspc monitored cells approach, which only reconstructs the monitored during optimization cells, reduced even further optimization time while providing consistent results with the optimization that used full snapshot reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Science in Quantum, Atomistic, and Continuum Systems</title>

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) are fueling a new paradigm of discoveries in natural sciences. Today, AI has started to advance natural sciences by improving, accelerating, and enabling our understanding of natural phenomena at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, giving rise to a new area of research known as AI for science (AI4Science). Being an emerging research paradigm, AI4Science is unique in that it is an enormous and highly interdisciplinary area. Thus, a unified and technical treatment of this field is needed yet challenging. This work aims to provide a technically thorough account of a subarea of AI4Science; namely, AI for quantum, atomistic, and continuum systems. These areas aim at understanding the physical world from the subatomic (wavefunctions and electron density), atomic (molecules, proteins, materials, and interactions), to macro (fluids, climate, and subsurface) scales and form an important subarea of AI4Science. A unique advantage of focusing on these areas is that they largely share a common set of challenges, thereby allowing a unified and foundational treatment. A key common challenge is how to capture physics first principles, especially symmetries, in natural systems by deep learning methods. We provide an in-depth yet intuitive account of techniques to achieve equivariance to symmetry transformations. We also discuss other common technical challenges, including explainability, out-of-distribution generalization, knowledge transfer with foundation and large language models, and uncertainty quantification. To facilitate learning and education, we provide categorized lists of resources that we found to be useful. We strive to be thorough and unified and hope this initial effort may trigger more community interests and efforts to further advance AI4Science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-scale neural network method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with small parameters using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We directly incorporate the small parameters into the architecture of neural networks. The proposed method enables solving PDEs with small parameters in a simple fashion, without adding Fourier features or other computationally taxing searches of truncation parameters. Various numerical examples demonstrate reasonable accuracy in capturing features of large derivatives in the solutions caused by small parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Green's function theory has emerged as a powerful many-body approach not only in condensed matter physics but also in quantum chemistry in recent years. We have developed a new all-electron implementation of the BSE@GW formalism using numeric atom-centered orbital basis sets (Liu et al., J. Chem. Phys. 152, 044105 (2020)). We present our recent developments in implementing this formalism for extended systems with periodic boundary conditions. We discuss its numerical implementation and various convergence tests pertaining to numerical atom-centered orbitals, auxiliary basis sets for the resolution-of-identity formalism, and Brillouin zone sampling. Proof-of-principle examples are presented to compare with other formalisms, illustrating the new all-electron BSE@GW method for extended systems.</description>

      <title>Extending GPU-Accelerated Gaussian Integrals in the TeraChem Software Package to f Type Orbitals: Implementation and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14920v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing availability of GPUs for scientific computing has prompted interest in accelerating quantum chemical calculations through their use. The complexity of integral kernels for high angular momentum basis functions however often limits the utility of GPU implementations with large basis sets or for metal containing systems. In this work, we report implementation of $f$ function support in the GPU-accelerated TeraChem software package through the development of efficient kernels for the evaluation of Hamiltonian integrals. The high efficiency of the resulting code is demonstrated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations on increasingly large organic molecules and transition metal complexes, as well as coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) calculations on water clusters. Preliminary investigations into Ni(I) catalysis with DFT and the photochemistry of MnH(CH$_3$) with complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) are also carried out. Overall, our GPU-accelerated software appears to be well-suited for fast simulation of large transition metal containing systems, as well as organic molecules.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Polaritonic Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polaritons, arising from the strong coupling between excitons and photons within microcavities, hold promise for optoelectronic and all-optical devices. They have found applications in various domains, including low-threshold lasers and quantum information processing. To realize complex functionalities, non-intuitive designs for polaritonic devices are required. In this contribution, we use finite-difference time-domain simulations of the dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation, written in a differentiable manner, and combine it with an adjoint formulation. Such a method allows us to use topology optimization to engineer the potential landscape experienced by polariton condensates to tailor its characteristics on demand. The potential directly translates to a blueprint for a functional device, and various fabrication and optical control techniques can experimentally realize it. We inverse-design a selection of polaritonic devices, i.e., a structure that spatially shapes the polaritons into a flat-top distribution, a metalens that focuses a polariton, and a nonlinearly activated isolator. The functionalities are preserved when employing realistic fabrication constraints such as minimum feature size and discretization of the potential. Our results demonstrate the utility of inverse design techniques for polaritonic devices, providing a stepping stone toward future research in optimizing systems with complex light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Nevanlinna Analytic Continuation for Migdal-Eliashberg Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a method to reconstruct real-frequency properties from analytically continued causal Green's functions within the framework of Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) theory for superconductivity. ME theory involves solving a set of coupled equations self-consistently in imaginary frequency space, but to obtain experimentally measurable properties like the spectral function and quasiparticle density of states, it is necessary to perform an analytic continuation to real frequency space. Traditionally, the ME Green's function is decomposed into three fundamental complex functions, which are analytically continued independently. However, these functions do not possess the causal properties of Green's functions, complicating or even preventing the application of standard methods such as Maximum Entropy. Our approach overcomes these challenges, enabling the use of various analytic continuation techniques that were previously impractical. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by combining it with Nevanlinna analytic continuation to achieve accurate real-frequency results for ME theory, which are directly comparable to experimental data, with applications highlighted for the superconductors MgB$_2$ and LaBeH$_8$.</description>

      <title>Effect of span size in Scale Resolving Simulations of airfoil stall and post-stall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In aerodynamic design, the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools has long relied on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Unsteady RANS (URANS) turbulence models. However, these methods face limitations in predicting massively separated flow regions. As a result, there is growing emphasis on scale-resolving methods such as Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which have become more feasible due to advancements in computational resources. This study focuses on the LES of airfoil flows, specifically analyzing the influence of the spanwise extent of the computational domain on aerodynamic forces. We examine the NREL S826 airfoil at a chord Reynolds number of $Re_c = 10^5$ under different angles of attack, with simulations performed using the PyFR solver. Our results highlight the importance of adequate spanwise resolution, particularly in post-stall flow conditions, where larger span sizes are necessary to accurately capture three-dimensional flow structures. The findings suggest that for certain flow regimes, traditional two-dimensional statistical representations may not be sufficient, necessitating further investigation into 3D flow phenomena.</description>
