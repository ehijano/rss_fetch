      <title>Exploration Is Not What It Seeks: Catalytic Exploration under Status Quo Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a distinct motive for search, termed catalytic exploration, where agents rationally explore alternatives they expect to reject to resolve uncertainty about the status quo. By decomposing option value into switching and catalytic components, we show that high exploration rates can coexist with bounded switching probabilities. This mechanism generates three insights. First, strong catalytic motives cause separating equilibria to collapse in signaling games as receivers explore indiscriminately. Second, agents optimally acquire more precise information about the status quo than about alternatives, reversing rational inattention intuitions. Third, catalytic exploration creates negative externalities: information technology improvements can paradoxically reduce welfare by encouraging excessive benchmarking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies choice situations in which a decision maker can choose multiple alternatives. Given a menu of available options, the decision maker selects a subset of the menu with certain probabilities. We employ an axiomatic approach to characterize various parametric models in the literature. Our results elucidate the implications of the functional form assumptions and shed light on the distinctions between models. The behavioral postulates offer simple tools for testing and falsifying the choice procedures used by the decision maker and reveal a close connection between models that are seemingly unrelated.</description>

      <title>Prior-Free Information Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a prior-free framework for information design based on partial identification and applies it to robust causal inference. The decision maker observes the distribution of signals generated by an information structure and ranks alternatives by their worst-case payoff over the state distributions consistent with those signals. We characterize the set of robustly implementable actions and show that each can be implemented by an information structure that withholds at most one dimension of information from the decision maker. In the potential outcomes model, every treatment is implementable via an experiment that is almost fully informative.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Persuasion without Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model of persuasion in which a sender without any commitment power privately gathers information about an unknown state of the world and then chooses what to verifiably disclose to a receiver. The receiver does not know how many experiments the sender is able to run, and may therefore be uncertain as to whether the sender disclosed all of her information. Despite this challenge, we show that, under general conditions, the sender is able to achieve the same payoff as in the full-commitment Bayesian persuasion case.</description>

      <title>"Don't Fall Behind": A Unified Framework of Dynastic Survival, Two-Stage Belief Error, and the Modern Involution Trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set out to solve a dual puzzle regarding reproductive strategies: The "Ancient vs. Modern" Puzzle (why pre-modern elites adopted a "Survival" strategy while modern elites adopt an "Anxiety" strategy) and the "Class Divide" Puzzle (why modern involution manifests as a U-shaped fertility pattern). We develop a unified computational framework (DP + Monte Carlo) that introduces Cognitive Heterogeneity across classes. Our Hybrid Model (M-H) posits that the poor act as "Rational Survivors" (M1 utility, Reality parameters), while the middle/rich act as "Biased Strivers" (M4b utility, Belief parameters).
  Our simulations yield three core findings. First, we confirm that the "Survival" strategy is objectively rational whenever risk exceeds a low threshold ($\sigma &gt; 0.45$). Given that real-world risk is massive ($\sigma_{Real} \approx 4.9$), the modern "Quality" strategy is objectively fragile. Second, the trap for the Middle/Rich ($B \ge 200$) is driven by a "Two-Stage Belief Error": they are first "baited" by a Causal Error (underestimating risk) to enter the status game, and then "trapped" by a Marginal Error (underestimating returns) which triggers a stop in fertility. Third, the U-shape is driven by the cognitive divide. The Poor escape the trap by retaining a "Rational Survival" strategy in the face of real high risk. Conversely, the Aspirational Middle Class ($HC \approx 12, B \ge 200$) is uniquely trapped by their Biased Beliefs. Their high competence raises their dynastic reference point ($R$) to a level where, under perceived low returns, restricting fertility to $N=1$ becomes the only rational choice within their biased belief system.</description>

      <title>Misinformation Dynamics in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information transmitted across modern communication platforms is degraded not only by intentional manipulation (disinformation) but also by intrinsic cognitive decay and topology-dependent social averaging (misinformation). We develop a continuous-fidelity field theory on multiplex networks with distinct layers representing private chats, group interactions, and broadcast channels. Our analytic solutions reveal three universal mechanisms controlling information quality: (i) groupthink blending, where dense group coupling drives fidelity to the initial group mean; (ii) bridge-node bottlenecks, where cross-community flow produces irreversible dilution; and (iii) a network-wide fidelity landscape set by a competition between broadcast truth-injection and structural degradation pathways. These results demonstrate that connectivity can reduce information integrity and establish quantitative control strategies to enhance fidelity in large-scale communication systems.</description>

      <title>Bipartiteness in Progressive Second-Price Multi-Auction Networks with Perfect Substitute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a bipartite network of buyers and sellers, where the sellers run locally independent Progressive Second-Price (PSP) auctions, and buyers may participate in multiple auctions, forming a multi-auction market with perfect substitute. The paper develops a projection-based influence framework for decentralized PSP auctions. We formalize primary and expanded influence sets using projections on the active bid index set and show how partial orders on bid prices govern allocation, market shifts, and the emergence of saturated one-hop shells. Our results highlight the robustness of PSP auctions in decentralized environments by introducing saturated components and a structured framework for phase transitions in multi-auction dynamics. This structure ensures deterministic coverage of the strategy space, enabling stable and truthful embedding in the larger game. We further model intra-round dynamics using an index to capture coordinated asynchronous seller updates coupled through buyers' joint constraints. Together, these constructions explain how local interactions propagate across auctions and gives premise for coherent equilibria--without requiring global information or centralized control.</description>

      <title>Reserve Matching with Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for reserve systems that allocate scarce resources such as vaccines to unit-demand agents under prioritization and eligibility constraints, along with a computationally efficient mechanism. Reserve systems allocate scarce resources --such as vaccines, medical units, school seats, or government positions-- to essential groups by creating categories with prioritized beneficiaries. Prior work typically assumed a common baseline priority ordering and featured either hard or soft reserves. The threshold reserve model we introduce supports independent priority orderings, mixtures of hard and soft reserves, and overlapping categories, thereby capturing both beneficiary designations and eligibility constraints while offering policymakers greater flexibility. Our Iterative Max-in-Max Assignment Mechanism (IMMAM) satisfies all desirable properties in this domain: it respects priorities within categories, maximizes resource utilization, and then lexicographically maximizes beneficiary assignments. IMMAM is path independent and therefore well-behaved in settings with multiple institutions making simultaneous allocation decisions. We leverage path independence to obtain comparative statics and to significantly improve the mechanism's computational efficiency. We outline applications of our framework in the context of vaccine allocation.</description>

      <title>Revealed Bayesian Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How does one test empirically the hypothesis that a decision maker (DM) is being influenced by information via Bayesian persuasion? In this paper, I consider a DM whose state-dependent preferences are known to an analyst, who sees the conditional distribution of choices given the state. I provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the dataset to be consistent with the DM being Bayesian persuaded by an unobserved sender who generates a distribution of signals to ex-ante optimize the sender's expected payoff. I thereby provide a tool for empirical work on information design.</description>

      <title>Self-Employment as a Signal: Career Concerns with Hidden Firm Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a dynamic labor market in which a risk-averse worker with career concerns chooses each period between self-employment, which generates publicly observed binary output, and employment at a firm, which pays a flat wage but keeps individual performance hidden from the outside market. The worker values future opportunities through a reputation for talent, understood as the public belief used by firms to set wages. Firms may be myopic, pricing only off public beliefs, or sophisticated, inferring from who is expected to apply. Three forces organize the results: an insurance - information trade-off, selection by talent, and inference from application decisions. A self-confirming absorbing hidden-employment region arises naturally when the value of insurance dominates the value of additional public signals, so some workers optimally stop generating public information. At any public belief there is a unique talent cutoff governing selection into self-employment, and sophisticated firms, by internalizing application-based inference, compress wages and induce different patterns of public information production than myopic firms. The framework yields testable predictions for the prevalence of self-employment, switching into opaque jobs, and wage dynamics across markets with different degrees of performance transparency.</description>
