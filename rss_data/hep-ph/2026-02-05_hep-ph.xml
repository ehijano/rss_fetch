      <title>Ultralight time-oscillating scalars from magnetized compact stars: electrophilic radiation and photon propagation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight scalars with electrophilic couplings to the time-dependent Goldreich-Julian charge density of magnetized compact stars can be radiated from their magnetospheres, contributing to pulsar spin-down. Coupling to the time-independent component of the charge density instead generates a quadrupolar scalar field profile, which may influence the orbital dynamics of binary systems. Such scalars can also interact with the time-varying electromagnetic fields of magnetized stars, modifying photon propagation and inducing observable effects in the redshift and residual time-delay measurements, as well as corrections to the background electromagnetic fields. We investigate these phenomena for the Crab pulsar, SGR 1806-20, and GRB 080805A. Using spectral and timing observations, we derive constraints on the scalar-electron and scalar-photon couplings. While the bounds obtained on the scalar-electron coupling from pulsar spin-down are weaker than existing limits, electromagnetic radiation measurements yield the strongest astrophysical constraints to date on the scalar-photon coupling. Compact stars with stronger surface magnetic fields and observations at lower photon frequencies can improve these bounds by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement and Bell Nonlocality at Future Lepton Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and Bell nonlocality--cornerstones of quantum mechanics--have traditionally been investigated only in low-energy experimental settings. Only recently, these fundamental phenomena have come to be explored in the high-energy domain of particle physics, where collider experiments offer a powerful new platform for studying the phenomenology of quantum correlations. We present here recent results on the detection of entanglement and Bell nonlocality in processes such as tau-lepton, $WW$, and $ZZ$ pair production, illustrating the potential of Future Lepton Colliders to probe the quantum properties of fundamental interactions.</description>

      <title>Emergent equilibrium-like yields from nonequilibrium cascade dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium cascades in which fragile bound or coherent structures are formed through intermediate states rather than by direct equilibration. Motivated by light-nuclei production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions and by Bose--Einstein condensation in cosmological settings, we analyze such processes within the Schwinger--Keldysh real-time formalism. We show that commonly used rate equations can be understood as a controlled Markovian approximation obtained by integrating out intermediate reservoirs in an underlying multi-component nonequilibrium dynamics. When the finite lifetime of these reservoirs is retained, non-Markovian memory effects naturally appear, leading to delayed and history-dependent formation dynamics. The associated memory time provides a quantitative criterion for the validity of reduced, rate-based descriptions far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Disentangling baryon stopping and neutron skin effects in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the net baryon (B) and net electric charge (Q) stopping in heavy-ion collisions using the statistical model. Focusing first on isobar collisions $\rm{Ru}+\rm{Ru}$ and $\rm{Zr}+\rm{Zr}$ at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$~GeV, we show that the excess baryon-stopping parameter $\gamma_B \equiv (N_B/N_Q)\,(Z/A)$ can be quantitatively extracted from forthcoming RHIC measurements of charge- and baryon-stopping ratios. We then generalize the approach to other collision systems at RHIC and LHC energies and introduce an oxygen-baseline observable, $r^{OX}$, whose central-to-peripheral ratio exhibits strong and systematic sensitivity to the neutron-skin thickness of the target nucleus $X$.</description>

Abstract: To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the J/{\psi}, the first charmonium state observed, I start with a brief review of major progresses on the QCD inspired quark potential model originated from charmonium spectrum.Then I show the importance of unquenching dynamics, multiquark components and exotic multiquark states for understanding hadron structure and hadron spectrscopy. The J/{\psi} and charmonium-like states have played an important role in this aspect.</description>

      <title>Charged lepton flavor violating decays $Z\to \ell_\alpha\ell_\beta$ in the inverse seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After confirmation of massiveness and mixing of neutrinos, by neutrino oscillation data, the origin of neutrino mass and the occurrence of charged-lepton-flavor non-conservation in nature have become two main objectives for the physics of elementary particles. Taking inspiration from both matters, we address the decays $Z\to\ell_\alpha\ell_\beta$, with $\ell_\alpha\ne\ell_\beta$, thus violating charged-lepton flavor. We calculate the set of contributing one-loop diagrams characterized by virtual neutral leptons, both light and heavy, emerged from the inverse seesaw mechanism for the generation of neutrino mass. By neglecting charged-lepton and light-neutrino masses, and then assuming that the mass spectrum of the heavy neutral leptons is degenerate, we find that a relation $\textrm{Br}\big( Z\to\ell_\alpha\ell_\beta \big)\propto\big| \eta_{\beta\alpha} \big|^2$, with $\eta$ the matrix describing non-unitarity effects in light-lepton mixing, is fulfilled. Our quantitative analysis, which considers both scenarios of degenerate and non-degenerate masses of heavy neutral leptons, takes into account upper bounds on $\eta_{\mu e}$, imposed by current constraints on the decay $\mu\to e\gamma$ from the MEG II experiment, while projected future sensitivity of this experiment is considered as well. We find that, even though current constraints on $Z\to\ell_\alpha\ell_\beta$, by the ATLAS Collaboration, remain far from inverse-seesaw contributions, improved sensitivity from in-plans machines, such as the Future Circular Collider and the Circular Electron Positron Collider, shall be able to probe this mass-generating mechanism through these decays.</description>

      <title>Studies of the Roper Resonance by the Ljubljana Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ever since its discovery in 1964 the nature of the N*(1440) nucleon resonance has been a perpetual and one of the outstanding puzzles in hadronic physics. The Ljubljana group joined the global effort in the late 1990s, first from the theoretical viewpoint and later experimentally. This paper is a short overview of our attempts to understand this elusive resonance.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the semileptonic decays $\Sigma_b\to\Sigma_cl\bar{\nu}_l$, $\Xi'_b\to\Xi'_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ and $\Omega_b\to\Omega_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ in QCD sum rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the electroweak transition form factors of $\Sigma_b\to\Sigma_c$, $\Xi'_b\to\Xi'_c$ and $\Omega_b\to\Omega_c$ are analyzed within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. In phenomenological side, all possible couplings of interpolating current to hadronic states are considered, and the Dirac structure dependence on the form factors is systematically eliminated. In QCD side, our calculation incorporates both the perturbative part and the contributions from vacuum condensates up to dimension 8. This systematic inclusion of higher-dimensional terms accounts for a broader set of Feynman diagrams, thereby enhancing the comprehensiveness and reliability of the operator product expansion. Using the obtained form factors, we study the partial widths of semileptonic decays $\Sigma_b\to\Sigma_cl\bar{\nu}_l$, $\Xi'_b\to\Xi'_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ and $\Omega_b\to\Omega_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ ($l=e$, $\mu$ and $\tau$). The results indicate that these decay widths approximately satisfy SU(3) flavor symmetry. Next, we calculate the branching ratios for the decay process $\Omega_b\to\Omega_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ and compare them with the results from other collaborations. Furthermore, the lepton universality ratios and some asymmetry parameters of these decay processes are also analyzed, which provide information for the study of new physics. We hope that these results will serve as a useful reference for future theoretical and experimental studies of weak decays involving heavy flavor baryons.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic decay form factors of $\Xi_b^0 \rightarrow \Xi_c^+\ell\bar{\nu}$ in HQET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decays, particularly the bottom-to-charm quark transitions are essential for testing the Standard Model (SM) and extracting the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements. These decays have been extensively studied using various theoretical approaches. In this work, we investigate the semileptonic decay $\Xi_b^0 \rightarrow \Xi_c^+\ell\bar{\nu}$ (where $\ell = e$, $\tau$) using a phenomenological quark model. We compute the ground-state masses of the initial and final baryons to get the wave function. Which is then used to calculate the form factors, including corrections up to order $1/m_Q$ within the framework of Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET). The obtained form factors are implemented in the helicity formalism to evaluate the differential decay rates, total decay width and branching ratio. We compare our results for the form factors at both the maximum and minimum recoil points with previous theoretical studies, finding good agreement. We observe that the form factors depend on the transferred momentum $q^2$ and their magnitude gradually increases with increasing $q^2$. The dominant form factors are $f_1$ and $g_1$ and they also exhibit similar $q^2$ dependencies. Additionally, we calculate the lepton flavour universality (LFU) ratio $R(\Xi_c) \approx 0.3$, which is in agreement with existing theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark production in deep-inelastic scattering -- Mellin moments of structure functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute Mellin moments of the heavy-quark structure functions in deep-inelastic scattering at next-to-leading order in quantum chromodynamics, retaining their full dependence on the heavy-quark mass. Using the optical theorem and the operator product expansion, we derive analytic results for fixed Mellin moments $N = 2$ to $22$ of the structure functions $F_2$ and $F_L$. Our results reproduce the known expressions in the relevant asymptotic limits, in particular for virtualities of the exchanged photon $Q^2$ much larger than the heavy-quark mass squared $m^2$, and are in agreement with existing parametrisations of the next-to-leading-order coefficient functions. The computational set-up developed in this work also provides a direct pathway toward extending these calculations to next-to-next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>The EP Model and its Completion Terms (E4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present the simple example of an Exotic Invariant with just two chiral electron supermultiplets E and P. In this example we include a mass term, and that means that there is a constraint on the Exotic Invariant. The constraint is easily solved for this simple case. Here we also exhibit a simple conjecture for the Completion Terms. This simple example is very useful, because the constraint that arises in the case of the Exotic Model, presented in E6, is just as easy to solve, and the Completion Terms there are also very similar to those here. So this simple EP model is very useful for understanding the Exotic Model, which is what results from adding an Exotic Invariant to the rather complicated Supersymmetric Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Searches for Extra Higgs Bosons using $t\bar{t}+$Higgs{{$(\to b\bar b)$}} Events within 2HDMs: Direct versus Indirect Probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of establishing the production of additional Higgs states in the process $gg,q\bar q\to t\bar t \Phi$, where $\Phi$ = $H_{2,3}$, with $H_2$ being CP-even and $H_3$ being CP-odd, at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), by solely exploiting the kinematic features of the reconstructed $t\bar t$ system. We adopt as reference theoretical framework a generic CP-Conserving 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), which also accommodate a Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs state $H_1$. We show that the masses $m_{H_{2,3}}$ exhibit clear correlations with the $t\bar{t}$ system properties and could, in principle, be extracted from these. Moreover, the CP properties of the $H_{2,3}$ states can be determined, even when both states are produced simultaneously. We then compare the results produced using this method with those obtained from a full kinematic reconstruction of the $H_{2,3}$ decays in the most studied $b\bar b$ channel (we take $m_{H_{2,3}}&lt; 2m_t$), thus proving the superiority of the approach here proposed. This paves the way to both the discovery and characterization of additional Higgs states produced {\sl inclusively} in association with top-antitop quark pairs, thereby dispensing of the complications intrinsic to the {\sl exclusive} reconstruction of such states from their decay products. We test this by establishing the sensitivity of our approach in the case of a Composite 2HDM (C2HDM), describing the Higges as pseudo-Nambu Goldstone Bosons (pNGBs) and naturally predicting Higgs mass spectra in the range of sensitivity of the described analysis.</description>

      <title>Fierz analyses on the decay properties of two- and three-gluon glueballs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fierz rearrangement, based on the various internal symmetries of hadrons, can be used to study their decay properties in a largely model-independent way. In this Letter we apply this method to calculate the relative branching ratios of two-gluon glueballs with $J^{PC} = 0^{++}/0^{-+}$ and three-gluon glueballs with $J^{PC} = 0^{++}/1^{+-}$. In total, we derive nearly one hundred ratios for these glueballs. Our results suggest that the $f_0(1710)$ and $\eta(2370)$ likely contain a significant gluon component, whereas the gluon component in $f_0(1500)$ appears to be small. Furthermore, we propose observing the three-gluon glueball with $J^{PC} = 0^{++}$ in the $\pi\pi\omega$ and $K\bar{K}\phi$ channels, and the three-gluon glueball with $J^{PC} = 1^{+-}$ in the $\pi\pi\omega$, $\pi\pi\phi$, and $K\bar{K}\phi$ channels. This study enhances our understanding of the gluonic structure of exotic hadrons and will assist future experimental searches in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-Induced Friction in Bubble-Wall Dynamics of Cosmological First-Order Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study bubble-wall dynamics in cosmological first-order phase transitions in a two-scalar-field model, where the wall is formed by $\phi$ and an additional real scalar $s$ couples through a portal interaction. We evolve the coupled classical field equations on the lattice and demonstrate that for an initial Bose--Einstein distribution of $s$ fluctuations at the nucleation temperature $T_n$, the resulting patchy background intermittently modulates the local driving pressure on the wall. The wall therefore undergoes alternating episodes of acceleration and deceleration and approaches a quasi-stationary propagation regime with a smaller time-averaged speed than in the decoupled limit. We further identify three familiar propagation profiles -- deflagration, detonation, and hybrid -- distinguished by where the dynamical $s$-sector energy density is concentrated relative to the wall. These effects can impact gravitational wave and baryogenesis predictions.</description>

      <title>Estimating power corrections for the Drell-Yan Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study power corrections in the Drell-Yan (DY) process using state-of-the-art predictions for both neutral and charged current production. For both types of DY processes, we account for power corrections arising from bottom and charm quark effects within a variable flavor number scheme. Our results show that these corrections become significant in the low-$Q$ region. We also ensure proper treatment of overlapping contributions by carefully applying matching procedures to eliminate any double counting.</description>

      <title>Relativistic and Recoil Corrections to Light-Fermion Vacuum Polarization for Bound Systems of Spin-0, Spin-1/2, and Spin-1 Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In bound systems whose constituent particles are heavier than the electron, the dominant radiative correction to energy levels is given by light-fermion (electronic) vacuum polarization. In consequence, relativistic and recoil corrections to the one-loop vacuum-polarization correction are phenomenologically relevant. Here, we generalize the treatment, previously accomplished for systems with orbiting muons, to bound systems of constituents with more general spins: spin-0, spin-1/2, and spin-1. We discuss the application of our more general expressions to various systems of interest, including spinless systems (pionium), muonic hydrogen and deuterium, and devote special attention to the excited non-S states of deuteronium, the bound system of a deuteron and its antiparticle. The obtained energy corrections are of order alpha^5*m_r, where alpha is the fine-structure constant and m_r is the reduced mass.</description>

      <title>Near-Resonant Thermal Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study leptogenesis in the quasi-degenerate but non-resonant regime. Expanding the CP asymmetry parameter near degeneracy and imposing the conservative non-resonance condition that the mass splitting must be much greater than the right-handed neutrino decay rates $\Delta M &gt; 100\Gamma_i$, yields the universal upper bound $\epsilon \leq 1/200$, independent of both the effective neutrino masses and the right-handed neutrino mass. We investigate vanilla and flavoured near-resonant leptogenesis and find that successful leptogenesis by right-handed neutrino decays can occur for $M \gtrsim 100~\mathrm{GeV}$ independent of washout regime, extending the viable parameter space of thermal leptogenesis down to the electroweak scale without invoking resonance. We also analyse near-resonant thermal leptogenesis during reheating and show that successful baryon asymmetry generation is compatible with reheating temperatures as low as $T_{RH}\simeq 10\rm GeV$ without relying on non-thermal production. Finally, we present a consistent framework for incorporating flavour effects in near-resonant leptogenesis during reheating. Overall, near-resonant thermal leptogenesis offers a controlled alternative regime to resonant leptogenesis, lowering the leptogenesis scale to the electroweak scale, without reliance on a disputed regulator used in resonant leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Exploring supernova neutrino mass ordering at DUNE via quantum entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) offers strong sensitivity to neutrinos from a Galactic core collapse supernova, providing a powerful probe of neutrino flavor conversion and the neutrino mass ordering. In this work, we study supernova neutrino oscillations at DUNE using quantum entanglement as an organizing framework. Treating the three flavor neutrino system as an effective multipartite quantum state, we quantify flavor correlations through the entanglement of formation, concurrence, and negativity, expressed directly in terms of flavor survival and transition probabilities. Benchmark scenarios defined by representative variations of the electron neutrino survival probability are constructed for each entanglement measure. Event rates and fluences are computed for a supernova at 10 kpc, and the mass ordering sensitivity is evaluated using detector-level simulations performed with the \texttt{SNOwGLoBES} framework, employing the Garching supernova flux model and including the dominant detection channels in liquid argon: $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ charged-current interactions on argon and elastic scattering on electrons. We analyze both individual and combined detection channels and incorporate $5\%$ normalization and energy calibration systematic uncertainties. Our results show that DUNE achieves a $5\sigma$ determination of the neutrino mass ordering for a supernova at distances of $\sim 20$~kpc for the $\nu_e$ charged current channel and $\sim 2$~kpc for the $\bar{\nu}_e$ channel, with the reach depending on the entanglement scenario considered. These results demonstrate that entanglement based observables provide a complementary and robust framework for probing supernova neutrino oscillations and the neutrino mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes as cosmic accelerators of light dark matter: Novel direct detection constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current multiton dark matter (DM) detectors are largely incapable of detecting light dark matter from the Galactic halo due to the energy threshold limitations of their recoil measurements. However, primordial black holes (PBHs) can evaporate via Hawking radiation to particles whose energies are set by the black hole temperature. Consequently, weakly interacting light dark matter (or dark radiation) particles produced in this manner can reach the Earth with sufficient flux and kinetic energy above the experimental thresholds. This opens up a novel avenue to probe the light dark sector in terrestrial experiments. In this work, we explore this possibility by considering fermionic DM produced through PBH evaporation and investigate its electron recoil signatures in direct detection experiments. We analyze both energy independent (constant) and energy dependent (scalar and vector mediated) DM-electron interactions, highlighting the strong dependence of the recoil spectra on the underlying Lorentz structure of the interaction. In addition, we also account for the attenuation effects due to loss of kinetic energy while DM traverses through Earth's crust, which can significantly modify the incoming DM flux. Incorporating these effects carefully, we place constraints on light DM using the electron recoil data from XENONnT, LZ, and PandaX-4T. Finally, we also discuss the detection prospects of such dark matter in current and future generation neutrino detectors, such as Super Kamiokande and Hyper Kamiokande.</description>

      <title>Where Does Tracing of Cosmic Ray in Real Atmosphere Terminate?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In backtracing simulations, which are widely employed to determine cosmic-ray particle trajectories in the geomagnetic field, the atmosphere is typically approximated as an artificial sharp boundary at some low altitude where the traced trajectory terminates. In this paper, we extend beyond this simplified assumption and investigate two realistic physical processes that terminate cosmic-ray particle propagation in the atmosphere: Bethe-Bloch energy loss mechanisms and hard scattering interactions with atmospheric atoms using total cross sections based on the Glauber-Gribov formalism. The former mechanism dominates at low rigidities (for protons below $\sim0.57$~GV), while the latter becomes dominant at higher rigidities. Consequently, we introduce two dimensionless variables up to detailed numerical criteria: the relative rigidity shift due to Bethe-Bloch effects ($\Delta\mathfrak{R}/\mathfrak{R}$), and the expected number of hard scattering events ($\langle N\rangle$). Using the corrected US Standard Atmosphere 1976 model, we demonstrate that the altitude dependence can be factorized as approximately $\exp(-0.14h/\textrm{km})$. Additionally, the effect of the local curvature radius of the trajectory near perigee can be similarly factorized. Our calculations indicate that the simplified sharp-boundary altitude should be at least $50$ km with $\Delta\mathfrak{R}/\mathfrak{R}+\langle N\rangle\lesssim1$ for protons, increasing by more than $15$ km for heavy nuclei such as iron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Maxwell electrodynamics with a Chern--Simons coupling to a dark sector top form sourced by domain walls. Electromagnetic fields which cross such domain walls exhibit optical activity. We outline the parameter space where the theory satisfies the observational bounds from domain wall nucleation rates and cosmic microwave background anisotropies. In this regime, the discretely evanescent dark energy walls can produce a polarization rotation of cosmic microwave background by $\Delta\vartheta \sim 10^{-3} ~{\rm radians}$.</description>

      <title>On the importance of radiation-era initial conditions for tensor perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conservation of super-horizon tensor fluctuations is crucial for connecting inflation to observations. Starting from first principles, recent works have found violations of this conservation if free-streaming radiation is produced during reheating. We show that the non-conservation is sensitive to the radiation initial state, and argue that the physical state should be affected by tensor perturbations that are already present during reheating. The deviation from super-horizon conservation is then negligible, recovering the standard result from kinetic theory. In contrast, a globally homogeneous and isotropic plasma state leads to a large suppression of tensor amplitudes. This difference between the local (physical) and global thermal equilibrium settles the discrepancy between the older and recent literature.</description>

      <title>A simple mechanism for the enhancement of the inflationary power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The background evolution in two-field inflation can feature two distinct stages, corresponding to the evolution along two successive field directions. When the second stage occurs at a significantly lower energy scale, the inflationary trajectory includes a sharp transition, accompanied by a series of rapid turns in field space. Fluctuations crossing the Hubble horizon during this turning phase can experience amplification by several orders of magnitude. This mechanism is very intuitive and can be implemented even in simple two-field models. It produces a peak in the scalar power spectrum that can lead to significant abundances of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Mapping Nuclear Deformation with Differential Radial Flow in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the radial flow of the fireball, usually characterized by transverse momentum spectra of final-state particles, encodes essential information about the hot and dense nuclear matter created in the collisions. However, the response of radial flow, including its $p_T$-differential structure $v_0(p_T)$ and longitudinal fluctuations $v_0(\eta)$, to intrinsic nuclear deformation remains unexplored. Using realistic $(3+1)$-dimensional viscous hydrodynamic calculations with Trento-3D initial conditions, we investigate how nuclear deformation affects the differential radial flow. We observe a clear, positive correlation between quadrupole deformation $\beta_2$ and radial flow: both magnitudes of $v_0$ and $v_0(p_T)$ are enhanced in central collisions when $\beta_2$ is increased. In contrast, the Pearson coefficient $\rho(n(p_T), [p_T])$ exhibits a universal step-like behavior across all collision systems and centralities. Further analysis of longitudinal decorrelation of radial flow reveals a rich structure: in central collisions, large $\beta_2$ tends to suppress the decorrelation, whereas hexadecapole deformation $\beta_4$ tends to enhance it. Such decorrelation effect increases toward peripheral collisions. Our results demonstrate that precise measurements of radial flow, spanning transverse momentum and longitudinal dependences, can provide powerful, complementary constraints on nuclear deformation in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions.</description>

      <title>Parametric Resonance and Backreaction Effects in Magnetogenesis from Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We take a more detailed look at the recently proposed magnetogenesis mechanism triggered by ultralight dark matter coupled to electromagnetism. The proposed mechanism made use of a tachyonic resonance channel which leads to the exponential amplification of infrared modes. Here, we first investigate a possible narrow band parametric resonance channel which can produce photons at higher frequencies. Secondly, we estimate the effects of back-reaction on terminating the resonance. We find that there is indeed a narrow resonance channel. It is characterized by a Floquet exponent which is slightly smaller than the corresponding exponent for the tachyonic resonance. However, there is a region of parameter space (corresponding to a very small coupling constant) for which the tachyonic resonance is ineffective. In this case, the narrow resonance will dominate, and it will still be sufficiently strong to generate the observed magnetic fields on cosmological scales. Our analytical treatment of the back-reaction effects considered here indicates that a fraction of order one of the initial dark matter density can flow into the gauge fields. Hence, our magnetogenesis scenario appears to be robust to back-reaction effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.04371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feynman integrals whose associated geometries extend beyond the Riemann sphere, such as elliptic curves and Calabi-Yau varieties, are increasingly relevant in modern precision calculations. They arise not only in collider cross-section calculations, but also in the post-Minkowskian expansion of gravitational-wave scattering. A powerful approach to compute integrals of this type is via differential equations, particularly when cast in a canonical form, which simplifies their $\varepsilon$-expansion and makes analytic properties manifest. In these proceedings, we will present a method to systematically construct canonical differential equations even for integrals that evaluate beyond multiple polylogarithms. The discussion is kept as light as possible, focusing on the two-loop sunrise integral, deferring the technical details to the original publications.</description>

Abstract: Aim of this paper is to retrace the path that led the young Enrico Fermi to write his paper on the statistics of an ideal monatomic gas. This discovery originated in his interest, which he had shown since his formative years, in the absolute entropy constant and in the problems he highlighted in Sommerfeld's quantization in the case of identical particle systems. The fundamental step taken by Fermi in writing his work on statistics was to apply the Exclusion Principle, formulated for electrons in an atom and which could therefore have been a pure effect due to dynamics, to a system of non-interacting particles.</description>

Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) provides a well-defined framework for studying nuclear recoil observables in low-energy neutrino interactions. In this work, we present a comparative Monte Carlo benchmark study of CEvNS-induced nuclear recoils for four target nuclei (B, Mg, Ti, and Zr) using the Geant4 simulation toolkit and the ROOT analysis framework. The study focuses on relative differences in recoil-energy spectra, nuclear form-factor effects, and angular distributions under identical simulation conditions. A deliberately simplified detector geometry is employed to ensure a controlled and transparent comparison between target materials, rather than to model a specific experimental setup. The results highlight how nuclear mass and form-factor suppression influence CEvNS recoil observables and provide a reference-level comparison that may be useful for material-selection studies in CEvNS-related simulations.</description>

Abstract: We consider the differential cross-section for single-inclusive jet production with transverse momentum $P_\perp$ in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) at small Bjorken $x_{\rm Bj}$, mediated by a virtual photon with virtuality $Q^2$. Unlike most studies at small $x$, which focus on particle production in the current fragmentation region, we investigate the kinematic regime where the jet is produced in the target fragmentation hemisphere of the Breit frame, and with $P_\perp \ll Q$. For a longitudinally polarised photon, we demonstrate that this cross-section is not power suppressed in $P_\perp/Q$ and we derive a factorised expression in terms of extended quark and gluon jet fracture functions. Our formula, valid at next-to-leading order in $\alpha_s$ at small $x$, is akin to the Altarelli-Martinelli identity for the longitudinal DIS structure function. Numerical estimates show that the extended quark jet fracture function is the most sensitive to saturation effects in large nuclei.</description>

      <title>Impact of coherent scattering on relic neutrinos boosted by cosmic rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) scattering off the cosmic relic neutrino background have recently gained renewed interest in the literature. Current data suggest that (UHECR) are predominantly made of heavy nuclei. Similar to the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) observed at low-energy neutrino experiments, the cross section of heavy nucleus scattering off relic neutrinos will be coherently enhanced since the energy of relic neutrinos can reach $\sim O(10)$ MeV in the rest frame of the UHECR. We calculate the diffuse flux of relic neutrinos boosted by UHECR after taking into account the contributions from both coherent and incoherent scatterings. Using current data from IceCube and Pierre Auger Observatory, we place constraints on the overdensity of relic neutrinos down to $\sim 10^8$. Since the flux of boosted relic neutrinos peaks at an energy of $\sim 200\, \text{PeV}$, we also entertain the possibility to explain the recently observed KM3NeT event with boosted relic neutrinos from UHECR.</description>

In line with our previous publications, we obtain the results in the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme for $\gamma_5$, corrected for evanescent as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking effects through finite renormalizations. We compute the renormalization of the dimension-six four-fermion and three-gluon operators, as well as the power corrections to lower-dimension operators in the presence of masses, i.e., the down-mixing into dimension-five dipole operators, masses, gauge couplings, and theta terms. Our results are of interest for a broad range of low-energy precision searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive analysis of Drell-Yan production uncertainties and mass effects at moderate and low dilepton masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a thorough investigation of the sources of uncertainties to the Drell-Yan production using state-of-the-art predictions for both neutral and charged current channels, focusing on the low invariant mass region. Differential predictions for the invariant mass spectrum are provided at N$^3$LO supplemented with exact charm and bottom quark mass effects calculated at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$. The impact of PDF choices (including approximate N$^3$LO), scale variations, the variation of the strong coupling constant, and impact heavy quark mass effects on the distributions is studied in detail. We also comment on the correlation of high-energy astrophysical processes with the low-mass DY region.</description>

      <title>Searching the possibility of $a_0(1450)$ scalar state being a diquark structure via charmed meson semileptonic decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The internal structure of light scalar state $a_0(1450)$ has not been definitively determined, it may consist of multiple possible states. Among them, it has the possibility of being regarded as a diquark state. Based on this possibility, we use QCD light-cone sum rules to study the semileptonic decay process $D \to a_0(1450)\ell \nu_\ell $ with $\ell=(e, \mu)$ to verify its rationality. Firstly, we construct two types of twist-2 light-cone distribution amplitude schemes based on the light-cone harmonic oscillator model, and present their moments $\langle\xi^{n}\rangle |_{\mu}$ and Gegenbauer moments $a_{n}(\mu)$ at $\mu_0=1~{\rm GeV}$ and $\mu_k= 1.4~{\rm GeV}$ for $n=(1,3,5)$. In the large recoil region, we obtain the transition form factors (TFFs): $f_+^{\rm (S1)}(0) = 0.836_{-0.116}^{+0.119}$, $f_+^{\rm (S2)}(0)=0.767_{-0.105}^{+0.106}$ and $f_-(0)=0.630_{-0.077}^{+0.078}$. A simplified series expansion $z(q^2, t)$ is used to extrapolate TFFs to the entire physical $q^2$-region. For $q^2=10^{-5} ~{\rm GeV}^2$, we compute angular distribution of the differential decay width ${d\Gamma}/{d\cos\theta_\ell }$ over the range $\cos\theta_\ell \in [-1,1]$. Subsequently, we obtain differential decay widths and branching fractions for $D^0 \to a_0(1450)^- \ell^+ \nu_\ell $ and $D^- \to a_0(1450)^0 \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell $, where the branching fractions being of order $10^{-6}$. Finally, we analyze three angular observables for the semileptonic decay process $D^- \to a_0(1450)^0 \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell $, the forward-backward asymmetry ${\cal A}_{\rm FB}$, lepton polarization asymmetry ${\cal A}_{\lambda_\ell}$ and $q^2$-differential flat term~${\cal F}_{\rm H}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the spin density matrix of a heavy quark-antiquark pair ($b\bar{b}$, $c\bar{c}$ or $s\bar{s}$) diffractively produced in Deep Inelastic Scattering and Ultraperipheral Collisions. We show that the Pomeron exchange leaves characteristic imprints on the entanglement pattern between the quark and the antiquark. For the longitudinally polarized virtual photon, the pair always exhibits maximal entanglement and maximal violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. For the transversely polarized photon, the pair is always entangled and Bell-violating, reaching maximal entanglement and maximal violation simultaneously when the transverse momentum approximately equals the quark mass.</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD Prediction of the Hyperon EDM from CP-violating Dipole Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric dipole moment (EDM) of baryons provides a sensitive probe of CP-violating interactions beyond the Standard Model. Motivated by the recent BESIII measurement on the $\Lambda$-hyperon EDM [1], we present the first perturbative QCD analysis of the $\Lambda$ EDM form factor to elucidate its origin in CP-violating quark dipole interactions. In particular, we derive a QCD factorization formula that relates the $\Lambda$ EDM form factor to quark EDMs and chromo-electric dipole moments (CEDMs) through convolutions with the light-cone distribution amplitudes of $\Lambda$. These connections allow us to extract constraints on CP-violating dipole couplings from current and future hyperon EDM measurements. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that the $\Lambda$ EDM exhibits unique sensitivity to the strange-quark CEDM, providing complementary information to that obtained from the neutron EDM.</description>

      <title>Invisible neutron decay and light BSM particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), invisible neutron decay arises from d = 12 operators. Adding new light particles to the field content of the SM, such as right-handed neutrinos, allows one to construct operators for invisible neutron decay at much lower dimensions. Observing invisible neutron decay, if nucleon decays with charged leptons remain absent, would therefore point towards the existence of new neutral degrees of freedom. Here we discuss four cases: (i) adding right-handed neutrinos to the SM; (ii) a right-handed neutrino and an axion-like particle; (iii) a right-handed neutrino and a nearly massless singlet scalar; and (iv) a right-handed neutrino and a light Z'. We give the general tree-level decomposition for the resulting d = 7-9 operators for invisible neutron decay and briefly discuss LHC searches related to the exotic states found in these UV completions.</description>

      <title>Identifying Charged Lepton-like Portal Matter at Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Kinetic Mixing (KM) portal scenario, the interaction of dark matter (DM) with the particles of the Standard Model (SM) is generated by diagrams connecting the familiar photon with its dark sector analog, the dark photon (DP), via loops of particles carrying both dark and SM quantum numbers, \ie, Portal Matter (PM). For the case of sub-GeV DM and DP, these PM states may lie in the $\sim 1-10$ TeV range and be potentially accessible at the HL-LHC as well as at other future lepton and hadron colliders. In perhaps the simplest scenario of this kind, PM consists of just a pair of electrically charged, iso- and color-singlet, vector-like (VL) fermions having opposite dark charges, with an $O(1)$ mass splitting, yielding a finite value for the strength of the KM, \ie, $\epsilon \sim a~ few \times10^{-4}$. The dark Higgs induced mixing of PM states with their SM analogs allows for their decay but can also lead to significant distortions in the expected production properties for the PM at future lepton colliders due to $t$-channel dark Higgs exchange, potentially confusing PM identification. We show that the large set of clean observables available at lepton colliders is more that sufficient to resolve any of these ambiguities. The possibility of the production of like-sign PM fields via $t/u$-channel exchange of the same dark Higgs is also briefly explored.</description>

      <title>Strong Decays of the Light Exotic $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$ Hybrid Mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model of hybrid meson structure based on the QCD Hamiltonian in Coulomb gauge and the use of a single constituent quasigluon is applied compute hadronic decays of mesons with exotic quantum numbers, $0^{+-}$ and $2^{+-}$. These correspond to hybrid mesons in which the gluon couples to a $q\bar{q}$ pair in an $P$-wave and can therefore be identified as orbital excitations of the exotic $1^{-+}$ state. Interestingly, we find $0^{+-}$ states to be narrow, contrary to what was found by previous calculations. This is primarily due to the suppression of the decay mode $0^{+-}\rightarrow 2^1S_0+1^1S_0$, which is unique to our model. The $2^{+-}$ states are found to be narrow, as expected.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quarkonium Spectrum and Decay Constants from a Neural-Network-Based Holographic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a data-driven inverse construction of the dilaton field in a bottom-up AdS/QCD description of heavy vector quarkonia. Instead of adopting an \emph{ad hoc} analytic ansatz, we use a multilayer perceptron to learn \(\Phi'(z)\) as a smooth function of the holographic coordinate, with \(\Phi(0)=0\) imposed to ensure ultraviolet consistency. The dilaton and its derivatives obtained by automatic differentiation generate the holographic potential \(U(z)\), and the associated Schr\"odinger-like equation is discretized and diagonalized to extract the low-lying eigenmodes. Masses and decay constants are then evaluated from the eigenvalues and the near-boundary behavior of the bulk-to-boundary modes. Training on PDG data for charmonium and bottomonium yields a non-quadratic dilaton profile that resolves the longstanding difficulty of simultaneously reproducing both the heavy-quarkonium spectrum and the monotonic suppression of leptonic decay constants with radial excitation. The combined fit achieves RMS deviations of \(1.26\%\) (charmonium) and \(3.32\%\) (bottomonium). This work establishes neural-network reconstruction as a flexible tool for holographic modeling and provides a basis for future extensions incorporating additional channels, lattice constraints, or finite-temperature backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Origin of the nucleon gravitational form factor $B_N(t)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent lattice QCD simulations and phenomenological models indicate that the nucleon's gravitational form factor $B_N(t)$ remains remarkably small at finite momentum transfer $t$. While $B_N(0) = 0$ is a known consequence of the equivalence principle, the physical origin of its suppression at finite $t$ has not been fully elucidated. In this work, we demonstrate that the smallness of $B_N(t)$ arises from a fundamental cancellation within the nucleon's wave functions. Using light-front holographic QCD, we show that $B_N(t)$ is governed by an antisymmetric factor in the longitudinal dynamics that leads to an exact vanishing in the symmetric limit and significant suppression for realistic nucleon structures. Our results suggest that the smallness of $B_N(t)$ is a signature of the nucleon's dominant S-wave character, providing a formal justification for its frequent omission in practical applications like near-threshold $J/\psi$ production.</description>

      <title>Strong CP and the QCD Axion: Lecture Notes via Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These lecture notes provide a self-contained, graduate-level introduction to the strong $CP$ problem and QCD axion physics from an effective field theory (EFT) viewpoint. We review the construction of the chiral EFT of QCD yielding a $\theta$-dependent potential, from which vacuum alignment, $\theta$ periodicity and branch structure follow. We further show how the framework leads to the Witten-Veneziano relation highlighting the role of the pure-glue topological susceptibility in organizing $\theta$-dependent hadronic observables. Using these tools, we show how to extract representative $CP$-odd mesonic and baryonic amplitudes, including the chiral estimate underlying the neutron EDM bound, and how to generalize the effective framework to confining SU(N) theories with fermions in arbitrary representations. We further show how to employ the Veneziano-Yankielowicz effective Lagrangian for N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory to extract salient information on the $\theta$-dependent physics of one-flavour QCD via orientifold planar equivalence. We also revisit a recent no strong $CP$ claim based on an ordering of limits in the sum over topological sectors and show, in the EFT language, that it amounts to introducing an extra non-propagating axion-like degree of freedom not required by QCD. We then present the standard dynamical resolution to the strong $CP$ problem, i.e. the Peccei-Quinn mechanism, the resulting axion potential and mass from chiral EFT and briefly review associated time-honored UV completions, and the axion quality problem from gravitational corrections.</description>

Abstract: In the present work, we study the possible production of the dark Higgs boson ($h_{D}$) candidates, which originated from a simplified-model scenario based on the Mono-Z$^{\prime}$ model, in association with a neutral gauge boson (Z$^{\prime}$). This study has been performed by studying events with dimuon plus missing transverse energy produced in the simulated electron-positron collisions at the foreseen Future Circular Collider in the Electron-Positron collision mode (FCC-ee), operating at 240 GeV center of mass energy and integrated luminosity of 10.8 ab$^{-1}$. In case no new physics has been discovered, we set upper limits at a 95\% confidence level on the mass of the dark Higgs.</description>

      <title>Inference on inner galaxy structure via gravitational waves from supermassive binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar-timing arrays indicates the presence of a population of supermassive black hole binaries. Although the observed spectrum generally matches predictions for orbital evolution driven by gravitational-wave emission in circular orbits, there is a preference for a spectral turnover at the lowest observed frequencies, which may point to substantial hardening during a transition from early environmental influences to later stages dominated by emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. Here we model how the gravitational-wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile before scouring by binary ejections while accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. By analysing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we find that a parsec-scale galactic-centre density of around $10^6 M_{\odot} \mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ is favoured across most of the parameter space, thus shedding light on the environmental effects that shape black hole evolution and the combined matter density near galaxy centres.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing early universe evolution with gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves from supercooled cosmological first-order phase transitions. If such a transition is followed by inefficient reheating, the evolution history of the universe is modified by a period of early matter domination. This leaves an imprint on the predicted gravitational-wave spectra. Using Fisher analysis we show the parameter space in reach of upcoming gravitational wave observatories where reheating can be probed due to its impact on the stochastic background produced by the transition. We use both the simplified geometric parametrisation and the thermodynamical one explicitly including the decay rate of the field undergoing the transition as a parameter determining the spectrum. We show the expansion history following the transition can be probed provided the transition is very strong which is naturally realised in classically scale invariant models generically predicting supercooling. Moreover, in such a scenario the decay rate of the scalar undergoing the phase transition, a parameter most likely inaccessible to accelerators, can be determined through the spectrum analysis.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Predicting pion dynamics from QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gauge Theory Bootstrap [arXiv:2309.12402, arXiv:2403.10772] computes the strongly coupled pion dynamics by considering the most general scattering matrix, form factors and spectral densities and matching them with perturbative QCD at high energy and with weakly coupled pions at low energy. In this work, we show that further constraints on the spectral densities significantly reduce the possible solutions to a small set of qualitatively similar ones. Quantitatively, the precise solution is controlled by the asymptotic value of the form factors and SVZ sum rules. We also introduce an iterative procedure that, starting from a generic feasible point, converges to a unique solution parameterized by the UV input. For the converged solution we compute masses and widths of resonances that appear, scattering lengths and effective ranges of partial waves, low energy coefficients in the effective action. Additionally, we use these results to discuss the thermodynamics of a pion gas including pair correlations of pions with same and opposite charge.</description>

      <title>QuGrav: Bringing gravitational waves to light with Qumodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using qumodes, quantum bosonic modes, for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves via the inverse Gertsenshtein effect, where a gravitational wave resonantly converts into a single photon in a magnetized cavity. For an occupation number $n$ of the photon field in a qumode, the conversion probability is enhanced by a factor of $n+1$ due to Bose-Einstein statistics. Unlocking this increased sensitivity entails the ability to continuously prepare the qumode and perform non-demolition measurement on the qumode-qubit system within the qumode coherence time. Our results indicate that, at microwave frequencies and with existing technology, the proposed setup can attain sensitivities within 1.7 orders of magnitude of the cosmological bound. With anticipated near-future improvements, it has the potential to surpass this limit and pave the way for the first exploration of high-frequency cosmological gravitational wave backgrounds. At optical frequencies, it can enhance the sensitivity of current detectors by one order of magnitude. That further enhances their potential in reaching the single-graviton level.</description>

      <title>Novel method to trace the dark matter density profile around supermassive black holes with AGN reverberation mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to determine the dark matter density profile in the vicinity of distant supermassive black holes (SMBH) using reverberation mapping (RM) measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The mapping of multiple emission lines allows the measurement of the enclosed mass within different radii from the central SMBH, which can be used to infer or constrain the dark matter density profile on sub-parsec scales. We apply a toy model based on this method to a sample of fourteen AGN to test its feasibility based on current measurements. We find that for five objects, the observed enclosed mass does grow with radii, hinting towards the presence of a dark matter component at the 1-2 $\sigma$ level. For these sources, we find global evidence for a universal dark matter profile with a preferred radial steepness of index $\gamma \sim 1.6$, consistent with the scenario expected for a dark matter spike mildly relaxed by stellar heating processes. The enclosed dark matter mass, however, is found to be significantly larger than expected. We show that the current RM based mass measurements suffer from large systematic uncertainties, that limit the effectiveness of our method. Our work emphasizes the importance of applying the recent developments in mass determination techniques to target multiple emission lines with future RM and interferometry campaigns. This provides the most direct way of constraining the dark matter density in the sub-parsec regions around extragalactic SMBHs, which is crucial to our understanding of the dynamics and nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Glauber predictions for oxygen and neon collisions at energies available at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Glauber model is a widely used framework for describing the initial conditions in high-energy nuclear collisions. TGlauberMC is a Monte Carlo implementation of this model that enables detailed, event-by-event calculations across various collision systems. In this work, I present an updated version of TGlauberMC (3.3), which incorporates recent theoretical developments and improved parameterizations, especially relevant for small collision systems. I focus on the oxygen-oxygen (OO), neon-neon (NeNe), and proton-oxygen (pO) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in July 2025, where precise modelling of nuclear geometry and fluctuations is essential. The updated version includes revised nuclear density profiles and an enhanced treatment of nucleon substructure. Geometrical cross sections for all relevant collision systems are calculated and initial-state observables are explored to provide predictions for particle production trends at $\sqrt{s_{\rm nn}}$=5.36 TeV. In particular, a prediction for the centrality dependence of mid-rapidity multiplicity in OO and NeNe collisions is obtained. The updated code is publicly available to support the heavy-ion community with a robust and flexible tool for studying strongly interacting matter in small and intermediate-sized nuclear systems.</description>

      <title>Hubble's Law in Heavy Ion Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of the "microscopic" Hubble parameter related to the expansion of matter born in heavy-ion collisions was obtained for nucleons and pions. The calculations were carried out within the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) transport model. Au+Au collisions with $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.8$ GeV at $b = 2.5,\ 5.0,\ 7.5$, and $10.0$ fm were considered. A new method for determining the "microscopic" Hubble parameter from simulated data was used. The ballistic motion was obtained for the longitudinal direction after the separation of the nuclei. In earlier times, the evolution of the "microscopic" Hubble parameter in this direction was more complicated. For transverse directions, an exponential low-time asymptotics of the Hubble parameter was observed. The obtained values of the "microscopic" Hubble parameter are about 40 orders of magnitude higher than the cosmological Hubble constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the field space geometry of scalar-fermion effective field theories as a vector bundle supermanifold. We further establish a Fermi normal coordinate system on the bundle that clarifies the geometric content in scattering amplitudes, particularly the imprints of field space non-analyticities. Specializing to the Standard Model Higgs sector, we examine the geometric consequences of custodial symmetry violation, including implications for the physical Higgs field as a distinguished scalar axis and deformations in the fermionic sector. Our results enable a systematic and realistic geometric interpretation of Higgs sector phenomenology.</description>

      <title>New determination of the neutrino hadronic production cross sections from GeV to beyond PeV energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flux of astrophysical neutrinos is now measured with unprecedented accuracy and over several decades of energy spectrum. Their origin traces back to hadronic collisions between protons and nuclei in the cosmic rays with hydrogen and helium in the target gas. To accurately interpret the data, a precise determination of the underlying cross sections is therefore mandatory. We present a new evaluation of the neutrino production cross section from $p+p$ collisions, building on our previous analysis of the production cross section for $\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$, and minor baryonic and mesonic channels. Cross sections for scatterings involving nuclei heavier than protons are also derived. The novelty of our approach is the analytical description of the Lorentz invariant cross section $\sigma_{\rm inv}$, and the fit of the model to the available accelerator data. We work with neutrino energies from $10$ GeV to $10^7$ GeV, and, correspondingly, to incident proton (nuclei) energies from $10$ GeV to $10^9$ GeV (GeV/n). We obtain the total differential cross section, $d\sigma(p+p\rightarrow \nu+X)/dE_{\nu}$ as a function of neutrino and proton energies, with an estimated uncertainty of 5% for neutrino energies below 100 GeV, increasing to 10% above TeV energies. Predictions are given for $\nu_e, \nu_\mu, \bar{\nu_e}$ and $\bar{\nu_\mu}$. A comparison with state-of-the-art cross sections, all relying on Monte Carlo generators, is also presented. To facilitate the use by the community, we provide numerical tables and a script for accessing our energy-differential cross sections.</description>

      <title>Towards spinning $U(1)$ gauged non-topological solitons in the model with Chern-Simons term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain localized field configurations with finite energy in a ($2+1$)-dimensional model with Maxwell and Chern-Simons gauge terms coupled to a massive complex scalar field. These non-topological solitons are characterized by the $U(1)$ frequency and a winding number. Thus, the solutions possess Noether charge and non-trivial angular momentum, which is not quantized in contrast to the topological case. We study the solitons and their integral characteristics numerically and demonstrate that they are kinematically stable. The obtained solutions allow for the thin-wall approximation in some region of frequencies. For each winding number, the Noether charge has a lower bound that coincides with an isolated point, where the non-relativistic conformal symmetry seems to be restored.</description>
