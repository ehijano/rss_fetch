      <title>Limits of sequences of operators associated with Walsh System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the current paper is to determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for the weights $\mathbf{q}=\{q_k\}$, ensuring that the sequence of operators $\left\{ T_{n}^{\left( \mathbf{q}\right) }f\right\} $ associated with Walsh system, is convergent almost everywhere for all integrable function $f$. The article also examines the convergence of a sequence of tensor product operators denoted as $\left\{ T_{n}^{( \mathbf{q})}\otimes T_{n}^{( \mathbf{p})}\right\}$ involving functions of two variables. We point out that recent research by G\'{a}t and Karagulyan (2016) demonstrated that this sequence of tensor product operators cannot converge almost everywhere for every integrable function. In this paper, the necessary and sufficient conditions for the weight are provided which ensure that the sequence of the mentioned operators converges in measure on $L_{1}$.</description>

      <title>Limits of sequence of Tensor Product Operators associated with the Walsh-Paley system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that to establish the almost everywhere convergence of a sequence of operators on $L_1$-space, it is sufficient to obtain a weak $(1,1)$-type inequality for the maximal operator corresponding to the sequence of operators. However, in practical applications, the establishment of the mentioned inequality for the maximal operators is very tricky and difficult job. In the present paper, the main aim is a novel outlook at above mentioned inequality for the tensor product of two weighted one-dimensional Walsh-Fourier series. Namely, our main idea is naturally to consider uniformly boundedness conditions for the sequences which imply the weak type estimation for the maximal operator of the tensor product. More precisely, we are going to establish weak type of inequality for the tensor product of two dimensional maximal operators while having the uniform boundedness of the corresponding one dimensional operators. Moreover, the convergence of the tensor product of operators is established at the two dimensional Walsh-Lebesgue points.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-stability $\&amp;$ Minimal Entropy Conditions for Scalar Conservation Laws with Concave-Convex Fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study stability properties of solutions to scalar conservation laws with a class of non-convex fluxes. Using the theory of $a$-contraction with shifts, we show $L^2$-stability for shocks among a class of large perturbations, and give estimates on the weight coefficient $a$ in regimes where the shock amplitude is both large and small. Then, we use these estimates as a building block to show a uniqueness theorem under minimal entropy conditions for weak solutions to the conservation law via a modified front tracking algorithm. The proof is inspired by an analogous program carried out in the $2 \times 2$ system setting by Chen, Golding, Krupa, $\&amp;$ Vasseur.</description>

      <title>Curve shortening flow with an ambient force field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the anisotropic curve shortening flow in the plane in the presence of an ambient force. We consider force fields in which all their derivatives are bounded in the $L^{\infty}$ sense. We prove that closed embedded curves that have a minimum of curvature sufficiently large shrink to round points. The method of proof follows along the same lines of Gage and Hamilton, in that we study a rescaling to prove curvature bounds. We additionally show that the influence of an ambient force field may make such a result untrue, by giving sufficient conditions on the ambient field that ensures eventual non-convexity of an initially convex curve evolving under the flow.</description>

      <title>Stability of steady states of the 3-D Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations with non-flat doping profile in exterior domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns an initial boundary value problem of compressible Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations with the non-flat doping profile in a 3-D exterior domain.The global existence of strong solutions near a steady state for compressible Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations with the general Navier-slip boundary conditions is established. For our setting, not only a steady state should be constructed in the exterior domain by the sub and super solution method, but also some new techniques should be adopted to obtain a priori estimates, especially some refined elliptic estimates and the estimates on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Stability of a Riemann Shock in a Physical Class: From Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier to Euler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of an irreversible singularity, such as a Riemann shock solution to the full Euler system, in the absence of any technical conditions for perturbations, remains a major open problem even within a mono-dimensional framework. A natural approach to justify the stability of such a singularity involves considering a class of vanishing physical dissipation limits (or viscosity limits) of physical viscous flows with evanescent viscosities. We prove the existence of vanishing physical dissipation limits, on which a Riemann shock of small jump strength is stable (up to a time-dependent shift) and unique. As a physical viscous model that generates vanishing dissipation limits, we adopt the Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, proposed by Brenner based on the bi-velocity theory. For this viscous system, we show the uniform stability of shock with respect to the strength of the viscosity. The uniformity is ensured by the contraction estimates of any large perturbations around the shock. Since we cannot impose any smallness on initial perturbations for the contraction estimates, the density could be arbitrarily small or large. Controlling such large perturbations is the most challenging part in our analysis. The contraction estimates ensure the existence of vanishing physical dissipation limits of solutions to the Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier system. In addition, the distance of those limits from the Riemann shock, up to shifts, is controlled by the magnitude of the initial perturbations. The distance is measured by the relative entropy with a weight depending on the shock. This is the first result for the stability of Riemann shock solution to the full Euler system in a class of vanishing physical dissipation limits.</description>

      <title>Multiple critical points in closed sets via minimax theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply our minimax theory ([4], [5], [6]) with the one developed by A. Moameni in [2] to formalize a general scheme giving the multiplicity of critical points. Here is a sample of application of the scheme to a critical elliptic problem: Let $\Omega\subset {\bf R}^n$ ($n\geq 3$) be a smooth bounded domain and let $1&lt;q&lt;2\leq p&lt;{{2n}\over {n-2}}$.Then, for every $r, \nu&gt;0$, there exists $\lambda^*&gt;0$ with the following property: for every $\lambda\in ]0,\lambda^*[$, $\mu\in ]-\lambda^*,\lambda^*[$, and for every convex dense set $S\subset H^{-1}(\Omega)$, there exists $\tilde\varphi\in S$, with $\|\tilde\varphi\|_{H^{-1}(\Omega)}&lt;r$, such that the problem $$\cases{-\Delta u=\lambda(|u|^{{{4}\over {n-2}}}u+\nu |u|^{q-2}u+\mu|u|^{p-2}u+\tilde\varphi) &amp; in $\Omega$\cr &amp; \cr u=0 &amp; on $\partial\Omega$\cr}$$ has at least two solutions whose norms in $H^1_0(\Omega)$ are less than or equal to $r$.</description>

      <title>Convergence of layer potentials and Riemann-Hilbert problem on extension domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of layer potential operators for the harmonic transmission problem over a sequence of converging two-sided extension domains. Consequently, the Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators, Calder{\'o}n projectors, and associated Neumann series converge in this setting. As a result, we generalize the notion of Cauchy integrals and, in a sense, of Hilbert transforms for a class of extension domains. Our approach relies on dyadic approximations of arbitrary open sets, considering convergence in terms of characteristic functions, Hausdorff distance, and compact sets.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear Calder\'on-Zygmund $ L^2$-theory for the Dirichlet problem involving $ -|Du|^{\gamma}\Delta^N_p u=f$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a nonlinear Calder\'on-Zygmund $L^2$-theory to the Dirichlet problem $$-|Du|^{\gamma}\Delta^N_p u=f\in L^2(\Omega)\quad {\rm in}\quad \Omega; \quad u=0 \ \mbox{on $\partial\Omega$} $$ for $n\ge2$, $ p&gt;1$ and a large range of $\gamma&gt;-1$, in particular, for all $p&gt;1$ and all $ \gamma&gt;-1$ when $n=2$. Here $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a bounded convex domain, or a bounded Lipschitz domain whose boundary has small weak second fundamental form in the sense of Cianchi-Maz'ya (2018).
  The proof relies on an extension of an Miranda-Talenti \&amp; Cianchi-Maz'ya type inequality, that is, for any $v\in C^\infty_0(\Omega)$ in any bounded smooth domain $\Omega$, $\|D[(|Dv|^2+\epsilon)^{\frac\gamma 2}Dv]\|_{L^2(\Omega)}$ is bounded via $\|(|Dv|^2+\epsilon)^{\frac\gamma 2} \Delta^N_{p,\epsilon}v \|_{L^2(\Omega)}$, where $\Delta^N_{p,\epsilon}v$ is the to $\varepsilon$-regularization of normalized $p$-Lapacian.
  Our results extend the well-known Calder\'on-Zygmund $L^2$-estimate for Poisson equation, a nonlinear global second order Sobolev estimate for inhomogeneous $p$-Laplace equation by Cianchi-Maz'ya (2018), and a local $W^{2,2}$-estimate for inhomogeneous normalized $p$-Laplace equation by Attouchi-Ruosteenoja (2018).</description>

      <title>Homogenization of Hamilton-Jacobi equations on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a homogenization result for a family of time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations, rescaled by a parameter $\varepsilon$ tending to zero, posed on a periodic network, with a suitable notion of periodicity that will be defined. As $\varepsilon$ becomes infinitesimal, we derive a limiting Hamilton-Jacobi equation in a Euclidean space, whose dimension is determined by the topological complexity of the network and is independent of the ambient space in which the network is embedded. Among the key contributions of our analysis, we extend to the setting of networks and graphs Mather's result on the asymptotic behavior of the average minimal action functional, as time tends to infinity. Additionally, we establish the well-posedness of the approximating problems, representing a nontrivial generalization of existing results for finite networks to a non-compact setting.</description>

      <title>Steady State Blended Gas Flow on Networks: Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an existence result for the steady state flow of gas mixtures on networks. The basis of the model are the physical principles of the isothermal Euler equation, coupling conditions for the flow and pressure, and the mixing of incoming flow at nodes. The state equation is based on a convex combination of the ideal gas equations of state for natural gas and hydrogen. We analyze mathematical properties of the model allowing us to prove the existence of solutions in particular for tree-shaped networks and networks with exactly one cycle. Numerical examples illustrate the results and explore the applicability of our approach to different network topologies.</description>

      <title>On the steady motion of a Navier-Stokes flow across a sieve with prescribed pressure drop in a finite pipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steady motion of a viscous incompressible fluid through a sieve (that is, a wall perforated with a large number of small holes), in a pipe of finite length, is modeled through the Navier-Stokes equations under mixed boundary conditions involving the Bernoulli pressure and the tangential velocity on the inlet and outlet of the tube, while the pressure drop is prescribed along the pipe. Applying the classical energy method in homogenization theory, we study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions to this system, without any restriction on the magnitude of the data, as the diameters of the perforations vanish. Regardless of the initial scaling and distribution of the holes, we show that the sieve asymptotically becomes a wall, meaning that the effective equations are two, independent, stationary Navier-Stokes systems with a no-slip boundary condition on the wall. In the absence of external forces we prove, furthermore, that the fluid motion becomes quiescent in the homogenization limit.</description>

      <title>On the critical behavior for the semilinear biharmonic heat equation with forcing term in an exterior domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the critical behavior of solutions to the semilinear biharmonic heat equation with forcing term $f(x),$ under six homogeneous boundary conditions. This paper is the first since the seminal work by Bandle, Levine, and Zhang [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 251 (2000) 624-648], to focus on the study of critical exponents in exterior problems for semilinear parabolic equations with a forcing term. By employing a method of test functions and comparison principle, we derive the critical exponents $p_{Crit}$ in the sense of Fujita. Moreover, we show that $p_{Crit}=\infty$ if $N=2,3,4$ and $p_{Crit}=\frac{N}{N-4}$ if $N \geq 5$. The impact of the forcing term on the critical behavior of the problem is also of interest, and thus a second critical exponent in the sense of Lee-Ni, depending on the forcing term is introduced. We also discuss the case $f\equiv 0$, and present the finite-time blow-up results and lifespan estimates of solutions for the subcritical and critical cases. The lifespan estimates of solutions are obtained by employing the method proposed by Ikeda and Sobajama in [Nonlinear Anal. 182 (2019) 57-74].</description>

      <title>Strong instability of standing waves for $L^2$-supercritical Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Poisson system with a doping profile. We are interested in the strong instability of standing waves associated with ground state solutions in the $L^2$-supercritical case. The presence of a doping profile causes several difficulties, especially in examining geometric shapes of fibering maps along an $L^2$-invariant scaling curve. Furthermore, the classical approach by Berestycki-Cazenave for the strong instability cannot be applied to our problem due to a remainder term caused by the doping profile. To overcome these difficulties, we establish a new energy inequality associated with the $L^2$-invariant scaling and adopt the strong instability result developed by Fukaya-Ohta(2018). When the doping profile is a characteristic function supported on a bounded smooth domain, some geometric quantities related to the domain, such as the mean curvature, are responsible for the strong instability of standing waves.</description>

      <title>On a diffuse interface model for diblock copolymers interacting with an electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a diffuse interface model describing a ternary system constituted by a conductive diblock copolymer and a homopolymer acting as solvent. The resulting dynamics is modeled by two Cahn--Hilliard--Oono equations for the copolymer blocks, accounting for long-range interactions; a classical Cahn--Hiliard equation for the homopolymer and the Maxwell equation for the electric displacement field. A multiphase singular potential is employed in order to ensure physical consistency. First, we show existence of global weak solutions in two and three dimensions. Uniqueness of weak solutions is established in the constant mobility case, and a conditional result is given in the general case. Instantaneous regularization and long-time behavior are also investigated, the latter in the case of affine-linear electric permittivity, showing in particular that solutions converge to a single stationary state.</description>

Abstract: We consider the 2D stochastic Navier--Stokes equations driven by noise that has the regularity of space-time white noise but doesn't exactly coincide with it. We show that, provided that the intensity of the noise is sufficiently weak at high frequencies, this systems admits uniform bounds in time, so that it has an invariant measure, for which we obtain stretched exponential tail bounds.</description>

      <title>Designing a Linearized Potential Function in Neural Network Optimization Using Csisz\'{a}r Type of Tsallis Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, learning for neural networks can be viewed as optimization in the space of probability measures. To obtain the exponential convergence to the optimizer, the regularizing term based on Shannon entropy plays an important role. Even though an entropy function heavily affects convergence results, there is almost no result on its generalization, because of the following two technical difficulties: one is the lack of sufficient condition for generalized logarithmic Sobolev inequality, and the other is the distributional dependence of the potential function within the gradient flow equation. In this paper, we establish a framework that utilizes a linearized potential function via Csisz\'{a}r type of Tsallis entropy, which is one of the generalized entropies. We also show that our new framework enable us to derive an exponential convergence result.</description>

      <title>Functional tilings and the Coven-Meyerowitz tiling conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coven and Meyerowitz formulated two conditions which have since been conjectured to characterize all finite sets that tile the integers by translation. By periodicity, this conjecture is reduced to sets which tile a finite cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_M$. In this paper we consider a natural relaxation of this problem, where we replace sets with nonnegative functions $f,g$, such that $f(0)=g(0)=1$, $f\ast g=\mathbf{1}_{\mathbb{Z}_M}$ is a functional tiling, and $f, g$ satisfy certain further natural properties associated with tilings. We show that the Coven-Meyerowitz tiling conditions do not necessarily hold in such generality. Such examples of functional tilings carry the potential to lead to proper tiling counterexamples to the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture in the future.</description>

      <title>An optimal control problem for Maxwell's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the optimal boundary control of the Maxwell system. We consider a Bolza problem, where the quadratic functional to be minimized penalizes the electromagnetic field at a given final time. Since the state is weighted in the energy space topology -- a physically realistic choice --, the property that the optimal cost operator does satisfy the Riccati equation (RE) corresponding to the optimization problem is missed, just like in the case of other significant hyperbolic partial differential equations; however, we prove that this Riccati operator as well as the optimal solution can be recovered by means of approximating problems for which the optimal synthesis holds via proper differential Riccati equations. In the case of zero conductivity, an explicit representation of the optimal pair is valid which does not demand the well-posedness of the RE, instead.</description>

Abstract: In this work, it is proven the semiglobal exponential stabilization to time-dependent trajectories of the nonisothermal Cahn-Hilliard equations. In the model, the input controls are given by explicit feedback operators that involve appropriate oblique projections. The actuators are given by a finite number of indicator functions. The results also hold for the isothermal Cahn-Hilliard system. Numerical simulations are shown that illustrate the stabilizing performance of the proposed input feedback operators.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present the basic concepts of the geometric theory of composition operators on Sobolev spaces. The main objects of the theory are topological mappings which generate bounded embedding operators on Sobolev spaces by the composition rule. This theory is in some sense a "generalization" of the theory of quasiconformal mappings, but the theory of composition operators is oriented to its applications to the Sobolev embedding theorems, the spectral theory of elliptic operators and continuum mechanics problems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations as gradient flows on the space of probability measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general method to identify nonlinear Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations (FPK equations) as gradient flows on the space of probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a natural differential geometry. Our notion of gradient flow does not depend on any underlying metric structure such as the Wasserstein distance, but is derived from purely differential geometric considerations. We explicitly identify the associated entropy functions, which are not necessarily convex, and also the corresponding energy functionals, in particular their domains of definition. Furthermore, the latter functions are Lyapunov functions for the solutions of the FPK equations. Moreover, we show uniqueness results for such gradient flows, and we also prove that the gradient of $E$ is a gradient field on $\mathbb{R}^d$, which can be approximated by smooth gradient fields. These results cover classical and generalized porous media equations, where the latter have a generalized diffusivity function and a nonlinear transport-type first-order perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02304v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a variety of scientific and engineering domains, the need for high-fidelity and efficient solutions for high-frequency wave propagation holds great significance. Recent advances in wave modeling use sufficiently accurate fine solver outputs to train a neural network that enhances the accuracy of a fast but inaccurate coarse solver. In this paper we build upon the work of Nguyen and Tsai (2023) and present a novel unified system that integrates a numerical solver with a deep learning component into an end-to-end framework. In the proposed setting, we investigate refinements to the network architecture and data generation algorithm. A stable and fast solver further allows the use of Parareal, a parallel-in-time algorithm to correct high-frequency wave components. Our results show that the cohesive structure improves performance without sacrificing speed, and demonstrate the importance of temporal dynamics, as well as Parareal, for accurate wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Local interpolation techniques for higher-order singular perturbations of non-convex functionals: free-discontinuity problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general approach, using local interpolation inequalities, to non-convex integral functionals depending on the gradient with a singular perturbation by derivatives of order $k\ge 2$. When applied to functionals giving rise to free-discontinuity energies, such methods permit to change boundary values for derivatives up to order $k-1$ in problems defining density functions for the jump part, thus allowing to prove optimal-profile formulas, and to deduce compactness and lower bounds. As an application, we prove that for $k$-th order perturbations of energies depending on the gradient behaving as a constant at infinity, the jump energy density is a constant $m_k$ times the $k$-th root of the jump size. The result is first proved for truncated quadratic energy densities and in the one-dimensional case, from which the general higher-dimensional case can be obtained by slicing techniques. A wide class of non-convex energies can be studied as an envelope of these particular ones. Finally, we remark that an approximation of the Mumford-Shah functional can be obtained by letting $k$ tend to infinity. We also derive a new approximation of the Blake-Zisserman functional.</description>

Abstract: We study the effective behavior of random, heterogeneous, anisotropic, second order phase transitions energies that arise in the study of pattern formations in physical-chemical systems. Specifically, we study the asymptotic behavior, as $\epsilon$ goes to zero, of random heterogeneous anisotropic functionals in which the second order perturbation competes not only with a double well potential but also with a possibly negative contribution given by the first order term. We prove that, under suitable growth conditions and under a stationarity assumption, the functionals $\Gamma$-converge almost surely to a surface energy whose density is independent of the space variable. Furthermore, we show that the limit surface density can be described via a suitable cell formula and is deterministic when ergodicity is assumed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the field concentration phenomenon between two closely spaced perfect conductors with imperfect bonding interfaces of low conductivity type. The boundary condition on these interfaces is given by a Robin-type boundary condition. We discover a \textit{new} dichotomy for the field concentration depending on the bonding parameter $\gamma$. Specifically, we show that the gradient of solution is uniformly bounded independent of $\varepsilon$ (the distance between two inclusions) when $\gamma$ is sufficiently small. However, the gradient may blow up when $\gamma$ is large. Moreover, we identify the threshold of $\gamma$ and the optimal blow-up rates under certain symmetry assumptions. The proof relies on a crucial anisotropic gradient estimate in the thin neck between two inclusions. We develop a general framework for establishing such estimate, which is applicable to a wide range of elliptic equations and boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the well-posed issues of the fractional dissipative system in the framework of the Fourier--Besov spaces with variable regularity and integrability indices. By fully using some basic properties of these variable function spaces, we establish the linear estimates in variable Fourier--Besov spaces for the fractional heat equation. Such estimates are fundamental for solving certain dissipative PDE's of fractional type. As an applications, we prove global well-posedness in variable Fourier--Besov spaces for the 3D generalized incompressible Navier--Stokes equations and the 3D fractional Keller--Segel system.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the Navier--Stokes equations and the Keller--Segel system in variable Fourier--Besov spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Cauchy problem of the classical incompressible Navier--Stokes equations and the parabolic-elliptic Keller--Segel system in the framework of the Fourier--Besov spaces with variable regularity and integrability indices. By fully using some basic properties of these variable function spaces, we establish the linear estimates in variable Fourier--Besov spaces for the heat equation. Such estimates are fundamental for solving certain PDE's of parabolic type. As an applications, we prove global well-posedness in variable Fourier--Besov spaces for the 3D classical incompressible Navier--Stokes equations and the 3D parabolic-elliptic Keller--Segel system.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotic behaviour of double-well energies perturbed by a higher-order fractional term, which, in the one-dimensional case, take the form $$ \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\int_I W(u(x))dx+\varepsilon^{2(k+s)-1}\frac{s(1-s)}{2^{1-s}}\int_{I\times I} \frac{|u^{(k)}(x)-u^{(k)}(y)|^2}{|x-y|^{1+2s}} dx\,dy $$ defined on the higher-order fractional Sobolev space $H^{k+s}(I)$, where $W$ is a double-well potential, $k\in \mathbb N$ and $s\in(0,1)$ with $k+s&gt;\frac12$. We show that these functionals $\Gamma$-converge as $\varepsilon\to 0$ to a sharp-interface functional with domain $BV(I;\{-1,1\})$ of the form $m_{k+s}\#(S(u))$, with $m_{k+s}$ given by the optimal-profile problem \begin{equation*} m_{k+s} =\inf\Big\{\int_{\mathbb R} W(v)dx+\frac{s(1-s)}{2^{1-s}}\int_{\mathbb R^2}\frac{|v^{(k)}(x)-v^{(k)}(y)|^2}{|x-y|^{1+2s}} dx\,dy : v\in H^{k+s}_{\rm loc}(\mathbb R), \lim_{x\to\pm\infty}v(x)=\pm1\Big\}. \end{equation*} The normalization coefficient $\frac{s(1-s)}{2^{1-s}}$ is such that $m_{k+s}$ interpolates continuously the corresponding $m_k$ defined on standard higher-order Sobolev space $H^k(I)$, obtained by Modica and Mortola in the case $k=1$, Fonseca and Mantegazza in the case $k=2$ and Brusca, Donati and Solci for $k\ge 3$. The results also extends previous works by Alberti, Bouchitt\'e and Seppecher, Savin and Valdinoci, and Palatucci and Vincini, in the case $k=0$ and $s\in(\frac12,1)$.</description>

      <title>Second-order optimality conditions for the bilinear optimal control of a degenerate equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is the study of second-order optimality conditions for the bilinear control of a strongly degenerate parabolic equation. The equation is degenerate at the boundary of the spatial domain. The well-posedness of the state equation, as well as weak maximum principles are established. We prove some differentiability properties of the control-to-state operator and the existence of optimal solutions. Finally, we derive first- and second-order optimality conditions for the system.</description>

      <title>On the rotational invariance and hyperbolicity of shallow water moment equations in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the two-dimensional extension of a recently introduced set of shallow water models based on a regularized moment expansion of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations \cite{kowalski2017moment,koellermeier2020analysis}. We show the rotational invariance of the proposed moment models with two different approaches. The first proof involves the split of the coefficient matrix into the conservative and non-conservative parts and proves the rotational invariance for each part, while the second one relies on the special block structure of the coefficient matrices. With the aid of rotational invariance, the analysis of the hyperbolicity for the moment model in 2D is reduced to the real diagonalizability of the coefficient matrix in 1D. Then we analyze the real diagonalizability by deriving the analytical form of the characteristic polynomial. We find that the moment model in 2D is hyperbolic in most cases and weakly hyperbolic in a degenerate edge case. With a simple modification to the coefficient matrices, we fix this weakly hyperbolicity and propose a new global hyperbolic model. Furthermore, we extend the model to include a more general class of closure relations than the original model and establish that this set of general closure relations retains both rotational invariance and hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>An abstract approximation tool for mixed-dimensional and equidimensional modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many coupled problems in engineering and science can be described by elliptic partial differential equations on adjacent domains, where the coupling can be considered either as a thin equidimensional overlap between the model domains, or as a lower-dimensional interface. Thereby we distinguish equidimensional and mixed-dimensional models of the same system, and the relationship between these modeling approaches is of natural interest.
  In this paper, we construct an overlapping open cover for a class of simplicial geometries and construct a bounded cochain map from the simplicial de Rham complex to the \v{C}ech-de Rham complex associated with the overlapping cover. Thus, we establish an isomorphism between simplicial de Rham complexes (i.e. functions and forms on mixed-dimensional partitions and their differentials) and subcomplexes of \v{C}ech-de Rham complexes (i.e. functions and forms on equidimensional partitions and their differentials), which serves as an abstract approximation tool for comparing mixed-dimensional problems to the equidimensional version of the same problem.</description>

      <title>Hermitian-Einstein equations on noncompact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper first investigates solvability of Hermitian-Einstein equation on a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle on the complement of an arbitrary closed subset in a compact Hermitian manifold. The uniqueness of Hermitian-Einstein metrics on a Zariski open subset in a compact K\"{a}hler manifold was only figured out by Takuro Mochizuki recently, for this model the second part of this paper gives an affirmative answer to a question proposed by Takuro Mochizuki and it leads to an alternative approach to the unique issue. We also prove stability from solvability of Hermitian-Einstein equation, which together with the classical existence result of Carlos Simpson in particular establish a Kobayashi-Hitchin bijective correspondence. The argument is also effective in more general settings, including basic models of Takuro Mochizuki, as well as non-K\"{a}hler and semi-stable contexts.</description>
