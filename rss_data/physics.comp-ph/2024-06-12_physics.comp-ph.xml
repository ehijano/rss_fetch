      <title>A high-performance reconstruction method for partially coherent ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ptychography is now integrated as a tool in mainstream microscopy allowing quantitative and high-resolution imaging capabilities over a wide field of view. However, its ultimate performance is inevitably limited by the available coherent flux when implemented using electrons or laboratory X-ray sources. We present a universal reconstruction algorithm with high tolerance to low coherence for both far-field and near-field ptychography. The approach is practical for partial temporal and spatial coherence and requires no prior knowledge of the source properties. Our initial visible-light and electron data show that the method can dramatically improve the reconstruction quality and accelerate the convergence rate of the reconstruction. The approach also integrates well into existing ptychographic engines. It can also improve mixed-state and numerical monochromatisation methods, requiring a smaller number of coherent modes or lower dimensionality of Krylov subspace while providing more stable and faster convergence. We propose that this approach could have significant impact on ptychography of weakly scattering samples.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Boltzmann Equation for Complex Systems of Neutral Gases across All Flow Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Multi-scale Boltzmann Equation (MBE) is found from the gas-kinetic theory and the direct modeling philosophy as a master equation for complex physical systems of neutral gases across all flow regimes, which locates between the continuum limit and the free-molecular limit, covering a vast range of applications such as hypersonic flows over aerospace crafts and delicate flows around MEMS. The most explicit characteristic of MBE is evolving the variable observation time in the expression, which distinguishes the MBE from the single-scale master or governing equation where a fixed scale is implied in the assumptions. The fundamental properties of MBE, such as the asymptotic property, are proved theoretically, while a concise numerical scheme is developed for MBE to demonstrate its validity by benchmark multi-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate evaluation of Biot-Savart integrals over spatial curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Biot-Savart law is relevant in physical contexts including electromagnetism and fluid dynamics. In the latter case, when the rotation of a fluid is confined to a set of very thin vortex filaments, this law describes the velocity field induced by the spatial arrangement of these objects. The Biot-Savart law is at the core of vortex methods used in the simulation of classical and quantum fluid flows. Naive methods are inefficient when dealing with large numbers of vortex elements, which makes them inadequate for simulating turbulent vortex flows. Here we exploit a direct analogy between the Biot-Savart law and electrostatics to adapt Ewald summation methods, routinely used in molecular dynamics simulations, to vortex filament simulations in three-dimensional periodic domains. In this context, the basic idea is to split the induced velocity onto (i) a coarse-grained velocity generated by a Gaussian-filtered vorticity field, and (ii) a short-range correction accounting for near-singular behaviour near the vortices. The former component can be accurately and efficiently evaluated using the nonuniform fast Fourier transform algorithm. Analytical accuracy estimates are provided as a function of the parameters entering the method. We also discuss how to properly account for the finite vortex core size in kinetic energy estimations. Using numerical experiments, we verify the accuracy and the conservation properties of the proposed approach. Moreover, we demonstrate the $O(N \log N)$ complexity of the method over a wide range of problem sizes $N$, considerably better than the $O(N^2)$ cost of a naive approach.</description>

      <title>Full transmission of vectorial waves through 3D multiple-scattering media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A striking prediction from the random matrix theory in mesoscopic physics is the existence of "open channels": waves that can use multipath interference to achieve perfect transmission across an opaque disordered medium even in the multiple-scattering regime. Realization of such open channels requires a coherent control of the complete incident wavefront. To date, the open channels have only been demonstrated in scalar two-dimensional (2D) structures, both experimentally and with numerical studies. Here, we utilize a recently proposed "augmented partial factorization" full-wave simulation method to compute the scattering matrix from 3D vectorial Maxwell's equations and demonstrate the existence of open channels in 3D disordered media. We examine the spatial profile of such open channels, demonstrate the existence of a bimodal transmission eigenvalue distribution with full control, and study the effects of incomplete polarization control and of a finite illumination area. This study confirms the validity of the random matrix theory in vectorial systems. The simulation framework provides full access to the complex multi-channel wave transport in 3D disordered systems, filling the gap left by experimental capabilities.</description>

      <title>A way to identify whether a DFT gap is from right reasons or error cancellations: The case of copper chalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gap opening remains elusive in copper chalcogenides (Cu$_{2}X$, $X$ = S, Se and Te), not least because Hubbard + $U$, hybrid functional and ${GW}$ methods have also failed. In this work, we elucidate that their failure originates from a severe underestimation of the 4$s$-3$d$ orbital splitting of the Cu atom, which leads to a band-order inversion in the presence of an anionic crystal field. As a result, the Fermi energy is pinned due to symmetry, yielding an invariant zero gap. Utilizing the hybrid pseudopotentials to correct the underestimation on the atomic side opens up gaps of experimental magnitude in Cu$_{2}X$, suggesting their predominantly electronic nature. Our work not only clarifies the debate about the Cu$_{2}X$ gap, but also provides a way to identify which of the different methods really captures the physical essence and which is the result of error cancellation.</description>

      <title>MPSDynamics.jl: Tensor network simulations for finite-temperature (non-Markovian) open quantum system dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MPSDynamics.jl package provides an easy to use interface for performing open quantum systems simulations at zero and finite temperatures. The package has been developed with the aim of studying non-Markovian open system dynamics using the state-of-the-art numerically exact Thermalized-Time Evolving Density operator with Orthonormal Polynomials Algorithm (T-TEDOPA) based on environment chain mapping. The simulations rely on a tensor network representation of the quantum states as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network (TTN) states. Written in the Julia programming language, MPSDynamics.jl is a versatile open-source package providing a choice of several variants of the Time-Dependent Variational Principle (TDVP) method for time evolution (including novel bond-adaptive one-site algorithms). The package also provides strong support for the measurement of single and multi-site observables, as well as the storing and logging of data, which makes it a useful tool for the study of many-body physics. It currently handles long-range interactions, time-dependent Hamiltonians, multiple environments, bosonic and fermionic environments, and joint system-environment observables.</description>

      <title>Path-based packing of icosahedral shells into multi-component aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-component aggregates are being intensively researched in various fields because of their highly tunable properties and wide applications. Due to the complex configurational space of these systems, research would greatly benefit from a general theoretical framework for the prediction of stable structures, which, however, is largely incomplete at present. Here we propose a general theory for the construction of multi-component icosahedral structures by assembling concentric shells of different chiral and achiral types, consisting of particles of different sizes. By mapping shell sequences into paths in the hexagonal lattice, we establish simple and general rules for building a wide variety of magic icosahedral structures, and we evaluate the optimal size-mismatch between particles in the different shells. Our predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations for different systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter, we discuss recent advances and new opportunities through methods of machine learning for the field of classical density functional theory, dealing with the equilibrium properties of thermal nano- and micro-particle systems having classical interactions. Machine learning methods offer the great potential to construct and/or improve the free energy functional (the central object of density functional theory) from simulation data and thus they complement traditional physics- or intuition-based approaches to the free energy construction. We also give an outlook to machine learning efforts in related fields, such as liquid state theory, electron density functional theory and power functional theory as a functionally formulated approach to classical nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Interacting-bath dynamical embedding for capturing non-local electron correlation in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantitative simulation of electronic structure of solids requires the treatment of local and non-local electron correlations on an equal footing. Dynamical mean-field theory, a widely-used quantum embedding algorithm that assumes local self-energy approximation, is challenging to extend to capture long-range electron correlation. In this work, we present a new formulation of Green's function embedding that, instead of embedding the impurity in non-interacting bath through the hybridization function, derives bath representation with general two-particle interactions in a fully ab initio and systematically improvable manner. The resulting interacting-bath dynamical embedding theory (ibDET) simulates local and non-local self-energies using high-level quantum chemistry solvers, such as the coupled-cluster theory. We demonstrate that ibDET combined with the GW theory (GW+ibDET) achieves good agreements with experimental band structure and photoemission spectra while preserving translational symmetry across a range of semiconducting, insulating, and metallic materials. Furthermore, our approach allows quantifying the role of non-local electron correlation in determining spectral properties of materials and addressing the long-standing debate over the bandwidth narrowing of metallic sodium.</description>

      <title>A finite element method to compute the damping rate and frequency of oscillating fluids inside microfluidic nozzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computation of damping rates of an oscillating fluid with a free surface in which viscosity is small and surface tension high is numerically challenging. A typical application requiring such computation is drop-on-demand (DoD) microfluidic devices that eject liquid metal droplets, where accurate knowledge of damping rates for the least-damped oscillation modes following droplet ejection is paramount for assessing jetting stability at higher jetting frequencies. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often struggle to accurately predict meniscus damping unless a very fine discretization is adopted, so calculations are computationally expensive. The faster alternative we adopt is to compute damping rates directly from the eigenvalues of the linearized problem. The surface tension term in Stokes or sloshing problems requires approximation of meniscus displacements, which introduces additional complexity in their numerical solution. We consider the combined effects of viscosity and surface tension, approximate the meniscus displacements, and construct a finite element method to compute the fluid's oscillation modes. We prove that the method is free of spurious modes with zero or positive damping rates, and we implement it with Taylor-Hood elements for velocity and pressure, and with continuous piecewise quadratic elements for meniscus displacement. We verify the numerical convergence of the method by reproducing the solution to an analytical benchmark problem and two more complex examples with axisymmetric geometry. We obtain the spatial shape and temporal evolution (angular frequency and damping rate) of the set of least-damped oscillation modes in minutes, compared to days for a CFD simulation. The method's ability to quickly generate accurate estimates of fluid oscillation damping rates makes it suitable for integration into design loops for prototyping microfluidic nozzles.</description>

Abstract: Novel methods to integrate the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation within the framework of multiscale approximation is presented. The methods are based on symplectic splitting algorithms to separate the kinetic and potential parts of the corresponding propagator. The semigroup associated with the free-particle Schr\"odinger operator is represented in a multiwavelet basis. The propagator is effectively discretized with a contour deformation technique, which overcomes the challenges presented by previous discretization methods. The discretized operator is then employed in simple numerical simulations to test the validity of the implementation and to benchmark its precision.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computational fluid dynamics (QCFD) offers a promising alternative to classical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) by leveraging quantum algorithms for higher efficiency. This paper introduces a comprehensive QCFD method implemented on a superconducting quantum computer, demonstrating successful simulations of steady Poiseuille flow and unsteady acoustic wave propagation. The Poiseuille flow simulation achieved a relative error of less than $0.2\%$, and the unsteady acoustic wave simulation solved a 5043-dimension matrix, marking the largest fluid simulation on a quantum computer to date. Our approach bridges quantum and classical computing, adapting to quantum hardware constraints and offering scalable solutions for large-scale CFD problems, which paves the way for practical applications of near-term quantum computers in computational science.</description>

Abstract: Properties of erfonium, a Hooke atom with the Coulomb interaction potential $1/r$ replaced by a non-singular $\text{erf}(\mu r)/r$ potential are investigated. The structure of the Hooke atom potential and properties of its energy spectrum, relative to the ones of the spherical harmonic oscillator and of harmonium, are analyzed. It is shown, that at a certain value of $\mu$ the system changes its behavior from a harmonium-like regime to a harmonic-oscillator-like regime.</description>

      <title>CT Reconstruction using Diffusion Posterior Sampling conditioned on a Nonlinear Measurement Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have been demonstrated as powerful deep learning tools for image generation in CT reconstruction and restoration. Recently, diffusion posterior sampling, where a score-based diffusion prior is combined with a likelihood model, has been used to produce high quality CT images given low-quality measurements. This technique is attractive since it permits a one-time, unsupervised training of a CT prior; which can then be incorporated with an arbitrary data model. However, current methods rely on a linear model of x-ray CT physics to reconstruct or restore images. While it is common to linearize the transmission tomography reconstruction problem, this is an approximation to the true and inherently nonlinear forward model. We propose a new method that solves the inverse problem of nonlinear CT image reconstruction via diffusion posterior sampling. We implement a traditional unconditional diffusion model by training a prior score function estimator, and apply Bayes rule to combine this prior with a measurement likelihood score function derived from the nonlinear physical model to arrive at a posterior score function that can be used to sample the reverse-time diffusion process. This plug-and-play method allows incorporation of a diffusion-based prior with generalized nonlinear CT image reconstruction into multiple CT system designs with different forward models, without the need for any additional training. We develop the algorithm that performs this reconstruction, including an ordered-subsets variant for accelerated processing and demonstrate the technique in both fully sampled low dose data and sparse-view geometries using a single unsupervised training of the prior.</description>

      <title>A mesh-constrained discrete point method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-based methods are a practical tool in computational fluid dynamics, and novel types of methods have been proposed. However, widely developed Lagrangian-type formulations suffer from the nonuniform distribution of particles, which is enhanced over time and result in problems in computational efficiency and parallel computations. To mitigate these problems, a mesh-constrained discrete point (MCD) method was developed for stationary boundary problems (Matsuda et al., 2022). Although the MCD method is a meshless method that uses moving least-squares approximation, the arrangement of particles (or discrete points (DPs)) is specialized so that their positions are constrained in background meshes to obtain a closely uniform distribution. This achieves a reasonable approximation for spatial derivatives with compact stencils without encountering any ill-posed condition and leads to good performance in terms of computational efficiency. In this study, a novel meshless method based on the MCD method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries is proposed. To ensure the mesh constraint of each DP in moving boundary problems, a novel updating algorithm for the DP arrangement is developed so that the position of DPs is not only rearranged but the DPs are also reassigned the role of being on the boundary or not. The proposed method achieved reasonable results in numerical experiments for well-known moving boundary problems.</description>
