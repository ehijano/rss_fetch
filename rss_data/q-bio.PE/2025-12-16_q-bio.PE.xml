      <title>Modeling the Prey-Predator Dynamics of Habu Snakes and Mongooses Leading to Ecological Disaster on Amami Oshima Island in Japan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of mongooses from Indian subcontinent to Amami Oshima Island, Japan, aimed at controlling the population of venomous Habu snakes, has led to significant ecological disruptions, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of the islands biodiversity. To highlight the unintended consequences of such interventions and the necessity of understanding predator-prey dynamics in preserving ecological balance, a mathematical model incorporating snake, mongooses, mouse and natural resources has been proposed to explore their role in the ongoing ecological disaster and analysis the other scenarios if the authorities applied different approaches in place of already implemented strategy. Determining the model's existence and uniqueness, stability at equilibrium points, and state variable characteristics are some of the parts of the analytical analysis of the model. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify sensitive factors. In addition, the Runge-Kutta 4th order has been used to execute the numerical simulations. Our research reveals that although the government began killing and trapping mongooses almost 20 years after their introduction, but if trapping had started just 10 years after their introduction, the outcome could have been drastically different. This time, mongooses would not have been extinct, and their coexistence with other native species would have helped to preserve the ecological balance and prevent the severe ecological damage that is presently being seen. Thus, It is recommended to use mathematical modeling to explore alternatives before decision-making, ensuring sustainable ecosystem management while preventing irreversible impacts of invasive species.</description>

      <title>Dual-Model Framework for CHIKV Transmission Modeling: ODE and Petri Net Analysis of the 2025 Foshan Outbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study constructs a dual-model framework integrating Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and Petri Nets (PN) to analyze the 2025 Chikungunya outbreak in Foshan City, China. We employ SEICR compartmental modeling to compare two distinct approaches under identical epidemiological scenarios and evaluate intervention effectiveness through three-phase fitting protocols. Both models demonstrate excellent accuracy with MAE of 18.77-18.91 cases and RMSE of 36.52-36.54 cases. Models predicted epidemic peaks at day 32 (406 cases), 3 days earlier than observed (day 35, 432 cases), with 6.0% peak value error. Reproduction number analysis revealed initial R0 of 14.67 (ODE)/13.90 (PN), with effective reproduction numbers decreasing through intervention phases: 7.85/7.86 after Phase 1, 7.59/7.56 after Phase 2, and 0.059 in Phase 3, achieving transmission blockade. Sensitivity analysis showed recovery rate) as the most sensitive parameter (Sobol index 0.9672), explaining 96.72% of R0 variation. This study presents the first systematic ODE-Petri Net comparison, providing a novel dual-model framework for vector-borne disease modeling with significant theoretical and practical value for epidemic control strategy formulation.</description>

      <title>Ecological interactions and spatial dynamics in microbial aggregates: A novel modelling framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mathematical model based on a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) with cross-diffusion and reaction terms to describe ecological interactions between multiple bacterial species and substrates within microaggregates, where bacteria proliferate in response to substrate availability and undergo passive dispersal driven by population pressure gradients. The ecological interactions include interspecific competition for shared substrates, and commensalism, whereby one species benefits from the metabolic by-products of another. The main motivation comes from individual-based models (IBMs) of microbial aggregates, where simulations reveal that substrate-limited conditions can give rise to rich spatial patterns. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our PDE-based model captures the key qualitative features of three verification scenarios that have previously been investigated with IBMs. Moreover, we formally derive a competition system from an on-lattice biased random walk, and establish local well-posedness for a parameter-symmetric subcase of it. We then formally analyse the travelling wave behaviour of this case in one spatial dimension and compare the minimal travelling wave speed with the wave speed measured in the simulations.</description>

      <title>Stable equilibria in the Lotka-Volterra equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Lotka-Volterra system and provide necessary conditions for an equilibrium to be stable. Our results naturally complement earlier fundamental results by N. Adachi, Y. Takeuchi, and H. Tokumaru, who, in a series of papers, give sufficient (and for some cases necessary) conditions for the existence of a stable equilibrium point.</description>

      <title>Binary normal networks without near reticulations can be reconstructed from their rooted triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normal networks are an important class of phylogenetic networks that have compelling mathematical properties which align with intuition about inference from genetic data. While tools enabling widespread use of phylogenetic networks in the biological literature are still under mathematical, statistical, and computational development, many such results are being assembled, and in particular for normal phylogenetic networks. For instance, it has been shown that binary normal networks can be reconstructed from the sets of three- and four-leaf rooted phylogenetic trees that they display. It is also known that one can reconstruct particular subclasses of normal networks from just the displayed rooted triples. This applies, for instance, to rooted binary phylogenetic trees and to binary level-$1$ normal networks. In this paper we address the question of how much of the class of binary normal networks can be reconstructed from just the rooted triples that they display. We find that all except those with substructures that we call ``near-sibling reticulations'' and ``near-stack reticulations'' can be reconstructed just from their rooted triples. This goes some way to answering the natural question of how much information can be extracted from a set of displayed rooted triples, which are arguably the simplest substructure that one may hope for in a phylogenetic object.</description>

      <title>Wavespeed selection and interstitial gap formation in an acid-mediated cancer invasion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-component reaction-diffusion system that has previously been developed to model invasion of cells into a resident cell population. The system is an idealised version of models of tumour growth in which tumour cells degrade the surrounding tissue by increasing the acidity of the local environment. By numerically computing families of travelling wave solutions to this problem, we observe that a general initial condition with either compact support, or sufficiently large exponential decay in the far field, tends to the travelling wave solution that has the largest possible decay at its front. Initial conditions with sufficiently slow exponential decay tend to those travelling wave solutions that have the same exponential decay as their initial conditions. We also show that in the limit that the (nondimensional) degradation rate of resident cells is large, the system has similar asymptotic structure as previously observed in perturbed Fisher--KPP models. The asymptotic analysis in this limit explains the formation of an interstitial gap (a region between the invading and receding fronts, in which both cell populations are small), the width of which is logarithmically large in the limit of large degradation rate. These results show that the general mechanism behind the formation of the interstitial gap in reaction-diffusion tumour models is connected to perturbations of the Fisher-KPP system. Biologically, this implies that order of magnitude difference in degradation rate is required to produce appreciably different gap sizes, while the velocity of the invading front is largely determined by the Fisher-KPP velocity, and only very weakly affected by the presence of the interstitial gap.</description>
