      <title>The growth rate of closed prime magnetic geodesics on closed contact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for any given closed contact manifold, there exists an infinite-dimensional space of Riemannian metrics which can be identified with the space of bundle metrics on the induced contact distribution. For each such metric, and for all energy levels, the number of embedded periodic orbits of the corresponding magnetic geodesic flow grows at least as fast as the number of geometrically distinct periodic Reeb orbits of period less than $t$.
  As a corollary, we deduce that for every closed 3-manifold which is not a graph manifold, there exists an open $C^1$-neighborhood of the set of nondegenerate contact forms such that for each contact form in this neighborhood, there exists an infinite-dimensional space of Riemannian metrics as above. For the corresponding magnetic systems, the number of prime closed magnetic geodesics grows at least exponentially on all energy levels. Consequently, the restriction of the magnetic geodesic flow to any energy surface has positive topological entropy.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many left-symmetric structures on nilpotent Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dekimpe and Ongenae constructed infinitely many pairwise non-isomorphic complete left-symmetric structures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n\geq 6$. In this paper, we construct a family of complete left-symmetric structures on the cotangent Lie algebra $T^*\mathfrak{g}$ of a certain $n$-dimensional almost abelian nilpotent Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and give a condition under which two left-symmetric structures in this family are isomorphic. As a consequence of this result, we obtain infinitely many pairwise non-isomorphic left-symmetric structures on $T^{*}\mathfrak{g}$. As an application of this construction, we also obtain infinitely many symplectic structures on $T^{*}\mathfrak{g}$ which are pairwise non-symplectomorphic up to homothety.</description>

      <title>Nearby Special Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10385v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Calabi--Yau manifold and $Q\subset X$ a closed connected embedded special Lagrangian; closed Lagrangians mean compact Lagrangian submanifolds without boundary. We prove that if the fundamental group $\pi_1Q$ is abelian then there exists a Weinstein neighbourhood of $Q\subset X$ in which every closed irreducibly immersed special Lagrangian with unobstructed Floer cohomology is $C^1$ close to $Q.$ We prove also that if $\pi_1Q$ is virtually solvable then for every positive integer $R$ there exists a Weinstein neighbourhood of $Q\subset X$ in which every closed irreducibly immersed special Lagrangian of degree $\le R$ and with unobstructed Floer cohomology is unbranched; that is, the projection $L\to Q$ is a covering map. We prove a stronger statement when $\pi_1Q$ is finite and a weaker statement when $\pi_1Q$ has no non-abelian free subgroups. The $\pi_1Q$ conditions, the Floer cohomology condition and the special Lagrangian condition are all essential as we show by counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Relating categorical dimensions in topology and symplectic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study several notions of dimension for (pre-)triangulated categories naturally arising from topology and symplectic geometry. We prove new bounds on these dimensions and raise several questions for further investigation. For instance, we relate the Rouquier dimension of the wrapped Fukaya category of either the cotangent bundle of a smooth manifold $M$ or more generally a Weinstein domain $X$ to quantities of geometric interest. These quantities include the minimum number of critical values of a Morse function on $M$, the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of $M$, the number of distinct action values of a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism of $X$, and the smallest $n$ such that $X$ admits a Weinstein embedding into $\mathbb{R}^{2n+1}$. Along the way, we introduce a notion of the Lusternik-Schnirelmann category for dg-categories and construct exact Lagrangian cobordisms for restriction to a Liouville subdomain.</description>

      <title>A universal mirror to $(\mathbb{P}^2, \Omega)$ as a birational object</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study homological mirror symmetry for $(\mathbb{P}^2, \Omega)$ viewed as an object of birational geometry, with $\Omega$ the standard meromorphic volume form. First, we construct universal objects on the two sides of mirror symmetry, focusing on the exact symplectic setting: a smooth complex scheme $U_\mathrm{univ}$ and a Weinstein manifold $M_\mathrm{univ}$, both of infinite type; and we prove homological mirror symmetry for them. Second, we consider autoequivalences. We prove that automorphisms of $U_\mathrm{univ}$ are given by a natural discrete subgroup of $\operatorname{Bir} (\mathbb{P}^2, \pm \Omega)$; and that all of these automorphisms are mirror to symplectomorphisms of $M_\mathrm{univ}$. We conclude with some applications.</description>
