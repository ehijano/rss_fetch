      <title>Why Districting Becomes NP-hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates why and when the edge-based districting problem becomes computationally intractable. The overall problem is represented as an exact mathematical programming formulation consisting of an objective function and several constraint groups, each enforcing a well-known districting criterion such as balance, contiguity, or compactness. While districting is known to be NP-hard in general, we study what happens when specific constraint groups are relaxed or removed. The results identify precise boundaries between tractable subproblems (in P) and intractable ones (NP-hard). The paper also discusses implications on node-based analogs of the featured districting problems, and it considers alternative notions of certain criteria in its analysis.</description>

      <title>A Tight Lower Bound on Cubic Vertices and Upper Bounds on Thin and Non-thin edges in Planar Braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a subset $X$ of the vertex set $\VV(\GG)$ of a graph $\GG$, we denote the set of edges of $\GG$ which have exactly one end in $X$ by $\partial(X)$ and refer to it as the cut of $X$ or edge cut $\partial(X)$. A graph $\GG=(\VV,\EE)$ is called matching covered if $\forall e \in \EE(\GG), ~\exists \text{a perfect matching }M \text{ of }\GG \text{ s. t. } e \in M$. A cut $C$ of a matching covered graph $\GG$ is a separating cut if and only if, given any edge $e$, there is a perfect matching $M_{e}$ of $\GG$ such that $e \in M_{e}$ and $|C \cap M_{e}| = 1$. A cut $C$ in a matching covered graph $\GG$ is a tight cut of $\GG$ if $|C \cap M| = 1$ for every perfect matching $M$ of $\GG$. For, $X, Y \subseteq \VV(\GG)$, we denote the set of edges of $\EE(\GG)$ which have one endpoint in $X$ and the other endpoint in $Y$ by $E[X,Y]$. Let $\partial(X)=E[X,\overline{X}]$ be an edge cut, where $\overline{X}=\VV(\GG) \setminus X$. An edge cut is trivial if $|X|=1$ or $|\overline{X}|=1$. A matching covered graph, which is free of nontrivial tight cuts, is a brace if it is bipartite and is a brick if it is non-bipartite. An edge $e$ in a brace $\GG$ is \emph{thin} if, for every tight cut $\partial(X)$ of $\GG - e$, $|X| \le 3$ or $|\overline{X}| \le 3$.
  Carvalho, Lucchesi and Murty conjectured that there exists a positive constant $c$ such that every brace $\GG$ has $c|\VV(\GG)|$ thin edges \cite{DBLP:journals/combinatorics/LucchesiCM15}. He and Lu \cite{HE2025153} showed a lower bound of thin edges in a brace in terms of the number of cubic vertices. We asked whether any planar brace exists that does not contain any cubic vertices. We answer negatively by showing that such set of planar braces is empty. We have been able to show a quantitively tight lower bound on the number of cubic vertices in a planar brace. We have proved tight upper bounds of nonthin edges and thin edges in a planar brace.</description>

      <title>Fractional Iterates and Oscillatory Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simple continued fractions for the Golden &amp; Silver means are well-known. It is astonishing that, as far as we know, no one has published half-iterates (let alone quarter-iterates) for the corresponding algorithms. We also examine the cosine and logistic maps (with parameter $2 &lt; \lambda &lt; 3$).</description>

      <title>Triangulated spheres with holes in triangulated surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{S}_h$ denote a sphere with $h$ holes. Given a triangulation $G$ of a surface $\mathbb{M}$, we consider the question of when $G$ contains a spanning subgraph $H$ such that $H$ is a triangulated $\mathbb{S}_h$. We give a new short proof of a theorem of Nevo and Tarabykin that every triangulation $G$ of the torus contains a spanning subgraph which is a triangulated cylinder. For arbitrary surfaces, we prove that every high facewidth triangulation of a surface with $h$ handles contains a spanning subgraph which is a triangulated $\mathbb{S}_{2h}$. We also prove that for every $0 \leq g' &lt; g$ and $w \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists a triangulation of facewidth at least $w$ of a surface of Euler genus $g$ that does not have a spanning subgraph which is a triangulated $\mathbb{S}_{g'}$. Our results are motivated by, and have applications for, rigidity questions in the plane.</description>

      <title>Partitions of planar (oriented) graphs into a connected acyclic and an independent set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A question at the intersection of Barnette's Hamiltonicity and Neumann-Lara's dicoloring conjecture is: Can every Eulerian oriented planar graph be vertex-partitioned into two acyclic sets? A CAI-partition of an undirected/oriented graph is a partition into a tree/connected acyclic subgraph and an independent set. Consider any plane Eulerian oriented triangulation together with its unique tripartition, i.e. partition into three independent sets. If two of these three sets induce a subgraph G that has a CAI-partition, then the above question has a positive answer. We show that if G is subcubic, then it has a CAI-partition, i.e. oriented planar bipartite subcubic 2-vertex-connected graphs admit CAI-partitions. We also show that series-parallel 2-vertex-connected graphs admit CAI-partitions. Finally, we present a Eulerian oriented triangulation such that no two sets of its tripartition induce a graph with a CAI-partition. This generalizes a result of Alt, Payne, Schmidt, and Wood to the oriented setting.</description>

      <title>Amnesiac Flooding: Easy to break, hard to escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Broadcast is a central problem in distributed computing. Recently, Hussak and Trehan [PODC'19/DC'23] proposed a stateless broadcasting protocol (Amnesiac Flooding), which was surprisingly proven to terminate in asymptotically optimal time (linear in the diameter of the network). However, it remains unclear: (i) Are there other stateless terminating broadcast algorithms with the desirable properties of Amnesiac Flooding, (ii) How robust is Amnesiac Flooding with respect to \emph{faults}?
  In this paper we make progress on both of these fronts. Under a reasonable restriction (obliviousness to message content) additional to the fault-free synchronous model, we prove that Amnesiac Flooding is the \emph{only} strictly stateless deterministic protocol that can achieve terminating broadcast. We achieve this by identifying four natural properties of a terminating broadcast protocol that Amnesiac Flooding uniquely satisfies. In contrast, we prove that even minor relaxations of \textit{any} of these four criteria allow the construction of other terminating broadcast protocols.
  On the other hand, we prove that Amnesiac Flooding can become non-terminating or non-broadcasting, even if we allow just one node to drop a single message on a single edge in a single round. As a tool for proving this, we focus on the set of all \textit{configurations} of transmissions between nodes in the network, and obtain a \textit{dichotomy} characterizing the configurations, starting from which, Amnesiac Flooding terminates.
  Additionally, we characterise the structure of sets of Byzantine agents capable of forcing non-termination or non-broadcast of the protocol on arbitrary networks.</description>

      <title>On edge-colouring-games by Erd\H{o}s, and Bensmail and Mc Inerney</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two games proposed by Erd\H{o}s, and one game by Bensmail and Mc Inerney, all sharing a common setup: two players alternately colour edges of a complete graph, or in the biased version, they colour $p$ and $q$ edges respectively on their turns, aiming to maximise a graph parameter determined by their respective induced subgraphs. In the unbiased case, we give a first reduction towards confirming the conjecture of Bensmail and Mc Inerney, propose a conjecture for Erd\H{o}s' game on maximum degree, and extend the clique and maximum-degree versions to edge-transitive and regular graphs. In the biased case, the maximum-degree and vertex-capturing games are resolved, and we prove the clique game with $(p,q)=(1,3)$.</description>
