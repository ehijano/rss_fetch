      <title>Deploying Open-Source Large Language Models: A performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the release of ChatGPT in November 2023, large language models (LLMs) have seen considerable success, including in the open-source community, with many open-weight models available. However, the requirements to deploy such a service are often unknown and difficult to evaluate in advance. To facilitate this process, we conducted numerous tests at the Centre Inria de l'Universit\'e de Bordeaux. In this article, we propose a comparison of the performance of several models of different sizes (mainly Mistral and LLaMa) depending on the available GPUs, using vLLM, a Python library designed to optimize the inference of these models. Our results provide valuable information for private and public groups wishing to deploy LLMs, allowing them to evaluate the performance of different models based on their available hardware. This study thus contributes to facilitating the adoption and use of these large language models in various application domains.</description>

      <title>Solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems on a Photonic Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems pose significant computational challenges across various fields, from logistics to cryptography. Traditional computational methods often struggle with their exponential complexity, motivating exploration into alternative paradigms such as quantum computing. In this paper, we investigate the application of photonic quantum computing to solve combinatorial optimization problems. Leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, we demonstrate how photonic quantum computers can efficiently explore solution spaces and identify optimal solutions for a range of combinatorial problems. We provide an overview of quantum algorithms tailored for combinatorial optimization for different quantum architectures (boson sampling, quantum annealing and gate-based quantum computing). Additionally, we discuss the advantages and challenges of implementing those algorithms on photonic quantum hardware. Through experiments run on an 8-qumode photonic quantum device, as well as numerical simulations, we evaluate the performance of photonic quantum computers in solving representative combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Max-Cut problem and the Job Shop Scheduling Problem.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of GPU-Centric Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, GPUs have become the preferred accelerators for HPC and ML applications due to their parallelism and fast memory bandwidth. While GPUs boost computation, inter-GPU communication can create scalability bottlenecks, especially as the number of GPUs per node and cluster grows. Traditionally, the CPU managed multi-GPU communication, but advancements in GPU-centric communication now challenge this CPU dominance by reducing its involvement, granting GPUs more autonomy in communication tasks, and addressing mismatches in multi-GPU communication and computation.
  This paper provides a landscape of GPU-centric communication, focusing on vendor mechanisms and user-level library supports. It aims to clarify the complexities and diverse options in this field, define the terminology, and categorize existing approaches within and across nodes. The paper discusses vendor-provided mechanisms for communication and memory management in multi-GPU execution and reviews major communication libraries, their benefits, challenges, and performance insights. Then, it explores key research paradigms, future outlooks, and open research questions. By extensively describing GPU-centric communication techniques across the software and hardware stacks, we provide researchers, programmers, engineers, and library designers insights on how to exploit multi-GPU systems at their best.</description>
