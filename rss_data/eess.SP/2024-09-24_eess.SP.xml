      <title>Joint LOS Identification and Data Association for 6G-Enabled Networked Device-Free Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers networked device-free sensing in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) cellular system with multipath environment, where the passive targets reflect the downlink signals to the base stations (BSs) via non-line-of-sight (NLOS) paths and/or line-of-sight (LOS) paths, and the BSs share the sensing information extracted from their received echoes to jointly localize the targets. A two-phase localization protocol is considered. In Phase I, we design an efficient method that is able to accurately estimate the range of any path from a transmitting BS to a receiving BS via a target, even if the transmitting and receiving BSs are separated and not perfectly synchronized. In Phase II, we propose an effective method that is able to jointly identify the ranges of the LOS paths between the targets and the BSs as well as associate the ranges of LOS paths with the right targets, such that the number and the locations of the targets both can be accurately estimated. Numerical results verify that our proposed two-phase protocol can achieve high performance of networked sensing in the multipath environment.</description>

      <title>Identification of fault frequency variation in the envelope spectrum in the vibration-based local damage detection in possible changing load/speed conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of local damage diagnosis (based on the detection of impulsive and periodic signals) is discussed. Both features should be checked, as fault frequency must be linked to the true value calculated for a given machine and speed. The precise estimation of the fault frequency is hard due to several factors. If a speed fluctuation exists, it is solved by order analysis. A wider perspective is proposed here, namely, an automatic statistical approach to analyze the distribution of estimated fault frequencies. We propose a procedure to evaluate whether the fault frequency is constant or not. The algorithm uses frequency estimation based on peak detection in the envelope spectrum and statistical testing. We present simulation studies and industrial examples. We have found that if the fault frequency is not constant and its distribution does not follow Gaussian shape with minor variance, then one should use more advanced techniques, e.g. order analysis.</description>

      <title>LDPC Codes in Cooperative Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fact, the broadcast nature of every transmitter makes it possible for other transceivers in the channel to overhear the broadcasted signal. The proposed idea in cooperative communication is to use these intermediate transceivers as relay for the transmitted signal, therefore we will have spatial diversity which can improve throughput and received data reliability in the system. In this dissertation we consider some important aspects of cooperative communication in a network composed of three nodes. First, we verify the increase of reliability for the received signal by comparing the reliability of the received bits in a cooperative network with a non-cooperative one. Then we step forward and use LDPC error correction technique to improve the reliability of the received bits even more and compare it with a network without LDPC codes (encoder and decoder) to measure the level of improvement for different SNRs. The overall aim of this dissertation is to deploy cooperative communication idea to consider and test its claimed aspects and also enhance its performance by using LDPC error correction technique.</description>

      <title>TFT-multi: simultaneous forecasting of vital sign trajectories in the ICU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory forecasting in healthcare data has been an important area of research in precision care and clinical integration for computational methods. In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</description>

      <title>Computational Ghost Imaging with Low-Density Parity-Check Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ghost imaging (GI) is a high-resolution imaging technology that has been a subject of interest to many fields in the past 20 years. Most GI researchers focus on the reconstruction of signal under-sampling, nevertheless, how to use information redundancy to improve the result's belief in a complex environment has hardly been studied. Motivated by this, we propose a computational GI system based on the low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded radiation field by exploiting the signal redundancy. The non-ideal factors generated within the imaging process can be eliminated by setting up the matching fading channel model. We have derived the analytical lower bound on the bit error rate for the proposed LDPC-coded GI system. The effectiveness and performance of the LDPC-coded GI system are further validated through numerical and experiment results.</description>

      <title>User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO With RIS-Integrated Antenna Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is a promising network architecture for beyond 5G systems, which can particularly offer more uniform data rates across the coverage area. Recent works have shown how reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be used as relays in cell-free massive MIMO networks to improve data rates further. In this paper, we analyze an alternative architecture where an RIS is integrated into the antenna array at each access point and acts as an intelligent transmitting surface to expand the aperture area. This approach alleviates the multiplicative fading effect that normally makes RIS-aided systems inefficient and offers a cost-effective alternative to building large antenna arrays. We use a small number of antennas and a larger number of controllable RIS elements to match the performance of an antenna array whose size matches that of the RIS. In this paper, we explore this innovative transceiver architecture in the uplink of a cell-free massive MIMO system for the first time, demonstrating its potential benefits through analytic and numerical contributions. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed phase-shift configuration and highlight scenarios where the proposed architecture significantly enhances data rates.</description>

      <title>Positioning Error Compensation by Channel Knowledge Map in UAV Communication Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) perform high-precision communication tasks, such as searching for users and providing emergency coverage, positioning errors between base stations and users make it challenging to deploy trajectory planning algorithms. To address these challenges caused by position errors, a framework was proposed to compensate it by Channel Knowledge Map (CKM), which stores channel state information (CSI). By taking the positions with errors as input, the generated CKM could give a prediction of signal attenuation which is close to true positions. Based on that, the predictions are utilized to calculate the received power and a PPO-based algorithm is applied to optimize the compensation. After training, the framework is able to find a strategy that minimize the flight time under communication constraints and positioning error. Besides, the confidence interval is calculated to assist the allocation of power and the update of CKM is studied to adapt to the dynamic environment. Simulation results show the robustness of CKM to positioning error and environmental changes, and the superiority of CKM-assisted UAV communication design.</description>

      <title>Self Calibration by ON/OFF Sensitivity Switching - Feasibility Study of a Resonant Accelerometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research provides the theoretical feasibility study of a novel architecture of a MEMS differential resonant accelerometer, with switchable and tunable electrostatic transmission between the proof mass and the vibrating sensing beams. The same beams are used for sensing of the inertial force, while the transmission is switched ON, and for the device's calibration, when the transmission is OFF. Therefore, the beams' response in the OFF state is affected by the same factors (temperature, electronics, packaging) as in the ON state, with the only exception for the acceleration. This unique ability to physically disconnect the inertial force from the sensing elements opens possibilities for new schemes of the signal processing, including sensitivity tuning, zero-bias correction and on-the-fly self-calibration of the sensor. The device includes a proof mass (PM) and two force-transmitting frames that are attached to the substrate by the suspension springs, such that there is no direct mechanical connection between the PM and the frames. Two identical sensing beams are attached at their ends to the frames and the substrate. When the electrostatic transmission is switched ON by applying a voltage between the PM and frames, the force is transmitted from the PM through the frame to the beams. Disturbance in the electrostatic field, due to the acceleration-dependent displacement of the PM, results in the shift in the beam axial force and, therefore, in its resonant frequency, assuring the device's acceleration sensing. Furthermore, the change in the control voltage tunes the transmission of the input signal, and therefore the scale factor and the dynamic range of the sensor. An analytic model of the generic device is formulated and verified using finite elements analysis. The tunability of the device and the compensation of the scale factor thermal sensitivity are demonstrated using the model.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming Design for Near-Field DMA-NOMA mmWave Communications With Imperfect Position Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For millimeter-wave (mmWave) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) communication systems, we propose an innovative near-field (NF) transmission framework based on dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) technology. In this framework, a base station (BS) utilizes the DMA hybrid beamforming technology combined with the NOMA principle to maximize communication efficiency between near-field users (NUs) and far-field users (FUs). In conventional communication systems, obtaining channel state information (CSI) requires substantial pilot signals, significantly reducing system communication efficiency. We propose a beamforming design scheme based on position information to address with this challenge. This scheme does not depend on pilot signals but indirectly obtains CSI by analyzing the geometric relationship between user position information and channel models. However, in practical applications, the accuracy of position information is challenging to guarantee and may contain errors. We propose a robust beamforming design strategy based on the worst-case scenario to tackle this issue. Facing with the multi-variable coupled non-convex problems, we employ a dual-loop iterative joint optimization algorithm to update beamforming using block coordinate descent (BCD) and derive the optimal power allocation (PA) expression. We analyze its convergence and complexity to verify the proposed algorithm's performance and robustness thoroughly. We validate the theoretical derivation of the CSI error bound through simulation experiments. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme performs better than traditional beamforming schemes. Additionally, the transmission framework exhibits strong robustness to NU and FU position errors, laying a solid foundation for the practical application of mmWave NOMA communication systems.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna Enabled ISAC Beamforming Design for Low-Altitude Airborne Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mobile systems with low-altitude vehicles, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is considered an effective approach to increase the transmission rate due to limited spectrum resources. To further improve the ISAC performance, this paper proposes a novel method called integrated sensing and communication-movable antenna (ISAC-MA) to optimize the antenna's position. Our goal is to support low-space vehicles by optimizing radar and communication joint beamforming and antenna position in the presence of clutter. This scheme not only guarantees the required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for sensing but also further improves the SNR for communication. A successive convex approximation (SCA)-based block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm is proposed to maximize communication capacity under the condition of sensing SNR. Numerical results show that, compared with the traditional ISAC system and various benchmark schemes, the proposed ISAC-MA system can achieve higher communication capacity under the same sensing SNR constraints.</description>

      <title>EMF-Aware Waveform for Dual-functional Radar Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging dual-functional radar communication(RadCom) systems promise to revolutionize wireless systems by enabling radar sensing and communication on a shared platform, thereby enhancing spectral efficiency. However, the high transmit power required for efficient radar operation poses risks by potentially exceeding the electromagnetic field (EMF) exposure limits enforced by the regulations. To address this challenge, we propose an EMF-aware signalling design that enhances RadCom system performance while complying with EMF constraints. Our approach considers exposure levels not only experienced by network users but also in sensitive areas such as schools and hospitals, where the exposure must be further reduced. First, we model the exposure metric for the users and the sectors that encounter sensitive areas. Then, we design the waveform by exploiting the trade-off between radar and communication while satisfying the exposure constraints. We reformulate the problem as a convex optimization program and solve it in closed form using Karush Kuhn Tucker (KKT) conditions. The numerical results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a robust RadCom system with low electromagnetic (EM) radiations.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Representation Learning with Augmentations of Continuous Training Data Improves the Feel and Performance of Myoelectric Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pattern recognition-based myoelectric control is traditionally trained with static or ramp contractions, but this fails to capture the dynamic nature of real-world movements. This study investigated the benefits of training classifiers with continuous dynamic data, encompassing transitions between various movement classes. We employed both conventional (LDA) and deep learning (LSTM) classifiers, comparing their performance when trained with ramp data, continuous dynamic data, and continuous dynamic data augmented with a self-supervised learning technique (VICReg). An online Fitts' Law test with $20$ participants evaluated the usability and effectiveness of each classifier. Results demonstrate that temporal models, particularly LSTMs trained with continuous dynamic data, significantly outperformed traditional approaches. Furthermore, VICReg pre-training led to additional improvements in online performance and user experience. Qualitative feedback highlighted the importance of smooth, jitter-free control and consistent performance across movement classes. These findings underscore the potential of continuous dynamic data and self-supervised learning for advancing sEMG-PR-based myoelectric control, paving the way for more intuitive and user-friendly prosthetic devices.</description>

      <title>BCRLB Under the Fusion Extended Kalman Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the process of tracking multiple point targets in space using radar, since the targets are spatially well separated, the data between them will not be confused. Therefore, the multi-target tracking problem can be transformed into a single-target tracking problem. However, the data measured by radar nodes contains noise, clutter, and false targets, making it difficult for the fusion center to directly establish the association between radar measurements and real targets. To address this issue, the Probabilistic Data Association (PDA) algorithm is used to calculate the association probability between each radar measurement and the target, and the measurements are fused based on these probabilities. Finally, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to predict the target states. Additionally, we derive the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (BCRLB) under the PDA fusion framework.</description>

      <title>Joint Long-Term Processed Task and Communication Delay Optimization in UAV-Assisted MEC Systems Using DQN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) assisted by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely investigated as a promising system for future Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. In this context, delay-sensitive tasks of IoT devices may either be processed locally or offloaded for further processing to a UAV or to the cloud. This paper, by attributing task queues to each IoT device, the UAV, and the cloud, proposes a real-time resource allocation framework in a UAV-aided MEC system. Specifically, aimed at characterizing a long-term trade-off between the time-averaged aggregate processed data (PD) and the time-averaged aggregate communication delay (CD), a resource allocation optimization problem is formulated. This problem optimizes communication and computation resources as well as the UAV motion trajectory, while guaranteeing queue stability. To address this long-term time-averaged problem, a Lyapunov optimization framework is initially leveraged to obtain an equivalent short-term optimization problem. Subsequently, we reformulate the short-term problem in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) form, where a Deep Q Network (DQN) model is trained to optimize its variables. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed resource allocation scheme improves the system performance by up to 36\% compared to baseline models.</description>

Abstract: We consider the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction challenge of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems utilizing tone reservation (TR) under a sensing-enabling constraint, such that the signals placed in the reserved tones (RTs) can be exploited for Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC). To that end, the problem is first cast as an unconstrained manifold optimization problem, and then solved via an iterative projected gradient descent algorithm assisted by an approximation of the infinity norm. Simulation results show that the proposed method, while maintaining a level of PAPR reduction similar to state of the art (SotA), not only has lower computational complexity but also outperforms the alternatives in terms of sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Equivariance-based self-supervised learning for audio signal recovery from clipped measurements</title>

Abstract: &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In numerous inverse problems, state-of-the-art solving strategies involve training neural networks from ground truth and associated measurement datasets that, however, may be expensive or impossible to collect. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques have emerged, with the major advantage of no longer requiring ground truth data. Most theoretical and experimental results on self-supervised learning focus on linear inverse problems. The present work aims to study self-supervised learning for the non-linear inverse problem of recovering audio signals from clipped measurements. An equivariance-based selfsupervised loss is proposed and studied. Performance is assessed on simulated clipped measurements with controlled and varied levels of clipping, and further reported on standard real music signals. We show that the performance of the proposed equivariance-based self-supervised declipping strategy compares favorably to fully supervised learning while only requiring clipped measurements alone for training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: QUB-PHEO introduces a visual-based, dyadic dataset with the potential of advancing human-robot interaction (HRI) research in assembly operations and intention inference. This dataset captures rich multimodal interactions between two participants, one acting as a 'robot surrogate,' across a variety of assembly tasks that are further broken down into 36 distinct subtasks. With rich visual annotations, such as facial landmarks, gaze, hand movements, object localization, and more for 70 participants, QUB-PHEO offers two versions: full video data for 50 participants and visual cues for all 70. Designed to improve machine learning models for HRI, QUB-PHEO enables deeper analysis of subtle interaction cues and intentions, promising contributions to the field. The dataset will be available at https://github.com/exponentialR/QUB-PHEO subject to an End-User License Agreement (EULA).</description>

      <title>Physics Enhanced Residual Policy Learning (PERPL) for safety cruising in mixed traffic platooning under actuator and communication delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear control models have gained extensive application in vehicle control due to their simplicity, ease of use, and support for stability analysis. However, these models lack adaptability to the changing environment and multi-objective settings. Reinforcement learning (RL) models, on the other hand, offer adaptability but suffer from a lack of interpretability and generalization capabilities. This paper aims to develop a family of RL-based controllers enhanced by physics-informed policies, leveraging the advantages of both physics-based models (data-efficient and interpretable) and RL methods (flexible to multiple objectives and fast computing). We propose the Physics-Enhanced Residual Policy Learning (PERPL) framework, where the physics component provides model interpretability and stability. The learning-based Residual Policy adjusts the physics-based policy to adapt to the changing environment, thereby refining the decisions of the physics model. We apply our proposed model to decentralized control to mixed traffic platoon of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs) using a constant time gap (CTG) strategy for cruising and incorporating actuator and communication delays. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves smaller headway errors and better oscillation dampening than linear models and RL alone in scenarios with artificially extreme conditions and real preceding vehicle trajectories. At the macroscopic level, overall traffic oscillations are also reduced as the penetration rate of CAVs employing the PERPL scheme increases.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Federated Consensus Learning for Surface Defect Classification Under Data Heterogeneity in IIoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of data scarcity hinders the application of deep learning in industrial surface defect classification (SDC), as it's difficult to collect and centralize sufficient training data from various entities in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) due to privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) provides a solution by enabling collaborative global model training across clients while maintaining privacy. However, performance may suffer due to data heterogeneity--discrepancies in data distributions among clients. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized FL (PFL) approach, named Adversarial Federated Consensus Learning (AFedCL), for the challenge of data heterogeneity across different clients in SDC. First, we develop a dynamic consensus construction strategy to mitigate the performance degradation caused by data heterogeneity. Through adversarial training, local models from different clients utilize the global model as a bridge to achieve distribution alignment, alleviating the problem of global knowledge forgetting. Complementing this strategy, we propose a consensus-aware aggregation mechanism. It assigns aggregation weights to different clients based on their efficacy in global knowledge learning, thereby enhancing the global model's generalization capabilities. Finally, we design an adaptive feature fusion module to further enhance global knowledge utilization efficiency. Personalized fusion weights are gradually adjusted for each client to optimally balance global and local features, tailored to their individual global knowledge learning efficacy. Compared with state-of-the-art FL methods like FedALA, the proposed AFedCL method achieves an accuracy increase of up to 5.67% on three SDC datasets.</description>

      <title>Microwave photonic frequency measurement and time-frequency analysis: Unlocking bandwidths over hundreds of GHz with a 10-nanosecond temporal resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and broadband spectrum sensing is an essential component in cognitive radio systems, intelligent transportation systems, electronic warfare systems, etc. However, traditional electronic-based solutions have a trade-off among the analysis bandwidth, temporal resolution, and real-time performance. In comparison, microwave photonic solutions can overcome the trade-off at the cost of frequency accuracy and resolution. Nevertheless, the reported microwave photonic solutions suffer from a very poor frequency resolution and impose extremely high requirements on hardware when the analysis bandwidth is close to or greater than 100 GHz. Here, we show a microwave photonic frequency measurement and time-frequency analysis method, which is implemented by dispersion-based frequency-to-time mapping and assisted by a specially designed V-shape linearly frequency-modulated signal and a duty-cycle-enabling technique. Compared with the reported microwave photonic solutions, the hardware requirements are greatly reduced when achieving similar performance conditions. Using a total dispersion of -6817 ps/nm and a V-shape linearly frequency-modulated signal with a bandwidth of 31.6 GHz and a duty cycle of 1/4, we achieve an ambiguity-free analysis bandwidth of 252.8 GHz, a corresponding temporal resolution of 13.75 ns and a frequency resolution of 1.1 GHz. The temporal resolution can be improved to 6.875 ns when the duty cycle is changed to 1/2, while the analysis bandwidth in this case is 126.4 GHz.</description>

      <title>Exploring VQ-VAE with Prosody Parameters for Speaker Anonymization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human speech conveys prosody, linguistic content, and speaker identity. This article investigates a novel speaker anonymization approach using an end-to-end network based on a Vector-Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder (VQ-VAE) to deal with these speech components. This approach is designed to disentangle these components to specifically target and modify the speaker identity while preserving the linguistic and emotionalcontent. To do so, three separate branches compute embeddings for content, prosody, and speaker identity respectively. During synthesis, taking these embeddings, the decoder of the proposed architecture is conditioned on both speaker and prosody information, allowing for capturing more nuanced emotional states and precise adjustments to speaker identification. Findings indicate that this method outperforms most baseline techniques in preserving emotional information. However, it exhibits more limited performance on other voice privacy tasks, emphasizing the need for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Interpolation filter design for sample rate independent audio effect RNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are effective at emulating the non-linear, stateful behavior of analog guitar amplifiers and distortion effects. Unlike the case of direct circuit simulation, RNNs have a fixed sample rate encoded in their model weights, making the sample rate non-adjustable during inference. Recent work has proposed increasing the sample rate of RNNs at inference (oversampling) by increasing the feedback delay length in samples, using a fractional delay filter for non-integer conversions. Here, we investigate the task of lowering the sample rate at inference (undersampling), and propose using an extrapolation filter to approximate the required fractional signal advance. We consider two filter design methods and analyze the impact of filter order on audio quality. Our results show that the correct choice of filter can give high quality results for both oversampling and undersampling; however, in some cases the sample rate adjustment leads to unwanted artefacts in the output signal. We analyse these failure cases through linearised stability analysis, showing that they result from instability around a fixed point. This approach enables an informed prediction of suitable interpolation filters for a given RNN model before runtime.</description>

Abstract: 6G network technology will emerge in a landscape where visual data transmissions dominate global mobile traffic and are expected to grow continuously, driven by the increasing demand for AI-based computer vision applications. This will make already challenging task of visual data transmission even more difficult. In this work, we review effective techniques for visual data transmission, such as content compression and adaptive video streaming, highlighting their advantages and limitations. Further, considering the scalability and cost issues of cloud-based and on-device AI services, we explore distributed in-network computing architecture like fog-computing as a direction of 6G networks, and investigate the necessary technical properties for the timely delivery of visual data.</description>

      <title>TE-PINN: Quaternion-Based Orientation Estimation using Transformer-Enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Transformer-Enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Network (TE-PINN) designed for accurate quaternion-based orientation estimation in high-dynamic environments, particularly within the field of robotics. By integrating transformer networks with physics-informed learning, our approach innovatively captures temporal dependencies in sensor data while enforcing the fundamental physical laws governing rotational motion. TE-PINN leverages a multi-head attention mechanism to handle sequential data from inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, ensuring temporal consistency. Simultaneously, the model embeds quaternion kinematics and rigid body dynamics into the learning process, aligning the network's predictions with mechanical principles like Euler's laws of motion. The physics-informed loss function incorporates the dynamics of angular velocity and external forces, enhancing the network's ability to generalize in complex scenarios. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that TE-PINN consistently outperforms traditional methods such as Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) and LSTM-based estimators, particularly in scenarios characterized by high angular velocities and noisy sensor data. The results show a significant reduction in mean quaternion error and improved gyroscope bias estimation compared to the state-of-the-art. An ablation study further isolates the contributions of both the transformer architecture and the physics-informed constraints, highlighting the synergistic effect of both components in improving model performance. The proposed model achieves real-time performance on embedded systems typical of mobile robots, offering a scalable and efficient solution for orientation estimation in autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Age of Gossip in Networks with Multiple Views of a Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the version age of information (AoI) in a network where a subset of nodes act as sensing nodes, sampling a source that in general can follow a continuous distribution. Any sample of the source constitutes a new version of the information and the version age of the information is defined with respect to the most recent version of the information available for the whole network. We derive a recursive expression for the average version AoI between different subsets of the nodes which can be used to evaluate the average version AoI for any subset of the nodes including any single node. We derive asymptotic behavior of the average AoI on any single node of the network for various topologies including line, ring, and fully connected networks. The prior art result on version age of a network by Yates [ISIT'21] can be interpreted as in our derivation as a network with a single view of the source, e.g., through a Poisson process with rate $\lambda_{00}$. Our result indicates that there is no loss in the average version AoI performance by replacing a single view of the source with distributed sensing across multiple nodes by splitting the same rate $\lambda_{00}$. Particularly, we show that asymptotically, the average AoI scales with $O(\log(n))$ and $O(\sqrt{n})$ for fully connected and ring networks, respectively. More interestingly, we show that for the ring network the same $O(\sqrt{n})$ asymptotical performance on average AoI is still achieved with distributed sensing if the number of sensing nodes only scales with $O(\sqrt{n})$ instead of prior known result which requires $O(n)$. Our results indicate that the sensing nodes can be arbitrarily chosen as long as the maximum number of consecutive non-sensing nodes also scales as $O(\sqrt{n})$.</description>

      <title>Robust Wideband Channel Estimation for mmWave Massive MIMO Systems With Beam Squint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.02196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the robust wideband channel estimation problem in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In such a scenario, the beam squint effect that the array response vectors vary with different frequencies and the impulsive noise are in existence, which pose great challenges for accurate channel estimation. Directly applying the existing channel estimation methods usually suffers significant performance degradation, since they are proposed based on the assumptions of frequency-invariant array response vectors and Gaussian distributed noise. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel wideband channel estimation method with robustness to impulsive noise. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates a cyclic refinement step to overcome the estimation inaccuracy caused by the greedy nature of matching-pursuit-esque algorithms. In particular, the generalized $\ell_p$-norm minimization criterion is adopted in Newton's method to improve the performance robustness against the non-Gaussian impulsive noise. Numerical results are provided to verify the superior performance of the proposed method over the existing representative benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05743v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a generative AI approach to probabilistic forecasting of real-time electricity market signals, including locational marginal prices, interregional price spreads, and demand-supply imbalances. We present WIAE-GPF, a Weak Innovation AutoEncoder-based Generative Probabilistic Forecasting architecture that generates future samples of multivariate time series. Unlike traditional black-box models, WIAE-GPF offers interpretability through the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation for nonparametric time series, making it a nonparametric generalization of the Wiener/Kalman filter-based forecasting. A novel learning algorithm with structural convergence guarantees is proposed, ensuring that, under ideal training conditions, the generated forecast samples match the ground truth conditional probability distribution. Extensive tests using publicly available data from U.S. independent system operators under various point and probabilistic forecasting metrics demonstrate that WIAE-GPF consistently outperforms classical methods and cutting-edge machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Achieving Distributed MIMO Performance with Repeater-Assisted Cellular Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In what ways could cellular massive MIMO be improved? This technology has already been shown to bring huge performance gains. However, coverage holes and difficulties to transmit multiple streams to multi-antenna users because of insufficient channel rank remain issues. Distributed MIMO, also known as cell-free massive MIMO, might be the ultimate solution. However, while being a powerful technology, it is expensive to install backhaul, and it is a difficult problem to achieve accurate phase alignment for coherent multiuser beamforming on downlink. Another option is reflective intelligent surfaces -- but they have large form factors and require a lot of training and control overhead, and probably, in practice, some form of active filtering to make them sufficiently band-selective.
  We propose a new approach to densification of cellular systems, envisioning repeater-assisted cellular massive MIMO, where a large numbers of physically small and cheap wireless repeaters are deployed. They receive and retransmit signals instantaneously, appearing as ordinary scatterers in the channel but with amplification. We elaborate on the requirements of such repeaters, show that the performance of these systems could potentially approach that of distributed MIMO, and outline future research directions.</description>

Abstract: Expected to provide higher transportation efficiency and security, autonomous driving has attracted substantial attentions from both industry and academia. Meanwhile, the emergence of edge intelligence has further introduced significant advancements to this field. However, the crucial demands of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) among the vehicles and edge servers have hindered the development of autonomous driving. In this article, we provide a brief overview of edge intelligence enabled autonomous driving system and current vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies. Moreover, challenges associated with massive data transmission in autonomous driving are highlighted from three perspectives: multi-modal data transmission and fusion, multi-user collaboration and connection, and multi-task training and execution. To cope with these challenges, we propose to incorporate semantic communication into autonomous driving to achieve highly efficient and task-oriented data transmission. Unlike traditional communications, semantic communication extracts task-relevant semantic feature from multi-sensory data. Specifically, a unified multi-user semantic communication system for transmitting multi-modal data and performing multi-task execution is designed for collaborative data transmission and decision making in autonomous driving. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system can significantly reduce data transmission volume without compromising task performance, as evidenced by the realization of a cooperative multi-vehicle target classification and detection task.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Low-Complexity, Non-Linear Processing for MU-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14982</link>

Abstract: Non-linear detection schemes can substantially improve the achievable throughput and connectivity capabilities of uplink MU-MIMO systems that employ linear detection. However, the complexity requirements of existing non-linear soft detectors that provide substantial gains compared to linear ones are at least an order of magnitude more complex, making their adoption challenging. In particular, joint soft information computation involves solving multiple vector minimization problems, each with a complexity that scales exponentially with the number of users. This work introduces a novel ultra-low-complexity, non-linear detection scheme that performs joint Detection and Approximate Reliability Estimation (DARE). For the first time, DARE can substantially improve the achievable throughput (e.g., 40%) with less than 2x the complexity of linear MMSE, making non-linear processing extremely practical. To enable this, DARE includes a novel procedure to approximate the reliability of the received bits based on the region of the received observable that can efficiently approach the accurately calculated soft detection performance. In addition, we show that DARE can achieve a better throughput than linear detection when using just half the base station antennas, resulting in substantial power savings (e.g., 500 W). Consequently, DARE is a very strong candidate for future power-efficient MU-MIMO developments, even in the case of software-based implementations, as in the case of emerging Open-RAN systems. Furthermore, DARE can achieve the throughput of the state-of-the-art non-linear detectors with complexity requirements that are orders of magnitude lower.</description>

      <title>NL-COMM: Demonstrating Gains of Non-Linear Processing in Open-RAN Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-user multiple-input, multiple-output (MU-MIMO) designs can substantially increase wireless systems' achievable throughput and connectivity capabilities. However, existing MU-MIMO deployments typically utilize linear processing techniques that, despite their practical benefits, such as low computational complexity and easy integrability, can leave much of the available throughput and connectivity gains unexploited. They typically require many power-intensive antennas and RF chains to support a smaller number of MIMO streams, even when the transmitted information streams are of low rate. Alternatively, non-linear (NL) processing methods can maximize the capabilities of the MIMO channel. Despite their potential, traditional NL methods are challenged by high computational complexity and processing latency, making them impractical for real-time applications, especially in software-based systems envisioned for emerging Open Radio Access Networks (Open-RAN). Additionally, essential functionalities such as rate adaptation (RA) are currently unavailable for NL systems, limiting their practicality in real-world deployments. In this demo, we present the latest capabilities of our advanced NL processing framework (NL-COMM) in real-time and over-the-air, comparing them side-by-side with conventional linear processing. For the first time, NL-COMM not only meets the practical 5G-NR real-time latency requirements in pure software but also does so within a standard-compliant ecosystem. To achieve this, we significantly extended the NL-COMM algorithmic framework to support the first practical RA for NL processing. The demonstrated gains include enhanced connectivity by supporting four MIMO streams with a single base-station antenna, substantially increased throughput, and the ability to halve the number of base-station antennas without any performance loss to linear approaches.</description>

      <title>Anti-jamming Transmission of Downlink Cell Free Millimeter-Wave MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, the maximization of resistible jamming power is studied for multi-user downlink millimeter-wave cell-free multiple-input-multiple-output (CF-MIMO) systems. We propose an alternate optimization-based anti-jamming hybrid beamforming (AO-AJHBF) scheme. For receiving beamforming, more practical prior about the jamming channel, i.e., second-order statistics rather than instantaneous information, is exploited via maximizing the generalized Rayleigh quotient. For transmitting beamforming, we use the max-min fairness principle and propose a low-complexity projected gradient ascent-based method to circumvent the excessive computation of semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Simulations verify the performance advantage of proposed AO-AJHBF over schemes based on weighted minimum mean square error and SDR methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To ensure consistent navigation services despite GNSS signal disruptions, Korea is developing the R-Mode system. This study focuses on enhancing the simulation accuracy of the MF R-Mode system's performance by integrating data from the Eocheong transmitter with existing data from the Palmi and Chungju transmitters. Additional measurements from these three transmitters were gathered using the DARBS receiver to model the Time-of-Arrival(TOA) variance. Analysis of this data facilitated the calculation of new constants and transmitter specific jitter values, which were then used to determine coverage areas based on the updated parameters.</description>

      <title>Enhanced RMT estimator for signal number estimation in the presence of colored noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subspace-based techniques are widely utilized to estimate the parameters of sums of complex sinusoids corrupted by noise, and they need accurate estimation of the signal subspace dimension. The classic RMT estimator for model order estimation based on random matrix theory (RMT) assumes that the noise is white Gaussian, and performs poorly in the presence of colored noise with unknown covariance matrix. In order to deal with this problem, this paper proposes a novel algorithm to estimate the number of signals for the case of colored noise with unknown covariance matrix based on the analysis of the behavior of information theoretic criteria utilized in model order selection. Firstly, a first criterion is defined as the ratio of the current eigenvalue and the mean of the next ones, and its properties is analyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Secondly, a second criterion is designed as the ratio of the current value and the next value of the first criterion, and its properties is analyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Then, a novel enhanced RMT estimator is proposed for signal number estimation by analyzing the detection properties among the signal number estimates obtained by these two criteria and the RMT estimator to determine which eigenvalue is arising from a signal. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate that the proposed enhanced RMT estimator has better estimation performance and works better in the presence of colored noise than the existing methods.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Blind Beamforming for Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Configuring intelligent surface (IS) or passive antenna array without any channel knowledge, namely blind beamforming, is a frontier research topic in the wireless communication field. Existing methods in the previous literature for blind beamforming include the RFocus and the CSM, the effectiveness of which has been demonstrated on hardware prototypes. However, this paper points out a subtle issue with these blind beamforming algorithms: the RFocus and the CSM may fail to work in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) channel case. To address this issue, we suggest a grouping strategy that enables adaptive blind beamforming. Specifically, the reflective elements (REs) of the IS are divided into three groups; each group is configured randomly to obtain a dataset of random samples. We then extract the statistical feature of the wireless environment from the random samples, thereby coordinating phase shifts of the IS without channel acquisition. The RE grouping plays a critical role in guaranteeing performance gain in the NLoS case. In particular, if we place all the REs in the same group, the proposed algorithm would reduce to the RFocus and the CSM. We validate the advantage of the proposed blind beamforming algorithm in the real-world networks at 3.5 GHz aside from simulations.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Near-Field Sensing (NISE) in Wideband MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The performance of near-field sensing (NISE) in a legacy wideband multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) communication systems is analyzed. The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) for the target's distance and angle relative to the antenna array are derived. To evaluate the estimation error, closed-form analytical expressions of Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) are derived for both uniform linear arrays (ULAs) and uniform circular arrays (UCAs). The asymptotic CRBs are then analyzed to reveal the scaling laws of CRBs with respect to key system parameters, including array size, bandwidth, and target distance. Our results reveal that 1) the mean-squared error achieved by MLEs approaches CRBs in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime; 2) a larger array aperture does not necessarily improve NISE performance, especially with ultra-large bandwidth; 3) large bandwidth sets an estimation error ceiling for NISE as target distance increases; 4) array aperture and bandwidth, rather than the number of antennas and subcarriers, are the key factors affecting wideband NISE performance; and 5) UCAs offer superior, angle-independent wideband NISE performance compared to ULAs with the same aperture.</description>

      <title>Phoneme Discretized Saliency Maps for Explainable Detection of AI-Generated Voice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Phoneme Discretized Saliency Maps (PDSM), a discretization algorithm for saliency maps that takes advantage of phoneme boundaries for explainable detection of AI-generated voice. We experimentally show with two different Text-to-Speech systems (i.e., Tacotron2 and Fastspeech2) that the proposed algorithm produces saliency maps that result in more faithful explanations compared to standard posthoc explanation methods. Moreover, by associating the saliency maps to the phoneme representations, this methodology generates explanations that tend to be more understandable than standard saliency maps on magnitude spectrograms.</description>

      <title>Quantifying uncertainty in area and regression coefficient estimation from remote sensing maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing map products are used to obtain estimates of environmental quantities, such as deforested area or the effect of conservation zones on deforestation. However, the quality of map products varies, and - because maps are outputs of complex machine learning algorithms that take in a variety of remotely sensed variables as inputs - errors are difficult to characterize. Thus, population-level estimates from such maps may be biased. In this paper, we compare several uncertainty quantification methods - stratified estimator, post-stratified estimator, and prediction-powered inference - that combine a small amount of randomly sampled ground truth data with large-scale remote sensing map products to generate unbiased estimates. Applying these methods across four remote sensing use cases in area and regression coefficient estimation, we find that they result in estimates that are more reliable than using the map product as if it were 100% accurate and have lower uncertainty than using only the ground truth and ignoring the map product. Prediction-powered inference uses ground truth data to correct for bias in the map product estimate and (unlike stratification) does not require us to choose a map product before sampling. This is the first work to (1) apply prediction-powered inference to remote sensing estimation tasks, and (2) perform uncertainty quantification on remote sensing regression coefficients without assumptions on the structure of map product errors. To improve the utility of machine learning-generated remote sensing maps for downstream applications, we recommend that map producers provide a randomly sampled holdout ground truth dataset to be used for calibration in uncertainty quantification alongside their maps. Data and code are available at https://github.com/Earth-Intelligence-Lab/uncertainty-quantification.</description>

      <title>MDS-ED: Multimodal Decision Support in the Emergency Department -- a Benchmark Dataset for Diagnoses and Deterioration Prediction in Emergency Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: A clinically meaningful comparative assessment of medical decision support in emergency care is challenging due to a lack of appropriate datasets with multimodal input modalities and comprehensive prediction task. This hampers measurable progress in the field.
  Results: We introduce a dataset based on MIMIC-IV, a benchmarking protocol, and initial results for evaluating multimodal decision support in the emergency department (ED). We use diverse data modalities from the first 1.5 hours after patient arrival, including demographics, biometrics, vital signs, lab values, and electrocardiogram waveforms. We analyze 1443 clinical labels across two contexts: predicting diagnoses and patient deterioration. Our diagnostic model achieves an AUROC score over 0.8 in a statistically significant manner for 609 out of 1428 conditions, including cardiac conditions like myocardial infarction and non-cardiac conditions such as renal disease and diabetes. The deterioration model scores above 0.8 in a statistically significant manner for 14 out of 15 targets, including critical events like cardiac arrest, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission, as well as short- and long-term mortality. Furthermore, we provide one of the first robust demonstrations of the significant impact of raw waveform input data on model performance.
  Conclusions: This study highlights the proposed dataset as a unique resource to foster progress towards measurable progress in the domain of algorithmic decision support in emergency care. The presented multimodal baseline models showcase the potential of diagnostic decision support in the field and provide strong incentives for including raw waveform data.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting for Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Performance Analysis and Generative AI Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) provides a ubiquitous coverage to user equipments (UEs) but it is also susceptible to interference. Ratesplitting (RS) effectively extracts data by decoding interference, yet its effectiveness is limited by the weakest UE. In this paper, we investigate an RS-based CF massive MIMO system, which combines strengths and mitigates weaknesses of both approaches. Considering imperfect channel state information (CSI) resulting from both pilot contamination and noise, we derive a closed-form expression for the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the RS-based CF massive MIMO system under a spatially correlated Rician channel. Moreover, we propose low-complexity heuristic algorithms based on statistical CSI for power-splitting of common messages and power-control of private messages, and genetic algorithm is adopted as a solution for upper bound performance. Furthermore, we formulate a joint optimization problem, aiming to maximize the sum SE of the RS-based CF massive MIMO system by optimizing the power-splitting factor and power-control coefficient. Importantly, we improve a generative AI (GAI) algorithm to address this complex and nonconvexity problem by using a diffusion model to obtain solutions. Simulation results demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality in mitigating interference, especially in dynamic environments.</description>
