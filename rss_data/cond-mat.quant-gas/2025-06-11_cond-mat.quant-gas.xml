      <title>Wave-function microscopy: Derivation and anatomy of exact algebraic spinful wave functions and full Wigner-molecular spectra of a few highly correlated rapidly rotating ultracold fermionic atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring strongly correlated spinful states of few fermionic ultracold atoms in a rapidly rotating trap, an example of which was recently realized for two fermionic $^6$Li atoms in an optical tweezer, we derive analytical (algebraic) total-spin-eigenstate wavefunctions through the development and employment of a theoretical platform that integrates exact numerical diagonalization (full configuration interaction, FCI) with symbolic language processing. For such rapid rotations, where the atoms occupy the lowest Landau level (LLL), the obtained algebraic expressions can address the full LLL spectrum in all its complexity, demonstrating that their spatial, spectral, and spin characteristics manifest formation of collectively rotating and vibrating Wigner molecules. The explicitly exhibited analytic wavefunctions (for two and three spinful $^6$Li atoms) reproduce precisely the corresponding numerical FCI results, and they are shown to reach beyond the limited range of applicability of previous Jastrow-type treatments. These results, and their extension to bosonic systems, provide the impetus and analysis tools for future experimental and theoretical simulations of larger mesoscopic systems</description>

      <title>Rogue waves collision under incident momentum modulation in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collision dynamics of two first-order rogue waves (RWs) with opposite incident momentum in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) is studied by solving the two-component one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. It is demonstrated that the introduction of appropriate incident momentum successfully promotes the generation of second-order RWs in the case of relatively weaker interspecies interactions compared to intraspecific interactions. The range of incident momentum that can facilitate the generation of second-order RWs under different interspecies interaction strengths is determined, and machine learning is employed to find and analyze relationships among the interspecies interaction, the incident momentum, and the offset that can lead to the generation of second-order RWs. It shows that any two parameters above exhibit a positive or negative correlation when the third parameter is fixed. These findings provide additional possibilities for generating and controlling high-order RWs.</description>

      <title>Light-induced localized vortices in multicomponent Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study continuous interaction of a trapped two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with light fields in a $\Lambda$-type configuration. Using light beams with orbital angular momentum, we theoretically show how to create a stable, pinned vortex configuration, where the rotating component is confined to the region surrounded by the second, non-rotating component. The atoms constituting this vortex can be localized in volumes much smaller than the volume occupied by the second component. The position of the vortex can be robustly changed by moving the laser beams as long as the beam movement speed is below the speed of sound.</description>

      <title>Dissipationless tune-out trapping for a lanthanide-alkali quantum gas mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gas mixtures offer a wide field of research, ranging from few-body physics of impurities to many-body physics with emergent long-range interactions and ultracold molecular gases. Achieving precision control of mixtures is much harder than for single-component gases and, consequently, the respective techniques are less developed. Here we report on a decisive step forward in this direction by realizing dissipationless and fully differential optical control of the motional degrees of freedom of one of the species without affecting the other. This is achieved in a novel Bose-Fermi mixture with extreme mass imbalance, erbium-166 and lithium-6. Our experiments pave the way to a new generation of precision many-body experiments with quantum gas mixtures with unprecedented long lifetimes and low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Mediated Gas-Liquid Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place after the system becomes superradiant at a finite pumping strength. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Topological Invariants in Nonlinear Thouless Pumping of Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent explorations of quantized solitons transport in optical waveguides have thrust nonlinear topological pumping into the spotlight. In this work, we introduce a unified topological invariant applicable across both weakly and strongly nonlinear regimes. In the weak nonlinearity regime, where the nonlinear bands are wellseparated, the invariant reduces to the Abelian Chern number of the occupied nonlinear band. Consequently, the pumped charge is quantized to an integer value. As the nonlinearity increases, the nonlinear bands start to intertwine, leading to a situation where the invariant is expressed as the non-Abelian Chern number divided by the number of interacting bands. This could result in a fractional quantization of the pumped charge. Our unified topological invariant approach not only advances the understanding of the soliton dynamics, but also provides implications for the future design of nonlinear topological systems.</description>

      <title>Isotope-agnostic motional ground-state cooling of neutral Yb atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient high-fidelity ground-state cooling of motional degrees of freedom is crucial for applications in quantum simulation, computing and metrology. Here, we demonstrate direct ground-state cooling of fermionic $^{171}$Yb and bosonic $^{174}$Yb atoms in two- and three-dimensional magic-wavelength optical lattices on the ultranarrow clock transition. Its high spectral resolution offers the potential for reaching extremely low temperatures. To ensure efficient cooling, we develop a chirped sideband cooling scheme, where we sweep the clock-laser frequency to mitigate the effects of spatial trap inhomogeneities. We further generalize the theoretical description of sideband spectra to higher-dimensional lattices for precise thermometry. We achieve 2D ground state fractions of $97\%$ for $^{171}$Yb with an average motional occupation of $\bar{n}\simeq0.015$ and provide a direct comparison with $^{174}$Yb, reaching similar cooling performance. Applying the same scheme in 3D results in $\bar{n}\simeq0.15$ limited by layer-to-layer inhomogeneities in the vertical direction. These results demonstrate efficient motional ground-state cooling in optical lattices, especially for bosonic alkaline-earth(-like) atoms, where other methods are not applicable, opening the door to novel protocols for quantum science applications with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Fate of chiral order and impurity self-pinning in flat bands with local symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interacting bosons on a single plaquette threaded by a $\pi$-flux can spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry, resulting in a chiral loop current. Connecting such bosonic $\pi$-flux plaquettes in a dispersive configuration was recently shown to lead to long-range chiral order. Here, instead, we design a chain of $\pi$-flux plaquettes that exhibits an all-flat-bands single-particle energy spectrum and an extensive set of local symmetries. Using Elitzur's theorem, we show that these local symmetries prevent the emergence of long-range chiral order. Moreover, projecting the dynamics to a Creutz ladder model with an effective intra-rung interaction allows one to derive simple spin Hamiltonians capturing the ground state degeneracy and the low-energy excitations, and to confirm the absence of chiral order. Nevertheless, we show how to obtain gauge-invariant information from a mean-field approach, which explicitly break gauge-invaraince. Finally, we observe an ``impurity self-pinning'' phenomenon, when an extra boson is added on top of a ground state at integer filling, resulting in a non-dispersive density peak. Exact diagonalization benchmarks are also provided, and experimental perspectives are discussed.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Bose-Einstein condensates at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the geometric quantum complexity of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) at finite temperature. Specifically, we use the Bures and Sj\"oqvist metrics -- generalizations of the Fubini-Study metric for mixed quantum states, as well as the Nielsen geometric complexity approach based on purification of mixed states. Starting from the Bogoliubov Hamiltonian of BEC, which exhibits an $SU(1,1)$ symmetry, we explicitly derive and compare the complexities arising from these three distinct measures. For the Bures and Sj\"oqvist metrics, analytical and numerical evaluations of the corresponding geodesics are provided, revealing characteristic scaling behaviors with respect to temperature. In the Nielsen complexity approach, we rigorously handle the gauge freedoms associated with mixed state purification and non-uniqueness unitary operations, demonstrating that the resulting complexity aligns precisely with the Bures metric. Our work provides a comparative study of the geometric complexity of finite-temperature Bose-Einstein condensates, revealing its intimate connections to symmetry structures and temperature effects in BEC systems.</description>

      <title>Expansion-contraction duality breaking in a Planck-scale sensitive cosmological quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the experimental simulation of cosmological perturbations governed by a Planck-scale induced Lorentz violating dispersion, aimed at distinguishing between early-universe models with similar power spectra. Employing a novel variant of the scaling approach for the evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate with both contact and dipolar interactions, we show that scale invariance, and in turn, the duality of the power spectrum is broken at large momenta for an inflating gas, and at small momenta for a contracting gas. We thereby furnish a Planck-scale sensitive approach to analogue quantum cosmology that can readily be implemented in the quantum gas laboratory.</description>
