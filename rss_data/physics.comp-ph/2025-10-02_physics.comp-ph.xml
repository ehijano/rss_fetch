      <title>Hybrid Delta Tracking Schemes Using a Track-Length Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations, Woodcock-delta tracking is a common alternative to the more popular surface tracking technique. In this work we introduce a delta-tracking algorithm that tallies fluxes to a structured rectilinear mesh using the track-length estimator. This development also enables hybrid surface-delta tracking algorithms, because the track-length tally can be used everywhere for scalar flux estimation regardless of which tracking algorithm is employed. We use this tallying technique to develop a novel hybrid-in-energy method. We also implement a hybrid-in-material method, like what is implemented in Serpent2. We demonstrate that these delta tracking algorithms can be used in conjunction with continuously moving surfaces. We compare these methods showing figures of merit on four time-dependent problems (multi-group and continuous energy) solved with CPU- and GPU-based computers. Our implementation of delta tracking with a track length tally modestly improves figures of merit compared to standard delta tracking with a collision estimator and surface tracking with a track length estimator (1.5X 2.5X) for a problem with significant void regions. For both multi-group and continuous energy pressurized water reactor benchmarks, standard delta tracking with a collision estimator performs best. Hybrid-in-energy methods show significant improvements (7X-11X) for a continuous energy reactor benchmark problem.</description>

      <title>Instabilities and Phase Transformations in Architected Metamaterials: a Gradient-Enhanced Continuum Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Architected metamaterials such as foams and lattices exhibit a wide range of properties governed by microstructural instabilities and emerging phase transformations. Their macroscopic response--including energy dissipation during impact, large recoverable deformations, morphing between configurations, and auxetic behavior--remains difficult to capture with conventional continuum models, which often rely on discrete approaches that limit scalability. We propose a nonlocal continuum formulation that captures both stable and unstable responses of elastic architected metamaterials. The framework extends anisotropic hyperelasticity by introducing nonlocal variables and internal length scales reflective of microstructural features. Local polyconvex free-energy models are systematically augmented with two families of non-(poly)convex energies, enabling both metastable and bistable responses. Implementation in a finite element framework enables solution using a hybrid monolithic--staggered strategy. Simulations capture densification fronts, forward and reverse transformations, hysteresis loops, imperfection sensitivity, and globally coordinated auxetic modes. Overall, this framework provides a robust foundation for accelerated modeling of instability-driven phenomena in architected materials, while enabling extensions to anisotropic, dissipative, and active systems as well as integration with data-driven and machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Chase Orbits, not Time: A Scalable Paradigm for Long-Duration Eccentric Gravitational-Wave Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00116v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surrogate modeling of eccentric binary black hole waveforms has remained challenging. The complicated morphology of these waveforms due to the eccentric orbital timescale variations makes it difficult to construct accurate and efficient surrogate models, especially for waveforms long enough to cover the sensitivity band of the current ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We present a novel and scalable surrogate building technique which makes surrogate modeling of long-duration eccentric binary black hole waveforms both feasible and highly efficient. The technique aims to simplify the harmonic content of the intermediate eccentric surrogate data pieces by modeling them in terms of an angular orbital element called the mean anomaly, instead of time. We show that this novel parameterization yields an order of magnitude fewer surrogate basis functions than using the contemporary parameterization in terms of time. We show that variations in surrogate data-pieces across parameter space become much more regular when expressed in terms of the instantaneous waveform eccentricity and mean anomaly, greatly easing their parameter-space fitting. The methods presented in this work make it feasible to build long-duration eccentric surrogates for the current as well as future third-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>BigBang-Proton Technical Report: Next-Word-Prediction is Scientific Multitask Learner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure, cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization; Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures. Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates 100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction, and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational model.</description>

      <title>Electron neural closure for turbulent magnetosheath simulations: energy channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a non-local five-moment electron pressure tensor closure parametrized by a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN). Electron pressure plays an important role in generalized Ohm's law, competing with electron inertia. This model is used in the development of a surrogate model for a fully kinetic energy-conserving semi-implicit Particle-in-Cell simulation of decaying magnetosheath turbulence. We achieve this by training FCNN on a representative set of simulations with a smaller number of particles per cell and showing that our results generalise to a simulation with a large number of particles per cell. We evaluate the statistical properties of the learned equation of state, with a focus on pressure-strain interaction, which is crucial for understanding energy channels in turbulent plasmas. The resulting equation of state learned via FCNN significantly outperforms local closures, such as those learned by Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or double adiabatic expressions. We report that the overall spatial distribution of pressure-strain and its conditional averages are reconstructed well. However, some small-scale features are missed, especially for the off-diagonal components of the pressure tensor. Nevertheless, the results are substantially improved with more training data, indicating favorable scaling and potential for improvement, which will be addressed in future work.</description>

      <title>Correlation function metrology for warm dense matter: Recent developments and practical guidelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) has emerged as a valuable diagnostic for matter under extreme conditions, as it captures the intricate many-body physics of the probed sample. Recent advances, such as the model-free temperature diagnostic of Dornheim et al. [Nat.Commun. 13, 7911 (2022)], have demonstrated how much information can be extracted directly within the imaginary-time formalism. However, since the imaginary-time formalism is a concept often difficult to grasp, we provide here a systematic overview of its theoretical foundations and explicitly demonstrate its practical applications to temperature inference, including relevant subtleties. Furthermore, we present recent developments that enable the determination of the absolute normalization, Rayleigh weight, and density from XRTS measurements without reliance on uncontrolled model assumptions. Finally, we outline a unified workflow that guides the extraction of these key observables, offering a practical framework for applying the method to interpret experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>FourPhonon_GPU: A GPU-accelerated framework for calculating phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting phonon scattering is crucial for understanding thermal transport properties. However, the computational cost of such calculations, especially for four-phonon scattering, can often be more prohibitive when large number of phonon branches and scattering processes are involved. In this work, we present FourPhonon_GPU, a GPU-accelerated framework for three-phonon and four-phonon scattering rate calculations based on the FourPhonon package. By leveraging OpenACC and adopting a heterogeneous CPU-GPU computing strategy, we efficiently offload massive, parallelizable tasks to the GPU while using the CPU for process enumeration and control-heavy operations. Our approach achieves over 25x acceleration for the scattering rate computation step and over 10x total runtime speedup without sacrificing accuracy. Benchmarking on various GPU architectures confirms the method's scalability and highlights the importance of aligning parallelization strategies with hardware capabilities. This work provides an efficient and accurate computational tool for phonon transport modeling and opens pathways for accelerated materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Bayesian power spectral density estimation for LISA noise based on P-splines with a parametric boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible and efficient noise characterization is crucial for the precise estimation of gravitational wave parameters. We introduce a fast and accurate Bayesian method for estimating the power spectral density (PSD) of long, stationary time series tailored specifically for LISA data analysis. Our approach models the PSD as a geometric mean of a parametric and a nonparametric component, combining the computational efficiency of parametric models with the flexibility to capture deviations from theoretical expectations. The nonparametric component is expressed by a mixture of penalized B-splines. Adaptive, data-driven knot placement performed once during initialization eliminates computationally expensive reversible-jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo, while hierarchical roughness penalty priors prevent overfitting. This design yields stable, flexible PSD estimates with runtimes of minutes instead of hours. Validation on simulated autoregressive AR(4) data demonstrates estimator consistency. It shows that well-matched parametric components reduce the integrated absolute error compared to an uninformative baseline, requiring fewer spline knots to achieve comparable accuracy. Applied to a year of simulated LISA $X$-channel noise, our method achieves relative integrated absolute errors of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ with computation times less than three minutes, which makes it suitable for iterative analysis pipelines and multi-year mission datasets.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine (PIELM) for Tunnelling-Induced Soil-Pile Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning systems in geotechnical engineering.</description>

      <title>Kinetic closure of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a kinetic closure of the filtered Boltzmann-BGK equation, paving the way towards an alternative description of turbulence. The closure naturally incorporates the turbulent subfilter stress tensor without the need for explicit modeling, unlike in Navier-Stokes models. In contrast, it accounts for the subfilter turbulent diffusion in the nonconserved moments by generalizing the BGK collision operator. The model requires neither scale separation nor a Smagorinsky-type ansatz for the subfilter stress tensor. The Chapman-Enskog analysis shows that its hydrodynamic limit converges exactly to the filtered Navier-Stokes equations, with velocity gradients isolating subfilter contributions. Validations through lattice Boltzmann simulations of the Taylor-Green vortex and the turbulent mixing layer demonstrate improved stability and reduced dissipation, benchmarked against the Smagorinsky model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth-doped nitride phosphors are promising materials for solid-state lighting and photonic applications due to their thermal stability, sharp emission lines, and strong UV-blue absorption. In this work, we present a first-principles density functional theory (DFT) study, using the GGA+U approach, of pristine and Eu3+-doped CaAlSiN3 at doping levels of 8.5% and 17%. Electronic structure calculations show that Eu incorporation introduces localized 4f states within the band gap, leading to band-gap narrowing and enabling red photoluminescence through the 5D0 -&gt; 7F2 transition. Spin-polarized density of states and spin density mapping confirm the magnetic nature of Eu3+, while charge density, Bader analysis, and electron localization function (ELF) indicate mixed ionic-covalent bonding and charge transfer from Eu to neighboring N and Al atoms, stabilizing the doped lattice. Optical spectra, including dielectric function, absorption, refractive index, and reflectivity, reveal red-shifted absorption edges and enhanced visible-range light-matter interactions, consistent with experimental red to near-infrared emission. Formation energy analysis confirms the thermodynamic feasibility of Eu substitution, while elastic constants and Pugh's ratio indicate mechanical robustness and ductility. Thermoelectric transport properties, obtained using WIEN2k and BoltzTraP, suggest that moderate Eu3+ doping improves the power factor and reduces lattice thermal conductivity through disorder scattering. These results establish Eu-doped CaAlSiN3 as a stable and efficient red-emitting phosphor for white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) and provide theoretical insights for crystal site engineering in advanced optoelectronic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A modern chiral potential incorporating the three-body force is adopted to investigate bulk properties, spectra, and nuclear responses of closed-(sub)shell nuclei throughout the nuclear chart within a particle-hole (p-h) renormalized random-phase approximation (RRPA) scheme using a Hartree- Fock (HF) single-particle basis. Our analysis shows that all instabilities induced by the quasiboson approximation (QBA) underlying RPA are removed and an overall better consistency with the experiments is achieved for all observables of the investigated nuclei. The residual discrepancies point out the need of going beyond the p-h space.</description>

      <title>Exploring Chalcogen Influence on Sc2BeX4 (X = S, Se) for Green Energy Applications Using DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principles density functional theory study of the structural, electronic, optical, and thermoelectric properties of Sc2BeX4 (X = S, Se) chalcogenides for energy applications. Both compounds are dynamically and thermodynamically stable, exhibiting negative formation energies of -2.6 eV (Sc2BeS4) and -2.2 eV (Sc2BeSe4). They feature direct band gaps of 1.8 eV and 1.2 eV, respectively, within the TB-mBJ approximation, indicating strong visible-light absorption. Optical analysis reveals high static dielectric constants (9.0 for S and 16.5 for Se), absorption peaks near 13.5 eV, and reflectivity below 30 percent. Thermoelectric calculations predict p-type conduction with Seebeck coefficients reaching 2.5e-4 V/K and electrical conductivities of 2.45e18 and 1.91e18 (Ohm m s)^-1 at 300 K. Power factors approach 1.25e11 W/K^2 m s, with a maximum dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) of 0.80 at 800 K. Calculated Debye temperatures (420 K for Sc2BeS4 and 360 K for Sc2BeSe4) imply low lattice thermal conductivity. These findings establish Sc2BeX4 chalcogenides as promising materials for photovoltaic and thermoelectric applications.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic, optical, and thermodynamic properties of BeX compounds (X = S, Se, Te) under hydrostatic pressures ranging from 0 to 10 GPa. Calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT) within the Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA) using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional, as implemented in the CASTEP code. Phonon dispersion analyses confirm the dynamical stability of all compounds across the studied pressure range, as indicated by the absence of imaginary frequencies throughout the Brillouin zone. The electronic band structure reveals pressure-induced band modifications, with BeS retaining the widest bandgap. Optical properties, including the dielectric function, absorption coefficient, reflectivity, and energy loss spectra, were computed for photon energies up to 30 eV. The materials exhibit strong optical absorption in the ultraviolet region, suggesting potential for UV optoelectronic applications. Thermodynamic parameters such as Debye temperature, heat capacity, and entropy were evaluated, showing pressure-dependent trends. Notably, increasing pressure leads to reduced atomic vibrations and heat capacity, while the Gibbs free energy exhibits a consistent slope with temperature, reflecting entropy variation. These results highlight the suitability of BeX compounds for pressure-sensitive optoelectronic and thermoelectric devices, as well as thermal barrier applications.</description>

      <title>Combining Error Detection and Mitigation: A Hybrid Protocol for Near-Term Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practical implementation of quantum error correction is currently limited by near-term quantum hardware. In contrast, quantum error mitigation has demonstrated strong promise for improving the performance of noisy quantum circuits without the requirement of full fault tolerance. In this work, we develop a hybrid error suppression protocol that integrates Pauli twirling, probabilistic error cancellation, and the $[[n, n-2, 2]]$ quantum error detecting code. In addition, to reduce overhead from error mitigation components of our method, we modify Pauli twirling by lowering the number of Pauli operators in the twirling set, and apply probabilistic error cancellation at the end of the encoded circuit to remove undetectable errors. Finally, we demonstrate our protocol on a non-Clifford variational quantum eigensolver circuit that estimates the ground state energy of $\rm H_2$ using both \texttt{qiskit} AerSimulator and the IBM quantum processor \texttt{ibm\_brussels}.</description>

      <title>Singular Spectrum Analysis of Time-series Data from Time-dependent density-functional theory in Real-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a spectral analysis of time-seires data derived from real-time time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). TDDFT is a robust method for obtaining molecular excited states and optical spectra by tracking the time evolution of dynamical dipole moments. However, the spectral resolution can be compromised when Fourier transformation's total time duration is insufficient. SSA enabled the extraction of specific oscillation components from the time-series data, facilitating the generation of higher-precision spectra. Even with relatively short time-series dataset, the predictive extension of SSA yielded high-resolution spectra, demonstrating substantial agreement with results obtained through conventional methods. The efficacy of this approach was validated for several small molecules, including ethylene, benzene, and others. SSA's ability to conduct detailed spectral anasysis in specific energy regions enhance spectral resolution and facilitates the clarification of oscillation components within these regions. Real-time TDDFT combined with SSA provides a new analytical method for analyzing the optical properties of molecules, significantly improving the accuracy of the analysis of emission and absorption spectra analysis. This method is expected to have various applications.</description>

      <title>An Atomic Cluster Expansion Potential for Twisted Multilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted multilayer graphene, characterized by its moir\'e patterns arising from inter-layer rotational misalignment, serves as a rich platform for exploring quantum phenomena. Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are a promising approach to model such systems. Our work develops a method to generate training and test datasets for fitting MLIPs that capture all possible misalignments but remain small-scale to facilitate efficient data generation and parameter estimation. To achieve this, we generate configurations with periodic boundary conditions suitable for DFT calculations, and then introduce an internal twist and shift within those supercell structures. Using this technique, supplemented with an active learning workflow, we fit an Atomic Cluster Expansion potential for simulating twisted multilayer graphene and test it for accuracy and robustness on a range of simulation tasks.</description>

      <title>SEMPO -- Retrieving poles, residues and zeros in the complex frequency plane from an arbitrary spectral response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Singularity Expansion Method Parameter Optimizer -- SEMPO -- is a toolbox to extract the complex poles, zeros and residues of an arbitrary response function acquired along the real frequency axis. SEMPO allows to determine this full set of complex parameters of linear physical systems from their spectral responses only, without prior information about the system. The method leverages on the Singularity Expansion Method of the physical signal. This analytical expansion of the meromorphic function in the complex frequency plane motivates the use of the Cauchy method and auto-differentiation-based optimization approach to retrieve the complex poles, zeros and residues from the knowledge of the spectrum over a finite and real spectral range. Both approaches can be sequentially associated to provide highly accurate reconstructions of physical signals in large spectral windows. The performances of SEMPO are assessed and analysed in several configurations that include the dielectric permittivity of materials and the optical response spectra of various optical metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>A finite element solver for a thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a finite element solver for a thermodynamically consistent electrolyte model that accurately captures multicomponent ionic transport by incorporating key physical phenomena such as steric effects, solvation, and pressure coupling. The model is rooted in the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and strictly enforces mass conservation, charge neutrality, and entropy production. It extends beyond classical frameworks like the Nernst-Planck system by employing modified partial mass balances, the electrostatic Poisson equation, and a momentum balance expressed in terms of electrostatic potential, atomic fractions, and pressure, thereby enhancing numerical stability and physical consistency. Implemented using the FEniCSx platform, the solver efficiently handles one- and two-dimensional problems with varied boundary conditions and demonstrates excellent convergence behavior and robustness. Validation against benchmark problems confirms its improved physical fidelity, particularly in regimes characterized by high ionic concentrations and strong electrochemical gradients. Simulation results reveal critical electrolyte phenomena, including electric double layer formation, rectification behavior, and the effects of solvation number, Debye length, and compressibility. The solver's modular variational formulation facilitates its extension to complex electrochemical systems involving multiple ionic species with asymmetric valences. We publicly provide the documented and validated solver framework.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Preparation of Many-Body Quantum States: Towards Practical Quantum Advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While dissipation has traditionally been viewed as an obstacle to quantum coherence, it is increasingly recognized as a powerful computational resource. Dissipative protocols can prepare complex many-body quantum states by leveraging engineered system-environment interactions. This essay focuses on a class of algorithms that utilize algorithmically constructed Lindblad generators, and highlight recent advances enabling the preparation of ground and thermal states for certain non-commuting Hamiltonians with rigorous performance guarantees. We also propose extensions of these protocols to prepare excited and resonance states, which may offer new pathways toward realizing practical quantum advantage on early fault-tolerant quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Structured Quantum Baths with Memory: A QuTiP Framework for Spectral Diagnostics and Machine Learning Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a compact simulation framework for modeling open quantum systems coupled to structured, memory-retaining baths using QuTiP. Our method models the bath as a finite set of layered qubits with adjustable connections, interpreted either as a physical realization or as a conceptual representation, rather than as a continuum. This explicit modeling enables direct control over non-Markovian dynamics and allows spectral diagnostics via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of system observables. Using a triangle-based bath motif and its extension to a six-qubit anisotropic fractal-like architecture, we demonstrate how spectral fingerprints encode bath topology and memory depth. Standard machine learning tools such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and gradient boosting can then be employed to infer bath parameters and estimate proximity to exceptional points (EPs). The results suggest that spectral analysis can serve as a unifying, quantum-platform agnostic tool across theory, simulation, and experiment, offering both a student-accessible and experimentally relevant approach to understanding coherence loss and memory flow in quantum hardware. Rather than treating noise as an adversary to be eliminated, our approach views structured baths as collaborative partners, enabling controlled memory and delocalized memory and information flow for engineered quantum dynamics. In addition to its diagnostic power, the framework offers a modular and reproducible platform for teaching open quantum systems. Ultimately, we frame this as a pedagogical tool: students can pair FFT-based spectral features with lightweight ML (e.g., PCA and gradient boosting) to extract data-rich, interpretable signatures of open-system and non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Solving advection equations with reduction multigrids on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods for solving hyperbolic systems typically depend on unknown ordering (e.g., Gauss-Seidel, or sweep/wavefront/marching methods) to achieve good convergence. For many discretisations, mesh types or decompositions these methods do not scale well in parallel. In this work we demonstrate that the combination of AIRG (a reduction multigrid which uses GMRES polynomials) and PMISR DDC (a CF splitting algorithm which gives diagonally dominant submatrices) can be used to solve linear advection equations in parallel on GPUs with good weak scaling. We find that GMRES polynomials are well suited to GPUs when applied matrix-free, either as smoothers (at low order) or as an approximate coarse grid solver (at high order). To improve the parallel performance we automatically truncate the multigrid hierarchy given the quality of the polynomials as coarse grid solvers. Solving time-independent advection equations in 2D on structured grids, we find 66-101% weak scaling efficiency in the solve and 47-63% in the setup with AIRG, across the majority of Lumi-G, a pre-exascale GPU machine.</description>
