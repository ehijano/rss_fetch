      <title>A thermionic electron gun to characterize silicon drift detectors with electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TRISTAN detector is a new detector for electron spectroscopy at the Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment. The semiconductor detector utilizes the silicon drift detector technology and will enable the precise measurement of the entire tritium beta decay electron spectrum. Thus, a significant fraction of the parameter space of potential neutrino mass eigenstates in the keV-mass regime can be probed. We developed a custom electron gun based on the effect of thermionic emission to characterize the TRISTAN detector modules with mono-energetic electrons before installation into the KATRIN beamline. The electron gun provides an electron beam with up to 25 keV kinetic energy and an electron rate in the order of 1E5 electrons per second. This manuscript gives an overview of the design and commissioning of the electron gun. In addition, we will shortly discuss a first measurement with the electron gun to characterize the electron response of the TRISTAN detector.</description>

      <title>Searching for new physics in the solar system with tetrahedral spacecraft formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tetrahedral configurations of spacecraft on unperturbed heliocentric orbits allow for highly precise observations of small spatial changes in the gravitational field, especially those affecting the gravity gradient tensor (GGT). The resulting high sensitivity may be used to search for new physics that could manifest itself via deviations from general relativistic behavior yielding a non-vanishing trace[GGT]. We study the feasibility of recovering the trace[GGT] with the sensitivity of O(1e-24 s^(-2)) -- the level where some of the recently proposed cosmological models may have observable effects in the solar system. We consider how local measurements provided by precision laser ranging and atom-wave interferometry can be used for that purpose. We report on a preliminary study of such an experiment and precision that may be reached in measuring the trace[GGT], with the assumption of drag-compensated spacecraft by atom interferometer measurements. For that, we study the dynamical behavior of a tetrahedral formation established by four spacecraft on heliocentric nearby elliptical orbits. We formulate the observational equations to measure the trace[GGT] relying only on the observables available within the formation: laser ranging and the Sagnac interferometry. We demonstrate that Sagnac observable is a mission enabling and allows to measure the angular frequency of the tetrahedral rotation with respect to an inertial reference frame with an accuracy much higher than that available from any other modern navigational techniques. We show that the quality of the science measurements is affected by the changes in tetrahedron's orientation and shape as spacecraft follow their orbits. We present the preliminary mission and instrument requirements needed to measure the trace[GGT] to the required accuracy and demonstrate the feasibility of satisfying the science objectives.</description>

      <title>Advanced Radiation Panel design for applications in National Security and Food Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04828v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a new concept for a basic radiation detection panel based on conventional scintillator technology and commercially available solid-state photo-detectors. The panels are simple in construction, robust, very efficient and cost-effective and are easily scalable in size, from tens of cm$^2$ to tens of m$^2$. We describe two possible applications: flagging radioactive food coontamination and detection of illicit radio nucleides, such as those potentially used in a terrorist attack with a dirty bomb.</description>

      <title>A novel cryogenic VUV spectrofluorometer for the characterization of wavelength shifters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15901v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel cryogenic VUV spectrofluorometer designed for the characterization of wavelength shifters (WLS) crucial for experiments based on liquid argon (LAr) scintillation light detection. Wavelength shifters like 1,1,4,4-tetraphenyl-1,3-butadiene (TPB) or polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) are used in these experiments to shift the VUV scintillation light to the visible region. Precise knowledge of the optical properties of the WLS at liquid argon's temperature (87 K) and LAr scintillation wavelength (128 nm) is necessary to model and understand the detector response. The cryogenic VUV spectrofluorometer was commissioned to measure the emission spectra and relative wavelength shifting efficiency (WLSE) of samples between 300 K and 87 K for VUV (128 nm to 190 nm) and UV (310 nm) excitation. New mitigation techniques for surface effects on cold WLS were established. As part of this work, the TPB-based wavelength shifting reflector (WLSR) featured in the neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment LEGEND-200 was characterized. The wavelength shifting efficiency was observed to increase by (54 +/- 5)% from room temperature (RT) to 87 K. PEN installed in LEGEND-200 was also characterized and a first measurement of the relative wavelength shifting efficiency and emission spectrum at RT and 87 K is presented. The WLSE of amorphous PEN was found to be enhanced by at least (37 +/- 4)% for excitation with 128 nm and by (52 +/- 3)% for UV excitation at 87 K compared to RT.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Photon Detection Efficiency of Hamamatsu VUV4 SiPMs at Cryogenic Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid argon time projection chambers (TPC) are widely used in neutrino oscillation and dark matter experiments. Detection of scintillation light in liquid argon TPC's is challenging because of its short wavelength, in the VUV range, and the cryogenic temperatures (~86 K) at which the sensors must operate. Wavelength shifters (WLS) are typically needed to take advantage of the high Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) in the visible range of most of photondetectors. The Hamamatsu VUV4 S13370--6075CN SiPMs can directly detect VUV light without the use of WLS, which main benefit is an improved PDE at these short wavelengths, but also the visible light from WLS. The manufacturer (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.) provides a complete characterization of these devices at room temperature; however, previous studies have indicated a decrease of the PDE at cryogenic temperature for VUV light. In this work, we present the measurement of the PDE of VUV4 SiPMs at cryogenic temperature for different wavelengths in the range [270, 570] nm. A dedicated measurement at 127 nm is also shown.</description>

      <title>Experimental determination of axion signal power of dish antennas and dielectric haloscopes using the reciprocity approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The reciprocity approach is a powerful method to determine the expected signal power of axion haloscopes in a model-independent way. Especially for open and broadband setups like the MADMAX dielectric haloscope the sensitivity to the axion field is difficult to calibrate since they do not allow discrete eigenmode analysis and are optically too large to fully simulate. The central idea of the reciprocity approach is to measure a reflection-induced test field in the setup instead of trying to simulate the axion-induced field. In this article, the reciprocity approach is used to determine the expected signal power of a dish antenna and a minimal dielectric haloscope directly from measurements. The results match expectations from simulation but also include important systematic effects that are too difficult to simulate. In particular, the effect of antenna standing waves and higher order mode perturbations can be quantified for the first time in a dielectric haloscope.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel conceptual design for a magnet system that provides the magnetic field necessary for the analysis of tracks in a high-pressure gaseous argon TPC while simultaneously serving as a pressure vessel to contain the TPC gas volume. The magnet was developed within a Near Detector proposal for the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The high-pressure gaseous argon TPC is a component proposed to be one of the elements of an ensemble of near detectors that are needed for DUNE</description>

      <title>A Configurable Ultra-Low Noise Current Source for Transition-Edge Sensor Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition-edge sensors (TESs) are sensitive devices for detecting photons from millimeter radiation to gamma rays. Their photon counting efficiency and collecting area benefit from large-array multiplexing scheme, and therefore the development of multiplexing readout system has been an important topic in this field. Among the many multiplex techniques, time-division multiplexing (TDM) superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) has been used most widely for TES readout. In this work, we design a Configurable Ultra-Low Noise Current Source (CLCS) for TES characterization and as a part of a whole TDM-TES bias control system. The CLCS is based on the feedback structure of ultra-low noise instrumentation amplifiers and low-noise, high-resolution (20 bits) digital-to-analog converter (DAC). CLCS has an ultra-high resolution of 10 nA in the 0 to 5 mA current output range, and can perform current-voltage (IV) sweep and bias-step tests to measure key TES parameters on board. The feedback structure of the CLCS also avoids the issue of impedance mismatch.</description>

      <title>Development of a new CEDAR for kaon identification at the NA62 experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NA62 experiment at CERN utilises a differential Cherenkov counter with achromatic ring focus (CEDAR) for tagging kaons within an unseparated monochromatic beam of charged hadrons. The CEDAR-H detector was developed to minimise the amount of material in the path of the beam by using hydrogen gas as the radiator medium. The detector was shown to satisfy the kaon tagging requirements in a test-beam before installation and commissioning at the experiment. The CEDAR-H performance was measured using NA62 data collected in 2023.</description>
