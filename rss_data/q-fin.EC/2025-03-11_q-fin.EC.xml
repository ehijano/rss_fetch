      <title>Will Neural Scaling Laws Activate Jevons' Paradox in AI Labor Markets? A Time-Varying Elasticity of Substitution (VES) Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI industry leaders often use the term ``Jevons' Paradox.'' We explore the significance of this term for artificial intelligence adoption through a time-varying elasticity of substitution framework. We develop a model connecting AI development to labor substitution through four key mechanisms: (1) increased effective computational capacity from both hardware and algorithmic improvements; (2) AI capabilities that rise logarithmically with computation following established neural scaling laws; (3) declining marginal computational costs leading to lower AI prices through competitive pressure; and (4) a resulting increase in the elasticity of substitution between AI and human labor over time. Our time-varying elasticity of substitution (VES) framework, incorporating the G\o rtz identity, yields analytical conditions for market transformation dynamics. This work provides a simple framework to help assess the economic reasoning behind industry claims that AI will increasingly substitute for human labor across diverse economic sectors.</description>

      <title>Place-Based Policies for Neighborhood Improvement: Evidence from Promise Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite growing evidence that neighborhoods play a critical role in shaping economic mobility and well-being, effective policies to address neighborhood disadvantage remain elusive. This study evaluates the impact of the Promise Zone program, which aims to revitalize disadvantaged neighborhoods through streamlined federal support and grant incentives. I use an event study framework with newly obtained data on the location of failed finalist applications as a comparison group to estimate the effects of the program. The results reveal significant improvements in poverty, household incomes, and employment in Promise Zone neighborhoods, particularly in later-designated zones and initially low-status neighborhoods. I also find that effects are driven partly by changes in residential composition, and that Promise Zones appear to induce positive spillovers in adjacent areas.</description>

      <title>Maine's Forestry and Logging Industry: Building a Model for Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From 2000 to 2017, 64% of Maine's pulp and paper processing mills shut down; these closures resulted in harmful effects to communities in Maine and beyond. One question this research asks is how will key macroeconomic and related variables for Maine's forestry and logging industry change in the future? To answer this, we forecast key macroeconomic and related variables with a vector error correction (VEC model) to assess past and predict future economic contributions from Maine's forestry and logging industry. The forecasting results imply that although the contribution of the industry in Maine would likely remain stable due to level prices and a slight increase in output, local Maine communities could be worse off due to decreases in employment and firms. We then incorporated these forecasts into a 3-stage modeling process to analyze how a negative shock to exchange rates from an increase in tariffs could affect Maine's employment and output. Our results suggest that increased tariffs will reduce output and increase employment volatility in Maine. Rising uncertainty and costs of business operations suggest care should be taken when changing tariffs and trade restrictions, especially when changes to business operations can harm markets and communities.</description>

      <title>Hate in the Time of Algorithms: Evidence on Online Behavior from a Large-Scale Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media algorithms are thought to amplify variation in user beliefs, thus contributing to radicalization. However, quantitative evidence on how algorithms and user preferences jointly shape harmful online engagement is limited. I conduct an individually randomized experiment with 8 million users of an Indian TikTok-like platform, replacing algorithmic ranking with random content delivery. Exposure to "toxic" posts decreases by 27%, mainly due to reduced platform usage by users with higher interest in such content. Strikingly, these users increase engagement with toxic posts they find. Survey evidence indicates shifts to other platforms. Model-based counterfactuals highlight the limitations of blanket algorithmic regulation.</description>

      <title>Spillover effects between climate policy uncertainty, energy markets, and food markets: A time-frequency analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study examines the return connectedness between climate policy uncertainty (CPU), clean energy, fossil energy, and food markets. Using the time-domain method of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and frequency-domain methods of Barun{\'{i}}k and K{\v{r}}hl{\'{i}}k (2018), we find substantial spillover effects between these markets. Furthermore, high frequency domain is the primary driver of overall connectedness. In addition, CPU is a net contributor of return shocks in the short term, whereas it turns to be a net recipient in the medium and long terms. Across all frequencies, clean energy and oils are consistent net recipients, while meat is a dominant net contributor.</description>

      <title>The impact of external uncertainties on the extreme return connectedness between food, fossil energy, and clean energy markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the extreme return connectedness between the food, fossil energy, and clean energy markets using the quantile connectedness approach, which combines the traditional spillover index with quantile regression. Our results show that return connectedness at the tails (57.91% for the right tail and 61.47% for the left tail) is significantly higher than at the median (23.02%). Further-more, dynamic analysis reveals that connectedness fluctuates over time, with notable increases during extreme events. Among these markets, fossil energy market consistently acts as the net receiver, while clean energy market primarily serves as the net transmitter. Additionally, we use linear and nonlinear ARDL models to examine the role of external uncertainties on return connectedness. We find that climate policy uncertainty (CPU), geopolitical risk (GPR), and the COVID-19pandemic significantly impact median connectedness, while economic policy uncertainty (EPU),GPR, and trade policy uncertainty (TPU) are crucial drivers of extreme connectedness. Our findings provide valuable insights for investors and policymakers on risk spillover effects between food and energy markets under both normal and extreme market conditions.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and Aligning Human Economic Risk Preferences in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making scenarios that involve risk assessment, yet their alignment with human economic rationality remains unclear. In this study, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit risk preferences consistent with human expectations across different personas. Specifically, we assess whether LLM-generated responses reflect appropriate levels of risk aversion or risk-seeking behavior based on individual's persona. Our results reveal that while LLMs make reasonable decisions in simplified, personalized risk contexts, their performance declines in more complex economic decision-making tasks. To address this, we propose an alignment method designed to enhance LLM adherence to persona-specific risk preferences. Our approach improves the economic rationality of LLMs in risk-related applications, offering a step toward more human-aligned AI decision-making.</description>

      <title>Financial Markets and ESG: How Big Data is Transforming Sustainable Investing in Developing countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the role of big data adoption and financial market development in driving ESG investments in developing countries, using an instrumental variable (IV) approach to address endogeneity. The results show that big data adoption significantly enhances ESG investing, as data-driven analytics improve sustainability assessments and capital allocation. Financial market development also positively influences ESG investments, but its effect is relatively small. A key finding is that inflation negatively impacts ESG investment, highlighting the importance of macroeconomic stability in fostering sustainable finance. In contrast, GDP per capita and foreign direct investment (FDI) are not significant determinants, suggesting that economic growth alone does not drive sustainability efforts. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence that leveraging big data and financial market improvements can accelerate sustainable investing in emerging economies. Policymakers should focus on technological advancements, financial reforms, and inflation control to strengthen ESG investments and long-term sustainability commitments.</description>

      <title>The Sustainable Future is now: a dynamic model to advance investments in PV and Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the relationship among photovoltaic (PV) investments, energy production, and environmental impact using a dynamic optimization model. Our findings show that increasing investment in renewables supports both energy generation and ecological sustainability, with the optimal path depending on policy priorities. Our analysis demonstrates that the economic and technological conditions for a transition to PV energy are already in place, challenging the idea that renewables will only become competitive in the future. We also account for the fact that PV optimality conditions improve over time as storage technology efficiency increases and production costs decrease. In this perspective we find that energy storage may be a more effective policy tool than carbon taxation for cutting emissions, as it faces less political resistance and further strengthens the long-term viability of renewable energy. Policy insights of the paper capture the evolving competitiveness of PV and its role in accelerating the energy transition. They also provide policymakers with strategies to align economic growth with long-term sustainability through renewable energy investments.</description>

      <title>The Economics of p(doom): Scenarios of Existential Risk and Economic Growth in the Age of Transformative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to a diverse set of predictions about its long-term impact on humanity. A central focus is the potential emergence of transformative AI (TAI), eventually capable of outperforming humans in all economically valuable tasks and fully automating labor. Discussed scenarios range from human extinction after a misaligned TAI takes over ("AI doom") to unprecedented economic growth and abundance ("post-scarcity"). However, the probabilities and implications of these scenarios remain highly uncertain. Here, we organize the various scenarios and evaluate their associated existential risks and economic outcomes in terms of aggregate welfare. Our analysis shows that even low-probability catastrophic outcomes justify large investments in AI safety and alignment research. We find that the optimizing representative individual would rationally allocate substantial resources to mitigate extinction risk; in some cases, she would prefer not to develop TAI at all. This result highlights that current global efforts in AI safety and alignment research are vastly insufficient relative to the scale and urgency of existential risks posed by TAI. Our findings therefore underscore the need for stronger safeguards to balance the potential economic benefits of TAI with the prevention of irreversible harm. Addressing these risks is crucial for steering technological progress toward sustainable human prosperity.</description>

      <title>Optimal energy storage management for self-consumption groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the optimal management of a photovoltaic system's battery owned by a self-consumption group that aims to minimize energy consumption costs. We assume that the photovoltaic system is composed of a photovoltaic panel and a battery, where the photovoltaic panel produces energy according to a certain stochastic process. The management of the battery is the responsibility of a group administrator, who makes the joint decision to either store part of the photovoltaic energy production and sell the remaining energy at the electricity spot price, or discharge part of the energy stored in the battery and sell it in the electricity market. Inspired by European Union and Italian legislation, which promote incentives for energy transition and renewable energy production, we assume that the group receives a monetary incentive for the virtual self-consumed energy, defined as the minimum between the power bought from the grid to satisfy the group's power demand and the energy sold to the market. In this case, the energy sold by the group is a mix of part of the photovoltaic production that is not stored and part of the energy discharged from the battery. We model the problem as a stochastic optimal control problem, where the optimal strategy is the joint charge-discharge decision that minimizes the group's energy consumption costs. We find the solution numerically by applying a finite difference scheme to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the value function of the optimal control problem.</description>

      <title>On Large Language Models as Data Sources for Policy Deliberation on Climate Change and Sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pose the research question, "Can LLMs provide credible evaluation scores, suitable for constructing starter MCDM models that support commencing deliberation regarding climate and sustainability policies?" In this exploratory study we
  i. Identify a number of interesting policy alternatives that are actively considered by local governments in the United States (and indeed around the world). ii. Identify a number of quality-of-life indicators as apt evaluation criteria for these policies. iii. Use GPT-4 to obtain evaluation scores for the policies on multiple criteria. iv. Use the TOPSIS MCDM method to rank the policies based on the obtained evaluation scores. v. Evaluate the quality and validity of the resulting table ensemble of scores by comparing the TOPSIS-based policy rankings with those obtained by an informed assessment exercise.
  We find that GPT-4 is in rough agreement with the policy rankings of our informed assessment exercise. Hence, we conclude (always provisionally and assuming a modest level of vetting) that GPT-4 can be used as a credible input, even starting point, for subsequent deliberation processes on climate and sustainability policies.</description>

      <title>Examining the Dynamics of Local and Transfer Passenger Share Patterns in Air Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The air transportation local share, defined as the proportion of local passengers relative to total passengers, serves as a critical metric reflecting how economic growth, carrier strategies, and market forces jointly influence demand composition. This metric is particularly useful for examining industry structure changes and large-scale disruptive events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This research offers an in-depth analysis of local share patterns on more than 3900 Origin and Destination (O&amp;D) pairs across the U.S. air transportation system, revealing how economic expansion, the emergence of low-cost carriers (LCCs), and strategic shifts by legacy carriers have collectively elevated local share. To efficiently identify the local share characteristics of thousands of O&amp;Ds and to categorize the O&amp;Ds that have the same behavior, a range of time series clustering methods were used. Evaluation using visualization, performance metrics, and case-based examination highlighted distinct patterns and trends, from magnitude-based stratification to trend-based groupings. The analysis also identified pattern commonalities within O&amp;D pairs, suggesting that macro-level forces (e.g., economic cycles, changing demographics, or disruptions such as COVID-19) can synchronize changes between disparate markets. These insights set the stage for predictive modeling of local share, guiding airline network planning and infrastructure investments. This study combines quantitative analysis with flexible clustering to help stakeholders anticipate market shifts, optimize resource allocation strategies, and strengthen the air transportation system's resilience and competitiveness.</description>

      <title>Assessing provincial carbon budgets for residential buildings to advance net-zero ambitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing provincial carbon budgets for residential building operations is a crucial strategy for advancing China's net-zero ambitions. This study is the first to employ a static-dynamic modeling approach to project future emission trends, particularly carbon peaks, in residential buildings across each province of China up to 2060. An optimized provincial carbon budget assessment scheme for residential buildings, based on the principle of maximizing expected emission reduction potential, is also proposed. Findings show that (1) in the business-as-usual scenario, the emissions for urban and rural residential buildings are projected to peak at 990 (+-0.7) and 450 (+-0.2) mega-tons of CO2 (MtCO2), respectively, with peak years occurring in 2031 (+-4.7) and 2026 (+-2.6). (2) In the decarbonization scenario, peak emissions decrease to 900 MtCO2 and 430 MtCO2 for urban and rural buildings, respectively. (3) The provinces with the highest emission reduction requirements are Henan (16.74 MtCO2), Xinjiang (12.59 MtCO2), Gansu (9.87 MtCO2), Hebei (8.46 MtCO2), and Guangdong (3.37 MtCO2), with Northwest China shouldering the greatest reduction responsibility, totaling 38.14 MtCO2. In conclusion, this study provides a dynamically optimized carbon budget assessment scheme for residential buildings, offering valuable insights for government policy-making and playing a key role in facilitating the low-carbon transition of China's building sector during the pre-2030 planning period, ultimately contributing to the goal of achieving net-zero emissions in the building sector by mid-century.</description>

      <title>Trust, Experience, and Innovation: Key Factors Shaping American Attitudes About AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large survey of American adults explored the complex landscape of attitudes towards artificial intelligence (AI). It explored the degree of concern regarding specific potential outcomes of the new advances in AI technology and correlates of these concerns. Key variables associated with the direction and intensity of concern include prior experience using a large language model such as ChatGPT, general trust in science, adherence to the precautionary principle versus support for unrestricted innovation, and demographic factors such as gender. By analyzing these relationships, the paper provides valuable insights into the American public's response to AI that are particularly important in the development of policy to regulate or further encourage its development.</description>

      <title>Building floorspace and stock measurement: A review of global efforts, knowledge gaps, and research priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of global floorspace data presents challenges in achieving building carbon neutrality. We analyze 2,140 peer-reviewed papers on global building floorspace, focusing on energy and emissions. The top five countries publishing the most include China, the UK, the US, Italy, and Spain. The key research topics include energy modeling, emissions analysis, building retrofits, and life cycle assessments, particularly for residential buildings. Measurement approaches (top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid), each face challenges, with top-down methods offering broad estimates but tending to low accuracy, whereas bottom-up approaches are precise but requiring intensive data. Our latest simulations reveal significant floorspace growth in emerging economies, particularly India, Indonesia, and Africa. By 2070, India's per capita residential floorspace is projected to triple, whereas Indonesia's non-residential floorspace could increase sevenfold. We emphasize the need for a high-resolution global floorspace imagery database to compare energy efficiency, track decarbonization progress, and assess renovation impacts, while promoting building sufficiency and accelerating the transition to net-zero building systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Diversification and Leverage in a Utility-Based Portfolio Allocation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the problem of optimal portfolio allocation within the framework of utility theory. We apply exponential utility to derive the optimal diversification strategy and logarithmic utility to determine the optimal leverage. We enhance existing methodologies by incorporating compound probability distributions to model the effects of both statistical and non-stationary uncertainties. Additionally, we extend the maximum expected utility objective by including the variance of utility in the objective function, which we term generalized mean-variance. In the case of logarithmic utility, it provides a natural explanation for the half-Kelly criterion, a concept widely used by practitioners.</description>

      <title>Optimal Investment and Fair Sharing Rules of the Incentives for Renewable Energy Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The focus on Renewable Energy Communities (REC) is fastly growing after the European Union (EU) has introduced a dedicated regulation in 2018. The idea of creating local groups of citizens, small- and medium-sized companies, and public institutions, which self-produce and self-consume energy from renewable sources is at the same time a way to save money for the participants, increase efficiency of the energy system, and reduce CO$_2$ emissions. Member states inside the EU are fixing more detailed regulations, which describe, how public incentives are measured. A natural objective for the incentive policies is of course to promote the self-consumption of a REC. A sophisticated incentive policy is that based on the so called 'virtual framework'. Under this framework all the energy produced by a REC is sold to the market, and all the energy consumed must be paid to retailers: self-consumption occurs only 'virtually', thanks a money compensation (paid by a central authority) for every MWh produced and consumed by the REC in the same hour. In this context, two problems have to be solved: the optimal investment in new technologies and a fair division of the incentive among the community members. We address these problems by considering a particular type of REC, composed by a representative household and a biogas producer, where the potential demand of the community is given by the household's demand, while both members produce renewable energy. We set the problem as a leader-follower problem: the leader decide how to share the incentive for the self-consumed energy, while the followers decide their own optimal installation strategy. We solve the leader's problem by searching for a Nash bargaining solution for the incentive's fair division, while the follower problem is solved by finding the Nash equilibria of a static competitive game between the members.</description>

      <title>Divide and Diverge: Polarization Incentives</title>

Abstract: We study polarization in a probabilistic voting model with aggregate shocks and a decreasing marginal utility from office rents. In equilibrium, parties offer different policies, despite being rent-motivated and ex-ante identical from the point of view of voters. When candidates compete on a single policy issue, parties' equilibrium payoffs increase in voter polarization, even when the change is driven by the supporters of the opposite party becoming more extreme. With multiple policy issues, parties benefit if the society is split into two factions and the ideological cohesion within such factions increases. We connect our results to empirical evidence on polarizing political communication, party identity, and zero-sum thinking, and find that polarization could be reduced by intervening on the electoral rule.</description>

      <title>ESG Rating Disagreement and Corporate Total Factor Productivity:Inference and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13895v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines how ESG rating disagreement (Dis) affects corporate total factor productivity (TFP) in China based on data of A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2022. We find that Dis reduces TFP, especially in state-owned, non-capital-intensive, low-pollution and high-tech firms, green innovation strengthens the dampening effect of Dis on TFP, and that Dis lowers corporate TFP by increasing financing constraints and weakening human capital. Furthermore, XGBoost regression demonstrates that Dis plays a significant role in predicting TFP, with SHAP showing that the dampening effect of ESG rating disagreement on TFP is still pronounced in firms with large Dis values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As US political party leaders increasingly take stances both on economic and cultural (i.e., social policy) issues, the economic views of opposite cultural groups are growing apart. This paper explores a novel explanation for this phenomenon. I provide experimental evidence that adding social policy content to a policy message pushes those disagreeing with the social policy to disagree also with the economic content of the message. As my results suggest regular deviations from Bayesian explanations, I propose a model of identity-based belief updating that predicts the main regularities found in the experiment. Finally, I shed light on opinion leaders' incentives to strengthen the association between social policy and economic policy views.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Automated Mechanism Design using Multi-Agent Revealed Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose a black box, representing multiple agents, generates decisions from a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium of a game. Assume that we can choose the input vector to the black box and this affects the utilities of the agents, but we do not know the utilities of the individual agents. By viewing the decisions from the black box, how can we steer the Nash equilibrium to a socially optimal point? This paper constructs a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for adaptively achieving this mechanism design objective. We first derive a novel multi-agent revealed preference test for Pareto optimality -- this yields necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of utility functions under which empirically observed mixed-strategy Nash equilibria are socially optimal. These conditions take the form of a testable linear program, and this result is of independent interest. We utilize this result to construct an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) step to determine the Pareto gap, i.e., the distance of observed strategies from Pareto optimality. We pair this IRL step with an RL policy gradient algorithm and prove convergence to a mechanism which minimizes the Pareto gap, thereby inducing social optimality in equilibria strategies. We also reveal an intimate connection between our constructed loss function and several robust revealed preference metrics; this allows us to reason about algorithmic suboptimality through the lens of these well-established microeconomic principles. Finally, in the case when only finitely many i.i.d. samples from mixed-strategies (partial strategy specifications) are available, we derive concentration bounds for our algorithm's convergence, and we construct a distributionally robust RL procedure which achieves mechanism design for the fully specified strategies.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Effect of Market Risks on New Pension System and Government Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines how market risks impact the sustainability and performance of the New Pension System (NPS). NPS relies on defined contributions from both employees and employers to build a corpus during the employee's service period. Upon retirement, employees use the corpus fund to sustain their livelihood. A critical concern for individuals is whether the corpus will grow sufficiently to be sustainable or if it will deplete, leaving them financially vulnerable at an advanced age. We explore the impact of market risks on the performance of the corpus resulting from the NPS. To address this, we quantify market risks using Monte Carlo simulations with historical data to model their impact on NPS. We quantify the risk of pension corpus being insufficient and the cost to the Government to hedge the risk arising from guaranteeing the pension.</description>

      <title>The amplifier effect of artificial agents in social contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the proliferation of artificial agents in social contexts, ranging from education to online social media and financial markets, among many others. The increasing rate at which artificial and human agents interact makes it urgent to understand the consequences of human-machine interactions for the propagation of new ideas, products, and behaviors in society. Across two distinct empirical contexts, we find here that artificial agents lead to significantly faster and wider social contagion. To this end, we replicate a choice experiment previously conducted with human subjects by using artificial agents powered by large language models (LLMs). We use the experiment's results to measure the adoption thresholds of artificial agents and their impact on the spread of social contagion. We find that artificial agents tend to exhibit lower adoption thresholds than humans, which leads to wider network-based social contagions. Our findings suggest that the increased presence of artificial agents in real-world networks may accelerate behavioral shifts, potentially in unforeseen ways.</description>
