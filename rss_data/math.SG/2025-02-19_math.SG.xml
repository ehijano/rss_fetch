      <title>Skeins on Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.08027v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study 1-parameter families of holomorphic curves with Lagrangian boundary in Calabi-Yau 3-folds. We show that the expected codimension-1 phenomena can be organized to match the HOMFLYPT skein relations from quantum topology. It follows that counting holomorphic curves by the class of their boundaries in the skein module of the Lagrangian gives a deformation invariant result. This is a mathematically rigorous incarnation of Witten's assertion that boundaries of open topological strings create line defects in Chern-Simons theory.
  Using this theory, we rigorously establish the following prediction of Ooguri and Vafa: the coefficients of the HOMFLYPT polynomial of a link in the three-sphere count the holomorphic curves in the resolved conifold, with boundary on (a pushoff of) the link conormal.</description>

      <title>Relative quantum cohomology of the Chiang Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03016v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the open Gromov-Witten disk invariants and the relative quantum cohomology of the Chiang Lagrangian $L_\triangle \subset \mathbb{C}P^3$. Since $L_\triangle$ is not fixed by any anti-symplectic involution, the invariants may augment straightforward $J$-holomorphic disk counts with correction terms arising from the formalism of Fukaya $A_\infty$-algebras and bounding cochains. These correction terms are shown in fact to be non-trivial for many invariants. Moreover, examples of non-vanishing mixed disk and sphere invariants are obtained.
  We characterize a class of open Gromov-Witten invariants, called basic, which coincide with straightforward counts of $J$-holomorphic disks. Basic invariants for the Chiang Lagrangian are computed using the theory of axial disks developed by Evans-Lekili and Smith in the context of Floer cohomology. The open WDVV equations give recursive relations which determine all invariants from the basic ones. The denominators of all invariants are observed to be powers of $2$ indicating a non-trivial arithmetic structure of the open WDVV equations. The magnitude of invariants is not monotonically increasing with degree. Periodic behavior is observed with periods $8$ and $16.$</description>

      <title>Counting bare curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a class of perturbations of the Cauchy-Riemann equations for maps from curves to a Calabi-Yau threefold. Our perturbations vanish on components of zero symplectic area. For generic 1-parameter families of perturbations, the locus of solution curves without zero-area components is compact, transversely cut out, and satisfies certain natural coherence properties.
  For curves without boundary, this yields a reduced Gromov-Witten theory in the sense of Zinger. That is, we produce a well defined invariant given by counting only maps without components of zero symplectic area, and we show that this invariant is related to the usual Gromov-Witten invariant by the expected change of variables.
  For curves with boundary on Maslov zero Lagrangians, our construction provides an `adequate perturbation scheme' with the needed properties to set up the skein-valued curve counting, as axiomatized in our previous work.
  The main technical content is the construction, over the Hofer-Wysocki-Zehnder Gromov-Witten configuration spaces, of perturbations to which the `ghost bubble censorship' argument can be applied. Certain local aspects of this problem were resolved in our previous work. The key remaining difficulty is to ensure inductive compatibilities, despite the non-existence of marked-point-forgetting maps for the configuration spaces.</description>

      <title>Flux Group Triviality and the Coincidence of Hofer and Hofer-like Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the flux group nullifies the influence of the flux homomorphism in the study of the Hofer-like geometry of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. Consequently, the Hofer-like norm and the usual Hofer norm coincide on the group of all Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. This resolves Banyaga's conjecture and enhances the existing proofs of the conjecture. As a result, several findings within the theory of Hofer-like geometry can be derived directly from their Hamiltonian analogs, eliminating the need for any sophisticated tools.</description>
