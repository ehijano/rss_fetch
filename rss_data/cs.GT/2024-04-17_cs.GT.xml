      <title>Allocation Mechanisms in Decentralized Exchange Markets with Frictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical theory of efficient allocations of an aggregate endowment in a pure-exchange economy has hitherto primarily focused on the Pareto-efficiency of allocations, under the implicit assumption that transfers between agents are frictionless, and hence costless to the economy. In this paper, we argue that certain transfers cause frictions that result in costs to the economy. We show that these frictional costs are tantamount to a form of subadditivity of the cost of transferring endowments between agents. We suggest an axiomatic study of allocation mechanisms, that is, the mechanisms that transform feasible allocations into other feasible allocations, in the presence of such transfer costs. Among other results, we provide an axiomatic characterization of those allocation mechanisms that admit representations as robust (worst-case) linear allocation mechanisms, as well as those mechanisms that admit representations as worst-case conditional expectations. We call the latter Robust Conditional Mean Allocation mechanisms, and we relate our results to the literature on (decentralized) risk sharing within a pool of agents.</description>

      <title>Decreasing Wages in Gig Economy: A Game Theoretic Explanation Using Mathematical Program Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gig economy consists of two market groups connected via an intermediary. Popular examples are rideshares where passengers and drivers are mediated via platforms such as Uber and Lyft. In a duopoly market, the platforms must compete to attract not only the passengers by providing a lower rate but also the drivers by providing better wages. While this should indicate better driver payout, as platforms compete to attract the driver pool, real world statistics does not indicate such. This goes completely against the intuition that the worker side of a gig economy, given their importance, should always earn better. We attempt to answer the low wages of drivers in the gig economy by modeling the ridesharing game between duopoly platforms, drivers, and passengers using Mathematical Program Networks. Our model is parsimonious, expressive, models the same-side and cross-side externalities of the economy, and has interpretations under both single-homing and multi-homing regimes. We derive the conditions for the existence of a profitable duopoly and show that it can only happen if the platforms collude together to pay the bare minimum to the drivers. This not only answers why drivers are paid less but also provides strong managerial insights to any interested policy maker.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Instant Runoff Voting to Allow Indifferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) is used in elections for many political offices around the world. It allows voters to specify their preferences among candidates as a ranking. We identify a generalization of the rule, called Approval-IRV, that allows voters more freedom by allowing them to give equal preference to several candidates. Such weak orders are a more expressive input format than linear orders, and they help reduce the cognitive effort of voting.
  Just like standard IRV, Approval-IRV proceeds in rounds by successively eliminating candidates. It interprets each vote as an approval vote for its most-preferred candidates among those that have not been eliminated. At each step, it eliminates the candidate who is approved by the fewest voters. Among the large class of scoring elimination rules, we prove that Approval-IRV is the unique way of extending IRV to weak orders that preserves its characteristic axiomatic properties, in particular independence of clones and respecting a majority's top choices. We also show that Approval-IRV is the unique extension of IRV among rules in this class that satisfies a natural monotonicity property defined for weak orders.
  Prior work has proposed a different generalization of IRV, which we call Split-IRV, where instead of approving, each vote is interpreted as splitting 1 point equally among its top choices (for example, 0.25 points each if a vote has 4 top choices), and then eliminating the candidate with the lowest score. Split-IRV fails independence of clones, may not respect majority wishes, and fails our monotonicity condition.
  The multi-winner version of IRV is known as Single Transferable Vote (STV). We prove that Approval-STV continues to satisfy the strong proportional representation properties of STV, underlining that the approval way is the right way of extending the IRV/STV idea to weak orders.</description>

      <title>Ordinal Maximin Guarantees for Group Fair Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate fairness in the allocation of indivisible items among groups of agents using the notion of maximin share (MMS). While previous work has shown that no nontrivial multiplicative MMS approximation can be guaranteed in this setting for general group sizes, we demonstrate that ordinal relaxations are much more useful. For example, we show that if $n$ agents are distributed equally across $g$ groups, there exists a $1$-out-of-$k$ MMS allocation for $k = O(g\log(n/g))$, while if all but a constant number of agents are in the same group, we obtain $k = O(\log n/\log \log n)$. We also establish the tightness of these bounds and provide non-asymptotic results for the case of two groups.</description>

      <title>Strategic Network Inspection with Location-Specific Detection Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-person network inspection game, in which a defender positions a limited number of detectors to detect multiple attacks caused by an attacker. We assume that detection is imperfect, and each detector location is associated with a probability of detecting attacks within its set of monitored network components. The objective of the defender (resp. attacker) is to minimize (resp. maximize) the expected number of undetected attacks. To compute Nash Equilibria (NE) for this large-scale zero-sum game, we formulate a linear program with a small number of constraints, which we solve via column generation. We provide an exact mixed-integer program for the pricing problem, which entails computing a defender's pure best response, and leverage its supermodular structure to derive two efficient approaches to obtain approximate NE with theoretical guarantees: A column generation and a multiplicative weights update (MWU) algorithm with approximate best responses. To address the computational challenges posed by combinatorial attacker strategies, each iteration of our MWU algorithm requires computing a projection under the unnormalized relative entropy. We provide a closed-form solution and a linear-time algorithm for the projection problem. Our computational results in real-world gas distribution networks illustrate the performance and scalability of our solution approaches.</description>

      <title>Maximin Shares in Hereditary Set Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible items under the criteria of the maximin share guarantee. Specifically, we study approximation of maximin share allocations under hereditary set system valuations, in which each valuation function is based on the independent sets of an underlying hereditary set systems. Using a lone divider approach, we show the existence of $1/2$-approximate MMS allocations, improving on the $11/30$ guarantee of Li and Vetta. Moreover, we prove that ($2/3 + \epsilon$)-approximate MMS allocations do not always exist in this model for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$, an improvement from the recent $3/4 + \epsilon$ result of Li and Deng. Our existence proof is constructive, but does not directly yield a polynomial-time approximation algorithm. However, we show that a $2/5$-approximate MMS allocation can be found in polynomial time, given valuation oracles. Finally, we show that our existence and approximation results transfer to a variety of problems within constrained fair allocation, improving on existing results in some of these settings.</description>

      <title>Self-adaptive PSRO: Towards an Automatic Population-based Game Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) as a general algorithmic framework has achieved state-of-the-art performance in learning equilibrium policies of two-player zero-sum games. However, the hand-crafted hyperparameter value selection in most of the existing works requires extensive domain knowledge, forming the main barrier to applying PSRO to different games. In this work, we make the first attempt to investigate the possibility of self-adaptively determining the optimal hyperparameter values in the PSRO framework. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) Using several hyperparameters, we propose a parametric PSRO that unifies the gradient descent ascent (GDA) and different PSRO variants. (2) We propose the self-adaptive PSRO (SPSRO) by casting the hyperparameter value selection of the parametric PSRO as a hyperparameter optimization (HPO) problem where our objective is to learn an HPO policy that can self-adaptively determine the optimal hyperparameter values during the running of the parametric PSRO. (3) To overcome the poor performance of online HPO methods, we propose a novel offline HPO approach to optimize the HPO policy based on the Transformer architecture. Experiments on various two-player zero-sum games demonstrate the superiority of SPSRO over different baselines.</description>
