      <description>arXiv:2412.06826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An alternative proof is given for the main result of the article referred to in the title and published in ECP (2024). The proof exploits the theory of regenerative composition structures due to Gnedin and Pitman. The present article is a slight revision of my note written up in May 2024 as a reaction to the preprint arxiv.org version of the paper by Aldous, Janson and Li.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to the giant component fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to study the evolution of the size (i.e. the number of vertices) of the giant component of a random graph process. It is based on the exploration algorithm called simultaneous breadth-first walk, introduced by Limic in 2019, that encodes the dynamic of the evolution of the sizes of the connected components of a large class of random graph processes. We limit our study to the variant of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph process $(G_n(s))_{s\geq 0}$ with $n$ vertices where an edge connecting a pair of vertices appears at an exponential rate 1 waiting time, independently over pairs. We first use the properties of the simultaneous breadth-first walk to obtain an alternative and self-contained proof of the functional central limit theorem recently established by Enriquez, Faraud and Lemaire in the super-critical regime ($s=\frac{c}{n}$ and $c&gt;1$). Next, to show the versatility of our approach, we prove a functional central limit theorem in the barely super-critical regime ($s=\frac{1+t\epsilon_n}{n}$ where $t&gt;0$ and $(\epsilon_n)_n$ is a sequence of positive reals that converges to 0 such that $(n\epsilon_n^3)_n$ tends to $+\infty$).</description>

      <title>Set-valued stochastic integrals in UMD spaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study certain set-valued integrals in UMD Banach spaces and provide a compatible form of the martingale representation theorem for set-valued martingales. Under specific conditions, these martingales can be expressed using revised set-valued stochastic integrals with respect to a real standard Brownian motion $W = (W_t)_{t\in[0,T ]}$. Moreover, we prove the existence of solutions to the following set-valued backward stochastic differential equation of the form $$
  Y_t=\left(\xi+\int_t^TH_u du+\int_{[0,t]}^{\mathscr{R}}{Z}\, dW_u\right) \circleddash \int_{[0,T]}^{\mathscr{R}}{Z}\, dW_u\quad a.s.,\quad t\in [0,T], $$ where the right-hand side, of this equation, represents the Hukuhara difference of two quantities containing revised set-valued stochastic integrals, $\xi$ is a terminal set-valued function condition and $H$ is a set-valued function satisfying some suitable conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a weakly asymmetric exclusion process with long jumps and with infinitely many extended reservoirs. We prove that the stationary fluctuations of the process are governed by the generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process or the stochastic Burgers equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions depending on the strength of the asymmetry of the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Permuton limit of a generalization of the Mallows and $k$-card-minimum models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new random permutation model that generalizes the $k$-card minimum model defined by Travers and the Mallows model. We calculate the permuton limit of such a sequence of random permutations. As a corollary, we deduce the law of large numbers for pattern densities. Moreover, we prove a universality result about the band structure of the limiting permuton, confirming a conjecture of Travers about the $k$-card minimum model. More specifically, we show that if a certain model parameter goes to infinity then the appropriately scaled restriction of the permuton measure to a line that intersects the diagonal perpendicularly converges weakly to the logistic distribution.</description>

      <title>Quasistationarity and extinction for population processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider stochastic population processes that are almost surely absorbed at the origin within finite time. Our interest is in the quasistationary distribution, $\boldsymbol{u}$, and the expected time, $\tau$, from quasistationarity to extinction, both of which we study via WKB approximation. This approach involves solving a Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation specific to the model. We provide conditions under which analytical solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is possible, and give the solution. This provides a first approximation to both $\boldsymbol{u}$ and $\tau$. We provide further conditions under which a corresponding `transport equation' may be solved, leading to an improved approximation of $\boldsymbol{u}$. For multitype birth and death processes, we then consider an alternative approximation for $\boldsymbol{u}$ that is valid close to the origin, provide conditions under which the elements of this alternative approximation may be found explicitly, and hence derive an improved approximation for $\tau$. We illustrate our results in a number of applications.</description>

      <title>A law of large numbers concerning the distribution of critical points of random Fourier series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the flat torus $\mathbb{T}^m=\mathbb{R}^m/\mathbb{Z}^m$ with angular coordinates $\vec{\theta}$ we consider the random function $F_R=\mathfrak{a}\big(\, R^{-1} \sqrt{\Delta}\,\big) W$, where $R&gt;0$, $\Delta$ is the Laplacian on this flat torus, $\mathfrak{a}$ is an even Schwartz function on $\mathbb{R}$ such that $\mathfrak{a}(0)&gt;0$ and $W$ is the Gaussian white noise on $\mathbb{T}^m$ viewed as a random generalized function. For any $f\in C(\mathbb{T}^m)$ we set \[ Z_R(f):=\sum_{\nabla F_R(\vec{\theta})=0} f(\vec{\theta}) \] We prove that if the support of $f$ is contained in a geodesic ball of $\mathbb{T}^m$, then the variance of $Z_R(f)$ is asymptotic to $const\times R^{m}$ as $R\to\infty$. We use this to prove that if $m\geq 2$, then as $N\to\infty$ the random measures $N^{-m}Z_N(-)$ converge a.s. to an explicit multiple of the volume measure on the flat torus.</description>

      <title>An H-theorem for a conditional McKean-Vlasov process related to interacting diffusions on regular trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of the $\kappa$-Markov local-field equation ($\kappa$-MLFE), which is a conditional McKean-Vlasov equation associated with interacting diffusions on the $\kappa$-regular tree. Under suitable assumptions on the coefficients, we prove well-posedness of the $\kappa$-MLFE. We also establish an H-theorem by identifying an energy functional, referred to as the sparse free energy, whose derivative along the measure flow of the $\kappa$-MLFE is given by a nonnegative functional that can be viewed as a modified Fisher information. Moreover, we show that the zeros of the latter functional coincide with the set of stationary distributions of the $\kappa$-MLFE and are also marginals of splitting Gibbs measures on the $\kappa$-regular tree. Furthermore, we show that for a natural class of initial conditions, the corresponding measure flow converges to one of the stationary distributions, thus demonstrating that the sparse free energy acts as a global Lyapunov function. Under mild additional conditions, in the case $\kappa = 2$ we prove that the sparse free energy arises naturally as the renormalized limit of certain relative entropies. We exploit this characterization to prove a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality and establish an exponential rate of convergence of the $2$-MLFE measure flow to its unique stationary distribution.</description>

      <title>Stably unactivated neurons in ReLU neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The choice of architecture of a neural network influences which functions will be realizable by that neural network and, as a result, studying the expressiveness of a chosen architecture has received much attention. In ReLU neural networks, the presence of stably unactivated neurons can reduce the network's expressiveness. In this work, we investigate the probability of a neuron in the second hidden layer of such neural networks being stably unactivated when the weights and biases are initialized from symmetric probability distributions. For networks with input dimension $n_0$, we prove that if the first hidden layer has $n_0+1$ neurons then this probability is exactly $\frac{2^{n_0}+1}{4^{n_0+1}}$, and if the first hidden layer has $n_1$ neurons, $n_1 \le n_0$, then the probability is $\frac{1}{2^{n_1+1}}$. Finally, for the case when the first hidden layer has more neurons than $n_0+1$, a conjecture is proposed along with the rationale. Computational evidence is presented to support the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions on 1d Long-Range Ising Models with Decaying Fields: A Direct Proof via Contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following seminal work by J. Fr\"ohlich and T. Spencer on the critical exponent $\alpha=2$, we give a proof via contours of phase transition in the one-dimensional long-range ferromagnetic Ising model in the entire region of decay, where phase transition is known to occur, i.e., polynomial decay $\alpha \in (1,2]$. No assumptions that the nearest-neighbor interaction $J(1)$ is large are made. The robustness of the method also yields a proof of phase transition in the presence of a nonsummable external field that decays sufficiently fast.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional classification problems with Barron regular boundaries under margin conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a classifier with a Barron-regular decision boundary can be approximated with a rate of high polynomial degree by ReLU neural networks with three hidden layers when a margin condition is assumed. In particular, for strong margin conditions, high-dimensional discontinuous classifiers can be approximated with a rate that is typically only achievable when approximating a low-dimensional smooth function. We demonstrate how these expression rate bounds imply fast-rate learning bounds that are close to $n^{-1}$ where $n$ is the number of samples. In addition, we carry out comprehensive numerical experimentation on binary classification problems with various margins. We study three different dimensions, with the highest dimensional problem corresponding to images from the MNIST data set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish upper and lower universal bounds for potentials of weighted designs on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ that depend only on quadrature nodes and weights derived from the design structure. Our bounds hold for a large class of potentials that includes absolutely monotone functions. The classes of spherical designs attaining these bounds are characterized. Additionally, we study the problem of constrained energy minimization for Borel probability measures on $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ and apply it to optimal distribution of charge supported at a given number of points on the sphere. In particular, our results apply to $p$-frame energy.</description>

      <title>A theory of passive market impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the market impact of aggressive orders has been extensively studied, the impact of passive orders, those executed through limit orders, remains less understood. The goal of this paper is to investigate passive market impact by developing a microstructure model connecting liquidity dynamics and price moves. A key innovation of our approach is to replace the traditional assumption of constant information content for each trade by a function that depends on the available volume in the limit order book. Within this framework, we explore scaling limits and analyze the market impact of passive metaorders. Additionally, we derive useful approximations for the shape of market impact curves, leading to closed-form formulas that can be easily applied in practice.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous Galerkin methods for the complete stochastic Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, stochastic effects have become increasingly relevant for describing fluid behaviour, particularly in the context of turbulence. The most important model for inviscid fluids in computational fluid dynamics are the Euler equations of gas dynamics which we focus on in this paper. To take stochastic effects into account, we incorporate a stochastic forcing term in the momentum equation of the Euler system. To solve the extended system, we apply an entropy dissipative discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method including the Finite Volume setting, adjust it to the stochastic Euler equations and analyze its convergence properties. Our analysis is grounded in the concept of dissipative martingale solutions, as recently introduced by Moyo (J. Diff. Equ. 365, 408-464, 2023). Assuming no vacuum formation and bounded total energy, we proof that our scheme converges in law to a dissipative martingale solution. During the lifespan of a pathwise strong solution, we achieve convergence of at least order 1/2, measured by the expected $L^1$ norm of the relative energy. The results built a counterpart of corresponding results in the deterministic case. In numerical simulations, we show the robustness of our scheme, visualise different stochastic realizations and analyze our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Convergence in Hit-and-Run Monte Carlo and a Coordinate-free Randomized Kaczmarz Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hit-and-Run is a coordinate-free Gibbs sampler, yet the quantitative advantages of its coordinate-free property remain largely unexplored beyond empirical studies. In this paper, we prove sharp estimates for the Wasserstein contraction of Hit-and-Run in Gaussian target measures via coupling methods and conclude mixing time bounds. Our results uncover ballistic and superdiffusive convergence rates in certain settings. Furthermore, we extend these insights to a coordinate-free variant of the randomized Kaczmarz algorithm, an iterative method for linear systems, and demonstrate analogous convergence rates. These findings offer new insights into the advantages and limitations of coordinate-free methods for both sampling and optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power of symbolic computation, as opposed to mere numerical computation, is illustrated with efficient algorithms for studying the generalized gambler's ruin problem in one and two dimensions. We also consider a new generalization of the classical gambler's ruin where we add a third step which we call the mirror step. In this scenario, we provide closed formulas for the probability and expected duration.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a connection between disintegration of measures and geometric properties of probability spaces. We prove a disintegration theorem, addressing disintegration from the perspective of an optimal transport problem. We look at the disintegration of transport plans, which are used to define and study disintegration maps. Using these objects, we study the regularity and absolute continuity of disintegration of measures. In particular, we exhibit conditions for which the disintegration map is weakly continuous and one can obtain a path of measures given by this map. We show a rigidity condition for the disintegration of measures to be given into absolutely continuous measures.</description>

      <title>Maximum Entropy Random Walks: the Infinite Setting and the Example of Spider Networks with their Scaling Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we establish solid foundations for the study of Maximal Entropy Random Walks (MERWs) on infinite graphs. We introduce a generalized definition that extends the original concept, along with rigorous tools for handling this generalization. Unlike conventional simple random walks, which maximize entropy locally, MERWs maximize entropy globally along their paths, marking a significant paradigm shift and presenting substantial computational challenges. Originally introduced by physicists and computer scientists in [1], MERWs have connections to concepts such as Parry measures and Doob h-transforms. Our approach addresses the challenges of existence, uniqueness, and approximation, illustrated through examples and counterexamples. Even in the infinite setting, MERWs continue to maximize the entropy rate, albeit in a less direct manner. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of weighted spider networks, including scaling limits, revealing various phenomena characteristic of the infinite framework, notably a phase transition. A unified proof of scaling limits based on submartingale problems is presented. Furthermore, we consider some extended models, where the spider lattice provides valuable insights, highlighting the complexity of studying these walks for general infinite weighted graphs.</description>

      <title>The extremal position of a branching random walk on the general linear group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a branching random walk $(G_u)_{u\in \mathbb T}$ on the general linear group $\textrm{GL}(V)$ of a finite dimensional space $V$, where $\mathbb T$ is the associated genealogical tree with nodes $u$. For any starting point $v \in V \setminus\{0\}$ with $\|v\|=1$ and $x = \mathbb R v \in \mathbb P(V)$, let $M^x_n=\max_{|u| = n} \log \| G_u v \|$ denote the maximal position of the walk $\log \| G_u v \|$ in the generation $n$. We first show that under suitable conditions, $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{M_n^x }{n} = \gamma$ almost surely, where $\gamma \in \mathbb R$ is a constant. Then, in the case when $\gamma = 0$, under appropriate {\textit boundary conditions}, we refine the last statement by determining the rate of convergence at which $M_n^x$ converges to $-\infty$. We prove in particular that $\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{M_n^x}{\log n} = -\frac{3}{2\alpha}$ in probability, where $\alpha &gt;0$ is a constant determined by the boundary conditions. Analogous properties are established for the minimal position. As a consequence we derive the asymptotic speed of the maximal and minimal positions for the coefficients, the operator norm and the spectral radius of $G_u$.</description>

      <title>Limit Profile for Projections of Random Walks on Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Establishing cutoff, an abrupt transition from "not mixed" to "well mixed", is a classical topic in the theory of mixing times for Markov chains. Interest has grown recently in determining not only the existence of cutoff and the order of its mixing time and window, but the exact shape, or profile, of the convergence inside the window. Classical techniques, such as coupling or $\ell_2$-bounds, are typically too crude to establish this and there has been a push to develop general techniques.
  We build upon this work, extending from conjugacy-invariant random walks on groups to certain projections. We exemplify our method by analysing the $k$-particle interchange process on the complete $n$-graph with $k \asymp n$. This is a projection of the random-transposition card shuffle, which corresponds to $k = n$, analysed by Teyssier.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for first passage times of multivariate perpetuity sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the first passage time $\tau_u = \inf \{ n \geq 1: |V_n| &gt; u \}$ for the multivariate perpetuity sequence $V_n = Q_1 + M_1 Q_2 + \cdots + (M_1 \ldots M_{n-1}) Q_n$, where $(M_n, Q_n)$ is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $M_1$ a $d \times d$ ($d \geq 1$) random matrix with nonnegative entries, and $Q_1$ a nonnegative random vector in $\mathbb R^d$. Here $|\cdot|$ denotes the vector norm. The exact asymptotic for the probability $\mathbb P (\tau_u &lt; \infty)$ as $u \to \infty$ has been found by Kesten (Acta Math. 1973). In this paper we prove a conditioned weak law of large numbers for $\tau_u$: conditioned on the event $\{ \tau_u &lt; \infty \}$, $\frac{\tau_u}{\log u}$ converges in probability to a certain constant $\rho &gt; 0$ as $u \to \infty$. A conditioned central limit theorem for $\tau_u$ is also obtained. We further establish precise large deviation asymptotics for the lower probability $\mathbb P (\tau_u \leq (\beta - l) \log u)$ as $u \to \infty$, where $\beta \in (0, \rho)$ and $l \geq 0$ is a vanishing perturbation satisfying $l \to 0$ as $u \to \infty$. Our results extend those of Buraczewski et al. (Ann. Probab. 2016) from the univariate case ($d=1$) to the multivariate case ($d&gt;1$). As consequences, we deduce exact asymptotics for the pointwise probability $\mathbb P (\tau_u = [(\beta - l) \log u] )$ and the local probability $\mathbb P (\tau_u - (\beta - l) \log u \in (a, a + m ] )$, where $a&lt;0$ and $m \in \mathbb Z_+$. We also establish analogous results for the first passage time $\tau_u^y = \inf \{ n \geq 1: \langle y, V_n \rangle &gt; u \}$, where $y$ is a nonnegative vector in $\mathbb R^d$ with $|y| = 1$.</description>

      <title>Commutation relations for two-sided radial SLE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the commutation relation for 2-radial SLE in the unit disc starting from two boundary points. We follow the framework introduced by Dub\'{e}dat. Under an additional requirement of the interchangeability of the two curves, we classify all locally commuting 2-radial SLE$_\kappa$ for $\kappa\in (0,8)$: it is either a two-sided radial SLE$_\kappa$ with spiral of constant spiraling rate or a chordal SLE$_\kappa$ weighted by a power of the conformal radius of its complement. Namely, for fixed $\kappa$ and starting points, we have exactly two one-parameter continuous families of locally commuting 2-radial SLE. Two-sided radial SLE with spiral is a generalization of two-sided radial SLE (without spiral) and satisfies the resampling property. We also discuss the semiclassical limit of the commutation relation as $\kappa \to 0$. In particular, we show that the limit for the second family with an appropriately chosen power of conformal radius is a chord that minimizes a modified chordal Loewner energy, which is unique only when the endpoints are not antipodal.</description>

Abstract: Through the rotational invariance of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice we express Smirnov's edge parafermionic observable as a sum of two new edge observables. With the help of these two new edge observables we can apply the discrete harmonic analysis and conformal mapping theory to prove the convergence of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice to the trace of $SLE_6$ as the mesh size of the lattice tends to zero.</description>

Abstract: We derive the KPZ equation as a continuum limit of height functions in asymmetric simple exclusion processes with drift that depends on the local particle configuration. To our knowledge, it is a first such result for a class of particle systems without duality or explicit invariant measures. The tools developed in this paper consist of estimates on the corresponding Kolmogorov equations, giving a more robust proof of the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle. These tools are not exclusive to KPZ.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate random walks on the general linear group constrained within a specific domain, with a focus on their asymptotic behavior. In a previous work [38], we constructed the associated harmonic measure, a key element in formulating the local limit theorem for conditioned random walks on groups. The primary aim of this paper is to prove this theorem. The main challenge arises from studying the conditioned reverse walk, whose increments, in the context of random walks on groups, depend on the entire future. To achieve our goal, we combine a Caravenna-type conditioned local limit theorem with the conditioned version of the central limit theorem for the reversed walk. The resulting local limit theorem is then applied to derive the local behavior of the exit time.</description>

      <title>Randomized Geodesic Flow on Hyperbolic Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by Gromov's geodesic flow problem on hyperbolic groups $G$, we develop in this paper an analog using random walks. This leads to a notion of a harmonic analog $\Theta$ of the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure on $\partial^2 G$. We provide three different but related constructions of $\Theta$: 1) by moving the base-point along a quasigeodesic ray 2) by moving the base-point along random walk trajectories 3) directly as a push-forward under the boundary map to $\partial^2 G$ of a measure inherited from studying all bi-infinite random walk trajectories (with no restriction on base-point) on $G^{\mathbb{Z}}$.
  Of these, the third construction is the most involved and needs new techniques. It relies on developing a framework where we can treat bi-infinite random walk trajectories as analogs of bi-infinite geodesics on complete simply connected negatively curved manifolds. Geodesic flow on a hyperbolic group is typically not well-defined due to non-uniqueness of geodesics. We circumvent this problem in the random walk setup by considering \emph{all} trajectories. We thus get a well-defined \emph{discrete flow} given by the $\mathbb{Z}-$shift on bi-infinite random walk trajectories. The $\mathbb{Z}-$shift is the random analog of the time one map of the geodesic flow. As an analog of ergodicity of the geodesic flow on a closed negatively curved manifold, we establish ergodicity of the $G$-action on $(\partial^2G, \Theta)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measures of accuracy usually score how accurate a specified credence depending on whether the proposition is true or false. A key requirement for such measures is strict propriety; that probabilities expect themselves to be most accurate. We discuss characterisation results for strictly proper measures of accuracy.
  By making some restrictive assumptions, we present the proof of the characterisation result of Schervish (1989) in an accessible way. We will also present the characterisation in terms of Bregman divergences and the relationship between the two characterisations.
  The new contribution of the paper is to show that the Schervish form characterises proper measures of accuracy for estimates of random variables more generally, by offering a converse to Schervish, Seidenfeld, and Kadane (2014, Lemma 1). We also provide a Bregman divergence characterisation in the estimates setting, using the close relationship between the two forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We sample from a given target distribution by constructing a neural network which maps samples from a simple reference, e.g. the standard normal distribution, to samples from the target. To that end, we propose using a neural network architecture inspired by the Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm. Based on LMC perturbation results, we show approximation rates of the proposed architecture for smooth, log-concave target distributions measured in the Wasserstein-$2$ distance. The analysis heavily relies on the notion of sub-Gaussianity of the intermediate measures of the perturbed LMC process. In particular, we derive bounds on the growth of the intermediate variance proxies under different assumptions on the perturbations. Moreover, we propose an architecture similar to deep residual neural networks and derive expressivity results for approximating the sample to target distribution map.</description>

      <title>Entropy on the path space and application to singular diffusions and mean-field models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we intend to present a unified treatment of a variety of singular interacting particle systems and their McKean-Vlasov limits. This unified approach is based on the use of the relative entropy on the path space in the spirit of our previous works together with C. L{\'e}onard. We show how it can be used to derive existence and uniqueness for some singular diffusions, in particular linear mean field stochastic particle systems and non linear SDE of McKean-Vlasov type, including $\mathbf L^p-\mathbf L^q$ models, the 2D vortex model associated to the 2D Navier-Stokes equation, sub-Coulombic interactions models or the Patlak-Keller-Segel model.  We also show the convergence and propagation of chaos as the number of particles grows to infinity. This is (mainly) obtained at the process level, not only at the Liouville equation (marginals flow) level. The paper thus contains new proofs and extensions of known results, as well as new results.The main results are given at the end of the Introduction.</description>

      <title>LIPO+: Frugal Global Optimization for Lipschitz Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose simple yet effective empirical improvements to the algorithms of the LIPO family, introduced in [Malherbe2017], that we call LIPO+ and AdaLIPO+. We compare our methods to the vanilla versions of the algorithms over standard benchmark functions and show that they converge significantly faster. Finally, we show that the LIPO family is very prone to the curse of dimensionality and tends quickly to Pure Random Search when the dimension increases. We give a proof for this, which is also formalized in Lean mathematical language. Source codes and a demo are provided online.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time persuasion by filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We frame dynamic persuasion in a partial observation stochastic control Leader-Follower game with an ergodic criterion. The Receiver controls the dynamics of a multidimensional unobserved state process. Information is provided to the Receiver through a device designed by the Sender that generates the observation process. The commitment of the Sender is enforced. We develop this approach in the case where all dynamics are linear and the preferences of the Receiver are linear-quadratic. We prove a verification theorem for the existence and uniqueness of the solution of the HJB equation satisfied by the Receiver's value function. An extension to the case of persuasion of a mean field of interacting Receivers is also provided. We illustrate this approach in two applications: the provision of information to electricity consumers with a smart meter designed by an electricity producer; the information provided by carbon footprint accounting rules to companies engaged in a best-in-class emissions reduction effort. In the first application, we link the benefits of information provision to the mispricing of electricity production. In the latter, we show that information provision is a substitute for best-in-class objective.</description>

      <title>Disease Incidence in a Stochastic SVIRS Model with Waning Immunity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14883v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with the long-term behaviour and incidence of a vaccine-preventable contact disease, under the assumption that both vaccine protection and immunity after recovery are not lifelong. The mathematical model is developed in a stochastic markovian framework. The evolution of the disease in a finite population is thus represented by a three-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain, which is versatile enough to be able to compensate for the loss of protection by including vaccination before the onset of the outbreak and also during the course of the epidemics.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence of a semi-implicit time Euler scheme for a 2D B\'enard-Boussinesq model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a semi-implicit time Euler scheme for the two-dimensional B\'enard-Boussinesq model on the torus D converges. The rate of convergence in probability is almost 1/2 for a multiplicative noise; this relies on moment estimates in various norms for the processes and the scheme.
  In case of an additive noise, due to the coupling of the equations, provided that the difference on temperature between the top and bottom parts of the torus is not too big compared to the viscosity and thermal diffusivity, a strong polynomial rate of convergence (almost 1/2) is proven in $(L^2(D))^2$ for the velocity and in $L^2(D)$ for the temperature.
  It depends on exponential moments of the scheme; due to linear terms involving the other quantity in both evolution equations, the proof has to be done simultaneaously for both the velocity and the temperature. These rates in both cases are similar to that obtained for the Navier-Stokes equation.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the set of zero-noise limits measures of perturbed cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We add small random perturbations to a cellular automaton and consider the one-parameter family $(F_\epsilon)_{\epsilon&gt;0}$ parameterized by $\epsilon$ where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is the level of noise. The objective of the article is to study the set of limiting invariant distributions as $\epsilon$ tends to zero denoted $\mathcal{M}_0^l$. Some topological obstructions appear, $\mathcal{M}_0^l$ is compact and connected, as well as combinatorial obstructions as the set of cellular automata is countable: $\mathcal{M}_0^l$ is $\Pi_3$-computable in general and $\Pi_2$-computable if it is uniformly approached. Reciprocally, for any set of probability measures $\mathcal{K}$ which is compact, connected and $\Pi_2$-computable, we construct a cellular automaton whose perturbations by an uniform noise admit $\mathcal{K}$ as the zero-noise limits measure and this set is uniformly approached. To finish, we study how the set of limiting invariant measures can depend on a bias in the noise. We construct a cellular automaton which realizes any connected compact set (without computable constraints) if the bias is changed for an arbitrary small value. In some sense this cellular automaton is very unstable with respect to the noise.</description>
