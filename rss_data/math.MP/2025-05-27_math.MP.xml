      <title>Wave pulses with unusual asymptotical behavior at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of wave signals in the far zone is not only of theoretical interest but also of paramount practical importance in communications and other fields of applications of optical, electromagnetic or acoustic waves. Long time ago T. T. Wu introduced models of 'electromagnetic missiles' whose decay could be made arbitrarily slower than the usual inverse distance by an appropriate choice of the high frequency portion of the source spectrum. Very recent work by Plachenov and Kiselev introduced a finite-energy scalar wave solution, different from Wu's, decaying slower than inversely proportional with the distance. A physical explanation for the unusual asymptotic behavior of the latter will be given in this article. Furthermore, two additional examples of scalar wave pulses characterized by abnormal slow decay in the far zone will be given and their asymptotic behavior will be discussed. A proof of feasibility of acoustic and electromagnetic fields with the abnormal asymptotics will be described.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study from a statistical mechanics viewpoint some of the simplest mathematical objects, finite pure sets. Starting from the empty set, new generations are produced step by step, sets of the next generation being those whose elements are the sets of the current generation. We compute in particular correlations and limiting laws for chains of various lengths for the membership relation when the number of generations becomes large.</description>

      <title>Multipole Distributions and Hyper-Flux Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We outline here a simple mathematical introduction to the notions of multipoles for a general extensive property $\Pi$ from the point of view of continuum mechanics. Classically, $\Pi$ is the electric charge, but the theory is not limited to electrostatics. The proposed framework allows a simple computation of the bound "charges" and bound multipoles of lower orders. In addition, if the property $\Pi$ has a potential function in the sense described below, a general expression for the mechanical force (power) functional acting on bodies containing the property is presented. Finally, using a similar viewpoint, we consider hyper-fluxes -- flux fields of tensorial order greater than one -- and show that moving multipoles (in particular, a moving dielectric) give rise to hyper-fluxes.</description>

      <title>Local isometric immersions of pseudospherical surfaces described by a class of third order partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of local isometric immersion of pseudospherical surfaces determined by the solutions of a class of third order nonlinear partial differential equations with the type $u_t - u_{xxt} = \lambda u^2 u_{xxx} + G(u, u_x, u_{xx}),(\lambda\in\mathbb{R})$. We prove that there is only two subclasses of equations admitting a local isometric immersion into the three dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{E}^3$ for which the coefficients of the second fundamental form depend on a jet of finite order of $u$, and furthermore, these coefficients are universal, namely, they are functions of $x$ and $t$, independent of $u$. Finally, we show that the generalized Camassa-Holm equation describing pseudospherical surfaces has a universal second fundamental form.</description>

      <title>A space-dependent Boltzmann-BGK model for gas mixtures and its hydrodynamic limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hybrid Boltzmann-BGK model for inert mixtures, where each kind of binary interaction may be described by a classical Boltzmann integral or by a suitable relaxation-type operator. We allow also the possibility of changing the option Boltzmann/BGK operator according to the space position. We prove that this model guarantees conservations of species masses, global momentum and energy, as well as the entropy dissipation, leading to the expected Maxwellian equilibria with all species sharing the same mean velocity and the same temperature. We investigate then such mixed kinetic equations in three different hydrodynamic limits: the classical collision dominated regime, a situation with dominant intra-species collisions, and a mixture with heavy and light particles leading to a kinetic-fluid description.</description>

      <title>On the asymptotic scaling of the von Neumann entropy in quasifree fermionic right mover/left mover systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the general class of quasifree fermionic right mover/left mover systems over the infinitely extended two-sided discrete line introduced in [8] within the algebraic framework of quantum statistical mechanics, we study the von Neumann entropy of a contiguous subsystem of finite length in interaction with its environment. In particular, under the assumption of spatial translation invariance, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the von Neumann entropy for large subsystem lengths and prove that its leading order density is, in general, nonvanishing and displays the signature of a mixture of the independent thermal species underlying the right mover/left mover system. As special cases, the formalism covers so-called nonequilibrium steady states, thermal equilibrium states, and ground states. Moreover, for general Fermi functions, we derive a necessary and sufficient criterion for the von Neumann entropy density to vanish.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Renormalization of the van Hove-Miyatake Model: an Algebraic and Hamiltonian Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short communication we discuss the ultraviolet renormalization of the van Hove-Miyatake scalar field, generated by any distributional source. An abstract algebraic approach, based on the study of a special class of ground states of the van Hove-Miyatake dynamical map is compared with an Hamiltonian renormalization that makes use of a non-unitary dressing transformation. The two approaches are proved to yield equivalent results.</description>

      <title>The modular Hamiltonian in asymptotically flat spacetime conformal to Minkowski</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a four-dimensional globally hyperbolic spacetime $(M,g)$ conformal to Minkowski spacetime, together with a massless, conformally coupled scalar field. Using a bulk-to-boundary correspondence, one can establish the existence of an injective $*$-homomorphism $\Upsilon_M$ between $\mathcal{W}(M)$, the Weyl algebra of observables on $M$ and a counterpart which is defined intrinsically on future null infinity $\Im^+\simeq\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{S}^2$, a component of the conformal boundary of $(M,g)$. Using invariance under the asymptotic symmetry group of $\Im^+$, we can individuate thereon a distinguished two-point correlation function whose pull-back to $M$ via $\Upsilon_M$ identifies a quasi-free Hadamard state for the bulk algebra of observables. In this setting, if we consider $\mathsf{V}^+_x$, a future light cone stemming from $x\in M$ as well as $\mathcal{W}(\mathsf{V}^+_x)=\mathcal{W}(M)|_{\mathsf{V}^+_x}$, its counterpart at the boundary is the Weyl subalgebra generated by suitable functions localized in $\mathsf{K}_x$, a positive half strip on $\Im^+$. To each such cone, we associate a standard subspace of the boundary one-particle Hilbert space, which coincides with the one associated naturally to $\mathsf{K}_x$. We extend such correspondence replacing $\mathsf{K}_x$ and $\mathsf{V}^+_x$ with deformed counterparts, denoted by $\mathsf{S}_C$ and $\mathsf{V}_C$. In addition, since the one particle Hilbert space at the boundary decomposes as a direct integral on the sphere of $U(1)$-currents defined on the real line, we prove that also the generator of the modular group associated to the standard subspace of $\mathsf{V}_C$ decomposes as a suitable direct integral. This result allows us to study the relative entropy between coherent states of the algebras associated to the deformed cones $\mathsf{V}_C$ establishing the quantum null energy condition.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Levi-Civita connections in noncommutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare the constructions of Levi-Civita connections for noncommutative algebras developed in arXiv:1505.07330, arXiv:1809.06721, arXiv:2403.13735. The assumptions in these various constructions differ, but when they are all defined, we provide direct translations between them. An essential assumption is that the (indefinite) Hermitian inner product on differential forms/vector fields provides an isomorphism with the module dual. By exploiting our translations and clarifying the simplifications that occur for centred bimodules, we extend the existence results for Hermitian torsion-free connections in arXiv:1505.07330, arXiv:1809.06721.</description>

      <title>On the time-dependent Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the time-dependent Born-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA) of a classical quantum molecule involving a possibly large number of nuclei and electrons, described by a Schr\"odinger equation. In the spirit of Born and Oppenheimer's original idea we study quantitatively the approximation of the molecular evolution. We obtain an iterable approximation of the molecular evolution to arbitrary order and we derive an effective equation for the reduced dynamics involving the nuclei equivalent to the original Schr\"odinger equation and containing no electron variables. We estimate the coefficients of the new equation and find tractable approximations for the molecular dynamics going beyond the one corresponding to the original Born and Oppenheimer approximation.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Kramers' Law: Hasselmann's Program and AMOC Tipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In bistable dynamical systems driven by Wiener processes, the widely used Kramers' law relates the strength of the noise forcing to the average time it takes to see a noise-induced transition from one attractor to the other. We extend this law to bistable systems forced with fast chaotic dynamics, which we argue to be a more realistic modeling approach than unbounded noise forcing in some cases. We test our results numerically in a reduced-order model of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and discuss the limits of the chaotic Kramers' law as well as its surprisingly wide parameter range of applicability. Hereby, we show in detail how to apply Hasselmann's program in practice and give a possible explanation for recent findings of AMOC collapse and recovery in complex climate models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze an approximation of a Laplacian subject to non-local interface conditions of a $\delta'$-type by Neumann Laplacians on a family of Riemannian manifolds with a sieve-like structure. We establish a (kind of) resolvent convergence for such operators, which in turn implies the convergence of spectra and eigenspaces, and demonstrate convergence of the corresponding semigroups. Moreover, we provide an explicit example of a manifold allowing to realize any prescribed integral kernel appearing in that interface conditions. Finally, we extend the discussion to similar approximations for the Laplacian with non-local Robin-type boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: In this article we study the semiclassical asymptotics of the Martinet sub-Laplacian on the flat toroidal cylinder $M = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{T}^2$. We describe the asymptotic distribution of sequences of eigenfunctions oscillating at different scales prefixed by Rothschild-Stein estimates by the introduction of adapted two-microlocal semiclassical measures. We obtain concentration and invariance properties of these measures in terms of effective dynamics governed by harmonic or an-harmonic oscillators depending on the regime, and we show new weak-dispersive properties with respect to critical points of the eigenvalues of the Montgomery family of quartic oscillators.</description>

Abstract: In this article we discuss the magnetic Schroedinger operator $H= (i \nabla +A)^2-V$ on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a non-negative potential $V$ supported over the tube built along a curve which is a local deformation of a straight one, and the magnetic field $B := \mathrm{rot}(A)$ is assumed to be nonzero and local. For the latter, we prove that the magnetic field does not change the essential spectrum of this system, and investigate a sufficient condition for the discrete spectrum of $H$ to be empty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present some new Poisson bivectors that are invariants by the flow of the nonholonomic Suslov problem. Two rank four invariant Poisson bivectors have globally defined Casimir functions and, therefore, define cubic Poisson brackets on the five dimensional state space with standard symplectic leaves. For the Suslov gyrostat in the potential field we found rank two Poisson bivectors having only two globally defined Casimir functions and, therefore, we say about formal Hamiltonian description in these cases.</description>

Abstract: We study the joint action of the Bethe algebra $\mathcal{B}_d^{\bf{w}}$ for the general linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_d$ with respect to ${\bf w} \in \mathbb{C}^d$ and the Bethe algebra $\mathcal{B}_{p+m|q+n}^{\bf{z}}$ for the general linear Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$ with respect to ${\bf z} \in \mathbb{C}^{p+q+m+n}$ on the Fock space of $d(p+m)$ bosonic and $d(q+n)$ fermionic oscillators. We establish a duality, called the Bethe duality of $(\mathfrak{gl}_d, \mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n})$, which is an equivalence between the actions of the algebras $\mathcal{B}_d^{\bf{w}}$ and $\mathcal{B}_{p+m|q+n}^{\bf{z}}$ on the Fock space. As an application, we show that the action of $\mathcal{B}_{p+m|q+n}^{\bf{z}}$ on each weight space of the evaluation module $\underline{M}({\bf w})$, where $\underline{M}$ is a $d$-fold tensor product of certain classes of infinite-dimensional unitarizable highest weight $\mathfrak{gl}_{p+m|q+n}$-modules, is a cyclic $\mathcal{B}_{p+m|q+n}^{\bf{z}}$-module, and that $\mathcal{B}_{p+m|q+n}^{\bf{z}}$ is diagonalizable with a simple spectrum on the weight space for generic $\bf{w}$ and $\bf{z}$.</description>

      <title>Tight Generalization of Robertson-Type Uncertainty Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the tightest possible Robertson-type preparation uncertainty relation, which explicitly depends on the eigenvalue spectrum of the quantum state. The conventional constant 1/4 is replaced by a state-dependent coefficient with the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the density operator. This coefficient is optimal among all Robertson-type generalizations and does not admit further improvement. Our relation becomes more pronounced as the quantum state becomes more mixed, capturing a trade-off in quantum uncertainty that the conventional Robertson relation fails to detect. In addition, our result provides a strict generalization of the Schroedinger uncertainty relation, showing that the uncertainty trade-off is governed by the sum of the covariance term and a state-dependent improvement over the Robertson bound. As applications, we also refine error-disturbance trade-offs by incorporating spectral information of both the system and the measuring apparatus, thereby generalizing the Arthurs-Goodman and Ozawa inequalities.</description>

      <title>Robust quantification of spectral transitions in perturbed quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum system subject to an external perturbation can experience leakage between uncoupled regions of its energy spectrum separated by a gap. To quantify this phenomenon, we present two complementary results. First, we establish time-independent bounds on the distances between the true dynamics and the dynamics generated by block-diagonal effective evolutions constructed via the Schrieffer-Wolff and Bloch methods. Second, we prove that, under the right conditions, this leakage remains small eternally. That is, we derive a time-independent bound on the leakage itself, expressed in terms of the spectral gap of the unperturbed Hamiltonian and the norm of the perturbation, ensuring its validity for arbitrarily large times. Our approach only requires a finite spectral gap, thus accommodating continuous and unbounded spectra. Finally, we apply our bounds to specific systems of practical interest.</description>

      <title>Critical dynamical fluctuations in reaction-diffusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional microscopic reaction-diffusion process obtained as a superposition of a Glauber and a Kawasaki dynamics. The reaction term is tuned so that a dynamical phase transition occurs in the model as a suitable parameter is varied. We study dynamical fluctuations of the density field at the critical point.
  We characterise the slowdown of the dynamics at criticality, and prove that this slowdown is induced by a single observable, the global density (or magnetisation). We show that magnetisation fluctuations are non-Gaussian and characterise their limit as the solution of a non-linear SDE. We prove, furthermore, that other observables remain fast: the density field acting on the fast modes (i.e. on mean-0 test functions) and with Gaussian scaling converges, in the sense of finite dimensional distributions, to a Gaussian field with space-time covariance that we compute explicitly.
  The proof relies on a decoupling of slow and fast modes relying in particular on a relative entropy argument. Major technical difficulties include the fact that local equilibrium does not hold due to the non-linearity, and proving replacement estimates on diverging time intervals due to critical slowdown.</description>

      <title>Integrability of the Kondo model with time dependent interaction strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we consider the time dependent Kondo model where a magnetic impurity interacts with the electrons through a time dependent interaction strength $J(t)$. Using the Bethe ansatz framework, an exact solution to the time dependent Schrodinger equation is constructed. We show that when periodic boundary conditions are applied, the consistency of the solution results in a constraint equation which relates the amplitudes corresponding to a certain ordering of the particles in the configuration space. This constraint equation takes the form of a matrix difference equation, and the associated consistency conditions restrict the interaction strength $J(t)$ for the system to be integrable. For a given $J(t)$ satisfying these constraints, the solution to the matrix difference equations provides the exact many-body wavefunction that satisfies the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The framework developed in this work is general and provides a method to solve new class of Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strength which are based on quantum Yang-Baxter algebra.</description>

      <title>Derivations for the MPS overlap formulas of rational spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a universal formula for the overlaps between integrable matrix product states (MPS) and Bethe eigenstates in $\mathfrak{gl}_{N}$ symmetric spin chains. This formula expresses the normalized overlap as a product of a MPS-independent Gaudin-determinant ratio and a MPS-dependent scalar factor constructed from eigenvalues of commuting operators, defined via the $K$-matrix associated with the MPS. Our proof is fully representation-independent and relies solely on algebraic Bethe Ansatz techniques and the $KT$-relation. We also propose a generalization of the overlap formula to $\mathfrak{so}_{N}$ and $\mathfrak{sp}_{N}$ spin chains, supported by algebra embeddings and low-rank isomorphisms. These results significantly broaden the class of integrable initial states for which exact overlap formulas are available, with implications for quantum quenches and defect CFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the methods of quantisation ideals, we construct a family of quantisations corresponding to Case alpha in Sergeev's classification of solutions to the tetrahedron equation. This solution describes transformations between special parametrisations of the space of unipotent matrices with noncommutative coefficients. We analyse the classical limit of this family and construct a pencil of compatible Poisson brackets that remain invariant under the re-parametrisation maps (mutations). This decomposition problem is closely related to Lusztig's framework, which makes links with the theory of cluster algebras. Our construction differs from the standard family of Poisson structures in cluster theory; it provides deformations of log-canonical brackets. Additionally, we identify a family of integrable systems defined on the parametrisation charts, compatible with mutations.</description>

      <title>On geometric bases for A-polynomials II: $\mathfrak{su}_3$ and Kuberberg bracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of quantum A-polynomials -- equations for knot polynomials with respect to their coloring (representation-dependence) -- as the relations between different links, obtained by hanging additional ``simple'' components on the original knot. Depending on the choice of this ``decoration'', the knot polynomial is either multiplied by a number or decomposes into a sum over ``surrounding'' representations by a cabling procedure. What happens is that these two of decorations, when complicated enough, become dependent -- and this provides an equation. Remarkably it can be made independent of the representation. However, the equivalence of links is not a topological property -- it follows from the properties of $R$-matrices, and strongly depends on the choice the gauge group and particular links. The relatively well studied part of the story concerns $\mathfrak{su}_2$, where $R$-matrices can be chosen in an especially convenient Kauffman form, what makes the derivation of equations rather geometrical. To make these geometric methods somewhat simpler we suggest to use an arcade formalism/representation of the braid group to simplify decorating links universally. Here we attempt to extend this technique to the next case, $\mathfrak{su}_3$, where the Kauffman rule is substituted by a more involved Kuberberg rule, still remains more geometric than generic analysis of MOY-diagrams, needed for higher ranks. Already in this case we encounter a classification problem for possible ``decorations'' and emergence of two-lined Young diagrams in enumeration of representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive new formulas for the expectation and variance of Wilson loops for any contractible simple loop on a compact orientable surface of genus $1$ and higher, in the model of two-dimensional Yang--Mills theory with structure group $\mathrm{U}(N)$. They are written in terms of a Gaussian measure on the dual of $\mathrm{U}(N)$ introduced recently by the author and M. Ma\"ida \cite{LM3}. From these formulas, we prove a quantitative result on the convergence of the expectation and variance as $N$ tends to infinity, refining a result of the author and A. Dahlqvist \cite{DL}. We finally derive the large $g$ limit of the Wilson loop expectation and variance, by analogy with the study of integrals on moduli spaces of compact hyperbolic surfaces. Surprisingly, the variance does not vanish in this regime, but there are no nontrivial fluctuations of any order.</description>

Abstract: We provide a rigorous construction of a large class of generalized spin-boson models with ultraviolet-divergent form factors. This class comprises various models of many possibly non-identical atoms with arbitrary but finite numbers of levels, interacting with a boson field. Ultraviolet divergences are assumed to be mild, such that no self-energy renormalization is necessary. Our construction is based on recent results by A. Posilicano, which also allow us to state an explicit formula for the domain of self-adjointness for our Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>On the bifurcation of a Dirac point in a photonic waveguide without band gap openning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in topological insulators and topological phases of matter has motivated new methods for the localization of waves in photonic structures. Especially, it is established that a Dirac point of a periodic structure can bifurcate into in-gap eigenvalues if the periodic structure is perturbed differently on the two sides of an interface and if a common band gap can be opened for the two perturbed periodic structures near the Dirac point. The associated eigenmodes are localized near the interface and decay exponentially away from it. This paper addresses the less-known situation when the perturbation only lifts the degeneracy of the Dirac point without opening a band gap. Using a two-dimensional waveguide model, we constructed a wave mode bifurcated from a Dirac point of a periodic waveguide. We show that when the constructed mode couples to an analytically continued Floquet-Bloch mode near the Dirac energy, its eigenvalue acquires a strictly negative imaginary part, making the mode resonant. On the other hand, when the coupling vanishes, the imaginary part of the eigenvalue turns to zero, and the constructed mode becomes an interface mode that decays exponentially away from the interface. The developed method can be extended to other settings, thus providing a clear answer to the problem concerning the bifurcation of Dirac points.</description>

Abstract: Quantum $L_\infty$ algebras are higher loop generalizations of cyclic $L_\infty$ algebras. Motivated by the problem of defining morphisms between such algebras, we construct a linear category of $(-1)$-shifted symplectic vector spaces and distributional half-densities, originally proposed by \v{S}evera. Morphisms in this category can be given both by formal half-densities and Lagrangian relations; we prove that the composition of such morphisms recovers the construction of homotopy transfer of quantum $L_\infty$ algebras. Finally, using this category, we propose a new notion of a relation between quantum $L_\infty$ algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information field theory (IFT) is an emerging technique for posing infinite-dimensional inverse problems using the mathematics found in quantum field theory. Under IFT, the field inference task is formulated in a Bayesian setting where the probability measures are defined by path integrals. We derive conditions under which IFT inverse problems have unique maximum a posterioi estimates, placing a special focus on the problem of identifying model-form error. We define physics-informed priors over fields, where a parameter, called the model trust, measures our belief in the physical model. Smaller values of trust cause the prior to diffuse, representing a larger degree of uncertainty about the physics. To detect model-form error, we learn the trust as part of the inverse problem and study the limiting behavior. We provide an example where the physics are assumed to be the Poisson equation and study the effect of model-form error on the model trust. We find that a correct model leads to infinite trust, and under model-form error, physics that are closer to the ground truth lead to larger values of the trust.</description>

Abstract: Single-particle continuum models such as the popular Bistritzer-MacDonald model have become powerful tools for predicting electronic phenomena of incommensurate 2D materials and the development of many-body models aimed to model unconventional superconductivity and correlated insulators. In this work, we introduce a procedure to construct continuum models of arbitrary accuracy relative to tight-binding models for moir\'{e} incommensurate bilayers. This is done by recognizing the continuum model as arising from Taylor expansions of a high accuracy momentum space approximation of the tight-binding model. We apply our procedure in full detail to two models of twisted bilayer graphene and demonstrate both admit the Bistritzer-MacDonald model as the leading order continuum model, while higher order expansions reveal qualitative spectral differences.</description>

      <title>A family of instanton-invariants for four-manifolds and their relation to Khovanov homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article reviews Witten's gauge-theoretic approach to Khovanov homology from the perspective of Haydys-Witten instanton Floer theory. Expanding on Witten's arguments, we introduce a one-parameter family of instanton Floer homology groups $HF_{\theta}(W^4)$, which, based on physical arguments, are expected to be topological invariants of the four-manifold $W^4$. In analogy to the original Yang-Mills instanton Floer theory, these groups are defined by the solutions of the $\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations on $W^4$ modulo instanton solutions of the Haydys-Witten equations that interpolate between them on the five-dimensional cylinder $\mathbb{R}_s \times W^4$. The relation to knot invariants arises when the four-manifold is the geometric blowup $W^4 = [X^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+, K]$ along a knot $K \subset X^3 \times \{0\}$ embedded in its three-dimensional boundary. The boundaries and corners of this manifold require the specification of boundary conditions that preserve the topological invariance of the construction and are fundamentally linked to various dimensional reductions of the Haydys-Witten equations. We provide a comprehensive discussion of these dimensional reductions and relate them to well-known gauge-theoretic equations in lower dimensions, including the $\theta$-Kapustin-Witten equations, twisted extended Bogomolny equations, and twisted octonionic Nahm equations. Along the way, we record novel results on the elliptic regularity of the Haydys-Witten equations with twisted Nahm pole boundary conditions. The upshot of the article is a tentative definition of Haydys-Witten Floer theory and a precise restatement of Witten's conjecture: an equality between the Haydys-Witten Floer homology $HF^\bullet_{\pi/2}([S^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+, K])$ and Khovanov homology $Kh^\bullet(K)$.</description>

      <title>Localization for random operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with the long-range hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate random operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with H\"older continuously distributed potentials and the long-range hopping. The hopping amplitude decays with the inter-particle distance $\|\bm x\|$ as $e^{-\log^{\rho}(\|\bm x\|+1)}$ with $\rho&gt;1,\bm x\in\Z^d$. By employing the multi-scale analysis (MSA) technique, we prove that for large disorder, the random operators have pure point spectrum with localized eigenfunctions whose decay rate is the same as the hopping term. This gives a partial answer to a conjecture of Yeung and Oono [{\it Europhys. Lett.} 4(9), (1987): 1061-1065].</description>

      <title>Invariance of intrinsic hypercontractivity under perturbation of Schr\"odinger operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Schr\"odinger operator that is bounded below and has a unique positive ground state can be transformed into a Dirichlet form operator by the ground state transformation. If the resulting Dirichlet form operator is hypercontractive, Davies and Simon call the Schr\"odinger operator ``intrinsically hypercontractive". I will show that if one adds a suitable potential onto an intrinsically hypercontractive Schr\"odinger operator it remains intrinsically hypercontractive. The proof uses a fortuitous relation between the WKB equation and logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. All bounds are dimension independent. The main theorem will be applied to several examples.</description>

      <title>Momentum coupling of classical atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new method, dual-space cluster expansion, is proposed to study classical phases transitions in the continuum. It relies on replacing the particle positions as integration variables by the momenta of the relative displacements of particle pairs. Due to the requirement that the particles must be static, coupling via the momenta partitions the set of particles into a set of clusters, and transforms the partition function into a sum over the different cluster decompositions. This allows us to derive a formula for the density that finite clusters can carry in the infinite system. In a simplified example, we then demonstrate that in two and higher dimensions this density has a threshold, beyond which the particles form infinite clusters. The transition is accompanied by a singularity in the free energy. We also show that infinite clusters are always present in condensed phases, most likely submacroscopic in liquids and macroscopic in crystals.</description>

Abstract: We describe deformations of the classical principle chiral model and 1+1 Gaudin model related to ${\rm GL}_N$ Lie group. The deformations are generated by $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation. Using the coefficients of the expansion for these $R$-matrices we derive equations of motion based on a certain ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair satisfying the Zakharov-Shabat equation. Another deformation comes from the twist function, which we identify with the cocentral charge in the affine Higgs bundle underlying the Hitchin approach to 2d integrable models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we establish the bulk-edge correspondence principle for finite two-dimensional photonic structures. Specifically, we focus on the divergence-form operator with periodic coefficients and prove the equality between the well-known gap Chern number (the bulk invariant) and an edge index defined via a trace formula for the operator restricted to a finite domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We demonstrate that the edge index characterizes the circulation of electromagnetic energy along the system's boundary, and the BEC principle is a consequence of energy conservation. The proof leverages Green function techniques and can be extended to other systems. These results provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for designing robust topological photonic devices with finite geometries, complementing recent advances in discrete models.</description>

      <title>Hard to soft edge transition for the Muttalib-Borodin ensembles with integer parameter $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find the universal limiting correlation kernels of the Muttalib-Borodin (MB) ensembles with integer parameter $\theta \geq 2$ at $0$ in the transitive regime between the hard edge regime and the soft edge regime. This generalizes the previously studied hard edge to soft edge transition in unitarily invariant random matrix theory by Its, Kuijlaars and \"{O}stensson, which is the $\theta = 1$ special case of our MB ensemble. The derivation is based on the vector Riemann-Hilbert (RH) problems for the biorthogonal polynomials associated with the MB ensemble. In the analysis of the RH problems, we construct matrix-valued model RH problems of size $(\theta + 1) \times (\theta + 1)$, and prove the solvability of the model RH problems by a vanishing lemma. The new limiting correlation kernels are proved to be universal for a large class of potential functions, and they interpolate the Meijer G-kernels for the hard edge regime and the Airy kernel for the soft edge regime. We observe that the new limiting correlation kernels have the integrability that is not seen in previous studies in random matrix theory and determinantal point processes. In the $\theta = 2$ case, we give a detailed analysis of the Lax pair associated with the model RH problem, show that it results in the Chazy I equation, which has a Painlev\'{e} IV reduction, and find that the Lax pair is in the Drinfeld-Sokolov hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Lagrangian and Multisymplectic Hamiltonian Formalisms for the Description of Classical Fields Interacting with Point Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The multisymplectic Hamiltonian formalism is a generalization of the Hamiltonian formalism that is known to manifestly preserve Lorentz covariance in the description of fields and has been suggested as a possible path for developing a covariant canonical quantization process. However, since this formalism allows for multiple definitions of Poisson brackets, its practical use in field theory has been very limited. In this paper, we demonstrate the equivalence between the Lagrangian and the multisymplectic Hamiltonian formalisms in the momentum representation for describing classical fields interacting with point particles by deriving the image in that representation of the de Donder-Weyl function for a general tensor representation of the Lorentz group. The calculation is performed explicitly for a complex scalar field, the electromagnetic field, and the classical Dirac field. The obtained results allow us to propose a Lorentz-covariant bilinear form as a Poisson bracket with respect to the canonical variables of the fields, thus opening the possibility of studying the complete system in a canonical and relativistic coherent way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00835v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motzkin chain is a model of nearest-neighbor interacting quantum $s=1$ spins with open boundary conditions. It is known that it has a unique ground state which can be viewed as a sum of Motzkin paths. We consider the case of periodic boundary conditions and provide several conjectures about structure of the ground state space and symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We conjecture that the ground state is degenerate and independent states are distinguished by eigenvalues of the third component of total spin operator. Each of these states can be described as a sum of paths, similar to the Motzkin paths. Moreover, there exist two operators commuting with the Hamiltonian, which play the roles of lowering and raising operators when acting at these states. We conjecture also that these operators generate a $C$-type Lie algebra, with rank equal to the number of sites. The symmetry algebra of the Hamiltonian is actually wider, and extended, besides the cyclic shift operator, by a central element contained in the third component of total spin operator.</description>

Abstract: Consider a closed curve of length $2\pi$ with curvature $\kappa(s)$ and the Schr\"odinger operator $H$ with $\kappa^2$ as the potential term. Let $\lambda_\Gamma$ be the lowest eigenvalue of $H$. The Ovals Conjecture proposed by Benguria and Loss states that $\lambda_\Gamma \ge 1$. While the conjecture remains open, the present work establishes a new lower bound of $0.81$ on $\lambda_\Gamma$, improving on the previously best known estimate of $0.6085$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Geometric Theory of Principal Bundle Constrained Systems: Strong Transversality Conditions and Variational Framework for Gauge Field Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric mechanics framework for constrained systems on principal bundles through \emph{compatible pairs} $(\mathcal{D}, \lambda)$, addressing fundamental challenges in gauge-constrained physical systems. We characterize the strong transversality condition by pairing constraint distributions $\mathcal{D}$ with Lie algebra dual functions $\lambda: P \to \mathfrak{g}^*$ satisfying compatibility $\mathcal{D}_p = \{v : \langle\lambda(p), \omega(v)\rangle = 0\}$ and differential consistency $d\lambda + \mathrm{ad}^*_\omega \lambda = 0$. This framework proves equivalent to $G$-equivariant Atiyah sequence splittings. We establish bidirectional construction enabling computation: forward (from $\lambda$ to compatible $\mathcal{D}$) and inverse (via variational minimization). Key mathematical contributions include existence theorems for bundles with $\mathrm{ad}^*_\Omega\lambda = 0$ and uniqueness results for semi-simple groups with $\mathfrak{z}(\mathfrak{g}) = 0$, providing rigorous foundations for constraint classification. Our central physical insight emerges from variational principles, deriving dynamic connection equations $\partial_t\omega = d^{\omega}\eta - \iota_{X_H}\Omega$ revealing constraint-curvature coupling: $P_{\text{constraint}} = \langle\lambda,\Omega(\dot{q},\delta q)\rangle$. This explains non-trivial constraint-field interactions in magnetohydrodynamics and Yang-Mills systems absent in kinematic theories. We construct Spencer cohomology for compatible pairs, establishing deep connections between topological invariants and conservation laws. Systematic comparison demonstrates that strong transversality captures essential constraint-curvature physics invisible to standard approaches. Applications span fluid dynamics, gauge theories, and geometric control, providing new tools for complex physical systems with intrinsic gauge-constraint coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.14859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1987 Graeme Segal gave a functorial definition of Conformal Field Theory (CFT) that was designed to capture the mathematical essence of the Conformal Bootstrap formalism pioneered in physics by Belavin-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov. In Segal's formulation the basic objects of CFT, the correlation functions of conformal primary fields, are viewed as functions on the moduli space of Riemann surfaces with marked points which behave naturally under gluing of surfaces. In this paper we give a probabilistic realization of Segal's axioms in Liouville Conformal Field Theory (LCFT) which is a CFT that plays a fundamental role in the theory of random surfaces and two dimensional quantum gravity. Then we use Segal's axioms to express the correlation functions of LCFT in terms of the basic objects of LCFT: its {\it spectrum} and its {\it structure constants}, determined in earlier works by the authors. As a consequence, we obtain a formula for the correlation functions as multiple integrals over the spectrum of LCFT, the structure of these integrals being associated to a pant decomposition of the surface. The integrand is the modulus squared of a function called conformal block: its structure is encoded by the commutation relations of an algebra of operators called the Virasoro algebra and it depends holomorphically on the moduli of the surface with marked points. The integration measure involves a product of structure constants, which have an explicit expression, the so called DOZZ formula.</description>

      <title>Strong Topological Trivialization of Multi-Species Spherical Spin Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the landscapes of multi-species spherical spin glasses. Our results determine the phase boundary for annealed trivialization of the number of critical points, and establish its equivalence with a quenched strong topological trivialization property. Namely in the "trivial" regime, the number of critical points is constant, all are well-conditioned, and all approximate critical points are close to a true critical point. As a consequence, we deduce that Langevin dynamics at sufficiently low temperature has logarithmic mixing time.
  Our approach begins with the Kac--Rice formula. We characterize the annealed trivialization phase by explicitly solving a suitable multi-dimensional variational problem, obtained by simplifying certain asymptotic determinant formulas from (Ben Arous--Bourgade--McKenna 2023, McKenna 2024). To obtain more precise quenched results, we develop general purpose techniques to avoid sub-exponential correction factors and show non-existence of approximate critical points. Many of the results are new even in the 1-species case.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Irreversibility in Quantum Systems: Free Expansion in a Fermion Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15263v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a free fermion chain with uniform nearest-neighbor hopping and let it evolve from an arbitrary initial state with a fixed macroscopic number of particles. We then prove that, at a sufficiently large and typical time, the measured coarse-grained density distribution is almost uniform with (quantum mechanical) probability extremely close to one. This establishes the emergence of irreversible behavior, i.e., a ballistic diffusion, in a system governed by quantum mechanical unitary time evolution. It is conceptually important that irreversibility from any initial state is proved here without introducing any randomness to the initial state or the Hamiltonian, while the known examples, both classical and quantum, rely on certain randomness or apply to limited classes of initial states. The essential new ingredient in the proof is the large deviation bound for every energy eigenstate, which is reminiscent of the strong ETH (energy eigenstate thermalization hypothesis).</description>

      <title>On the past maximal development of near-FLRW data for the Einstein scalar-field Vlasov system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the maximal globally hyperbolic development of near-FLRW initial data for the Einstein scalar-field Vlasov system exhibits stable Big Bang formation in the collapsing direction. The solutions exhibit stable Kretschmann scalar blow-up, causing the spacetime to become causally geodesically past incomplete, and are asymptotically velocity term dominated. This is the first stability result for the Einstein equations in the collapsing spacetime direction in presence of Vlasov matter that does not rely on any symmetry assumptions. Furthermore, the Vlasov distribution remains close to that of the FLRW solution as a function on the co-mass shell, and so does its momentum support if one assumes it to be close to that of the FLRW distribution initially. On the other hand, the leading order terms in components of the Vlasov energy-momentum tensor exbihit an offset in asymptotic order controlled by the perturbation size, and when viewed on the mass shell, the distribution asymptotically concentrates in certain preferred velocity directions. To ensure that this behaviour is sufficiently mitigated by the scalar field, we crucially exploit a scaling hierarchy between horizontal and vertical derivatives in the commuted Vlasov equation.</description>

      <title>Pinched-up periodic KPZ fixed point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01624v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The periodic KPZ fixed point is the conjectural universal limit of the KPZ universality class models on a ring when both the period and time critically tend to infinity. For the case of the periodic narrow wedge initial condition, we consider the conditional distribution when the periodic KPZ fixed point is unusually large at a particular position and time. We prove a conditional limit theorem up to the ``pinch-up" time. When the period is large enough, the result is the same as that for the KPZ fixed point on the line obtained by Liu and Wang in 2022. We identify the regimes in which the result changes and find probabilistic descriptions of the limits.</description>

      <title>Volume preserving spacetime mean curvature flow and foliations of initial data sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12971v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a volume preserving curvature evolution of surfaces in an asymptotically Euclidean initial data set with positive ADM-energy. The speed is given by a nonlinear function of the mean curvature which generalizes the spacetime mean curvature recently considered by Cederbaum-Sakovich (Calc. Var. PDE, 2021). Following a classical approach by Huisken-Yau (Invent. Math., 1996), we show that the flow starting from suitably round initial surfaces exists for all times and converges to a constant (spacetime) curvature limit. This provides an alternative construction of the CSTMC foliation by Cederbaum-Sakovich and has applications in the definition of center of mass of an isolated system in General Relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The binary perceptron problem asks us to find a sign vector in the intersection of independently chosen random halfspaces with intercept $-\kappa$. We analyze the performance of the canonical discrepancy minimization algorithms of Lovett-Meka and Rothvoss/Eldan-Singh for the asymmetric binary perceptron problem. We obtain new algorithmic results in the $\kappa = 0$ case and in the large-$|\kappa|$ case. In the $\kappa\to-\infty$ case, we additionally characterize the storage capacity and complement our algorithmic results with an almost-matching overlap-gap lower bound.</description>

      <title>On Landis' conjecture for positive Schr\"odinger operators on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we study the Landis conjecture for positive Schr\"odin\-ger operators on graphs. More precisely, we prove a Landis-type result in the form of a decay criterion that ensures when $\mathcal{H}$-harmonic functions for a positive Schr\"odinger operator $\mathcal{H}$ with potentials bounded from above by $ 1 $ are trivial. The positivity assumption on the operator allows us to impose slow decay across the entire graph, while requiring fast decay in only one direction, rather than throughout the whole graph. We then specifically look at the special cases of $ \mathbb{Z}^{d} $ and regular trees for which we get a explicit decay criterion. Moreover, we consider the fractional analogue of the Landis conjecture on $ \mathbb{Z}^{d} $. Our approach relies on the discrete version of Liouville comparison principle which is also proved in this article.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian structure of the intrinsic evolution of a closed vortex sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of previous authors on vortex sheets and their applications, the intrinsic inviscid evolution equations of a closed vortex sheet in a plane, separating two piecewise constant density fluids, and their Hamiltonian form are investigated. The model has potential applications to problems involving the dynamics of interfaces of two immiscible fluids. A boundary Poisson bracket, which appears to be new and related to the KdV bracket, is obtained containing the curve-tangential derivative $\partial / \partial s$. Lagrangian invariants of the sheet motion by its self-induced velocity--the Cauchy principal value of the Biot-Savart integral--are also derived.</description>

      <title>Homogenisation for Maxwell and Friends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We refine the understanding of continuous dependence on coefficients of solution operators under the nonlocal $H$-topology viz Schur topology in the setting of evolutionary equations in the sense of Picard. We show that certain components of the solution operators converge strongly. The weak convergence behaviour known from homogenisation problems for ordinary differential equations is recovered on the other solution operator components. The results are underpinned by a rich class of examples that, in turn, are also treated numerically, suggesting a certain sharpness of the theoretical findings. Analytic treatment of an example that proves this sharpness is provided too. Even though all the considered examples contain local coefficients, the main theorems and structural insights are of operator-theoretic nature and, thus, also applicable to nonlocal coefficients. The main advantage of the problem class considered is that they contain mixtures of type, potentially highly oscillating between different types of PDEs; a prototype can be found in Maxwell's equations highly oscillating between the classical equations and corresponding eddy current approximations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of the focusing $\Phi^4$-measure on the one-dimensional torus in the infinite volume limit. This measure is an invariant Gibbs measure for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. It had previously been shown by B. Rider that the measure is strongly concentrated around a family of minimizers of the Hamiltonian associated with the measure. These exhibit increasingly sharp spatial concentration, resulting in a trivial limit to first order. We study the fluctuations around this soliton manifold. We show that the scaled field under the Gibbs measure converges to white noise in the limit, identifying the next order fluctuations predicted by B. Rider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although it is long believed that vanishing of chiral central charges of a 2d conformal field theory (CFT) implies the existence of conformal boundary conditions, there are yet higher obstructions. In this paper, we focus on 2d rational CFTs, for which we identify a series of obstructions, known as higher central charges. We also discuss its implication for lattice realizations and the generalization with global symmetries.</description>

      <title>States and IR divergences in factorization algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are several choices of states. In factorization algebras, we often use a natural augmentation state $\langle-\rangle_{\rm aug}$. In physics, we use a state given by compactification of spacetime $\langle-\rangle_{\rm cptf}$, or a state corresponding Schwartz boundary condition $\langle-\rangle_{\rm Sch}$. At first glance, the relation between these three states is not so clear.
  In this paper, propose a definition of compactification method in factorization algebras and give a way to treat IR divergences in massless theory. As a result, we see the three sates are equivalent both in massive theory and massless theory.</description>

      <title>Unitarity constrains the quantum information metrics for particle interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitarity provides mathematical and physical constraints on quantum information systems. e.g., in entanglement swapping, unitarity requires the same von Neumann entanglement entropy generation for either a particle interaction or an act of measurement. For the first time, the language of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is presented to derive the density matrix for hard scattering. We show that unitarity allows for finding the latter's cross section without using the scattering amplitude or the Lippmann-Schwinger equation plus Green's function. We also show the language of relativistic quantum mechanics can be used to derive the momentum entropy or Sackur-Tetrode equation for the inelastic scattering of an electron from a proton. The latter entropy derives from a Shannon entropy and an additional entropy that evokes the uncertainty principle. This article's presentation allows particle physicists to readily begin calculating quantum information metrics such as correlations and mutual information for any particle interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a detailed account of the N -component Toda lattice hierarchy. This hierarchy is an extended version of the one introduced by Ueno and Takasaki. Our version contains N discrete variables rather than one. We start from the Lax formalism, deduce the bilinear relation for the wave functions from it and then, based on the latter, prove existence of the tau-function. We also show how the multi-component Toda lattice hierarchy is embedded into the universal hierarchy which is basically the multi-component KP hierarchy. At last, we show how the bilinear integral equation for the tau-function can be obtained using the free fermion technique. An example of exact solutions (a multi-component analogue of one-soliton solutions) is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel systematic construction of gapped domain walls (GDWs) within the Levin-Wen (LW) model. By gluing two LW models along their open sides in a compatible way, we achieve a complete GDW classification by subsets of bulk input data, which encompass the classifications in terms of bimodule categories. A generalized bimodule structure is introduced to capture domain-wall excitations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that folding along any GDW yields a gapped boundary (GB) described by a Frobenius algebra of the input UFC for the folded model, thus bridging our GDW classification and the GB classification in \cite{hu2018boundary}.</description>

      <title>Quantum dual extended Hamming code immune to collective coherent errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective coherent (CC) errors are inevitable, as every physical qubit undergoes free evolution under its kinetic Hamiltonian. These errors can be more damaging than stochastic Pauli errors because they affect all qubits coherently, resulting in high-weight errors that standard quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes struggle to correct. In quantum memories and communication systems, especially when storage durations are long, CC errors often dominate over stochastic noise. Trapped-ion platforms, for example, exhibit strong CC errors with minimal stochastic Pauli components. In this work, we address the regime where immunity to CC errors, high code rate (due to limited qubit availability), and moderate distance (sufficient for correcting low-weight errors) are all essential. We construct a new family of constant-excitation (CE) stabilizer codes with parameters $[[2^{r+1}, 2^r - (r+1), 4]]$. The smallest instance, the $[[8,1,4]]$ code, improves the code rate and error threshold of the best previously known CE code by factors of approximately two and four, respectively.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider $2\times 2$ matrix-valued pseudodifferential equations in which the two characteristic sets intersect with finite contact order. We show that the asymptotic behavior of its solution changes dramatically before and after the crossing point, and provide a precise asymptotic formula. This is a generalization of the previous results for matrix-valued Schr\"odinger operators and Landau-Zener models. The proof relies on a normal form reduction and a detailed analysis of a simple first-order system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16816v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simple and formally exact solutions of energy-conserving nonlinear pendulum motion are derived for all three classes: swinging, stopping, and spinning. Although with seemingly very different characteristic motions, the three classes can now be treated on the same footing using the frequency domain. The solutions are the first exact and complete description of energy-conserving pendulum in the frequency domain reported in the literature. The key insight is the importance of angular velocity frequency analysis, rather than that of angular displacement. The emphasis on velocity frequency domain should benefit other studies of nonlinear motion as well. Brief theoretical derivations are given. The solutions are validated by exact numerical values and frequency analysis of dynamical simulations using velocity verlet integration. Their unique simplicity should be useful in a theoretical development that requires a tractable mathematical framework or in an introductory physics course that aims to discuss nonlinear pendulum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an approach for deriving a broad class of propagation models for inhomogeneously, linearly polarized ``vector'' beams. Our formulation leverages a complex scalar potential along with an appropriately constructed Lagrangian energy density. Importantly, we show that polarization inhomogeneities can be included by simple addition of a spatially dependent polarization angle to the complex potential phase. Thus, phase and polarization are seen to be equivalent from an energy perspective. As part of our development, we also show how the complex scalar potential arises naturally when considering polarization angle as a field symmetry during construction of the Lagrangian. We further show that the definition of linear momentum density in terms of the complex potential holds a distinct advantage over the conventional definition for inhomogeneously polarized beams.</description>

      <title>Classical integrable spin chains of Landau-Lifshitz type from R-matrix identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09918v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a family of 1+1 classical integrable space-discrete models of the Landau-Lifshitz type through the usage of ansatz for $U$-$V$ (Lax) pair with spectral parameter satisfying the semi-discrete Zakharov-Shabat equation. The ansatz for $U$-$V$ pair is based on $R$-matrices satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation and certain additional properties. Equations of motion are obtained using a set of $R$-matrix identities. In the continuous limit we reproduce the previously known family of the higher rank Landau-Lifshitz equations.</description>

      <title>Kostka Numbers Constrain Particle Exchange Statistics beyond Fermions and Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing theoretical explorations of intermediate statistics beyond bosons and fermions have followed three routes: (1) a statistical-mechanics route that modifies microstate counting rules; (2) a quantum-mechanics route that generalizes wavefunction exchange symmetry via group representations; and (3) a quantum-field-theory route that deforms the creation-annihilation algebra. While each route has advanced individually, a unified formulation remains elusive. Recently, consistency between routes (2) and (3) was demonstrated (Nature 637, 314 (2025)). Here, employing combinatorial arguments with Kostka numbers, we establish the microstate uniqueness theorem (MUT). It demonstrates that statistical-mechanics counting constraints (route 1) and symmetric-group-based quantum-mechanical exchange symmetry (a restricted subset of route 2, excluding braid-group generalizations) are mathematically incompatible under indistinguishability. Consequently, intermediate statistics based on higher-dimensional irreducible representations of the symmetric group or on modified microstate-counting rules are mathematically ruled out for indistinguishable particles. The MUT relies solely on the indistinguishability principle, without invoking Lorentz symmetry or any field-theoretic assumptions.</description>
