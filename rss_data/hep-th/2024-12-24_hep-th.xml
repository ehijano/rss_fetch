      <title>Exotic gravity theory in loop space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exotic linearised theory of superconformal gravity in D = 6, (4,0) superspace, proposed by C. Hull, is discussed in loop space with focus on its bosonic sector. Pursuing an analogy to the loop space version of the system of a two form B and its field strength H, we show that the exotic linearised gravitational potential C and curvature G can be reinterpreted as an ultra-local (linearised) metric and curvature on loop space.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Observatories in AdS$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider four-dimensional general relativity with a negative cosmological constant in the presence of a finite size boundary, $\Gamma$, for both Euclidean and Lorentzian signature. As our boundary condition, we consider the `conformal' boundary condition that fixes the conformal class of the induced metric at $\Gamma$ and the trace of the extrinsic curvature, $K(x^m)$. In Lorentzian signature, we must supplement these with appropriate initial data comprising the standard Cauchy data along a spatial slice and, in addition, initial data for a boundary mode that appears due to the presence of the finite size boundary. We perform a linearised analysis of the gravitational field equations for both an $S^2\times \mathbb{R}$ as well as a Minkowskian, $\mathbb{R}^{1,2}$, boundary. In the $S^2\times \mathbb{R}$ case, in addition to the usual AdS$_4$ normal modes, we uncover a novel linearised perturbation, $\boldsymbol{\omega}(x^m)$, which can exhibit complex frequencies at sufficiently large angular momentum. Upon moving $\Gamma$ toward the infinite asymptotic AdS$_4$ boundary, the complex frequencies appear at increasingly large angular momentum and vanish altogether in the strict limit. In the $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$ case, although we uncover an analogous novel perturbation, we show it does not exhibit complex frequencies. In Euclidean signature, we show that $K(x^m)$ plays the role of a source for $\boldsymbol{\omega}(x^m)$. When close to the AdS$_4$ asymptotic boundary, we speculate on the holographic interpretation of $\boldsymbol{\omega}(x^m)$.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Krylov State Complexity in Random Matrix Quenches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum many-body systems, time-evolved states typically remain confined to a smaller region of the Hilbert space known as the $\textit{Krylov subspace}$. The time evolution can be mapped onto a one-dimensional problem of a particle moving on a chain, where the average position $\langle n \rangle$ defines Krylov state complexity or spread complexity. Generalized spread complexities, associated with higher-order moments $\langle n^p \rangle$ for $p&gt;1$, provide finer insights into the dynamics. We investigate the time evolution of generalized spread complexities following a quantum quench in random matrix theory. The quench is implemented by transitioning from an initial random Hamiltonian to a post-quench Hamiltonian obtained by dividing it into four blocks and flipping the sign of the off-diagonal blocks. This setup captures universal features of chaotic quantum quenches. When the initial state is the thermofield double state of the post-quench Hamiltonian, a peak in spread complexity preceding equilibration signals level repulsion, a hallmark of quantum chaos. We examine the robustness of this peak for other initial states, such as the ground state or the thermofield double state of the pre-quench Hamiltonian. To quantify this behavior, we introduce a measure based on the peak height relative to the late-time saturation value. In the continuous limit, higher-order complexities show increased sensitivity to the peak, supported by numerical simulations for finite-size random matrices.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Tensor multiplet in four dimensional N=2 conformal supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study various N=2 multiplets in four dimensions by looking at the supersymmetric truncation of four dimensional N=3 multiplets. Under supersymmetric truncation, the off-shell N=3 weyl multiplet reduces to the off-shell N=2 Weyl multiplet and the off-shell N=2 vector multiplet (which we will refer to as the central charge multiplet). Under the same truncation, the on-shell N=3 vector multiplet reduces to an on-shell N=2 vector multiplet and an on-shell massive hypermultiplet with a broken rigid SU(2) and a non-trivial central charge transformation. We use the equations of motion of this hypermultiplet to eliminate some of the fields of the central charge multiplet in terms of the fields of the hypermultiplet and a dual tensor gauge field (similar in spirit to how a dilaton Weyl multiplet is constructed). This results in a new off-shell multiplet, with 8+8 degrees of freedom, containing scalar fields and a tensor gauge field which we refer to as the scalar-tensor multiplet.</description>

      <title>Conformal geometry as a gauge theory of gravity: covariant equations of motion &amp; conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Weyl conformal geometry as a general gauge theory of the Weyl group (of Poincar\'e and dilatations symmetries) in a manifestly Weyl gauge covariant formalism in which this geometry is (automatically) metric and physically relevant. This gives a realistic (quadratic) gauge theory of gravity, with Einstein-Hilbert gravity and a (positive) cosmological constant recovered in its spontaneously broken phase. For the most general action we compute the manifestly Weyl gauge covariant equations of motion and present the conservation laws for the energy-momentum tensor and Weyl gauge current. These laws are valid both in Weyl conformal geometry (with respect to the Weyl gauge covariant derivative) but also in the Riemannian geometry equivalent picture (with respect to its associated covariant derivative). This interesting result is a consequence of (gauged) diffeomorphism invariance of the former versus usual diffeomorphism invariance of the latter. These results are first derived for $d=4$ dimensions and are then extended to conformal geometry in $d$ dimensions while automatically maintaining manifest Weyl gauge invariance/covariance. The results are useful in physical applications with this symmetry.</description>

      <title>Selection rules for RG flows of minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal d=2 CFTs are usually classified through modular invariant partition functions. There is a finer classification of ``non complete'' models when S-duality is not imposed. We approach this classification by starting with the local chiral algebra and adding primaries sequentially. At each step, we only impose locality (T-duality) and closure of the operator algebra. For each chiral algebra, this produces a tree-like graph. Each tree node corresponds to a local d=2 CFT, with an intrinsic Jones index measuring the size of Haag duality violation. This index can be computed with the partition function and is related to the total quantum dimension of the category of superselection sectors of the node, and to the relative size between the node and a modular invariant completion. In this way, we find in a very explicit manner a classification of local minimal (c&lt;1) d=2 CFTs. When appropriate, this matches Kawahigashi-Longo's previous results. We use this finer classification to constrain RG flows. For a relevant perturbation, the flow can be restricted to the subalgebra associated with it, typically corresponding to a non-modular invariant node in the tree. The structure of the graph above such node needs to be preserved by the RG flow. In particular, the superselection sector category for the node must be preserved. This gives selection rules that recover in a unified fashion several known facts while unraveling new ones.</description>

      <title>Horizon Entropy Refined: Quantum Contributions and Cosmological Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of quantum fluctuations on the event horizon area and their implications for corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. These quantum corrections are incorporated into the framework of large-scale gravitational systems, utilizing the holographic principle to derive modified Friedmann equations. By redefining the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, our model predicts significant alterations to the Friedmann equations within specific parameter ranges, offering novel perspectives on cosmological scales. Using distance modulus data from the Pantheon supernova sample, we demonstrate the model's potential to constrain the parameters governing quantum corrections and address unresolved cosmological issues. Crucially, our analysis reveals that quantum fluctuations can increase the area of the event horizon by up to 47\%. Beyond this threshold, theoretical predictions encounter substantial challenges when compared with observational data. This approach bridges quantum gravity and observational cosmology, opening new avenues for testing and refining theoretical models.</description>

      <title>From Hadrons to Gravitons via Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first quantum string theories were developed around 1970, prior to the discovery of QCD, with the goal of producing a theory of hadrons. Basic physical requirements and mathematical consistency of the string theories known at that time turned out to require the inclusion of gravity and the existence of extra spatial dimensions. This came as a complete surprise to everyone who was involved. It led to a completely new and very ambitious goal for string theory research, namely a unified quantum theory of gravity and all other forces. In particular, this goal requires that the string tension is 20 orders of magnitude larger than was previously envisioned. Fifty years later, this goal is widely shared.</description>

      <title>Irregular KZ equations and Kac-Moody representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we derive new types of KZ equations for conformal blocks with one irregular singularity at infinity. To this end, we construct irregular representations of Kac-Moody algebras where we restrict ourselves to the $sl(2,\mathbb{C})$ case. We show how such irregular representations correspond to irregular Gaiotto-Teschner representations of the Virasoro algebra. By connecting to 2d Liouville theory, we show how the conformal blocks governed by our irregular KZ equation correspond to 4d Argyres-Douglas theories with surface operator insertions. The corresponding flat connections describe braiding between such operators on the Gaiotto curve.</description>

      <title>Quantum Superspace and Bloch Electron Systems with Zeeman Effects: *-Bracket Formalism for Super Curtright-Zachos Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce supersymmetric extensions of the Hom-Lie deformation of the Virasoro algebra (super Curtright-Zachos algebra), as realized in the GL(1,1) quantum superspace, for Bloch electron systems under Zeeman effects. By examining the duality inherent in quantum superspace scaling operators, we establish a correspondence between quantum superspace and its physical realization through a novel operator mixing mechanism. For the continuous case, we construct super Curtright-Zachos algebra using magnetic translations and spin matrix bases, demonstrating explicit realizations for both N=1 and N=2 supersymmetric algebras with a natural N=2 decomposition. For the discrete case, we establish cyclic matrix representations in tight-binding models. We organize these structures through the *-bracket formalism with Z2-grading, revealing how the quantum superspace structure manifests in physical systems while preserving essential algebraic properties.</description>

      <title>Projections and teleportation of operator quenches in CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent proposals for information recovery from black holes via non-isometric maps and post-selection in an effective description, we set up and investigate a teleportation scenario in a 2d CFT involving a local operator quench and projection on a portion of space onto a Cardy state with the theory in the vacuum state. Using conformal invariance the system can be mapped to CFT with boundary (BCFT). Renyi entropies for spatial intervals in the projected state can then be computed as a function of the location of the quench, either using the replica method, or using twist fields, the latter employing universal results for correlators at large c. We find qualitatively distinct behaviours in the two systems. Our replica computations reveal a surprising universal n dependence of Renyi entropies which implies that teleportation does occur but is not optimal as would be expected because the projector is not especially tuned. We also find that the curious n dependence of the Renyi entropies means that the limit to the von Neumann entropy is not straightforward.</description>

      <title>Associativity is enough: an all-orders 2d chiral algebra for 4d form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a special set of massless four-dimensional gauge theories which admit local and gauge-anomaly-free uplifts to twistor space; we call such theories twistorial. In twistorial theories, generalized towers of soft modes (including states of both helicities) form a 2d chiral algebra even at the quantum level. The 2d OPE limit of this chiral algebra coincides with the holomorphic collinear limit in 4d. This is true, in particular, for self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) theory coupled to special choices of matter, the latter being required to make the theory twistorial. Costello and the second author recently proposed that form factors of such twistorial 4d theories could be computed as 2d chiral algebra correlators. In turn, there exist form factors of self-dual theories, with insertions of appropriate local operators, that compute a subclass of observables in full (i.e. non-self-dual) QCD, coupled to appropriate matter. For example, the n-point two-loop all + QCD amplitude has recently been computed using the 1-loop chiral algebra OPEs determined thus far, but higher orders of the quantum-deformed chiral algebra must be determined to continue the ``chiral algebra bootstrap'' program for higher-loop-level form factors of these twistorial theories. In this paper, using only elementary constraints from symmetries and associativity, we obtain closed-form expressions for the extended chiral algebra OPEs to arbitrary loop-order. This can be viewed as providing an all-loop result for a subset of collinear splitting functions in non-supersymmetric, massless QCD coupled to special choices of matter.</description>

      <title>Poisson electrodynamics on $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Poisson electrodynamics is the semi-classical limit of $U(1)$ non-commutative gauge theory. It has been studied so far as a theoretical model, where an external field would be the source of the non-commutativity effects in space-time. Being the Standard Model of fundamental interactions a local theory, the prediction of observables within it would be drastically altered by such affects. The natural question that arises is: how do particles interact with this field? In this work, we will answer this question using a point-like charged particle interacting with the Poisson gauge field, investigating how their trajectories are affected using the $\kappa$-Minkowski structure. The interaction arises from the construction of a gauge-invariant action. Using the field solutions, we find the second-order equation for the deformed Lorentz force, indicating possible effects of an emergent gravity due to non-commutativity.</description>

      <title>Meson correlators in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs and hints for 8d structures at weak coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study correlators of $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS mesons in two examples of 4d SQCDs with $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal symmetry in the planar limit. We focus on the weakly coupled regime and obtain one-loop corrections to $n$-point meson correlators with arbitrary operator dimensions. We show that these corrections can be resumed into generating functions which exhibit emergent 8d structures similar to the ones previously observed at strong coupling via AdS/CFT. These structures of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories also resemble the hidden 10d structures in 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM.</description>

      <title>Closed-string amplitude recursions from the Deligne associator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by earlier results on recursions for open-string tree-level amplitudes, and by a result of Brown and Dupont relating open- and closed-string tree-level amplitudes via single-valued periods, we identify a recursive relation for closed-string tree-level amplitudes. We achieve this by showing that closed-string analogues of Selberg integrals satisfy the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation for a suitable matrix representation of the free Lie algebra on two generators, and by identifying the limits at z=1 and z=0, which are related by the Deligne associator, with N-point and (N-1)-point closed-string amplitudes, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We study the physical consequences of 't Hooft anomalies in the high-temperature limit of relativistic quantum field theories with $SU(2)$, or more generally $USp(2N)$, global symmetry. The global anomaly afflicting these symmetry groups results in new transport phenomena akin to the chiral magnetic and chiral vortical effect, predicting conductivities that are fractionally quantised in units of a half, reflecting the 2-torsion in the bordism groups $\Omega^\text{Spin}_5(BUSp(2N))\cong \mathbb{Z}_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note aims to offer a non-technical and self-contained introduction to gravitational algebras and their applications in the nonequilibrium physics of gravitational systems. We begin by presenting foundational concepts from operator algebra theory and exploring their relevance to perturbative quantum gravity. Additionally, we provide a brief overview of the theory of nonequilibrium dynamical systems in finite dimensions and discuss its generalization to gravitational algebras. Specifically, we focus on entropy production in black hole backgrounds and fluctuation theorems in de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>A note on partially massless supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the couplings of a partially massless spin-2 field with a doublet of massless, real spin-3/2 fields. In the flat limit, this spectrum coincides with the spectrum of ${\cal N}_4=2$ pure supergravity. We classify all the possible parity-invariant, non-Abelian deformations of the free theory that lead to a deformation of the Lagrangian. By doing this, we re-derive a non-Abelian vertex recently found in 2412.04982 [hep-th] by Yu. M. Zinoviev following a different approach, and show that the corresponding non-Abelian gauge algebra closely resembles the one of ${\cal N}_4=2$ supergravity around anti-de Sitter spacetime AdS$_4$. The gauge-algebra deformation is however obstructed, at next order. Then, we add a massless vector field together with a massive spin-3/2 field, and find two nontrivial vertices mixing these fields with a single massless gravitino. Still, the gauge algebra remains obstructed at next order, therefore excluding the possibility to make local the global supersymmetry algebra found in recent works on partially massless supermultiplets in $AdS_4$. Finally, we argue that the two problems encountered are simultaneously solved by the adjunction of the masseless graviton, leading to ${\cal N}_4=1$ pure superconformal gravity around AdS$_4$ as the only consistent theory coupling partially massless spin-2 fields to massless and massive spin-3/2 fields.</description>

      <title>A Conformal Approach to Carroll Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to take the first step in the conformal program for constructing general matter couplings to Carroll gravity. In particular, we couple a single massless electric/magnetic scalar to conformal Carroll gravity with isotropic dilatations and show how, upon gauge-fixing, we obtain a (non-conformal version of) electric/magnetic Carroll gravity. We determine the full Carroll transformation rules paying special attention to the way the so-called intrinsic torsion tensors occur in these transformation rules. A noteworthy feature in the magnetic case is that the Lagrange multiplier present in the Lagrangian gets absorbed, after coupling to conformal Carroll gravity and gauge-fixing, into one of the independent spin-connections of magnetic Carroll gravity. Our results form a convenient starting point for constructing general matter couplings to Carroll gravity. Surprisingly, we find that the same relation between dynamical matter and gravity, which forms the basis of the conformal program, does not work in the usual way in the Galilei case.</description>

      <title>The Fractional Hall hierarchy from duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a modified version of Son's Dirac composite fermion theory proposed by Seiberg et al gives a candidate unified description of the gapped and gapless fractional quantum Hall states within a single Landau level. Our main tool is the successive application of three-dimensional dualities to partially filled Landau levels of composite fermions, which imply that this theory has a complicated landscape of gapped vacua and critical points. This construction is the Lagrangian, or effective field theory, analogue of the flux attachment procedure. The critical points exist at even denominator filling and are well-described by a Fermi surface for a weakly coupled composite fermion coupled to an abelian Chern-Simons theory. The gapped states include odd-denominator filling fraction states with an abelian Chern-Simons description which we show matches the one expected for hierarchy states, as well as non-abelian states at even-denominator filling that arise from pair instabilities of the composite fermion's Fermi surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the high-energy fixed-angle scattering of pions and $\rho$-mesons in a bottom-up holographic QCD model. To this end, we generalise the approach of Polchinski and Strassler arXiv:hep-th/0109174 to write an ansatz for meson scattering amplitudes based on superstring scattering amplitudes in asymptotically AdS space. We demonstrate that our generalisation of the Polchinski--Strassler proposal is necessary to describe $\rho$-meson scattering consistently with the Nambu--Goldstone boson equivalence theorem. Our results for pion and $\rho$-meson scattering amplitudes are in agreement with the constituent counting rule found in QCD. Moreover, our proposal for 2-to-2 scattering amplitudes provides a method for computing scattering angle dependence.</description>

      <title>Krylov spread complexity as holographic complexity beyond JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the important open problems in quantum black hole physics is a dual interpretation of holographic complexity proposals. To date the only quantitative match is the equality between the Krylov spread complexity in triple-scaled SYK at infinite temperature and the complexity = volume proposal in classical JT gravity. Our work utilizes the recent connection between double-scaled SYK and sine-dilaton gravity to show that the quantitative relation between Krylov spread complexity and complexity = volume extends to finite temperatures and to full quantum regime on the gravity side at disk level. From the latter we isolate the first quantum correction to the complexity = volume proposal and propose to view it as a complexity of quantum fields in the bulk. Finally, we comment on the switchback effect, whose presence would make the Krylov spread complexity a fully fledged holographic complexity at least in sine-dilaton gravity.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic construction of SSA-compatible extreme rays of the subadditivity cone and the ${\sf N}=6$ solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the set of all extreme rays of the 6-party subadditivity cone that are compatible with strong subadditivity. In total, we identify 208 new (genuine 6-party) orbits, 52 of which violate at least one known holographic entropy inequality. For the remaining 156 orbits, which do not violate any such inequalities, we construct holographic graph models for 150 of them. For the final 6 orbits, it remains an open question whether they are holographic. Consistent with the strong form of the conjecture in \cite{Hernandez-Cuenca:2022pst}, 148 of these graph models are trees. However, 2 of the graphs contain a "bulk cycle", leaving open the question of whether equivalent models with tree topology exist, or if these extreme rays are counterexamples to the conjecture. The paper includes a detailed description of the algorithm used for the computation, which is presented in a general framework and can be applied to any situation involving a polyhedral cone defined by a set of linear inequalities and a partial order among them to find extreme rays corresponding to down-sets in this poset.</description>

Abstract: We explore a square-law k-inflation using the Hamilton-Jacobi approach. Focusing on scenarios where the Hubble parameter exhibits a power-law dependence on the k-field, our analysis encompasses the computations of crucial observables, such as the scalar power spectrum, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, and the scalar spectral index. We further constrain the model's parameters using Planck data and present a specific form of the potential. Our results demonstrate that the model aligns well with observational data.</description>

      <title>Most general EFTs from spurion analysis: Hilbert series and Minimal Lepton Flavor Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a saturation theorem for general Effective Field Theories (EFTs) constructed using spurion analysis. Let $S$ be a set of spurion fields introduced to organize the breaking of a global symmetry $G_f$, and $H_S$ be the subgroup of $G_f$ that remains unbroken under a generic vacuum expectation value $\langle S\rangle$; we show that the EFT Lagrangian constructed from the spurion analysis $saturates$ the EFT Lagrangian without the spurions but restricted to $H_S$ invariance, provided that arbitrary powers of the spurion fields are allowed. As examples, we study several implementations of the Minimal Lepton Flavor Violation (MLFV) principle, corresponding to various origins of the neutrino masses. In each scenario, we compute the Hilbert series to obtain the numbers of independent lepton flavor covariants that appear in the corresponding EFT at mass dimension 6. These numbers agree with the number of $H_S$ invariants in the EFT without the spurions, demonstrating the saturation theorem. Motivated by phenomenological connections, we provide linearly independent spurion polynomials for selected lepton flavor covariants. An ancillary file is supplied at https://github.com/HilbertSeries/Group_Invariants_and_Covariants , which is a Mathematica notebook that provides functions for computing general Hilbert series of invariants and covariants of compact classical groups. It presents examples demonstrating the use of the code, including the Hilbert series for our MLFV scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the interaction between two quantum systems in spacetime and we compare two possible models to describe it: 1) a fully quantum field theoretical (QFT) description of the coupling of two quantum systems mediated by a quantum field and 2) a quantum-controlled model (qc-model), which is an effectively relativistic direct-coupling in which the interaction of two quantum systems is not mediated by a field with local quantum degrees of freedom. We show that while there are regimes where the qc-model can approximate QFT arbitrarily well, it can suffer from retrocausal effects. We discuss in what regimes those retrocausal predictions of the qc-model are non-negligible and whether they can be used to argue that gravity induced entanglement experiments can reveal genuinely quantum aspects of the gravitational interaction or not.</description>

      <title>Conformal invariance constraints in the $O(N)$ models: a first study within the nonperturbative renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of many critical phenomena at large distances is expected to be invariant under the full conformal group, rather than only isometries and scale transformations. When studying critical phenomena, approximations are often required, and the framework of the nonperturbative, or functional renormalization group is no exception. The derivative expansion is one of the most popular approximation schemes within this framework, due to its great performance on multiple systems, as evidenced in the last decades. Nevertheless, it has the downside of breaking conformal symmetry at a finite order. This breaking is not observed at the leading order of the expansion, denoted LPA approximation, and only appears once one considers, at least, the next-to-leading order of the derivative expansion ($\mathcal{O}(\partial^2)$) when including composite operators. In this work, we study the constraints arising from conformal symmetry for the $O(N)$ models using the derivative expansion at order $\mathcal{O}(\partial^2)$. We explore various values of $N$ and minimize the breaking of conformal symmetry to fix the non-physical parameters of the approximation procedure. We compare our prediction for the critical exponents with those coming from a more usual procedure, known as the principle of minimal sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Symmetries as Condensation Defects in Finite-Group Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work, we developed a method to construct invertible and non-invertible symmetries of finite-group gauge theories as topological domain walls on the lattice. In the present work, we consider abelian and non-abelian finite-group gauge theories in general spacetime dimension, and demonstrate how to realize these symmetries as condensation defects, i.e., as suitable insertions of lower dimensional topological operators. We then compute the fusion rules and action of these symmetries using their condensation expression and the algebraic properties of the lower dimensional objects that make them. We illustrate the discussion in $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where we derive the correspondence between domain walls, labeled by subgroups and actions for the doubled gauge group, and higher gauging condensation defects, labeled by subalgebras of the global symmetry. As a primary application, we obtain the condensation expression for the invertible symmetries of abelian gauge theories defined by outer automorphisms of the gauge group. We also show how to use these ideas to derive the action for certain non-abelian groups. For instance, one can obtain the action for the Dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_4$ by gauging a swap symmetry of $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetry (SUSY) proposed as an elementary symmetry for physics beyond the Standard Model has found important applications in various areas outside high-energy physics. Here, we systematically implement supersymmetric quantum mechanics -- exhibiting fundamental SUSY properties in the simple setting of quantum mechanics -- into a wide range of topological semimetals, where the broken translational symmetry, e.g., by a magnetic field, is effectively captured by a SUSY potential. We show that the dynamical SUSY breaking via the instanton effect over the SUSY potential valleys works as the underlying mechanism for the gap opening of the topological semimetallic phases, and the magnitude of the instanton effect is proportional to the energy gap. This instanton mechanism provides a simple criterion for determining whether the energy gap has been opened, without resorting to detailed calculations, i.e., a finite energy gap is opened if and only if the SUSY potential has an even number of zeros. Our theory leads to previously unexpected results: even an infinitesimal magnetic field can open a gap in topologically robust Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases due to the dynamical SUSY breaking. Overall, the revealed connection between SUSY quantum mechanics and non-uniform topological semimetals can elucidate previously ambiguous phenomena, provide guidance for future investigations, and open a new avenue for exploring topological semimetals.</description>

      <title>Projected Entangled Pair States for Lattice Gauge Theories with Dynamical Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theory is an important framework for studying gauge theories that arise in the Standard Model and condensed matter physics. Yet many systems (or regimes of those systems) are difficult to study using conventional techniques, such as action-based Monte Carlo sampling. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of gauged Gaussian projected entangled pair states as an ansatz for a lattice gauge theory involving dynamical physical matter. We study a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory on a two dimensional lattice with a single flavor of fermionic matter on each lattice site. Our results show agreement with results computed by exactly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the approach is computationally feasible for larger system sizes where exact results are unavailable. This is a further step on the road to studying higher dimensions and other gauge groups with manageable computational costs while avoiding the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal mode spectrum of rotating black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes are excited during the ringdown phase of black holes after merger. Determination of quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes in alternative theories of gravity has remained a challenge for a long time. Here we discuss in detail our recently developed method to extract the quasinormal modes for rapidly rotating black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton theory. We first obtain numerically the exact rapidly rotating background solutions, which also clarify their domain of existence. Then we solve the equations for the linear perturbations of the metric and the dilaton field by employing an appropriate set of boundary conditions and a spectral decomposition of the perturbation functions. The resulting spectrum agrees well with the known limits obtained for slow rotation and weak coupling, while it exhibits larger deviations for stronger coupling.</description>

      <title>The Role of Integration Cycles in Complex Langevin Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex Langevin simulations are an attempt to solve the sign (or complex-action) problem encountered in various physical systems of interest. The method is based on a complexification of the underlying degrees of freedom and an evolution in an auxiliary time dimension. The complexification, however, does not come without drawbacks, the most severe of which is the infamous 'wrong convergence' problem, stating that complex Langevin simulations sometimes fail to produce correct answers despite their apparent convergence. It has long been realized that wrong convergence may - in principle - be fixed by the introduction of a suitable kernel into the complex Langevin equation, such that the conventional correctness criteria are met. However, as we discuss in this work, complex Langevin results may - especially in the presence of a kernel - still be affected by unwanted so-called integration cycles of the theory spoiling them. Indeed, we confirm numerically that in the absence of boundary terms the complex Langevin results are given by a linear combination of such integration cycles, as put forward by Salcedo &amp; Seiler. In particular, we shed light on the way different choices of kernel affect which integration cycles are being sampled in a simulation and how this knowledge can be used to ensure correct convergence in simple toy models.</description>

      <title>Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solutions in bigravity and Kerr-Schild double copy relations using an effective metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work a formalism for proportional generalized double Kerr-Schild ansatz in bigravity is considered, where both metrics are coupled to matter. We study time-dependent and stationary solutions in the framework of the Kerr-Schild classical double copy and obtain the classical Kerr-Schild for the double, single and zeroth copy equations. For the time-dependent case, we use AdS waves solutions in bigravity previously studied in the literature. For the stationary case, we discuss a kind of Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solutions in bigravity which permit different masses, NUT parameters, electric and magnetic charges, while the kinematical parameters are the same, and the cosmological constants related. These solution is presented in Pleba\'nski coordinates, and it is noticed that in these coordinates the description simplifies the classical double copy equations allowing a clearer interpretation in terms of the defined fields. We present and interpret some cases for these solutions for the separate matter sector and using the effective metric.</description>

      <title>Local symmetries and extensive ground-state degeneracy of a 1D supersymmetric fermionic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a $1$D supersymmetric (SUSY) hard-core fermion model first proposed by Fendley, Schoutens, and de Boer [Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 120402 (2003)]. We focus on the full Hilbert space instead of a restricted subspace. Exact diagonalization shows the degeneracy of zero-energy states scales exponentially with size of the system, with a recurrence relation between different system sizes. We solve the degeneracy problem by showing the ground states can be systematically constructed by inserting immobile walls of fermions into the chain. Mapping the counting problem to a combinatorial one and obtaining the exact generating function, we prove the recurrence relation on both open and periodic chains. We also provide an explicit mapping between ground states, giving a combinatorial explanation of the recurrence relation.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark mass relation from a standard-model boson operator representation in terms of fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Abstract The standard-model can be equivalently represented with its fields in a spin-extended basis, departing from fermion degrees of freedom. The common Higgs operator connects the electroweak and Yukawa sectors, restricting the top and bottom quark masses[Phys. Rev. D 99, 073001, 2019]. Using second quantization, within the heavy-particle sector, electroweak vectors, the Higgs field, and symmetry operators are expanded in terms of bilinear combinations of top and bottom quark operators, considering discrete degrees of freedom and chirality. This is interpreted as either a basis choice or as a description of composite models. The vacuum expectation value is calculated quantum mechanically, which relates to the common mass-generating scalar operator and it reproduces the vector and quark-doublet masses. This also links the corresponding scalar-vector and Yukawa vertices, and restricts the t- and b-quark masses in a hierarchy relation.</description>

      <title>Super volumes and KdV tau functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of curves are deeply related to the Kontsevich-Witten KdV tau function. They possess a Virasoro symmetry which comes out of recursion relations between the volumes due to Mirzakhani. Similarly, the super Weil-Petersson volumes of the moduli space of super curves with Neveu-Schwarz punctures are related to the Br\'ezin-Gross-Witten (BGW) tau function of the KdV hierarchy and satisfy a recursion due to Stanford and Witten, analogous to Mirzakhani's recursion. In this paper we prove that by also allowing Ramond punctures, the super Weil-Petersson volumes are related to the generalised BGW KdV tau function, which is a one parameter deformation of the BGW tau function. This allows us to prove that these new super volumes also satisfy the Stanford-Witten recursion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, which introduces the "Crossing the Portal" session of the NOW 2024 meeting, I discuss the value of the concepts of interdisciplinarity and innovation for neutrino physics. After some historical considerations, which provide an initial illustration of the significant role of these concepts, I review some well-known cases of neutrino science, involving both astrophysics and particle physics, which allow us to deepen the analysis. The importance of a harmonious relationship between theoretical elaborations and experiments emerges: effective collaboration between theoretical and experimental physicists played a key role in many of the successful cases and proved marginal or defective in the doubtful ones. The discussion highlights also the need to proceed armed with a patience, a virtue that Feynman himself indicated as essential to science, all the more necessary when investigating interesting but elusive particles such as neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the deuteron gravitational form factors (GFFs) and generalized parton distributions (GPDs) within the soft-wall AdS/QCD model, where deuteron is described by the bulk vector field with twist $\tau=6$. For the finite-temperature studies, we apply the soft-wall model, which is thermalized by introducing a thermal dilaton field. GPDs and charge density are considered in impact parameter (IP) space and at zero and finite temperatures. We plot the temperature dependence of these quantities in IP space and observe a decreasing of their peaks on temperature increasing. The gravitational root means squared radius obtained here is close to the range given by experimental data for the mass radius and has low sensitivity to the temperature.</description>

Abstract: We study the Solar System constraints on covariant $f(Q)$ gravity. The covariant $f(Q)$ theory is described by the metric and affine connection, where both the torsion and curvature vanish. Considering a model including a higher nonmetricity-scalar correction, $f(Q)= Q +\alpha Q^{n} - 2\Lambda$, we derive static and spherically symmetric solutions, which represent the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution with higher-order corrections, for two different ansatz of the affine connection. On the obtained spacetime solutions, we investigate the perihelion precession, light deflection, Shapiro delay, Cassini constraint, and gravitational redshift in the $f(Q)$ gravity. We place bounds on the parameter $\alpha$ with $n=2, 3$ in our model of $f(Q)$ gravity, using various observational data in the Solar System.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general strategy is proposed to explore the low-energy properties of two-dimensional nonlinear $\sigma$ models with $\theta$ terms. We demonstrate its application to nonlinear $\sigma$ models with the target space $\text{SU($N$)}$/H, which include $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$, complex Grassmannian manifolds as well as the flag $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ manifolds. By analyzing the symmetry and its anomaly content, we realize these nonlinear $\sigma$ models through perturbations added to the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. For the flag-manifold $\text{SU($N$)}/\text{U(1)}^{N-1}$ and $\text{SU($N$)})/\text{SO($N$)}$ models, those perturbations are shown to correspond to the marginal current-current operator with the specific sign which leads to a massless renormalization group flow to the SU(N)$_1$ fixed point. In contrast, a massive regime with a two-fold ground-state degeneracy is found for the $\mathbb{C}P^{N-1}$ ($N &gt;2$) and Grassmannian nonlinear $\sigma$ models at $\theta=\pi$.</description>

Abstract: To gain a deeper understanding of the glassy phase in $p$-spin quantum models, this paper examines the dynamics of the $N$-vector $\bm{x} \in \mathbb{R}^N$ through the framework of renormalization group theory. First, we focus on perturbation theory, which is more suitable than nonperturbative techniques due to the specific temporal non-locality of the model after disorder integration. We compute the one-loop $\beta$-function and explore the structure of its fixed points. Next, we develop the nonperturbative renormalization group approach based on the standard Wetterich-Morris formalism, using two approximation schemes to address the model's non-locality. We investigate the vertex expansion in the symmetric phase and assess the reliability of the approximations for the fixed-point solutions. Finally, we extend our analysis beyond the symmetric phase by using an expansion around the vacuum of the local potential. Our numerical investigations particularly focus on the cases $p = 2$ and $p=3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anyonic chains provide lattice realizations of a rich set of quantum field theories in two space-time dimensions. The latter play a central role in the investigation of generalized symmetries, renormalization group flows and numerous exotic phases of strongly-correlated systems. Here, a variational quantum simulation scheme is presented for the analysis of those anyonic chains which can be mapped to the restricted solid-on-solid~(RSOS) models of Andrews, Baxter and Forrester. An~$L_R$ site RSOS model associated with a Dynkin diagram containing~$p$ nodes is realized with~$L_R\lceil\ln_2 p\rceil$ qubits, where~$\lceil x\rceil$ is the smallest integer~$\geq x$. The scheme is benchmarked by realizing the ground states of RSOS Hamiltonians in the~$A_p$ family for~$4\leq p\leq8$ using a variational quantum-classical algorithm. The latter is based on the Euler-Cartan circuit ansatz. Topological symmetry operators are analyzed for the RSOS models at the quantum-critical points. Measurement of observables acting on~$\lceil\ln_2 p\rceil$ qubits is shown to capture the anyonic nature of the Hilbert space. The described quantum simulation scheme provides a systematic approach to give rise to a large family of quantum field theories which have largely eluded physical realizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07149v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of solving the dark energy and the coincidence problems by postulating the massless sector of closed strings. This sector constitutes the gravitational multiplet of string theory and, when applied to four-dimensional cosmology, predicts that \textit{the expansion of an open Universe defined in string frame is readily accelerating}. We confront the prediction with the late-time cosmological data of Type Ia supernovae and quasar absorption spectrum, which probe the evolutions of the Hubble parameter and possibly the fine-structure constant. We report that these observations are in admirable agreement with the prediction without any dark sector or coincidence problem. We estimate the Hubble constant, $H_{0}\simeq 71.2\pm 0.2\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$.</description>

In particular, we identify the quantum difference equations in equivariant variables with quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations, and give their monodromy in terms of geometric elliptic R-matrices. A novel geometric feature in these constructions is that the varieties under study are not holomorphic symplectic, yet nonetheless have representation-theoretic significance. In physics, they originate from 3d supersymmetric gauge theories with $\mathcal{N} = 2$ rather than $\mathcal{N} = 4$ supersymmetry. We discuss an application of the results to the ramified version of the quantum q-Langlands correspondence of Aganagic, Frenkel, and Okounkov.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Symmetries for Logarithmic Soft Theorems in Gauge Theory and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauge theories and perturbative gravity in four dimensions are governed by a tower of infinite-dimensional symmetries which arise from tree-level soft theorems. However, aside from the leading soft theorems which are all-loop exact, subleading ones receive loop corrections due to long-range infrared effects which result in new soft theorems with logarithmic dependence on the energy of the soft particle. The conjectured universality of these logarithmic soft theorems to all loop orders cries out for a symmetry interpretation. In this letter we initiate a program to compute long-range infrared corrections to the charges that generate the asymptotic symmetries in (scalar) QED and perturbative gravity. For late-time fall-offs of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields which give rise to infrared dressings for the matter fields, we derive finite charge conservation laws and show that in the quantum theory they correspond precisely to the first among the infinite tower of logarithmic soft theorems. This symmetry interpretation, by virtue of being universal and all-loop exact, is a key element for a holographic principle in spacetimes with flat asymptotics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modified dispersion relations (MDRs) and noncommutative geometries are phenomenological models of Planck-scale corrections to relativistic kinematics, motivated by several approaches to quantum gravity. High-energy astrophysical observations, while commonly used to test such effects, are limited by significant systematic uncertainties. In contrast, low-energy, nonrelativistic experiments provide greater control, with precision serving as an amplifier for Planck-suppressed corrections. We derive corrections to Pauli's equation for nonrelativistic spin-1/2 particles in a magnetic field, incorporating general MDRs and noncommutative geometries. Applying our framework to k-Poincar\'e symmetries and minimal-length quantum mechanics, we identify Planck-scale corrections accessible in the nonrelativistic regime. Using the electron's anomalous magnetic moment, we constrain model parameters, pushing the k-Poincar\'e scale in the bi-crossproduct representation beyond $10^{10}$ GeV. These results highlight the complementarity of low-energy precision tests and astrophysical observation in probing quantum gravity phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Finite cut-off JT and Liouville quantum gravities on the disk at one loop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the path integral formalism, we compute the disk partition functions of two dimensional Liouville and JT quantum gravity theories coupled to a matter CFT of central charge $c$, with cosmological constant $\Lambda$, in the limit $c\rightarrow -\infty$, $|\Lambda|\rightarrow\infty$, for fixed $\Lambda/c$ and fixed and finite disk boundary length $\ell$, to leading and first subleading order in the $1/|c|$ expansion. In the case of Liouville theory, we find perfect agreement with the asymptotic expansion of the known exact FZZT partition function. In the case of JT gravity, we obtain the first explicit results for the partition functions at finite cut-off, in the three versions (negative, zero and positive curvature) of the model. Our findings are in agreement with predictions from the recent proposal for a microscopic definition of JT gravity, including the $c\rightarrow -\infty$ expansion of the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary. In the negative curvature case, we also provide evidence for the emergence of an effective Schwarzian description at length scales much greater than the curvature length scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the integrability of two-dimensional theories that are obtained by a dimensional reduction of certain four-dimensional gravitational theories describing the coupling of Maxwell fields and neutral scalar fields to gravity in the presence of a potential for the neutral scalar fields. For a certain solution subspace, we demonstrate partial integrability by showing that a subset of the equations of motion in two dimensions are the compatibility conditions for a linear system. Subsequently, we study the integrability of these two-dimensional models from a complementary one-dimensional point of view, framed in terms of Liouville integrability. In this endeavour, we employ various machine learning techniques to systematise our search for numerical Lax pair matrices for these models, as well as conserved currents expressed as functions of phase space variables.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that a complex coordinate transformation maps the Taub-NUT instanton metric to a Kerr-Schild metric. This metric involves a semi-infinite line defect as the gravitational analog of the Dirac string, much like the original metric. Moreover, it facilitates three versions of classical double copy correspondence with the self-dual dyon in electromagnetism, one of which involving a nonlocal operator. The relevance to the Newman-Janis algorithm is briefly noted.</description>

      <title>The bosonic string spectrum and the explicit states up to level $10$ from the lightcone and the chaotic behavior of certain string amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the irreps and their multiplicities of bosonic string spectrum up to level 10 and we give explicitly the on shell lightcone states which make the irreps. For scalars and vectors we compute the multiplicity up to level 22 and 19 respectively. The first scalar at odd level appears at level 11. For the bosonic string in non critical dimensions we argue that at level $N$ there are always states transforming as tensors with $ s\ge N/2$ indices. Only in critical dimensions there are states with $s\le N/2$. Looking at the explicit coefficients of the combinations needed to make the irreps from the lightcone states we trace the origin of the chaotic behavior of certain cubic amplitudes considered in literature to the extremely precise and sensitive mixtures of states. For example the vectors at level $N=19$ are a linear combinations of states and when the coefficients are normalized to be integer some of them have more than 1200 figures.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills extension of the Loop Quantum Gravity-corrected Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we endeavour to build up a non-Abelian formulation to describe the self-interactions of massless vector bosons in the context of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). To accomplish this task, we start off from the modified Maxwell equations with the inclusion of LQG corrections and its corresponding local $U(1)$ gauge invariance. LQG effects in the electromagnetic interactions have significant importance, as they might be adopted to describe the flight time of cosmic photons coming from very high-energy explosions in the Universe, such as events of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). These photons have energy-dependent speeds, indicating that the velocity of light in the vacuum is not constant. To carry out the extension from the Abelian to the non-Abelian scenario, we shall follow the so-called Noether current procedure, which consists in recurrently introducing self-interactions into an initially free action for vector bosons by coupling the latter to the conserved currents of a global symmetry present in the action of departure. In the end of the non-Abelianization process, the initial global symmetry naturally becomes local. Once the Yang-Mills system includes LQG correction terms, it becomes possible to analyze how quantum-gravity induced contributions show up in both the electroweak and the QCD sectors of the Standard Model, providing a set-up for phenomenological investigations that may bring about new elements to discuss Physics beyond the Standard-Model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from High Temperature Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study finite temperature effects in string cosmology and their potential gravitational wave signature. Expanding on our recent work arXiv:2310.11494 , we consider a general configuration of highly excited open and closed strings at high enough temperature to be in the Hagedorn phase in 3+1 dimensions, in order to explore its cosmological implications. We find conditions, which can be satisfied in compactifications with moduli stabilization, that allow the long strings to remain in equilibrium in a controlled effective field theory, with equilibration driven by the joining and splitting of the dominant open string population. We calculate the emission rate of gravitons by long open strings, which we show is determined by ten dimensional flat space transition amplitudes available in the literature, and then find the total gravitational wave spectrum generated by the gas of long strings. The gravitational wave spectrum has robust characteristics. It peaks at frequencies of order 50-100 GHz, the same as for gravitational waves from the reheating epoch of the Standard Model. But the amplitude of the string signal is significantly larger than predicted by the Standard Model and its field theoretic extensions. The amplitude and other physical observables (such as the contribution to $\Delta N_{\text eff}$) are directly proportional to the string scale $M_s$; indicating that a potential signal may also determine the string scale. Our calculations provide one of the few examples of a signal of stringy origin that dominates over the field theory predictions. We give a physical explanation of our results and discuss further implications.</description>

Abstract: We construct the double copy of the chiral higher-spin theory. It is a Lorentz invariant theory with the little group spectrum given by the tensor square of the chiral higher-spin theory spectrum. Moreover, its interactions factorise in close analogy with the way interactions factorise in lower-spin double-copy theories. We also propose theories, which can be viewed as products of self-dual Yang-Mills theory, self-dual gravity and chiral higher-spin theories taken in different combinations and powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the deformations driven by the stress-energy tensor $T$ and investigate their relation to the flow equation for the background metric at the classical level. For a deformation operator $\mathcal{O}$ as a polynomial function of the stress-energy tensor, we develop a formalism that relates a deformed action to a flow equation for the metric in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It is shown that in the $T\bar{T}$ deformation and the $\mathcal{O}(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, the flow equations for the metric allow us to directly obtain exact solutions in closed forms. We also demonstrate the perturbative approach to find the same results. As several applications of the $\mathcal{O}(T)=\text{tr}[\textbf{T}]^m$ deformation, we discuss the relation between the deformations and gravitational models. Besides, we also deform the Lagrangians for scalar field theories.</description>

      <title>On-Shell Approach to Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an on-shell approach to study black hole mergers. Since, asymptotically, the initial and final states can be described by point-like spinning particles, we propose a massive three-point amplitude for the merger of two Schwarzschild black holes into a Kerr black hole. This three-point amplitude and the spectral function of the final state are fully determined by kinematics and the model-independent input about the black hole merger which is described by a complete absorption process. Using the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell (KMOC) formalism, we then reproduce the classical conservation laws for momentum and angular momentum after the merger. As an application, we use the proposed three-point to compute the graviton emission amplitude, from which we extract the merger waveform to all orders in spin but leading in gravitational coupling. Up to sub-subleading order in spin, this matches the classical soft graviton theorem. We conclude with a comparison to black hole perturbation theory, which gives complementary amplitudes which are non-perturbative in the gravitational coupling but to leading order in the extreme mass ratio limit. This also highlights how boundary conditions on a Schwarzschild background can be used to rederive the proposed on-shell amplitudes for merger processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the moduli of the universal geometry of $d=4$ $N=1$ heterotic vacua. Universal geometry refers to a family of heterotic vacua fibered over the moduli space. The universal geometry mimics aspects of the original heterotic vacua, in particular holomorphic data such as F-terms, as well as the Green-Schwarz Bianchi identity. Here we study first order deformations of the universal geometry and find this provides a shortcut to computing second order deformations of the original problem. The equations governing the moduli of the universal geometry are remarkably similar to the equations of the underlying heterotic theory and we find a fascinating double extension structure that mirrors the original heterotic problem. As an application we find first order universal deformations determine second order deformations of the original heterotic theory. This gives a shortcut to determining results that are otherwise algebraically unwieldy. The role of the D-terms is closely related to the existence of flat connections on the moduli space. Finally, we re-derive some of these results by direct differentiation - this direct approach requires significantly more calculation.</description>

Abstract: We study if and when mod-2 anomalies can be canceled by the Green-Schwarz mechanism with the introduction of an antisymmetric tensor field $B_{\mu\nu}$. As explicit examples, we examine $SU(2)$ and more general $Sp(n)$ gauge theories in four and eight dimensions. We find that the mod-2 anomalies of 8d $\mathcal{N}=1$ $Sp(n)$ gauge theory can be canceled, as expected from it having a string theory realization, while the mod-2 Witten anomaly of 4d $SU(2)$ and $Sp(n)$ gauge theory cannot be canceled in this manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We holographically study quantum chaos in hyperscaling-violating Lifshitz (HVL) theories (with charge). Specifically, we present a detailed computation of the out-of-time ordered correlator (OTOC) via shockwave analysis in the bulk HVL geometry with a planar horizon topology. We also compute the butterfly velocity ($v_{B}$) using the entanglement wedge reconstruction and find that it matches the result obtained from the shockwave analysis. Using a recently developed thermodynamic dictionary for HVL theories, we express $v_B$ purely in terms of boundary thermodynamic variables. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of $v_{B}$ with respect to the dynamical critical exponent ($z$), hyperscaling-violating parameter ($\theta$), entropy (more precisely, the ratio of entropy to the central charge, $\tilde{S}$), and charge (more precisely, the ratio of charge to the central charge, $\tilde{Q}$). Interestingly, $v_B$ varies non-monotonically with $z$ for $\tilde{S} &lt; 1$, whereas it increases monotonically with $z$ for $\tilde{S} \geq 1$. Additionally, $v_B$ varies non-monotonically with $\theta$ for non-zero charge. Moreover, $v_B$ monotonically increases with $\tilde{S}$ and decreases with $\tilde{Q}$ for all allowed values of $z$ and $\theta$. All these features are reported for combinations /{$z$, $\theta$, $\tilde{S}$, $\tilde{Q}$/} for which the temperature is positive, the null energy condition is satisfied, and $v_B$ is not superluminal. Unpacking the non-monotonicities in $v_B$ can offer interesting insights into these theories.</description>

      <title>Cryptographic tests of the python's lunch conjecture</title>

Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a subregion of the CFT allows for the recovery of a corresponding subregion of the bulk known as its entanglement wedge. In some cases, an entanglement wedge contains a locally but not globally minimal surface homologous to the CFT subregion, in which case it is said to contain a python's lunch. It has been proposed that python's lunch geometries should be modelled by tensor networks that feature projective operations where the wedge narrows. This model leads to the python's lunch (PL) conjecture, which asserts that reconstructing information from past the locally minimal surface is computationally difficult. In this work, we invoke cryptographic tools pertaining to a primitive known as the Conditional Disclosure of Secrets (CDS) to develop consequences of the projective tensor network model that can be checked directly in AdS/CFT. We argue from the tensor network picture that the mutual information between appropriate CFT subregions is lower bounded linearly by an area difference associated with the geometry of the lunch. Recalling that the mutual information is also computed by bulk extremal surfaces, this gives a checkable geometrical consequence of the tensor network model. We prove weakened versions of this geometrical statement in asymptotically AdS$_{2+1}$ spacetimes satisfying the null energy condition, and confirm it in some example geometries, supporting the tensor network model and by proxy the PL conjecture. On the other hand, we point out a tension between the PL conjecture and a plausible cryptographically inspired lower bound on the mutual information involving the complexity of reconstructing operators inside the lunch; this suggests the existence of protocols for computationally secure CDS requiring unexpectedly small entanglement.</description>

      <title>Gravity and Unification: Insights from SL(2N,C) Gauge Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The perspective that gravity governs the unification of all known elementary forces calls for an extension of the gauge gravity symmetry group $SL(2,C)$ to the broader local symmetry $SL(2N,C)$, where $N$ reflects the internal $% SU(N)$ symmetry subgroup. This extension is shown to lead to a consistent hyperunification framework, provided that the tetrad fields of $SL(2,C)$ retain their invertibility condition in the extended theory, thus maintaining their connection to gravity. As a result, while the full gauge multiplet of $SL(2N,C)$ typically comprises vector, axial-vector, and tensor field submultiplets of $SU(N)$, only the vector submultiplet and the singlet tensor field manifest in the observed particle spectrum. The axial-vector submultiplet remains decoupled from ordinary matter, while the tensor submultiplet acquires the Planck scale order masses. Consequently, the effective symmetry of the theory reduces to $SL(2,C)\times SU(N)$, bringing together $SL(2,C)$ gauge gravity and $SU(N)$ grand unification. As all states in $SL(2N,C)$ are also classified by their spin, some $SU(N)$ grand unified models, including the standard $SU(5)$, appear unsuitable for the standard spin-1/2 quarks and leptons. However, applying $SL(2N,C)$ symmetry to a model of composite quarks and leptons, where constituent chiral preons form the fundamental representations, identifies $SL(16,C)$ with its effective $SL(2,C)\times SU(8)$ symmetry accommodating all three quark-lepton families, as the most compelling candidate for hyperunification of the existing fundamental forces.</description>

      <title>$SU(2)\times SU(2)$ dilaton Weyl multiplets for maximal conformal supergravity in four, five, and six dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New dilaton Weyl multiplets are constructed in four and five space-time dimensions for $N=4$ and $N=2$ conformal supergravity respectively. They are constructed from a mixture of the old dilaton weyl multiplets with an on-shell vector multiplet. The old dilaton Weyl multiplets have a $USp(4)$ R-symmetry group whereas the new multiplets have $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ R-symmetry, which is a subgroup of $USp(4)$. In six dimensions, for the first time we construct a dilaton Weyl multiplet for $(2,0)$ conformal supergravity from a mixture of the standard Weyl multiplet and a tensor multiplet. The R-symmetry group for the dilaton Weyl multiplet in six dimensions is also $SU(2)\times SU(2)$.</description>

      <title>Generalised second law beyond the semiclassical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the generalised second law (GSL), with an appropriate modification, holds in perturbative gravity to all orders beyond the semiclassical limit and without a UV cutoff imposed on the fields. Our proof uses algebraic techniques and builds on the recent work of Faulkner and Speranza, which combined Wall's proof of the GSL with the identification of generalised entropy as the von Neumann entropy of a boost-invariant crossed product algebra. The key additional step in our approach is to further impose invariance under null translations. Doing so requires one to describe horizon exterior regions in a relational manner, so we introduce `dynamical cuts': quantum reference frames which give the location of a cut of the horizon. We use idealised dynamical cuts, but expect that our methods can be generalised to more realistic models. The modified GSL that we prove says that the difference in generalised entropies of the regions outside two dynamical cuts is bounded below by the free energy of the degrees of freedom giving the location of the later cut. If one takes a semiclassical limit, imposes a UV cutoff, and requires the cuts to obey certain energy conditions, then our result reduces to the standard GSL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study observables in the scattering of classical, spinning objects using the KMOC formalism. In particular, we derive formulas to higher order in spin and one loop $\mathcal{O}(G^2)$ for the spin kick and momentum impulse. Our derivation method is agnostic to the choice of theory or special conditions, such as the spin supplementary condition (SSC); we only rely on the generic structure of long-range scattering amplitudes of non-transverse, massive spinning fields in the classical limit. We check these formulas for the case of gravity and agree with previous results from the eikonal formalism after imposing a SSC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that the finiteness of quantum gravity amplitudes in fully compactified theories (at least in supersymmetric cases) leads to a bottom-up prediction for the existence of non-trivial dualities. In particular, finiteness requires the moduli space of massless fields to be compactifiable, meaning that its volume must be finite or at least grow no faster than that of Euclidean space. Moreover, we relate the compactifiability of moduli spaces to the condition that the lattice of charged objects transform in a semisimple representation under the action of the duality group. These ideas are supported by a wide variety of string theory examples.</description>

      <title>Lie, Noether, Kosmann, and Diffeomorphism Anomalies Redux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Noether procedure carries an inherent ambiguity due to the necessary local extension, no longer a symmetry, of the global symmetry. The gauging should fix the ambiguity once and for all, however, and, for translations, the general covariance demands us to use the Lie derivative. We argue that, with this alone and without any further tweaking, the Noether energy-momentum $\hat{\mathbb{T}}$ must equal the symmetric counterpart, $T$, inevitably and show the equality explicitly for general tensors. For spinors, a subtlety with the Lie derivative itself enters the issue and leads us to the Kosmann lift, often unnoticed by the physics community, from which $T=\hat{\mathbb{T}}$ again emerges straightforwardly and in a naturally symmetric form. Finally, we address how the same Kosmann lift affects the anomaly computations and show that the diffeomorphism anomaly from the seminal paper must be halved, while the venerable anomaly polynomials themselves stand unaffected. We discuss the ramifications of these findings.</description>

      <title>The UV Sensitivity of Axion Monodromy Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit axion monodromy inflation in the context of UV-complete theories and point out that its cosmological observables are sensitive to heavy fields with masses far above the Hubble scale, such as the moduli of flux compactifications. By studying a string-inspired two-field extension of axion monodromy, we reveal that the oscillatory modulation of the axion potential leads to continuous excitation of heavy fields during inflation when the modulation frequency exceeds the field masses. This finding challenges the conventional single-field description, as heavy moduli cannot be simply integrated out. Using a full bootstrap analysis, we demonstrate that this mechanism produces cosmological collider signals that bypass the usual Boltzmann suppression for heavy masses. Specifically, we identify detectably large signatures of heavy moduli in the primordial bispectrum, offering a promising avenue for probing high-energy physics through cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Random Circuits in the Black Hole Interior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a quantitative holographic relation between a microscopic measure of randomness and the geometric length of the wormhole in the black hole interior. To this end, we perturb an AdS black hole with Brownian semiclassical sources, implementing the continuous version of a random quantum circuit for the black hole. We use the random circuit to prepare ensembles of states of the black hole whose semiclassical duals contain Einstein-Rosen (ER) caterpillars: long cylindrical wormholes with large numbers of matter inhomogeneities, of linearly growing length with the circuit time. In this setup, we show semiclassically that the ensemble of ER caterpillars of average length $k\ell_{\Delta}$ and matter correlation scale $\ell_{\Delta}$ forms an approximate quantum state $k$-design of the black hole. At exponentially long circuit times, the ensemble of ER caterpillars becomes polynomial-copy indistinguishable from a collection of random states of the black hole. We comment on the implications of these results for holographic circuit complexity and for the holographic description of the black hole interior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anyon condensation in wormhole geometries is investigated in the Virasoro TQFT (VTQFT) formulation. We first review some elementary techniques of VTQFT and verify its consistency by showing that it reproduces semiclassical results, including the Hawking-Page phase transition and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of BTZ blackhole. We then summarize a gauging scheme for non-invertible symmetries referred to as anyon condensation and exhibit that it is applicable to VTQFT even though the category of Wilson lines associated with it is not strictly a modular tensor category (MTC). More specifically, it is shown that the partition function of the wormhole factorizes upon condensating the so-called diagonal condensable anyon in VTQFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1308.0100v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new unified formulation of the current algebra theory in general dimensions in terms of supergeometry. We take a QP-manifold, i.e. a differential graded (dg) symplectic manifold, as a fundamental framework. A Poisson bracket in a current algebra is constructed by the so called derived bracket of the graded Poisson structure induced from the above QP-structure. By taking a canonical transformation on a QP-manifold, correct anomalous terms in physical theories are derived. A large class of current algebras with and without anomalous terms (central extensions) are constructed from the above structure. Moreover, using this formulation, a new class of current algebras related higher structures are systematically obtained.</description>

We also discuss (conjectural) extension of this equivalence to the case of quantum supergroups and to some exceptional supergroups.</description>

      <title>Theory of Quantum Circuits with Abelian Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits with gates (local unitaries) respecting a global symmetry have broad applications in quantum information science and related fields, such as condensed matter theory and quantum thermodynamics. However, despite their widespread use, fundamental properties of such circuits are not well-understood. Recently, it was found that generic unitaries respecting a global symmetry cannot be realized, even approximately, using gates that respect the same symmetry. This observation raises important open questions: What unitary transformations can be realized with k-local gates that respect a global symmetry? In other words, in the presence of a global symmetry, how does the locality of interactions constrain the possible time evolution of a composite system? In this work, we address these questions for the case of Abelian (commutative) symmetries and develop constructive methods for synthesizing circuits with such symmetries. Remarkably, as a corollary, we find that, while the locality of interactions still imposes additional constraints on realizable unitaries, certain restrictions observed in the case of non-Abelian symmetries do not apply to circuits with Abelian symmetries. For instance, in circuits with a general non-Abelian symmetry such as SU($d$), the unitary realized in a subspace with one irreducible representation (charge) of the symmetry dictates the realized unitaries in multiple other sectors with inequivalent representations of the symmetry. Furthermore, in certain sectors, rather than all unitaries respecting the symmetry, the realizable unitaries are the symplectic or orthogonal subgroups of this group. We prove that none of these restrictions appears in the case of Abelian symmetries. This result suggests that global non-Abelian symmetries may affect the thermalization of quantum systems in ways not possible under Abelian symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05331v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we fix the complex structure and explore the moduli space of the heterotic system by considering two different yet "dual" deformation paths starting from a K\"ahler solution. They correspond to deformation along the Bott-Chern cohomology class and the Aeppli cohomology class respectively. Using the implicit function theorem, we prove the local existence of heterotic solutions along these two paths and hence establish an initial step to construct local moduli coordinates around a K\"ahler solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For almost 75 years, the general solution for the Schr\"odinger equation was assumed to be generated by an exponential or a time-ordered exponential known as the Dyson series. We study the unitarity of a solution in the case of a singular Hamiltonian and provide a new methodology that is not based on the assumption that the underlying space is $L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$. Then, an alternative operator for generating the time evolution that is manifestly unitary is suggested, regardless of the choice of Hamiltonian. The new construction involves an additional positive operator that normalizes the wave function locally and allows us to preserve unitarity, even when dealing with infinite dimensional or non-normed spaces. Our considerations show that Schr\"odinger and Liouville equations are, in fact, two sides of the same coin and together they provide a unified description for unbounded quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Solutions of Tetrahedron Equation from Quantum Cluster Algebra Associated with Symmetric Butterfly Quiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08814v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new solution to the tetrahedron equation by further pursuing the quantum cluster algebra approach in our previous works. The key ingredients include a symmetric butterfly quiver attached to the wiring diagrams for the longest element of type $A$ Weyl groups and the implementation of quantum $Y$-variables through the $q$-Weyl algebra. The solution consists of four products of quantum dilogarithms. By exploring both the coordinate and momentum representations, along with their modular double counterparts, our solution encompasses various known three-dimensional (3D) $R$-matrices. These include those obtained by Kapranov-Voevodsky (1994) utilizing the quantized coordinate ring, Bazhanov-Mangazeev-Sergeev (2010) from a quantum geometry perspective, Kuniba-Matsuike-Yoneyama (2023) linked with the quantized six-vertex model, and Inoue-Kuniba-Terashima (2023) associated with the Fock-Goncharov quiver. The 3D $R$-matrix presented in this paper offers a unified perspective on these existing solutions, coalescing them within the framework of quantum cluster algebra.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Quantization: numerical results for the Feynman propagator on a 1+1 lattice and the theoretical relation with Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present here the first lattice simulation of symplectic quantization, a new functional approach to quantum field theory which allows to define an algorithm to numerically sample the quantum fluctuations of fields directly in Minkowski space-time, at variance with all other present approaches. Symplectic quantization is characterized by a Hamiltonian deterministic dynamics evolving with respect to an additional time parameter $\tau$ analogous to the fictious time of Parisi-Wu stochastic quantization. In this work we present the numerical study of a real scalar field theory on a $d$=1+1 space-time lattice with a $\lambda \phi^4$ interaction. We find that for $\lambda \ll 1$ the two-point correlation function obtained numerically reproduces qualitatively well the shape of the free Feynman propagator. Within symplectic quantization the expectation values over quantum fluctuations are computed as dynamical averages along the dynamics in $\tau$, in force of a natural ergodic hypothesis connecting Hamiltonian dynamics with a generalized microcanonical ensemble. Analytically, we prove that this "microcanonical" ensemble, in the continuum limit, is equivalent to a "canonical-like" one where the probability density of field configurations is $P[\phi] \propto \exp(zS[\phi]/\hbar)$. The results from our simulations correspond to the value $z=1$ of the parameter in the canonical weight, which in this case is a well-defined probability density for field configurations in causal space-time, provided that a lower bounded interaction potential is considered. The form proposed for $P[\phi]$ suggests that our theory can be connected to ordinary quantum field theory by analytic continuation in the complex-$z$ plane.</description>

      <title>Spin foam amplitude of the black-to-white hole transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been conjectured that quantum gravity effects may cause the black-to-white hole transition due to quantum tunneling. The transition amplitude of this process is explored within the framework of the spin foam model on a 2-complex containing 56 vertices. We develop a systematic way to construct the bulk triangulation from the boundary triangulation to obtain the 2-complex. By using Thiemann's complexifier coherent state as the boundary state to resemble the semiclassical geometry, we introduce a procedure to calculate the parameters labeling the coherent state from the continuous curved geometry. Considering that triad fields of different orientations, i.e., $e_i^a$ and $-e_i^a$, give the same intrinsic geometry of the boundary, we creatively adopt the boundary state as a superposition of the coherent states associated with both orientations. We employ the method of complex critical point to numerically compute the transition amplitude. Despite the numerical results, it is interestingly found that the transition amplitude is dominated by the terms allowing the change in orientation. This suggests that the black-to-white hole transition should be accompanied by quantum tunneling process of a change in orientation.</description>

      <title>Vacuum amplitudes and time-like causal unitary in the loop-tree duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first proof-of-concept application to decay processes at higher perturbative orders of LTD causal unitary, a novel methodology that exploits the causal properties of vacuum amplitudes in the loop-tree duality (LTD) and is directly well-defined in the four physical dimensions of the space-time. The generation of loop- and tree-level contributions to the differential decay rates from a kernel multiloop vacuum amplitude is shown in detail, and explicit expressions are presented for selected processes that are suitable for a lightweight understanding of the method. Specifically, we provide a clear physical interpretation of the local cancellation of soft, collinear and threshold singularities, and of the local renormalisation of ultraviolet singularities. The presentation is illustrated with numerical results that showcase the advantages of the method.</description>

      <title>CMB Constraints on Natural Inflation with Gauge Field Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The natural inflation model with a periodic cosine potential is ruled out by recent Planck 2018 data for the decay constant $f \lesssim 5.5~M_{\rm Pl}$. If the Planck data is combined with the BICEP Keck array and BAO data, the model is excluded (at $2$-$\sigma$) for all values of $f$. In this context, we revisit the model when the pseudoscalar inflation $\phi$ is coupled with a gauge field via a coupling of the form $\frac{\alpha}{f} \phi F \tilde{F}$, where $F (\tilde F)$ denotes the gauge field (dual) strength tensor, and $\alpha$ is the coupling constant. The back-reactions associated with the gauge field production during the later stages of inflation extend the duration of inflation. We numerically evaluate the dynamics of the fields while neglecting the effects due to the perturbations in the inflaton field. It allows us to determine the scalar and tensor power spectra leading to the calculations of observables at the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) scales. We find that the natural inflation model survives the test of the latest data only for a certain range of the coupling constant $\alpha$. Our analysis shows that the latest constraints coming from the scalar spectral index are more stringent than the ones arising from the non-gaussianities and the running of the scalar spectrum. This leads to lower and upper bounds on $\xi_*$, the parameter that controls the growth of the gauge field.</description>

      <title>Scale-dependent chirality as a smoking gun for Abelian gauge fields during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-inflation models are a compelling candidate as a mechanism behind the accelerated expansion in the early universe in light of the possibility to embed them in higher dimensional UV complete theories and the exciting prospect of testing them with next-generation cosmological probes. Adding an Abelian gauge sector to axion-inflation models makes for a rich, interesting, phenomenology spanning from primordial black holes to gravitational waves (GWs). Several recent studies employ an approximate analytic (Gaussian) template to characterize the effect of gauge field production on cosmological perturbations. In this work we go beyond such approximation and numerically study particle production and the ensuing scalar and tensor spectra. We find a significant deviation from results based on log-normally distributed vector field excitations. As an important phenomenological application of the improved method, we study the expected chirality and spectral index of the sourced GW background at scales relevant for current and next-generation GW detectors. One striking feature is that of a scale-dependent chirality. We derive a consistency relation between these two observables that can serve as an important tool in identifying key signatures of multi-field dynamics in axion inflation.</description>

      <title>Effective Potential and Topological Photon Spheres: A Novel Approach to Black Hole Parameter Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we base our analysis on the assumption that the existence of a photon sphere is an intrinsic feature of any ultra-compact gravitational structure with spherical symmetry. Utilizing the concept of a topological photon sphere, we categorize the behaviors of various gravitational models based on the structure of their photon spheres. This innovative approach enables us to define boundaries for black hole parameters, subsequently allowing us to classify the model as either a black hole or a naked singularity. Indeed, we will demonstrate that the presence of this interplay between the gravitational structure and the existence of a photon sphere is a unique advantage that can be utilized from both perspectives. Our observations indicate that a gravitational model typically exhibits the behavior of a horizonless structure (or a naked singularity) when a minimum effective potential (a stable photon sphere) appears within the studied spacetime region. Additionally, in this study, we tried to investigate the effect of this structure on the behavior of the photon sphere by choosing models that are affected by the Perfect Fluid Dark Matter (PFDM). Finally, by analyzing a model with multiple event horizons, we show that the proposed method remains applicable even in such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Form factors of $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$ within light-cone QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we calculated the form factors of the weak decay process $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$, where the final charm baryon represents an excited state with spin-parity $\frac{1}{2}^-$. Utilizing the light-cone QCD sum rules approach, we incorporated the contributions of the lowest two charm baryon states: the ground state $\Lambda_c$ with $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^+$ and the excited state $\Lambda_c(2595)^+$ with $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^-$ in the hadronic representation of the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$ transition correlation function. This approach allows us to extract the form factors of the $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+$ from $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c^+$ transition. During the light-cone QCD sum rules procedure, we employed the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the $\Lambda_b$ baryon. Furthermore, by combining these form factors with the helicity amplitudes of the bottom baryon transition matrix elements, we calculated the differential decay widths for the processes $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+\ell^-\bar{\nu}_\ell$ and provided the optimal choice of the interpolating current for $\Lambda_c$ in this process. Additionally, within the lifetime of $\Lambda_b^0$, we obtained the absolute branching fractions for the semileptonic decays $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+ \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$. With the branching fractions of $\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+ \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$ calculated in this work, we also determined the parameter $R(\Lambda_c(2595)^+)$ which tests the lepton flavor universality. This parameter is defined as the ratio of branching fractions $Br(\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+\tau^-\bar{\nu}_\tau)$ and $Br(\Lambda_b^0 \to \Lambda_c(2595)^+\mu^-\bar{\nu}_\mu)$. Our results provide a valuable theoretical test for these decay channels and offer insights into the LCDAs of bottom baryons, paving the way for further in-depth investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to recent measurements, dark matter magnetic dipole moment is strongly constrained. In the composite Higgs models the magnetic dipole moment of the Dirac dark matter fermion and its mass can be suppressed by the approximate U(1) symmetry. We consider E_6 inspired composite Higgs model (E_6CHM) with U(1) symmetry violating operators, which give rise to dark matter's mass and coupling constant to Higgs boson. The dependence of the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section on the E_6CHM parameters is explored. We argue that there are regions of the parameter space which are still safe from all current constraints and may lead to spectacular LHC signatures.</description>

Abstract: The spin tensor is fundamental to relativistic spin hydrodynamics, but its definition is ambiguous due to the pseudogauge symmetry. We show that this ambiguity can be solved in interacting field theories. We prove that the mean-field limit of a modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with spin-spin interactions is equivalent to nondissipative spin hydrodynamics with a canonical spin tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: R-parity can be extended to a continuous global U(1)${}_R$ symmetry. We investigate whether an anomalous U(1)${}_R$ can be identified as the PQ symmetry suitable for solving the strong CP problem within supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model. In this case, U(1)${}_R$ is broken at some intermediate scale and the QCD axion is the R-axion. Moreover, the R-symmetry can be naturally gauged via the Green-Schwartz mechanism within completions to supergravity, thus evading the axion quality problem. Obstacles to realizing this scenario are highlighted and phenomenologically viable approaches are identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the three-loop Wilson coefficients of all physically relevant dimension-four operators, i.e. $G_{\mu\nu}^a G^{a,\mu\nu}$, $m_i\bar q_j q_j$ and $m_i m_j m_k^2$, in the short-distance expansion of the time-ordered product of a pair of gauge-singlet vector, axial-vector, scalar and pseudo-scalar currents. The results are given for a general non-Abelian gauge theory with arbitrary (compact semi-simple) gauge group and $n_f$ light fermion flavors (quarks) in a common arbitrary representation of the gauge group, which includes QCD as a special case. In particular, we allow for arbitrary flavor contents of each of the currents. For the axial-vector current the included contributions from so-called singlet diagrams are consistent with the one-loop axial anomaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a formula for trigonometric orthosymplectic $R$-matrices associated with any parity sequence, and establish their factorization into the ordered product of $q$-exponents parametrized by positive roots in the corresponding reduced root systems. The latter is crucially based on the construction of orthogonal bases of the positive subalgebra through $q$-bracketings and combinatorics of dominant Lyndon words, as developed in [Clark, Hill, Wang, "Quantum shuffles and quantum supergroups of basic type", Quantum Topol. 7 (2016), no.3, 553-638]. We further evaluate the affine orthosymplectic $R$-matrices, establishing their intertwining property as well as matching them with those obtained through the Yang-Baxterization technique of [Ge, Wu, Xue, "Explicit trigonometric Yang-Baxterization", Internat. J. Modern Phys. A 6 (1991), no.21, 3735-3779]. This reproduces the celebrated formulas of [Jimbo, "Quantum $R$ matrix for the generalized Toda system", Comm. Math. Phys. 102 (1986), no.4, 537-547] for classical BCD types and the formula of [Mehta, Dancer, Gould, Links, "Generalized Perk-Schultz models: solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation associated with quantized orthosymplectic superalgebras", J. Phys. A 39 (2006), no.1, 17-26] for the standard parity sequence.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutrinophilic mediators at FASER$\nu$, FLArE and FASER$\nu$2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High energy collider neutrinos have been observed for the first time by the FASER$\nu$ experiment. The detected spectrum of collider neutrinos scattering off nucleons can be used to probe neutrinophilic mediators with GeV-scale masses. We find that constraints on the pseudoscalar (axial vector) neutrinophilic mediator are close to the scalar (vector) case since they have similar cross section in the neutrino massless limit. We perform an analysis on the measured muon spectra at FASER$\nu$, and find that the bounds on the vector mediator from the current FASER$\nu$ data are comparable to the existing bounds at $m_{Z^\prime}\approx 0.2$ GeV. We also study the sensitivities to a neutrinophilic mediator at future Forward Physics Facilities including FLArE and FASER$\nu$2 by using both the missing transverse momentum and the charge identification information. We find that FLArE and FASER$\nu$2 can impose stronger bounds on both the scalar and vector neutrinophilic mediators than the existing bounds. The constraints on the scalar mediator can reach 0.08 (0.1) for $m_\phi\lesssim1$ GeV with (without) muon charge identification at FASER$\nu$2.</description>

      <title>Algebraic classification of the gravitational field in general metric-affine geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07153v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the algebraic classification of the gravitational field in four-dimensional general metric-affine geometries, thus extending the current results of the literature in the particular framework of Weyl-Cartan geometry by the presence of the traceless nonmetricity tensor. This quantity switches on four of the eleven fundamental parts of the irreducible representation of the curvature tensor under the pseudo-orthogonal group, in such a way that three of them present similar algebraic types as the ones obtained in Weyl-Cartan geometry, whereas the remaining one includes thirty independent components and gives rise to a new algebraic classification. The latter is derived by means of its principal null directions and their levels of alignment, obtaining a total number of sixteen main algebraic types, which can be split into many subtypes. As an immediate application, we determine the algebraic types of the broadest family of static and spherically symmetric black hole solutions with spin, dilation and shear charges in Metric-Affine Gravity.</description>

      <title>$SU(\infty)$ Quantum Gravity and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We highlight the structure and properties of an abstract approach to quantum cosmology and gravity, dubbed $SU(\infty)$-QGR. Beginning from the concept of the Universe as an isolated quantum system, the main axiom of is the existence of an infinite number of mutually commuting observables. Consequently, the Hilbert space of the Universe represents $SU(\infty)$ symmetry. This Universe as a whole is static and topological. Nonetheless, quantum fluctuations induce local clustering in its quantum state and divide it into approximately isolated subsystems representing $G \times SU(\infty)$, where $G$ is a generic finite-rank internal symmetry. Due to the global $SU(\infty)$ subsystems are entangled to the rest of the Universe. In addition to parameters characterizing the representation of $G$, their quantum states depend on four continuous parameters: two of them characterize the representation of $SU(\infty)$, a dimensionful parameter arises from the possibility of comparing representations of $SU(\infty)$ by different subsystems; the fourth parameter is a measurable used as time registered by an arbitrary subsystem chosen as a clock. It introduces a relative dynamics for subsystems, formulated by a symmetry-invariant effective Lagrangian defined on the (3+1)D space of the continuous parameters. At lowest quantum order, the Lagrangian is a Yang--Mills field theory for both $SU(\infty)$ and internal symmetries. We identify the common $SU(\infty)$ symmetry and its interaction with gravity. Consequently, $SU(\infty)$-QGR predicts a spin-1 mediator for quantum gravity (QGR). Apparently, this is in contradiction with classical gravity. Nonetheless, we show that an observer who is unable to detect the quantumness of gravity perceives its effect as curvature of the space of average values of the continuous parameters. We demonstrate Lorentzian geometry of this emergent classical spacetime.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetized black holes and swirling backgrounds in nonlinear electrodynamics: The ModMax case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on constructing electromagnetized black holes and vortex-like backgrounds within the framework of the ModMax theory--the unique nonlinear extension of Maxwell's theory that preserves conformal symmetry and electromagnetic duality invariance. We begin by constructing the Melvin-Bonnor electromagnetic universe in ModMax through a limiting procedure that connects the spacetime of two charged accelerating black holes with that of a gravitating homogeneous electromagnetic field. Building on this result, we proceed to construct the Schwarzschild and C-metric Melvin-Bonnor black holes within the ModMax theory, representing the first black hole solutions embedded in an electromagnetic universe in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics. While the characteristics of the Melvin-Bonnor spacetime and some of its black hole extensions have been widely examined, we demonstrate for the first time that the Schwarzschild-Melvin-Bonnor configuration exhibits an unusual Kerr-Schild representation. Following this direction, we also unveil a novel Kerr-Schild construction for the spacetime of two accelerating black holes, drawing on the intrinsic relationship between the Melvin-Bonnor spacetime and the C-metric. Finally, we expand the spectrum of exact gravitational solutions within Einstein-ModMax theory by constructing a vortex-like background that coexists with the Melvin-Bonnor universe. In this process, the Taub-NUT spacetime in ModMax has played a crucial role. We present this Taub-NUT solution in a different gauge that facilitates the comparison with the Melvin-Bonnor-Swirling case.</description>

      <title>Maximal chirality transfer in the photon-graviton conversion in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While photons and gravitons do not interact significantly, photons can be converted to gravitons in a background magnetic field -- a phenomenon known as the Gertsenshtein effect. In this paper, we investigate whether chiral electromagnetic (EM) waves can be converted to chiral gravitational waves (GW) in the presence of primordial magnetic fields during the radiation-dominated epoch of the early universe. We consider two situations wherein chirality is either present in the propagating EM waves or it exists in the background magnetic field. Our analysis shows that while the conversion probability increases with stronger magnetic fields, it remains insensitive to the chiral nature of the background magnetic field. Consequently, the net chirality parameter is independent of the chirality of the background field in both cases. Finally, we demonstrate that the present-day energy density of the produced chiral GWs peaks at a frequency of $\sim 100$ GHz, and the corresponding characteristic strain can be sensitive to current and future missions designed to detect high-frequency GWs.</description>

      <title>Charged superradiant instability in a spherical regular black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19261v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the stability of a spherically symmetric regular black hole when subjected to perturbations from a charged scalar field. This particular black hole is constructed by deforming the Minkowski spacetime. It has been observed that the charged superradiant instability arises only within a specific range of the deformation parameter, potentially resulting in an instability growth rate with a maximum magnitude of approximately $\text{Im} (M \omega) \sim 10^{-3}$. This growth rate significantly exceeds the instability identified in ABG black holes discussed in prior research, suggesting a notable timescale for detecting this phenomenon in astrophysical scenarios. Additionally, we conduct a thorough investigation into how the three parameters of the model influence the onset and intensity of the instability. Our analysis offers further insights into the possible emergence of this instability in spherically regular black holes and its association with the nonlinear effects of the electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the scalar field potential in nonmetricity gravity through Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00051v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accelerated expansion of the universe has been widely confirmed, posing challenges to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, particularly the cosmological coincidence problem. This has motivated the exploration of modified gravity theories, including non-metricity gravity, which explains cosmic acceleration without dark energy. In this work, we incorporate a quintessence scalar field into the non-metricity framework to model both inflation and late-time acceleration. Employing the Gaussian process method with a square exponential kernel, we reconstruct the scalar field potential, $V(\phi)$, from observational Hubble data sets coming from cosmic chronometers (CC) as well as from the method of radial baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in a model-independent approach. This approach allows us to obtain a suitable quintessence scalar field model that aligns with the observational Hubble data under the framework of power-law non-metricity gravity. Additionally, we compare our reconstructed potential with power-law scalar field potentials, revealing that these models show better agreement with the observational data, providing new insights into the dynamics of the universe. In contrast, we find that the early dark energy has minimal effect on the present-time accelerated expansion of the universe.</description>

      <title>Gravitational quasinormal modes in quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational perturbations of black holes in quadratic gravity, in which the Einstein-Hilbert term is supplemented by quadratic terms in the curvature tensor. In this class of theories, the Schwarzschild solution can coexist with modified black hole solutions, and both families are radially stable in a wide region of the parameter space. Here we study non-radial perturbations of both families of static, spherically symmetric black holes, computing the quasi-normal modes with axial parity and finding strong numerical evidence for the stability of these solutions under axial perturbations. The perturbation equations describe the propagation of a massless and a massive spin-two fields. We show that the Schwarzschild solution admits the same quasi-normal modes as in general relativity, together with new classes of modes corresponding to the massive spin-two degrees of freedom. The spectrum of the modified black hole solution has the same structure, but all modes are different from those of general relativity. We argue that both classes of modes can be excited in physical processes, suggesting that a characteristic signature of this theory is the presence of massive spin-two modes in the gravitational ringdown, even when the stationary solution is the same as in general relativity.</description>
