      <title>Topological end state and enhanced thermoelectric performance of a supramolecular device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supramolecular device (SMD) with topological end states and a noncovalent junction is rarely investigated but deemed promising for thermoelectric (TE) applications. We designed a new kind of SMD based on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains, and calculated TE properties of it using the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. By scaling TE performance under different optimization conditions, we found the best scenario. Our result shows that the existing topological end states indeed give rise to a large value of power factor, rendering a dimensionless figure-of-merit ZT above 2 in a broad range of chemical potential (doping). Moreover, by imposing the system to various perturbations including end state shift, structural change and disorder, we found that the SMD system possesses a prominent switch effect, further optimizing its performance for TE applications.</description>

      <title>Extrapolation to infinite model space of no-core shell model calculations using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ensemble of neural networks is employed to extrapolate no-core shell model (NCSM) results to infinite model space for light nuclei. We present a review of our neural network extrapolations of the NCSM results obtained with the Daejeon16 NN interaction in different model spaces and with different values of the NCSM basis parameter $\hbar\Omega$ for energies of nuclear states and root-mean-square (rms) radii of proton, neutron and matter distributions in light nuclei. The method yields convergent predictions with quantifiable uncertainties. Ground-state energies for $^{6}$Li, $^{6}$He, and the unbound $^{6}$Be, as well as the excited $(3^{+},0)$ and $(0^{+},1)$ states of $^{6}$Li, are obtained within a few hundred keV of experiment. The extrapolated radii of bound states converge well. In contrast, radii of unbound states in $^{6}$Be and $^{6}$Li do not stabilize.</description>

      <title>CENIC: Convex Error-controlled Numerical Integration for Contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art robotics simulators operate in discrete time. This requires users to choose a time step, which is both critical and challenging: large steps can produce non-physical artifacts, while small steps force the simulation to run slowly. Continuous-time error-controlled integration avoids such issues by automatically adjusting the time step to achieve a desired accuracy. But existing error-controlled integrators struggle with the stiff dynamics of contact, and cannot meet the speed and scalability requirements of modern robotics workflows. We introduce CENIC, a new continuous-time integrator that brings together recent advances in convex time-stepping and error-controlled integration, inheriting benefits from both continuous integration and discrete time-stepping. CENIC runs at fast real-time rates comparable to discrete-time robotics simulators like MuJoCo, Drake and Isaac Sim, while also providing guarantees on accuracy and convergence.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Driven Enhancement of Optical Vortex Line Robustness in Atmospheric Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of optical vortex structures in turbulent environments is critical for their applications in optical communication, quantum information, and structured light technologies. Although topological invariants, such as crossings and linking numbers, are fundamentally invariant, recent studies reveal that their observed values deteriorate considerably in turbulent conditions due to environmental effects. In this study, we introduce an alternative approach based on the geometric stability of three-dimensional singularity line shapes, demonstrating that shape-based tracing of singularities outperforms both topological and spectral methods in turbulence. To test this concept, we propose Flower Beams, a novel class of structured optical fields featuring controllable petal-like singularity morphologies. We construct an 81-element optical alphabet and classify these structures after turbulence using deep learning. Our findings reveal that shape-based tracing achieves classification accuracy exceeding 90% in the weaker turbulence regimes and remains highly competitive even in stronger turbulence, significantly outperforming spectral and topology-based approaches. Experimental results confirm that the predicted shape stability holds in real-world conditions. This study stablishes the shape of the singularities' lines as a scalable and resilient alternative for structured light tracing and transmission, opening new avenues for turbulence-robust-applications.</description>

      <title>A Fully Spin and Polarization Resolved Strong Field QED Algorithm for Particle-in-Cell Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern ultra-intense laser facilities can generate electromagnetic fields strong enough to accelerate particles to near-light speeds over micron-scale distances and also approach the QED critical field, resulting in highly nonlinear and relativistic quantum phenomena. For such conditions, ab-initio modeling techniques are required that capture the electromagnetic, relativistic particle, and quantum emission processes in the plasma. One such technique is particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. In this paper, we describe the underlying theory for and development, validation, and verification of an extension to standard QED-PIC in the OSIRIS framework to include spin- and polarization-resolved QED processes central to next-generation laser-plasma experiments. This code can advance the current understanding of spin- and polarization-dependent QED phenomena in ultra-intense laser-plasma interactions.</description>

      <title>PIC analysis of spatiotemporal THz emission from radial and longitudinal wakefields via copropagating chirped lasers in magnetized rippled plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excitation of radial and longitudinal wake-fields by two co-propagating chirped laser pulses in a rippled, magnetized plasma has been examined. This study aimed to clarify the spatiotemporal evolution of wake structures and assess their role in the generation of THz radiation. A Fourier-Bessel Particle-In-Cell (FBPIC) simulation framework, optimized for cylindrical geometries, has been employed to model the relativistic dynamics of plasma electrons under the combined influence of laser-induced ponderomotive forces and an external magnetic field. It has been shown that the beat frequency between the pulses modulates the ponderomotive force, driving nonlinear wake-field structures sustained by electron oscillations. Simulations performed with high spatial resolution have revealed that wake-field amplitude and coherence are strongly influenced by laser chirp, pulse duration, and plasma density. Distinct THz peaks have been identified in the Fourier-transformed spectra, with their amplitudes enhanced by resonant coupling between wake-field harmonics and the laser frequency modulation. Moreover, electron motion has been confined by the magnetic field, leading to improved energy gain and shaping of angular radiation patterns. These findings suggest that tailored laser and plasma configurations can be used to optimize energy transfer mechanisms, paving the way for more efficient wake-field usage and THz generation.</description>

      <title>3D PIC simulation and theoretical modeling of RF Laser pulse in magnetized plasma for the generation of multidimensional relativistic Wakefields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study, investigates the modulation of plasma wakefields in dense magnetized plasma driven by relativistic electron beams under transverse RF excitation. A self consistent theoretical framework, comprising the RF vector potential, Maxwells equations, and relativistic electron motion, is extended through full 3D electromagnetic particle in cell simulations. The results reveal systematic amplification and reshaping of wakefields under the combined action of external magnetic fields and RF drivers. Variations in the cyclotron to plasma frequency ratio dictate the radial positioning and gyromotion of plasma electrons, sharpening transverse confinement and stabilizing blowout structures. The RF amplitude introduces progressive modulation of radial excursions and transverse forces, enhancing wakefield symmetry and depth. Current density distributions confirm the nonlinear scaling with RF strength, evolving from weak perturbations into sharply structured ion channels. Scalar potentials and longitudinal fields exhibit pronounced sensitivity to pulse shape, polarization angle, frequency ratio, and driver density, each parameter producing distinct oscillatory features and confinement regimes. Plasma density sets the field strength and radial localization, while the modulation parameter governs the emergence of fine scale oscillatory bands, producing smooth to multiband transitions in longitudinal electric fields. Across all conditions, simulations confirm the reinforcement of ponderomotive force, resulting in controlled narrowing of electron sheaths, sharper scalar potential gradients, and extended acceleration zones.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic PIC analysis of THz generation by two color laser in various plasma gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, a theoretical and PIC numerical investigation of THz emission driven by two color femtosecond laser fields in gaseous plasmas is conducted. The model is formulated in cylindrical coordinates to capture the inherent radial symmetry of laser plasma interactions. Starting from a hydrodynamic description of plasma electrons coupled with Maxwells equations, the nonlinear photocurrent dynamics that underpin the emission process is derived. The results reveal that the asymmetry induced by the superposition of the fundamental and second-harmonic fields plays a central role in breaking inversion symmetry, thereby generating a net directional current that radiates in the THz regime. Systematic analysis demonstrates that gas composition, ionization fraction, and the intensity ratio of the two fields strongly influence both the spectral characteristics and efficiency of THz radiation.</description>

      <title>Accelerating two-dimensional tensor network optimization by preconditioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit gradient-based optimization for infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS), a tensor network ansatz for simulating many-body quantum systems. This approach is hindered by two major challenges: the high computational cost of evaluating energies and gradients, and an ill-conditioned optimization landscape that slows convergence. To reduce the number of optimization steps, we introduce an efficient preconditioner derived from the leading term of the metric tensor. We benchmark our method against standard optimization techniques on the Heisenberg and Kitaev models, demonstrating substantial improvements in overall computational efficiency. Our approach is broadly applicable across various contraction schemes, unit cell sizes, and Hamiltonians, highlighting the potential of preconditioned optimization to advance tensor network algorithms for strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Learning conformational ensembles of proteins based on backbone geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models have recently been proposed for sampling protein conformations from the Boltzmann distribution, as an alternative to often prohibitively expensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. However, current state-of-the-art approaches rely on fine-tuning pre-trained folding models and evolutionary sequence information, limiting their applicability and efficiency, and introducing potential biases. In this work, we propose a flow matching model for sampling protein conformations based solely on backbone geometry - BBFlow. We introduce a geometric encoding of the backbone equilibrium structure as input and propose to condition not only the flow but also the prior distribution on the respective equilibrium structure, eliminating the need for evolutionary information. The resulting model is orders of magnitudes faster than current state-of-the-art approaches at comparable accuracy, is transferable to multi-chain proteins, and can be trained from scratch in a few GPU days. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance with reduced inference time, across not only an established benchmark of naturally occurring proteins but also de novo proteins, for which evolutionary information is scarce or absent. BBFlow is available at https://github.com/graeter-group/bbflow.</description>

      <title>CrystalFormer-RL: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Materials Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning played an instrumental role in enhancing the instruction-following and reasoning abilities of large language models. In this work, we employ reinforcement fine-tuning for materials design, in which discriminative machine learning models are used to provide rewards to the autoregressive transformer-based materials generative model CrystalFormer. By optimizing the reward signals-such as energy above the convex hull and material properties figures of merit-reinforcement fine-tuning infuses knowledge from discriminative models into generative models. The resulting model, CrystalFormer-RL, shows enhanced stability in generated crystals and successfully discovers crystals with desirable yet conflicting material properties, such as substantial dielectric constant and band gap simultaneously. Notably, we observe that reinforcement fine-tuning not only enables the property-guided material design but also unlocks property-based material retrieval behavior of pretrained generative model. The present framework opens an exciting gateway to the synergies of the machine learning ecosystem for materials design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10299v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise and accurate estimation of cosmological parameters is crucial for understanding the Universe's dynamics and addressing cosmological tensions. In this methods paper, we explore bio-inspired metaheuristic algorithms, including the Improved Multi-Operator Differential Evolution scheme and the Philippine Eagle Optimization Algorithm (PEOA), alongside the relatively known genetic algorithm, for cosmological parameter estimation. Using mock data that underlay a true fiducial cosmology, we test the viability of each optimization method to recover the input cosmological parameters with confidence regions generated by bootstrapping on top of optimization. We compare the results with Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in terms of accuracy and precision, and show that PEOA performs comparably well under the specific circumstances provided. Understandably, Bayesian inference and optimization serve distinct purposes, but comparing them highlights the potential of nature-inspired algorithms in cosmological analysis, offering alternative pathways to explore parameter spaces and validate standard results.</description>

Abstract: Genetic algorithm (GA) belongs to a class of nature-inspired evolutionary algorithms that leverage concepts from natural selection to perform optimization tasks. In cosmology, the standard method for estimating parameters is the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, renowned for its reliability in determining cosmological parameters. This paper presents a pedagogical examination of GA as a potential corroborative tool to MCMC for cosmological parameter estimation. Utilizing data sets from cosmic chronometers and supernovae with a curved $\Lambda$CDM model, we explore the impact of GA's key hyperparameters -- such as the fitness function, crossover rate, and mutation rate -- on the population of cosmological parameters determined by the evolutionary process. We compare the results obtained with GA to those by MCMC, analyzing their effectiveness and viability for cosmological application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our work is concerned with simplicial complexes that describe higher-order interactions in real complex systems. This description allows to go beyond the pairwise node-to-node representation that simple networks provide and to capture a hierarchy of interactions of different orders. The prime contribution of this work is the introduction of geometric measures for these simplicial complexes. We do so by noting the non-commutativity of the algebra associated with their matrix representations and consequently we bring to bear the spectral triplet formalism of Connes on these structures and then notions of associated dimensions, curvature, and distance can be computed to serve as characterizing features in addition to known topological metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an accelerated algorithm for computing an approximate eigenvalue decomposition of bistochastic normalized kernel matrices. Our approach constructs a low rank approximation of the original kernel matrix by the pivoted partial Cholesky algorithm and uses it to compute an approximate decomposition of its bistochastic normalization without requiring the formation of the full kernel matrix. The cost of the proposed algorithm depends linearly on the size of the employed training dataset and quadratically on the rank of the low rank approximation, offering a significant cost reduction compared to the naive approach. We apply the proposed algorithm to the kernel based extraction of spatiotemporal patterns from chaotic dynamics, demonstrating its accuracy while also comparing it with an alternative algorithm consisting of subsampling and Nystroem extension.</description>

Abstract: Classical phase-field theories of brittle fracture capture toughness-controlled crack growth but do not account for the material's strength surface, which governs fracture nucleation in the absence of cracks. The phase-field formulation of Kumar et al. (2020) proposed a blueprint for incorporating the strength surface while preserving toughness-controlled propagation by introducing a nucleation driving force and presented results for the Drucker-Prager surface. Following this blueprint, Chockalingam (2025) recently derived a general driving-force expression that incorporates arbitrary strength surfaces. The present work implements this driving force within a finite-element framework and incorporates representative strength surfaces that span diverse mathematical and physical characteristics-the Mohr-Coulomb, 3D Hoek-Brown, and Mogi-Coulomb surfaces. Through simulations of canonical fracture problems, the formulation is comprehensively validated across fracture regimes, capturing (i) nucleation under uniform stress, (ii) crack growth from large pre-existing flaws, and (iii) fracture governed jointly by strength and toughness. While the strength surfaces examined here already encompass a broad range of brittle materials, the results demonstrate the generality and robustness of the proposed driving-force construction for materials governed by arbitrary strength surfaces.</description>

      <title>Self-adaptive weighting and sampling for physics-informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has emerged as a promising framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Nevertheless, training these models on complex problems remains challenging, often leading to limited accuracy and efficiency. In this work, we introduce a hybrid adaptive sampling and weighting method to enhance the performance of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). The adaptive sampling component identifies training points in regions where the solution exhibits rapid variation, while the adaptive weighting component balances the convergence rate across training points. Numerical experiments show that applying only adaptive sampling or only adaptive weighting is insufficient to consistently achieve accurate predictions, particularly when training points are scarce. Since each method emphasizes different aspects of the solution, their effectiveness is problem dependent. By combining both strategies, the proposed framework consistently improves prediction accuracy and training efficiency, offering a more robust approach for solving PDEs with PINNs.</description>
