      <title>Multi-functional reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whereas the power of reservoir computing (RC) in inferring chaotic systems has been well established in the literature, the studies are mostly restricted to mono-functional machines where the training and testing data are acquired from the same attractor. Here, using the strategies of attractor labeling and trajectory separation, we propose a new scheme of RC capable of learning multiple attractors generated by entirely different dynamics, namely multi-functional RC. Specifically, we demonstrate that by incorporating a label channel into the standard RC, a single machine is able to learn from data the dynamics of multiple chaotic attractors, while each attractor can be accurately retrieved by inputting just a scalar in the prediction phase. The dependence of the machine performance on the labeling and separation parameters is investigated, and it is found that the machine performance is optimized when the parameters take intermediate values. The working mechanism of multi-functional RC is analyzed by the method of functional networks in neuroscience, and it is revealed that each attractor is represented by a stable, unique functional network in the reservoir, and the optimal performance arises as a balance between the stability, complexity, and distinguishability of the functional networks.</description>

      <title>Analytical calculation of the kinetic q factor and resonant response of toroidally confined plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking perturbations in axisymmetric toroidal plasma configurations have a drastic impact on particle, energy, and momentum transport in fusion devices, thereby affecting their confinement properties. The perturbative modes strongly affect particles with specific kinetic characteristics through resonant mode-particle interactions. In this work we present an analytical calculation of the kinetic q factor enabling the identification of particles with kinetic properties that meet the resonant conditions. This allows us to predict the locations and structures of the corresponding resonant island-chains, as well as the existence of transport barriers in the particle phase space. The analytical results, derived for the case of a large aspect ratio configuration, are systematically compared to numerical simulations, and their domain of validity is thoroughly investigated and explained. Our findings demonstrate that calculating the kinetic q factor and its dependence on both particle and magnetic field characteristics, provides a valuable tool for understanding and predicting the resonant plasma response to non-axisymmetric perturbations. Moreover, this approach can be semi-analytically applied to generic realistic experimental equilibria, offering a low-computational-cost method for scenario investigations under various multiscale perturbative modes.</description>

      <title>Fourier neural operators for spatiotemporal dynamics in two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows for most real-world applications remains an outstanding computational challenge. Several machine learning approaches have recently been proposed to alleviate the computational cost even though they become unstable or unphysical for long time predictions. We identify that the Fourier neural operator (FNO) based models combined with a partial differential equation (PDE) solver can accelerate fluid dynamic simulations and thus address computational expense of large-scale turbulence simulations. We treat the FNO model on the same footing as a PDE solver and answer important questions about the volume and temporal resolution of data required to build pre-trained models for turbulence. We also discuss the pitfalls of purely data-driven approaches that need to be avoided by the machine learning models to become viable and competitive tools for long time simulations of turbulence.</description>
