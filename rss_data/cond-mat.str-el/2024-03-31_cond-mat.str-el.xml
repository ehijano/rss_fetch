      <title>2-Morita Equivalent Condensable Algebras in Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify $E_2$ condensable algebras in a modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ up to 2-Morita equivalent. From physical perspective, it is equivalent to say we give the criterion when different $E_2$ condensable algebras result in a same condensed topological phase in a 2d anyon condensation process. By taking left and right centers of $E_1$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, we can exhaust all 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$. This paper gives a complete interplay between $E_1$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, 2-Morita equivalent $E_2$ condensable algebras in $\mathcal{C}$, and lagrangian algebras in $\mathcal{C}\boxtimes \overline{\mathcal{C}}$.
  The relations between different condensable algebras can be translated to their module categories, which corresponds to the domain walls in topological orders. We introduce a two-step condensation process and study the fusion of domain walls. We also find an automorphism of an $E_2$ condensable algebra may lead to a non-trivial braided autoequivalence in the condensed phase. As concrete examples, we interpret the categories of quantum doubles of finite groups. We develop a lattice model depiction of $E_1$ condensable algebras, in which the role played by the left and right centers can be realized on a lattice model. Examples beyond group symmetries are also been discussed.
  The classification of condensable algebras and domain walls motive us to introduce some promising concepts such as categorical quantum entanglement. Moreover, our results can be generalized to Witt equivalent modular tensor categories.</description>

      <title>Spinon Kondo lattice in quantum spin liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental observations of Kondo resonances in cobalt atoms on single layer 1T-TaSe$_{2}$, we theoretically investigate the effect of coupling a U(1) quantum spin liquid with a spinon Fermi surface to a lattice of Anderson impurities. Within the slave-rotor formalism, we find that above a critical coupling strength between the spin liquid and impurity lattice, the spinons hybridize to form heavy quasiparticles near the Fermi level, realizing a {\it spinon Kondo lattice phase} analogous to heavy fermion materials. Using the Bethe-Salpeter equation and accounting for emergent gauge fluctuations, we compute the spectral density and density of states, revealing the formation of spinon-chargon bound states in the spinon Kondo lattice phase. We characterize the thermodynamic and spectroscopic signatures of this phase, demonstrating specific heat and neutron scattering responses distinct from a pure quantum spin liquid. Our findings establish the spinon Kondo lattice as a framework to study the rich physics of spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Piezomagnetism in the Ising ferromagnet URhGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piezomagnetism, linear response between strain and magnetic field, is relatively unexplored cross-correlation but has promising potential as a novel probe of time-reversal-symmetry breaking in various classes of materials. Interestingly, there has been no report of piezomagnetism in ferromagnets, most archetypal time-reversal-symmetry-broken materials. This half-century absence of piezomagnetic ferromagnets is attributable to complications originating from multiple-domain states, as well as from changes in the magnetic point group by rotation of magnetic moment. Here, we report characteristic V-shaped magnetostriction in the Ising itinerant ferromagnet URhGe, observed by simultaneous multi-axis strain measurement technique utilizing optical fiber Bragg grating sensors. This novel magnetostriction occurs only under fields along the c axis and does not scale with the square of magnetization. Such unconventional feature indicates piezomagnetism as its origin. Our observation, marking the first report of piezomagnetism in ferromagnets, is owing to the mono-domain switching and the Ising magnetization. The obtained piezomagnetic coefficients are fairly large, implying that Ising ferromagnets are promising frontiers when seeking for materials with large piezomagnetic responses.</description>

      <title>Local magnetic moment formation and Kondo screening in the presence of Hund exchange: the two-band Hubbard model analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study formation and screening of local magnetic moments in the two-band Hubbard model in the presence of Hund exchange interaction using dynamic mean field theory approach. The characteristic temperatures of the formation, beginning and full screening of local magnetic moments are obtained from the analysis of temperature dependencies of the orbital, charge, and spin susceptibilities, as well as the respective instantaneous correlation functions. At half filling we find the phase diagram, which is similar to the single-orbital case with wide region of formation of local magnetic moments below the orbital Kondo temperature. Similarly to the single-orbital case, with decreasing temperature the screening of local magnetic moments is preceded by appearance of fermionic quasiparticles. In the two-band case the quasiparticles are however present also in some temperature region above the Mott insulating phase. At finite doping we find broad regime of presence of local magnetic moments, which coexist with incoherently or coherently moving holes. We also find, similarly to the half filled case, finite temperature interval in the doped regime, when the fermionic quasiparticles are formed, but do not yet screen local magnetic moments.</description>

      <title>Tuning Fermi Liquids with Sub-wavelength Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of whether or not passive sub-wavelength cavities can alter the properties of quantum materials is currently attracting a great deal of attention. In this Letter we show that the Fermi liquid parameters of a two-dimensional metal are modified by cavity polariton modes, and that these changes can be monitored by measuring a paradigmatic magneto-transport phenomenon, Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in a weak perpendicular magnetic field. This effect is intrinsic, and totally unrelated to disorder. As an illustrative example, we carry out explicit calculations of the Fermi liquid parameters of graphene in a planar van der Waals cavity formed by natural hyperbolic crystals and metal gates.</description>

      <title>Field tuning Kitaev systems for spin fractionalization and topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The honeycomb Kitaev model describes a $Z_2$ spin liquid with topological order and fractionalized excitations consisting of gapped $\pi$-fluxes and free Majorana fermions. Competing interactions, even when not very strong, are known to destabilize the Kitaev spin liquid. Magnetic fields are a convenient parameter for tuning between different phases of the Kitaev systems, and have even been investigated for potentially counteracting the effects of other destabilizing interactions leading to a revival of the topological phase. Here we review the progress in understanding the effects of magnetic fields on some of the perturbed Kitaev systems, particularly on fractionalization and topological order.</description>

      <title>Metamagnetism in the high-pressure tetragonal phase of UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A structural orthorhombic-to-tetragonal phase transition was recently discovered in the heavy-fermion compound UTe$_2$ at a pressure $p^*\simeq3-8$~GPa [Honda \textit{et al.}, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. \textbf{92}, 044702 (2023); Huston \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Mat. \textbf{6}, 114801 (2022)]. In the high-pressure tetragonal phase, a phase transition at $T_x=235$~K and a superconducting transition at $T_{sc}=2$~K have been revealed. In this work, we present an electrical-resistivity study of UTe$_2$ in pulsed magnetic fields up to $\mu_0H=58$~T combined with pressures up to $p$ = 6 GPa. The field was applied in a direction tilted by 30~$^\circ$~from \textbf{b} to \textbf{c} in the orthogonal structure, which is identified as the direction \textbf{c} of the tetragonal structure. In the tetragonal phase, the presence of superconductivity is confirmed and signatures of metamagnetic transitions are observed at the fields $\mu_0H_{x1}=24$~T and $\mu_0H_{x2}=34$~T and temperatures smaller than $T_x$. We discuss the effects of uniaxial pressure and we propose that a magnetic ordering drives the transition at $T_x$.</description>

      <title>Cavity electrodynamics of van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures host many-body quantum phenomena that can be tuned in situ using electrostatic gates. These gates are often microstructured graphite flakes that naturally form plasmonic cavities, confining light in discrete standing waves of current density due to their finite size. Their resonances typically lie in the GHz - THz range, corresponding to the same $\mu$eV - meV energy scale characteristic of many quantum effects in the materials they electrically control. This raises the possibility that built-in cavity modes could be relevant for shaping the low-energy physics of vdW heterostructures. However, capturing this light-matter interaction remains elusive as devices are significantly smaller than the diffraction limit at these wavelengths, hindering far-field spectroscopic tools. Here, we report on the sub-wavelength cavity electrodynamics of graphene embedded in a vdW heterostructure plasmonic microcavity. Using on-chip THz spectroscopy, we observed spectral weight transfer and an avoided crossing between the graphite cavity and graphene plasmon modes as the graphene carrier density was tuned, revealing their ultrastrong coupling. Our findings show that intrinsic cavity modes of metallic gates can sense and manipulate the low-energy electrodynamics of vdW heterostructures. This opens a pathway for deeper understanding of emergent phases in these materials and new functionality through cavity control.</description>

      <title>Corner modes in Non-Hermitian long-range model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider non-Hermitian (NH) analog of a second-order topological insulator, protected by chiral symmetry, in the presence of second-nearest neighbor hopping elements to theoretically investigate the interplay between long-range and topological order away from Hermiticity. In addition to the four zero-energy corner modes present in the first nearest neighbor hopping model, we uncover that the second nearest neighbor hopping introduces another topological phase with sixteen zero-energy corner modes. Importantly, the NH effects are manifested in altering the Hermitian phase boundaries for both the models. While comparing the complex energy spectrum under open boundary conditions, and bi-orthogonalized quadrupolar winding number (QWN) in real space, we resolve the apparent anomaly in the bulk boundary correspondence of the NH system as compared to the Hermitian counterpart by incorporating the effect of non-Bloch form of momentum into the mass term. The above invariant is also capable of capturing the phase boundaries between the two different topological phases where the degeneracy of the corner modes is evident, as exclusively observed for the second nearest neighbor model.</description>

      <title>Simulating the dynamics of large many-body quantum systems with Schr\"odinger-Feynman techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of powerful numerical techniques has drastically improved our understanding of quantum matter out of equilibrium. Inspired by recent progress in the area of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, this paper highlights hybrid Schr\"odinger-Feynman techniques as an innovative approach to efficiently simulate certain aspects of many-body quantum dynamics on classical computers. To this end, we explore the nonequilibrium dynamics of two large subsystems, which interact sporadically in time, but otherwise evolve independently from each other. We consider subsystems with tunable disorder strength, relevant in the context of many-body localization, where one subsystem can act as a bath for the other. Importantly, studying the full interacting system, we observe that signatures of thermalization are enhanced compared to the reference case of having two independent subsystems. Notably, with the here proposed Schr\"odinger-Feynman method, we are able to simulate the pure-state survival probability in systems significantly larger than accessible by standard sparse-matrix techniques.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from On-Chip Metallization on 2D Topological Chalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a versatile class of quantum materials of interest to various fields including, e.g., nanoelectronics, optical devices, and topological and correlated quantum matter. Tailoring the electronic properties of TMDs is essential to their applications in many directions. Here, we report that a highly controllable and uniform on-chip 2D metallization process converts a class of atomically thin TMDs into robust superconductors, a property belonging to none of the starting materials. As examples, we demonstrate the introduction of superconductivity into a class of 2D air-sensitive topological TMDs, including monolayers of Td-WTe2, 1T'-MoTe2 and 2H-MoTe2, as well as their natural and twisted bilayers, metalized with an ultrathin layer of Palladium. This class of TMDs are known to exhibit intriguing topological phases ranging from topological insulator, Weyl semimetal to fractional Chern insulator. The unique, high-quality two-dimensional metallization process is based on our recent findings of the long-distance, non-Fickian in-plane mass transport and chemistry in 2D that occur at relatively low temperatures and in devices fully encapsulated with inert insulating layers. Highly compatible with existing nanofabrication techniques for van der Waals (vdW) stacks, our results offer a route to designing and engineering superconductivity and topological phases in a class of correlated 2D materials.</description>

      <title>On the Hartree-Fock Ground State Manifold in Magic Angle Twisted Graphene Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) can exhibit correlated insulator behavior at half-filling. Seminal theoretical results towards understanding this phase in MATBG has shown that Hartree-Fock ground states (with a positive charge gap) can be exact many-body ground states of an idealized flat band interacting (FBI) Hamiltonian. We prove that in the absence of spin and valley degrees of freedom, the only Hartree-Fock ground states of the FBI Hamiltonian for MATBG are two ferromagnetic Slater determinants. Incorporating spin and valley degrees of freedom, we provide a complete characterization of the Hartree-Fock ground state manifold, which is generated by a ${\rm U}(4) \times {\rm U}(4)$ hidden symmetry group acting on five elements. We also introduce new tools for ruling out translation symmetry breaking in the Hartree-Fock ground state manifold, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Long-Time Dynamics in Quantum Many-Body Systems by Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerically computing physical quantities of time-evolved states in quantum many-body systems is a challenging task in general. Here, we propose a method that utilizes reliable short-time data of physical quantities to accurately forecast long-time behavior. The method is based on the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which is commonly used in fluid dynamics. The effectiveness and applicability of the DMD in quantum many-body systems such as the Ising model in the transverse field at the critical point are studied, even when the input data exhibits complicated features such as multiple oscillatory components and a power-law decay with long-ranged quantum entanglements unlike fluid dynamics. It is demonstrated that the present method enables accurate forecasts at time as long as nearly an order of magnitude longer than that of the short-time training data. Effects of noise on the accuracy of the forecast are also investigated, because they are important especially when dealing with the experimental data. We find that a few percent of noise does not affect the prediction accuracy destructively.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible symmetries act locally by quantum operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible symmetries of quantum field theories and many-body systems generalize the concept of symmetries by allowing non-invertible operations in addition to more ordinary invertible ones described by groups. The aim of this paper is to point out that these non-invertible symmetries act on local operators by quantum operations, i.e. completely positive maps between density matrices, which form a natural class of operations containing both unitary evolutions and measurements and play an important role in quantum information theory. This observation will be illustrated by the Kramers--Wannier duality of the one-dimensional quantum Ising chain, which is a prototypical example of non-invertible symmetry operations.</description>

      <title>Controlling the dynamics of atomic correlations via the coupling to a dissipative cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report the onset of periodic oscillations of coherences in an interacting bosonic gas coupled to a resonator after a quantum quench. This dynamics extends the collapse and revival features of atomic correlations in optical lattices to a dissipative scenario and exhibits hallmarks of synchronization. The behavior emerges from the interplay of the quantum dissipative nature of the cavity field and the presence of a (approximate) strong symmetry in the dissipative system, providing a general recipe to engineer intriguing quantum dynamics. Additionally, we show that the approximate symmetry can arise dynamically during self-organization and can be employed to obtain long-lived coherences.</description>

      <title>On AdS$_3$/ICFT$_2$ with a dynamical scalar field located on the brane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exploit holographic duality to study the system of a one-dimensional interface contacting two semi-infinite two-dimensional CFTs. Central to our investigation is the introduction of a dynamical scalar field located on the bulk interface brane which breaks the scaling symmetry of the dual interface field theory, along with its consequential backreaction on the system. We define an interface entropy from holographic entanglement entropy. At zero temperature we construct several illustrative examples and observe that the $g$-theorem is always satisfied. These examples also reveal distinct features of the interface entropy that are intricately linked to the scalar potential profiles. At finite temperature we find that the dynamical scalar field enables the bulk theory to have new configurations which would be infeasible solely with a tension term on the interface brane.</description>

      <title>Theory of the inverse Faraday effect in dissipative Rashba electron systems: Floquet engineering perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), i.e., photo-induced magnetization, in two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled electron systems irradiated by a circularly polarized light. Quantum master (GKSL) equation enables us to accurately compute the laser driven dynamics, taking inevitable dissipation effects into account. To find the universal features of laser-driven magnetization and its dynamics, we investigate (i) the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) driven by a continuous wave (CW) and (ii) ultrafast spin dynamics driven by short laser pulses. In the NESS (i), the laser-induced magnetization and its dependence of several parameters (laser frequency, laser field strength, temperature, dissipation strength, etc.) are shown to be in good agreement with the predictions from Floquet theory for dissipative systems in the high-frequency regime. In the case (ii), we focus on ferromagnetic metal states by introducing an effective magnetic field to the Rashba model as the mean field of electron-electron interaction. We find that a precession of the magnetic moment occurs due to the pulse-driven instantaneous magnetic field and the initial phase of the precession is controlled by changing the sign of light polarization. This is well consistent with the spin dynamics observed in experiments of laser-pulse-driven IFE. We discuss how the pulse-driven dynamics are captured by the Floquet theory. Our results provides a microscopic method to compute ultrafast dynamics in many electron systems irradiated by intense light.</description>

      <title>Terminable Transitions in a Topological Fermionic Ladder</title>

Abstract: Interacting fermionic ladders are important platforms to study quantum phases of matter, such as different types of Mott insulators. In particular, the D-Mott and S-Mott states hold pre-formed fermion pairs and become paired-fermion liquids upon doping (d-wave and s-wave, respectively). We show that the D-Mott and S-Mott phases are in fact two facets of the same topological phase and that the transition between them is terminable. These results provide a quantum analog of the well-known terminable liquid-to-gas transition. However, the phenomenology we uncover is even richer, as in contrast to the former, the order of the transition can be tuned by the interactions from continuous to first-order. The findings are based on numerical results using the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) formalism for infinite systems, and the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for finite systems. This is complemented by analytical field-theoretical explanations. In particular, we present an effective theory to explain the change of transition order, which is potentially applicable to a broad range of other systems. The role of symmetries and edge states are briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: Information scrambling refers to the unitary dynamics that quickly spreads and encodes localized quantum information over an entire many-body system and makes the information accessible from any small subsystem. While information scrambling is the key to understanding complex quantum many-body dynamics and is well-understood in random unitary models, it has been hardly explored in Hamiltonian systems. In this Letter, we investigate the information recovery in various time-independent Hamiltonian systems, including chaotic spin chains and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We show that information recovery is possible in certain, but not all, chaotic models, which highlights the difference between information recovery and quantum chaos based on the energy spectrum or the out-of-time-ordered correlators. We also show that information recovery probes transitions caused by the change of information-theoretic features of the dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using large-scale density-matrix renormalzation group calculations and minimally augmented spin-wave theory, we demonstrate that the phase diagram of the quantum $S\!=\!\frac12$ $J_1$--$J_3$ ferro-antiferromagnetic model on the honeycomb lattice differs dramatically from the classical one. It hosts the double-zigzag and Ising-z phases as unexpected intermediaries between ferromagnetic and zigzag states that are also extended beyond their classical regions of stability. In broad agreement with quantum order-by-disorder arguments, these collinear phases replace the classical spiral state.</description>

      <title>Phase evolution of Ce-based heavy-fermion superconductors under compression: a combined first-principle and effective-model study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many Ce-based superconductors, superconducting (SC) phases emerge or can be tuned in proximity to the antiferromagnetic (AF) quantum critical point (QCP), but so far the explicit phase evolution near the QCP lack theoretical understanding. Here, by combing the density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) with effective-model calculations, we provide a theoretical description for Ce-based superconductors under compression. DFT+DMFT calculations for the normal states reveal that the Kondo hybridizations are significantly enhanced under compression, while the initially localized $f$ electrons become fully itinerant via localized-itinerant crossover. We then construct an effective model and show that with the extracted Kondo coupling and RKKY exchange strengths from first-principle calculations, the ground-state phases of these materials can be properly predicted. We also show that the coexistence of magnetic correlation and Kondo hybridization can drive AF+SC coexisting state in narrow compression region. Under compression, competition between Kondo and RKKY interactions can drive successive transitions, from AF phase to AF+SC coexisting phase, then to paramagnetic SC phase via an AF transition which generates the QCP, and finally to normal Kondo paramagnetic (KP) phase through an SC-KP transition induced by the localized-itinerant crossover. Our study gives proper explanation to the pressure-induced QCP and SC-KP transition, and to the phase evolution in pressured Ce-based superconductors, and can help to understand the SC states around the ferromagnetic quantum transition points in uranium-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Effective model and electron correlations in trilayer nickelate superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, signatures of superconductivity with critical temperature from 20 to 30 K have been reported in pressured trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ through a pressure-induced structure transition. Here we explore the evolution of electronic structures and electronic correlations in different phases of La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under corresponding pressure regions, by using density functional theory (DFT) combined with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Similar to bilayer superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, the electronic bands in superconducting La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ are dominated by Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ and 3$d_{z^2}$ orbits near the Fermi level, in contrast, the inner Ni-O plane in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ generates a doublet hole-pocket Fermi surfaces around the Brillouin-zone corner, meanwhile one branch of the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ bands is pushed very close above the Fermi level, which can induce an electron pocket through small electron doping. The DFT+DMFT simulations suggest that the electronic correlations only give minor modification to the Fermi surfaces, meanwhile the Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ and 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ states on outer Ni-O layers have considerable greater mass enhancements than on the inner layer. The sensitiveness of electronic structure under doping and unique layer dependence of correlation suggest a distinct superconducting mechanism with respect to bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$. Based on the DFT and DFT+DMFT simulations, we eventually derive a trilayer effective tight-binding model, which can produce rather precise electronic bands and Fermi surfaces, hence can serve as an appropriate model to further study the superconducting mechanism and paring symmetry in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasiparticle excitations in material solids often experience a fictitious gauge field, which can be a potential source of intriguing transport phenomena. Here, we show that low-energy excitations in insulating antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals on the triangular lattice are effectively described by magnons with an SU(3) gauge field. The three-sublattice structure in the antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals is inherited as three internal degrees of freedom for the magnons, which are coupled with their kinetic motion via the SU(3) gauge field that arises from the topologically nontrivial spin texture in real space. We also demonstrate that the non-commutativity of the SU(3) gauge field breaks an effective time-reversal symmetry and contributes to a magnon thermal Hall effect.</description>

Abstract: A strange metal is an exotic state of correlated quantum matter; intensive efforts are ongoing to decipher its nature. Here we explore whether the quantum Fisher information (QFI), a concept from quantum metrology, can provide new insight. We use inelastic neutron scattering and quantum Monte Carlo simulations to study a Kondo destruction quantum critical point, where strange metallicity is associated with fluctuations beyond a Landau order parameter. We find that the QFI probed away from magnetic Bragg peaks, where the effect of magnetic ordering is minimized, increases strongly and without a characteristic scale as the strange metal forms with decreasing temperature, evidencing its unusual entanglement properties. Our work opens a new direction for studies across strange metal platforms.</description>

      <title>Generalized Kramers-Wanier Duality from Bilinear Phase Map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Bilinear Phase Map (BPM), a concept that extends the Kramers-Wannier (KW) transformation to investigate unconventional gapped phases, their dualities, and phase transitions. Defined by a matrix of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ elements, the BPM not only encapsulates the essence of KW duality but also enables exploration of a broader spectrum of generalized quantum phases and dualities. By analyzing the BPM's linear algebraic properties, we elucidate the loss of unitarity in duality transformations and derive general non-invertible fusion rules. Applying this framework to (1+1)D systems yields the discovery of new dualities, shedding light on the interplay between various Symmetry Protected Topological (SPT) and Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB) phases. Additionally, we construct a duality web that interconnects these phases and their transitions, offering valuable insights into relations between different quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Finite-time Scaling beyond the Kibble-Zurek Prerequisite: Driven Critical Dynamics in Strongly Interacting Dirac Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In conventional quantum critical point (QCP) characterized by order parameter fluctuations, the celebrated Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) and finite-time scaling (FTS) theory provide universal descriptions of the driven critical dynamics. However, in strongly correlated fermionic systems where gapless fermions are usually present in vicinity of QCP, the driven dynamics has rarely been explored. In this Letter, we investigate the driven critical dynamics in two-dimensional Dirac systems, which harbor semimetal and Mott insulator phases separated by the QCP triggered by the interplay between fluctuations of gapless Dirac fermions and order-parameter bosons. By studying the evolution of physical quantities for different driving rates through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we confirm that the driven dynamics is described by the FTS form. Accordingly, our results significantly generalize the KZM theory by relaxing its requirement for a gapped initial state to the system accommodating gapless Dirac fermionic excitation. Through successfully extending the KZM and FTS theory to Dirac QCP, our work not only brings new fundamental perspective into the nonequilibrium critical dynamics, but also provides a novel theoretical approach to fathom quantum critical properties in fermionic systems.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the Hubbard model is crucial for investigating various quantum many-body states and its fermionic and bosonic versions have been largely realized separately. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides heterobilayers have emerged as a promising platform for simulating the rich physics of the Hubbard model. In this work, we explore the interplay between fermionic and bosonic populations, using a $\rm{WS}_2$/$\rm{WSe}_2$ heterobilayer device that hosts this hybrid particle density. We independently tune the fermionic and bosonic populations by electronic doping and optical injection of electron-hole pairs, respectively. This enables us to form strongly interacting excitons that are manifested in a large energy gap in the photoluminescence spectrum. The incompressibility of excitons is further corroborated by measuring exciton diffusion, which remains constant upon increasing pumping intensity, as opposed to the expected behavior of a weakly interacting gas of bosons, suggesting the formation of a bosonic Mott insulator. We explain our observations using a two-band model including phase space filling. Our system provides a controllable approach to the exploration of quantum many-body effects in the generalized Bose-Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Distinct quasiparticle interference patterns for surface impurity scattering on various Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the response of the Fermi arc in the context of quasi-particle interference (QPI) with regard to a localized surface impurity on various three-dimensional Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Our study also reveals the variation of the local density of states (LDOS), obtained by Fourier transforming the QPI profile, on the two-dimensional surface. We use the $T$-matrix formalism to numerically (analytically and numerically) capture the details of the momentum space scattering in QPI (real space decay in LDOS), considering relevant tight-binding lattice and/or low-energy continuum models modeling a range of different WSMs. In particular, we consider multi-WSM (mWSM), hosting multiple Fermi arcs between two opposite chirality Weyl nodes (WNs), where we find a universal $1/r$-decay ($r$ measuring the radial distance from the impurity core) of the impurity-induced LDOS, irrespective of the topological charge. Interestingly, the inter-Fermi arc scattering is only present for triple WSMs, where we find an additional $1/r^3$-decay as compared to double and single WSMs. The untilted single (double) [triple] WSM shows a straight-line (leaf-like) [oval-shaped] QPI profile. The above QPI profiles are canted for hybrid WSMs where type-I and type-II Weyl nodes coexist, however, hybrid single WSM demonstrates strong non-uniformity, unlike the hybrid double and triple WSMs. We also show that the chirality and the positions of the Weyl nodes imprint marked signatures in the QPI profile. This allows us to distinguish between different WSMs, including the time-reversal-broken WSMs from the time-reversal-invariant WSM, even though both of the WSMs can host two pairs of Weyl nodes. Our study can thus shed light on experimentally obtainable complex QPI profiles and help differentiate different WSMs and their surface band structures.</description>

Abstract: Synthetic gauge fields have provided physicists with a unique tool to explore a wide range of fundamentally important phenomena. However, most experiments have been focusing on synthetic vector gauge fields. The very rich physics brought by coupling tensor gauge fields to fracton phase of matter remain unexplored in laboratories. Here, we propose schemes to realize synthetic tensor gauge fields that address dipoles instead of single-particles. A lattice tilted by a strong linear potential and a weak quadratic potential yields a rank-2 electric field for a lineon formed by a particle-hole pair. Such a rank-2 electric field leads to a new type of Bloch oscillations, which modulate the quadrupole moment and preserve the dipole moment of the system. In higher dimensions, the interplay between interactions and vector gauge potentials imprints a phase to the ring-exchange interaction and thus generates synthetic tensor gauge fields for planons. Such tensor gauge fields make it possible to realize a dipolar Harper-Hofstadter model in laboratories. The resultant dipolar Chern insulators feature chiral edge currents of dipoles in the absence of net charge currents.</description>

Abstract: Quantum information scrambling is the dynamical process where initially localized quantum information spreads over diverse degrees of freedom. Out-of-time-order correlators and tripartite mutual information have been utilized as key metrics to investigate scrambling, with a specific emphasis on the asymptotic behaviors in the long-time regime and the initial spreads in the early-time regime. An open question is the comprehensive clarification of the dynamics of information propagation, covering the intermediate-time regime. Here, by extending the idea of quantum reservoir computing, we propose quantum reservoir probing (QRP) to diagnose scrambling in a unified manner for arbitrary degrees of freedom at arbitrary times, through information estimation performance. As a paradigmatic example, we investigate a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain. We show that the QRP successfully distinguishes between quasiparticle-mediated information propagation in a free fermion system and correlation-mediated scrambling in a quantum chaotic system, all while showcasing its experimental simplicity. Furthermore, by systematically scanning the read-out operators, we can identify the system-specific information propagation channels, a distinct advantage over the conventional methods.</description>

      <title>On the Renormalisation group, protein folding, and naturalness</title>

Abstract: I am showing how the ideas behind the renormalisation group can be generalised in order to produce the desired reduction in the degrees of freedom other that the ones considered up to now. Instead of looking only at the renormalisation group flow, inspiration from optimisation tools for regulators of truncated theories is used to show that there exists another mathematical structure in the morphisms between various renormalisation groups, characterised by their operations, encoded by means of various regularisation functions. This expands the idea of renormalisation group to a renormalisation category. A group structure exists at the level of those morphisms, leading to new information emerging in the flowing process. Impact on problems like the naturalness and protein folding is being presented briefly.</description>

      <title>Locality bounds for quantum dynamics at low energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02856</link>

Abstract: We discuss the generic slowing down of quantum dynamics in low energy density states of spatially local Hamiltonians. Beginning with quantum walks of a single particle, we prove that for certain classes of Hamiltonians (deformations of lattice-regularized $H\propto p^{2k}$), the ``butterfly velocity" of particle motion at low energies has an upper bound that must scale as $E^{(2k-1)/2k}$, as expected from dimensional analysis. We generalize these results to obtain bounds on the typical velocities of particles in many-body systems with repulsive interactions, where for certain families of Hubbard-like models we obtain similar scaling.</description>

      <title>Temporal relaxation of disordered many-body quantum systems under driving and dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong disorder inhibits thermalization in isolated quantum systems and may lead to many-body localization (MBL). In realistic situations, however, the observation of MBL is hindered by residual couplings of the system to an environment, which acts as a bath and pushes the system to thermal equilibrium. This paper is concerned with the transient dynamics prior to thermalization and studies how the relaxation of a disordered system is altered under the influence of external driving and dissipation. We consider a scenario where a disordered quantum spin chain is placed into a strong magnetic field that polarizes the system. By suddenly removing the external field, a nonequilibrium situation is induced and the decay of magnetization probes the degree of localization. We show that by driving the system with light, one can distinguish between different dynamical regimes as the spins are more or less susceptible to the drive depending on the strength of the disorder. We provide evidence that some of these signatures remain observable at intermediate time scales even when the spin chain is subject to noise due to coupling to an environment. From a numerical point of view, we demonstrate that the open-system dynamics starting from a class of experimentally relevant mixed initial states can be efficiently simulated by combining dynamical quantum typicality with stochastic unraveling of Lindblad master equations.</description>
