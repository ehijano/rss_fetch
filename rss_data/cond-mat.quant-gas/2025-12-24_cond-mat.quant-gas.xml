      <title>Opening a gap in the collective excitation modes of a driven-dissipative condensate in the presence of an external coherent drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a minimal theoretical model to describe the opening of a gap in the dispersion of the collective excitations of a driven-dissipative condensate when the condensate phase is fixed by an additional coherent phase-locking drive. We map out the phase diagram as a function of the frequency and the strength of the coherent drive. We identify regions where the gap is purely imaginary or has a finite real part. When the coherent drive is unable to lock the condensate phase, a gapless Goldstone mode is recovered in the Floquet-Bogoliubov dispersion of collective modes. We finally characterize regions of finite-wavevector dynamical instability, where the condensate tends to develop a supersolid-like spatial modulation. While our theoretical framework is directly related to recent experiments with exciton-polariton condensates, it can be applied to describe the effect of external injection also in a variety of spatially extended optical parametric oscillators or laser devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum information scrambling in strongly disordered Rydberg spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the fact that power-law interactions occur in a plethora of physical systems, their many-body dynamics is far less understood than that of nearest-neighbor interacting systems. Here, we study information scrambling in strongly disordered spin systems with power-law interactions via out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs). Numerically, we find pronounced differences in the dynamical spreading of OTOCs between nearest-neighbor and power-law interacting systems. This deviation persists even for short-range interactions, opposing the common view that these interactions produce dynamics equivalent to the nearest-neighbor case. In a detailed experimental proposal, tailored but not limited to Rydberg tweezer setups, we present a protocol to extract OTOCs in XXZ Heisenberg spin systems with tunable anisotropy and programmable disorder based on currently available techniques.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced broadening of quantum momentum distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of a non-interacting two-dimensional quantum gas in a weak random potential with long-range correlations. Any peaked initial momentum distribution will eventually become isotropic and broaden due to scattering events with the random potential. We derive an expression for the long-time average of the momentum distribution and test it against computer simulations. We also discuss momentum isotropization and spatial diffusion.</description>

      <title>Profusion of Symmetry-Protected Qubits from Stable Ergodicity Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how combining a discrete symmetry with topological Hilbert space fragmentation can give rise to exponentially many topologically stable qubits protected by a single discrete symmetry. We illustrate this explicitly with the example of the $\mathsf{CZ}_p$ model, where the encoded qubits are stable to arbitrary symmetry-respecting perturbations for parametrically long times, substantially enhancing the robustness of a recently proposed construction based on nontopological fragmentation. In this model, the encoded qubits naturally come in pairs for which a universal set of transversal logical gates can be performed, ruling out (by the Eastin-Knill theorem) the possibility of using them for quantum error correction. We also comment on the combination of symmetry enrichment and topological fragmentation more generally, and the implications for use of systems exhibiting Hilbert space fragmentation as quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of distinct Discrete Time-Crystalline orders in the Floquet Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the distinct discrete time crystals (DTCs) that emerge in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, subjected to spatially nonuniform periodic driving. Intriguingly, we demonstrate that by appropriately tailoring the drive protocol, distinct DTC orders can be realized in different spatial regions of the system. Consequently, the system exhibits spatially varying sub-harmonic responses with distinct frequencies. We employ a semi-classical analysis to establish the stability of these co-existing DTC orders in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we establish the stability of the stability of these co-existing DTCs in the presence of quantum fluctuations. Our results establish spatially structured driving as a powerful route to engineer novel forms of time-crystalline order.</description>

      <title>Tunably realizing flat-bands and exceptional points in kinetically frustrated systems: An example on the non-Hermitian Creutz ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a non-Hermitian extension of the Creutz ladder with generic non-reciprocal hopping. By mapping the ladder onto two decoupled non-Hermitian Su--Schrieffer--Heeger (SSH) chains, we uncover a rich structure in parameter space under different boundary conditions. Under periodic boundary conditions, the spectrum admits a fine-tuned line in parameter space with entirely real eigenvalues, while deviations from this line induce a real--complex spectral transition without crossing exceptional points. In contrast, an exact analytical diagonalization under open boundary conditions reveals extended regions in parameter space with purely real or purely imaginary spectra, separated from complex spectral domains by exceptional lines. The intersections of these exceptional lines define triple-junction points where distinct spectral regimes meet, giving rise to a structured phase diagram that is absent under periodic boundary conditions. We further show that flat bands in this system can occur both as Hermitian diabolical points and as non-Hermitian exceptional points, known as exceptional flat bands, where the dynamics is more stringent than in the Hermitian case, leading to distinct spectral and dynamical signatures.</description>

      <title>Path-Integral Formulation of Bosonic Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics with Monte Carlo stochastic trajectories using the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q Functions and Hybrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Monte Carlo (MC) trajectory sampling of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) based on the quasiprobabilities, such as the Glauber-Sudarshan P, Wigner, and Husimi Q functions, enables us to investigate bosonic open quantum many-body dynamics described by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) equation. In this method, the MC samplings for the initial distribution and stochastic noises incorporate quantum fluctuations, and thus, we can go beyond the mean-field approximation. However, description using SDEs is possible only when the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation has a positive-semidefinite diffusion matrix. In this work, we analytically derive the SDEs for arbitrary Hamiltonian and jump operators based on the path-integral formula, independently of the derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). In the course of the derivation, we formulate the path-integral representation of the GKSL equation by using the $s$-ordered quasiprobability, which systematically describes the aforementioned quasiprobabilities by changing the real parameter $s$. The essential point of this derivation is that we employ the Hubbard-Stratonovich (HS) transformation in the path integral, and its application is not always feasible. We find that the feasible condition of the HS transformation is identical to the positive-semidefiniteness condition of the diffusion matrix in the FPE. In the benchmark calculations, we confirm that the MC simulations of the obtained SDEs well reproduce the exact dynamics of physical quantities and non-equal time correlation functions of numerically solvable models, including the Bose-Hubbard model. This work clarifies the applicability of the approximation and gives systematic and simplified procedures to obtain the SDEs to be numerically solved.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model using time-dependent disorder in optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model is a paradigm for extreme quantum chaos, non-Fermi-liquid behavior, and holographic matter. Yet, the dense random all-to-all interactions that characterize it are an extreme challenge for realistic laboratory realizations. Here, we propose a general scheme for densifying the coupling distribution of random disorder Hamiltonians, using a Trotterized cycling through sparse time-dependent disorder realizations. To diagnose the convergence of sparse to dense models, we introduce an information-theory inspired diagnostic. We illustrate how the scheme can come to bear in the realization of the complex SYK$_4$ model in cQED platforms with available experimental resources, using a single cavity mode together with a fast cycling through independent speckle patterns. The simulation scheme applies to the SYK class of models as well as spin glasses, spin liquids, and related disorder models, bringing them into reach of quantum simulation using single-mode cavity-QED setups and other platforms.</description>

      <title>Exciton-polariton condensate in the van der Waals magnet CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals magnets are an emergent material class of paramount interest for fundamental studies in coupling light with matter excitations, which are uniquely linked to their underlying magnetic properties. Among these materials, the semiconducting magnet CrSBr is possibly a first playground where we can study simultaneously the interaction of photons, magnons, and excitons at the quantum level. Here we demonstrate a coherent macroscopic quantum phase, the bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons, emerging in a CrSBr flake embedded in a fully tunable cryogenic open optical cavity. The Bose condensate is characterized by a highly non-linear threshold-like behavior, and coherence manifests distinctly via its first and second order quantum correlations. We find that the condensate's non-linearity is highly susceptible to the magnetic order in CrSBr. Specially, it can encounter a sign change from attractive to repulsive interactions when the intrinsic antiferromagnetic order transforms to the forced ferromagnetic order. Our findings open a route towards magnetically controllable quantum fluids of light, and optomagnonic devices where spin magnetism is coupled to on-chip Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>
