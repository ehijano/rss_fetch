      <title>The thermodynamics of liquid-vapor coexistence for a van der Waals fluid. Analytical solution of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a pedagogical derivation of the thermodynamics of a van der Waals fluid by explicitly incorporating pairwise molecular interactions and the finite size of particles into the statistical-mechanical description. Starting from the Lennard-Jones potential, we evaluate the second virial coefficient to infer the virial expansion of the equation of state and recover the van der Waals equation using only its leading correction. The corresponding partition function allows us to obtain all thermodynamic potentials for both monoatomic and diatomic fluids in a transparent and instructive manner.
  Building on this framework, we formulate and solve analytically the Clausius-Clapeyron equation in the vicinity of the critical point, obtaining the liquid-vapor coexistence curve in closed form. This approach not only clarifies the microscopic origin of van der Waals thermodynamics but also complements-and in several aspects improves upon-traditional treatments that rely heavily on numerical methods or heuristic arguments.
  In addition, because the van der Waals equation naturally predicts the liquid-vapor equilibrium, the existence of critical points, and the functional form of the saturation curve of the pressure as a function of temperature, it provides an analytically tractable framework for studying a 150-year-old problem that has historically been addressed using graphical constructions or numerical solutions. As such, the formulation developed here offers a coherent, accessible, and conceptually unified route for students and instructors to understand phase coexistence in simple fluids from first principles.</description>

      <title>Unifying Kibble-Zurek Mechanism in Weakly Driven Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A description of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism with linear response theory has been done previously, but ad hoc hypotheses were used, like the use of the rate-dependent impulse window via the Zurek equation in the context of no driving in the relaxation time. In this work, I present a new framework where such hypotheses are unnecessary, preserving all the characteristics of the phenomenon. The Kibble-Zurek scaling obtained for the excess work is close to 2/5, a result that holds for open and thermally isolated systems whose relaxation time diverges at the critical point and the first zero of the relaxation function is finite. I exemplify the results using four different but significant types of scaling functions.</description>

      <title>Energy-Time-Accuracy Tradeoffs in Thermodynamic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paradigm of thermodynamic computing, instead of behaving deterministically, hardware undergoes a stochastic process in order to sample from a distribution of interest. While it has been hypothesized that thermodynamic computers may achieve better energy efficiency and performance, a theoretical characterization of the resource cost of thermodynamic computations is still lacking. Here, we analyze the fundamental trade-offs between computational accuracy, energy dissipation, and time in thermodynamic computing. Using geometric bounds on entropy production, we derive general limits on the energy-delay-deficiency product (EDDP), a stochastic generalization of the traditional energy-delay product (EDP). While these limits can in principle be saturated, the corresponding optimal driving protocols require full knowledge of the final equilibrium distribution, i.e., the solution itself. To overcome this limitation, we develop quasi-optimal control schemes that require no prior information of the solution and demonstrate their performance for matrix inversion in overdamped quadratic systems. The derived bounds extend beyond this setting to more general potentials, being directly relevant to recent proposals based on non-equilibrium Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states in the SU($N$) Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct asymptotic quantum many-body scars (AQMBS) in one-dimensional SU($N$) Hubbard chains ($N\geq 3$) by embedding the scar subspace into an auxiliary Hilbert subspace $\mathcal{H}_P$ and identifying a parent Hamiltonian within it, together with a corresponding extension of the restricted spectrum-generating algebra to the multi-ladder case. Unlike previous applications of the parent-Hamiltonian scheme, we show that the parent Hamiltonian becomes the SU($N$) ferromagnetic Heisenberg model rather than the spin-1/2 case, so that its gapless magnons realize explicit AQMBS of the original model. Working in the doublon-holon subspace, we derive this mapping, obtain the one-magnon dispersion for periodic and open boundaries, and prove (i) orthogonality to the tower of scar states, (ii) vanishing energy variance in the thermodynamic limit, and (iii) subvolume entanglement entropy with rigorous MPS/MPO bounds. Our results broaden the parent-Hamiltonian family for AQMBS beyond spin-1/2 and provide analytic, low-entanglement excitations in SU($N$)-symmetric systems.</description>

      <title>Short-time statistics of extinction and blowup in reaction kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistics of extinction and blowup times in well-mixed systems of stochastically reacting particles. We focus on the short-time tail, $T \to 0$, of the extinction- or blowup-time distribution $\mathcal{P}_m(T)$, where $m$ is the number of particles at $t=0$. This tail often exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and we show that the singularity is captured by a time-dependent WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation applied directly to the master equation. This approximation, however, leaves undetermined a large pre-exponential factor. Here we show how to calculate this factor by applying a leading- and a subleading-order WKB approximation to the Laplace-transformed backward master equation. Accurate asymptotic results can be obtained when this WKB solution can be matched to another approximate solution (the ``inner" solution), valid for not too large $m$. We demonstrate and verify this method on three examples of reactions which are also solvable without approximations.</description>

      <title>Microscopic and hydrodynamic correlation in 1d hard rod gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute mass density correlations of a one-dimensional gas of hard rods at both microscopic and macroscopic scales. We provide exact analytical calculations of the microscopic correlation. For the correlation at macroscopic scale,, we utilize Ballistic Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (BMFT) to derive an explicit expression for the correlations of a coarse-grained mass density, which reveals the emergence of long-range correlations on the Euler space-time scale. By performing a systematic coarse-graining of our exact microscopic results, we establish a micro-macro correspondence and demonstrate that the resulting macroscopic correlations agree precisely with the predictions of BMFT. This analytical verification provides a concrete validation of the underlying assumptions of hydrodynamic theory in the context of hard rod gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full counting statistics (FCS) is a dynamical generalisation of the free energy, encapsulating detailed information about the distribution and large-scale correlation functions of conserved charges and their associated currents. In this work, we present a comprehensive numerical study of the FCS and the cumulants of the three lowest charges across the full parameter space of the sine--Gordon field theory. To this end, we extend the thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz (TBA) formulation of the FCS to the sine--Gordon model, emphasise the methodological subtleties for a reliable numerical implementation, and compare numerical results with analytical predictions in certain limits.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-response relation for a nonequilibrium system with resolved Markovian embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuation-response relations must be modified to describe nonequilibrium systems with non-Markovian dynamics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that such relation is quantitatively recovered when the appropriate Markovian embedding of the dynamics is explicitly resolved. Using a colloidal particle optically trapped in a harmonic potential and driven out of equilibrium by a controlled colored noise, we study the response to a perturbation of the stiffness of the confining potential. While the reduced dynamics violates equilibrium fluctuation-response relations, we show that the dynamical response to the stiffness perturbation is fully determined by steady-state correlations involving the exact conjugate observable in the Markovian embedding.</description>

      <title>How many-body chaos emerges in the presence of quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body chaos is a default property of many-body systems; at the same time, near-integrable behaviour due to weakly interacting quasiparticles is ubiquitous throughout condensed matter at low temperature. There must therefore be a, possibly generic, crossover between these very different regimes. Here, we develop a theory encapsulating the notion of a cascade of lightcones seeded by sequences of scattering of weakly interacting harmonic modes as witnessed by a suitably defined chaos diagnostic (classical decorrelator) that measures the spatiotemporal profile of many-body chaos. Our numerics deals with the concrete case of a classical Heisenberg chain, for either sign of the interaction, at low temperatures where the short-time dynamics are well captured in terms of non-interacting spin waves. To model low-temperature dynamics, we use ensembles of initial states with randomly embedded point defects in an otherwise ordered background, which provides a controlled setting for studying the scattering events. The decorrelator exhibits a short-time integrable regime followed by an intermediate `scarred' regime of the cascade of lightcones in progress; these then overlap, leading to an avalanche of scattering events which finally yields the standard long-time signature of many-body chaos.</description>

      <title>Gauging Open EFTs from the top down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17089v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present explicit top-down calculations of Open EFTs for gauged degrees of freedom with a focus on the effects of gauge fixing. Starting from the in-in contour with two copies of the action, we integrate out the charged matter in various $U(1)$ gauge theories to obtain the Feynman-Vernon influence functional for the photon, or, in the case of symmetry breaking, for the photon and St\"uckelberg fields. The influence functional is defined through a quantum path integral, which -- as is always the case when quantizing gauge degrees of freedom -- contains redundancies that must be eliminated via a gauge-fixing procedure. We implement the BRST formalism in this setting. The in-in boundary conditions break the two copies of BRST symmetry down to a single diagonal copy. Nevertheless the single diagonal BRST is sufficient to ensure that the influence functional is itself gauge invariant under two copies of gauge symmetries, retarded and advanced, regardless of the choice of state or symmetry-breaking phase. We clarify how this is consistent with the decoupling limit where the global advanced symmetry is generically broken by the state. We illustrate our results with several examples: a gauge field theory analogue of the Caldeira-Leggett model, spinor QED with fermions integrated out, scalar QED in a thermal state, the Abelian Higgs-Kibble model in the spontaneously broken state with the Higgs integrated out, and Abelian Higgs-Kibble model coupled to a charged bath in a symmetry-broken phase. The latter serves as an example of an open system for St\"uckelberg/Goldstone fields.</description>

      <title>Finding Graph Isomorphisms in Heated Spaces in Almost No Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining whether two graphs are structurally identical is a fundamental problem with applications spanning mathematics, computer science, chemistry, and network science. Despite decades of study, graph isomorphism remains a challenging algorithmic task, particularly for highly symmetric structures. Here we introduce a new algorithmic approach based on ideas from spectral graph theory and geometry that constructs candidate correspondences between vertices using their curvatures. Any correspondence produced by the algorithm is explicitly verified, ensuring that non-isomorphic graphs are never incorrectly identified as isomorphic. Although the method does not yet guarantee success on all isomorphic inputs, we find that it correctly resolves every instance tested in deterministic polynomial time, including a broad collection of graphs known to be difficult for classical spectral techniques. These results demonstrate that enriched spectral methods can be far more powerful than previously understood, and suggest a promising direction for the practical resolution of the complexity of the graph isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Dynamics of False Vacuum Decay in the $2+1$D Quantum Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False vacuum decay, which is understood to happen through bubble nucleation, is a prominent phenomenon relevant to elementary particle physics and early-universe cosmology. Understanding its microscopic dynamics in higher spatial dimensions is currently a major challenge and research thrust. Recent advances in numerical techniques allow for the extraction of related signatures in tractable systems in two spatial dimensions over intermediate timescales. Here, we focus on the $2+1$D quantum Ising model, where a longitudinal field is used to energetically separate the two $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-broken ferromagnetic ground states, turning them into a ``true'' and ``false'' vacuum. Using tree tensor networks, we simulate the microscopic dynamics of a spin-down domain in a spin-up background after a homogeneous quench, with parameters chosen so that the domain corresponds to a bubble of the true vacuum in a false-vacuum background. Our study identifies how the ultimate fate of the bubble -- indefinite expansion or collapse -- depends on its geometrical features and on the microscopic parameters of the Ising Hamiltonian. We further provide a realistic quantum-simulation scheme, aimed at probing bubble dynamics on atomic Rydberg arrays.</description>

      <title>When evolution realizes large deviations of fitness: from speciation to dynamical phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the connection between evolution and large-deviation theory. To do so, we study evolutionary dynamics in which individuals experience mutations, reproduction, and selection using variants of the Moran model. We show that, in the large population size limit, the impact of reproduction and selection amounts to realizing a large-deviation dynamics for the non-interacting random walk in which individuals simply explore the genome landscape due to mutations. This mapping, which holds at all times, allows us to recast transitions in the population genome distribution as dynamical phase transitions, which can then be studied using the toolbox of large-deviation theory. Finally, we show that the mapping extends beyond the class of Moran models.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing with critical systems: impact of symmetry, imperfections, and decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled many-body states enable high-precision quantum sensing beyond the standard quantum limit. We develop interferometric sensing protocols based on quantum critical wavefunctions and compare their performance with Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) and spin-squeezed states. Building on the idea of symmetries as a metrological resource, we introduce a symmetry-based algorithm to identify optimal measurement strategies. We illustrate this algorithm both for magnetic systems with internal symmetries and Rydberg-atom arrays with spatial symmetries. We study the robustness of criticality for quantum sensing under non-unitary deformations, symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking decoherence, and qubit loss -- identifying regimes where critical systems outperform GHZ states and showing that non-unitary deformation can even enhance sensing precision. Combined with recent results on log-depth preparation of critical wavefunctions, interferometric sensing in this setting appears increasingly promising.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale flows in active baths dictate the dynamics of semi-flexible filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-flexible filaments in living systems are constantly driven by active forces that often organize into mesoscale coherent flows. Although theory and simulations predict rich filament dynamics, experimental studies of passive filaments in collective active baths remain scarce. Here we present an experimental study on passive colloidal filaments confined to the air-liquid interface beneath a free-standing, quasi-two-dimensional bacterial film featuring jet-like mesoscale flows. By varying filament contour length and bacterial activity, we demonstrate that filament dynamics are governed by its length relative to the characteristic size of the bath. Filaments shorter than the jet width exhibit greatly enhanced translation and rotation with minimal deformation, while long filaments show dramatic deformation but less enhanced transport. We explain our findings through the competition between the active viscous drag of the bath and passive elastic resistance of the filaments, using a modified elastoviscous number that considers the mesoscale flows.</description>

      <title>Virtual temperatures as a key quantifier for passive states in quantum thermodynamic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the role of virtual temperatures for passive quantum states through the lens of majorization theory. A mean temperature over the virtual temperatures of adjacent energy levels is defined to compare the passive states of the system resulting from isoenergetic and isoentropic transformations. The role of the minimum and the maximum (min-max) values of the virtual temperatures in determining the direction of heat flow between the system and the environment is argued based on majorization relations. We characterize the intermediate passive states in a quantum Otto engine using these virtual temperatures and derive an upper bound for the Otto efficiency that can be expressed in terms of the min-max virtual temperatures of the working medium. An explicit example of the coupled-spins system is worked out. Moreover, virtual temperatures serve to draw interesting parallels between the quantum thermodynamic processes and their classical counterparts. Thus, virtual temperature emerges as a key operational quantity linking passivity and majorization to the optimal performance of quantum thermal machines.</description>

      <title>Entanglement negativity for a free scalar chiral current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement negativity for the free, scalar chiral current in two spacetime dimensions, which is a simple model violating the Haag duality in regions with nontrivial topology. For the ground state of the system, both on the line and on the circle, we consider the setups given by two intervals, either adjacent or disjoint. We find analytic expressions for the moments of the partial transpose of the reduced density matrix and the logarithmic negativity. In the limit of small separation distance, this expression yields the same subleading topological contribution occurring in the mutual information. In the limit of large separation distance between the two intervals, the exponential decay of the logarithmic negativity is obtained from its analytic expression. The analytic formulas are checked against exact numerical results from a bosonic lattice model, finding a perfect agreement. We observe that, since the chiral current generates the neutral subalgebra of the full chiral Dirac fermion theory, this analysis highlights how symmetries produce nontrivial features in the entanglement structure that are analogue to those ones already observed in the mutual information for regions with nontrivial topology.</description>

      <title>Graph energy as a measure of community detectability in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in network science is the detection of communities, which are sets of nodes in a network that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to the rest of the network. A fundamental result in community detection is the existence of a nontrivial threshold for community detectability on sparse graphs that are generated by the planted partition model (PPM). Below this so-called ``detectability limit'', no community-detection method can perform better than random chance. Spectral methods for community detection fail before this detectability limit because the eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors that are relevant for community detection can be absorbed by the bulk of the spectrum. One can bypass the detectability problem by using special matrices, like the non-backtracking matrix, but this requires one to consider higher-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we show that the difference in graph energy between a PPM and an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi (ER) network has a distinct transition at the detectability threshold even for the adjacency matrices of the underlying networks. The graph energy is based on the full spectrum of an adjacency matrix, so our result suggests that standard graph matrices still allow one to separate the parameter regions with detectable and undetectable communities.</description>

      <title>Cell size control in bacteria is modulated through extrinsic noise, single-cell- and population-growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living cells maintain size homeostasis by actively compensating for size fluctuations. Here, we present two stochastic maps that unify phenomenological models by integrating fluctuating single-cell growth rates and size-dependent noise mechanisms with cell size control. One map is applicable to mother machine lineages and the other to lineage trees of exponentially-growing cell populations, which reveals that population dynamics alter size control measured in mother machine experiments. For example, an adder can become more sizer-like or more timer-like at the population level depending on the noise statistics. Our analysis of bacterial data identifies extrinsic noise as the dominant mechanism of size variability, characterized by a quadratic conditional variance-mean relationship for division size across growth conditions. This finding contradicts the reported independence of added size relative to birth size but is consistent with the adder property in terms of the independence of the mean added size. Finally, we derive a trade-off between population-growth-rate gain and division-size noise. Correlations between size control quantifiers and single-cell growth rates inferred from data indicate that bacteria prioritize a narrow division-size distribution over growth rate maximisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.13863v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an integrable lattice model of classical interacting spins in discrete space-time, representing a discrete-time analogue of the lattice Landau-Lifshitz ferromagnet with uniaxial anisotropy. As an application we use this explicit discrete symplectic integration scheme to compute the spin Drude weight and diffusion constant as functions of anisotropy and chemical potential. We demonstrate qualitatively different behavior in the easy-axis and the easy-plane regimes in the non-magnetized sector. Upon approaching the isotropic point we also find an algebraic divergence of the diffusion constant, signaling a crossover to spin superdiffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10233v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-integrated state observables, which quantify the fraction of time spent by the system in a specific pool of states, are important in many fields, such as chemical sensing or the theory of fluorescence spectroscopy. We derive exact identities, called Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs), that connect the fluctuations of such observables to their response to external perturbations in nonequilibrium steady state of Markov jump processes. Using these results, we derive a first known upper bound on fluctuations of state observables, as well as some new lower bounds. We further demonstrate how our identities provide a deeper understanding of the mechanistic origin of fluctuations and reveal their properties dependent only on system topology, which may be relevant for model inference using measured data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observing super-diffusive fluctuations from Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality in isotropic integrable spin chains is usually challenging as it requires a fairly large number of spins in interaction. We demonstrate in this paper, in the context of classical spins, that accounting for boundary effects lowers the bar, down to a few dozen spins in some cases. Additionally, boundaries control the relaxation to stationarity, which leads to many new universal scaling functions to explore, both in periodic spin chains and for open chains with magnetization imposed by reservoirs at the ends.</description>

      <title>Local Reversibility and Divergent Markov Length in 1+1-D Directed Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany-Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06677v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement manifests itself in non-local correlations between the constituents of a system. In its simplest realization, a measurement on one subsystem is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple parties, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we argue that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a physical state as it heats up, evolves in time in a large family of dynamical protocols, or as its parts become separated. We focus on the generic case where the system interacts with an environment. These results mainly follow from the geometry of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium, and a quantum spin chain. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, genuinely collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Long Wavelength Mermin-Wagner Fluctuations in Active Crystals and Glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10625v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensions (2D), the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg (MWH) fluctuation plays a significant role, giving rise to striking dimensionality effects marked by long-range density fluctuations leading to the singularities of various dynamical properties. According to the MWH theorem, a 2D equilibrium system with continuous degrees of freedom cannot achieve long-range crystalline order at non-zero temperatures. Recently, MWH fluctuations have been observed in glass-forming liquids, evidenced by the logarithmic divergence in the plateau value of mean squared displacement (MSD). Our research investigates long-wavelength fluctuations in crystalline and glassy systems influenced by non-equilibrium active noises. Active systems serve as a minimal model for understanding diverse non-equilibrium dynamics, such as those in biological systems and self-propelled colloids. We demonstrate that fluctuations from active forces can strongly couple with long-wavelength density fluctuations, altering the lower critical dimension ($d_l$) from $2$ to $3$ and leading to a novel logarithmic divergence of the MSD plateau with system size in 3D.</description>

      <title>Redundancy Channels in the Conformal Bootstrap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A method for obstructing symmetry enhancement in numerical conformal bootstrap calculations is proposed. Symmetry enhancement refers to situations where bootstrap studies initialised with a certain symmetry end up allowing theories with higher symmetry. In such cases, it is shown that redundant operators in the less symmetric theory can descend from primary scaling operators of the more symmetric one, motivating the imposition of spectral gaps that are justified in the former but not the latter. The same mechanism can also be used to differentiate between decoupled and fully coupled theories which otherwise have the same global symmetry. A systematic understanding of this mechanism is developed and applied to distinguish the cubic from the $O(3)$ model in three dimensions, where a strip of disallowed parameter space, referred to as the cubic redundancy channel, emerges once a gap associated with a redundant operator of the cubic theory is imposed. The channel corresponds precisely to the region of parameter space where the assumed cubic symmetry would be enhanced to $O(3)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gravity from Entropy (GfE) action posits that the fundamental nature of gravity is information encoded in the metric degrees of freedom. This statistical mechanics theory is associated with the GfE Lagrangian given by the Geometric Quantum Relative Entropy (GQRE) between the true metric and the metric induced by the matter fields and the curvature. The GfE action leads to the GfE modified gravity equations displaying an emergent dynamical cosmological constant. Interestingly, the GfE equations of motion reduce to the Einstein equations in the limit of low energy and small curvature. Here we embrace a thermodynamic point of view and we associate the energy density of the GfE to the emergent dynamical cosmological constant of the theory. Focusing on homogeneous and isotropic spacetimes, we reveal that the GfE universes associated with the FRW metrics are thermal. Indeed they are associated with the $k$-temperatures and the $k$-pressures which are related to their local GQRE and their local energy by the first law of GfE thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of the GfE theory is illustrated in the low energy, small curvature limit with matter content modelled as perfect fluid, where the solutions of the GfE equations of motion are well approximated by the Friedmann universes. We show that while the total GQRE per unit volume is not increasing, coherently with its relative entropy nature, the total entropy of GfE universes is not decreasing in time. These results provide a natural thermodynamic interpretation of GfE cosmologies and a framework for reconciling local complexity with the global increase in entropy of the universe.</description>

Abstract: We define a black hole state in a spin chain by studying thermal correlators in holography. Focusing on the Heisenberg model we investigate the thermal and complexity properties of the black hole state by evaluating its entanglement entropy, emptiness formation probability and Krylov complexity. The entanglement entropy grows logarithmically with effective central charge c=5.2. We find evidence for thermalization at infinite temperature.</description>

      <title>Spin-operator form factors of the critical Ising chain and their finite volume scaling limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a self-contained derivation of the spin-operator matrix elements in the fermionic basis, for the critical Ising chain at a generic system length $N\in 2Z_{\ge 2}$. The approach relies on the near-Cauchy property of certain matrices formed by the Toeplitz symbol in the critical model, and leads to simpler product formulas for the dressing functions in terms of square root functions. These square root products allow fully dis-singularized integral representations. In the finite volume scaling limit, they further reduce to the Binet's second integral for the gamma function logarithm and its Hermite's generalization. As such, all the matrix elements in the scaling limit allow simple product formulas in terms of the gamma function at integer and half-integer arguments, and are rational numbers up to $\sqrt{2}$. They are exactly the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, whose explicit forms are much less well known in comparison to the finite-volume form factors in the massive theory. We also fully determine the normalization factor of the spin-operator and show explicitly how the coefficient $G(\frac{1}{2})G(\frac{3}{2})$ appear through a ground state overlap.</description>

      <title>Simulating Non-Markovian Dynamics in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum technologies and related experiments have created a need for highly accurate, versatile, and computationally efficient simulation techniques for the dynamics of open quantum systems. Long-lived correlation effects (non-Markovianity), system-environment hybridization, and the necessity for accuracy beyond the Born-Markov approximation form particular challenges. Approaches to meet these challenges have been introduced, originating from different fields, such as hierarchical equations of motion, Lindblad-pseudomode formulas, chain-mapping approaches, quantum Brownian motion master equations, stochastic unravelings, and refined quantum master equations. This diversity, while indicative of the field's relevance, has inadvertently led to a fragmentation that hinders cohesive advances and their effective cross-community application to current problems for complex systems. How are different approaches related to each other? What are their strengths and limitations? Here we give a systematic overview and concise discussion addressing these questions. We make use of a unified framework which very conveniently allows to link different schemes and, this way, may also catalyze further progress. In line with the state of the art, this framework is formulated not in a fully reduced space of the system but in an extended state space which in a minimal fashion includes effective reservoir modes. This in turn offers a comprehensive understanding of existing methods, elucidating their physical interpretations, interconnections, and applicability.</description>
