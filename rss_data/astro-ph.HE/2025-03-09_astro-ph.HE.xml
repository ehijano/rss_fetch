      <title>The Effect of the Fast-Flavor Instability on Core-Collapse Supernova Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merging our supernova code F{\sc{ornax}} with the Box3D fast-flavor neutrino oscillation formalism, we explore the effects of fast-flavor conversion (FFC) in state-of-the-art 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova simulations. We find that after a few tens of milliseconds after bounce the FFC emerges just interior to and exterior to the stalled shock wave. It does not obtain in the PNS core nor near the average neutrinosphere radii. Interior to the shock, this results in a temporary change in the net neutrino heating rate of $\sim$10\%, due mostly to a hardening of the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ neutrino spectra, despite the decrease in their corresponding neutrino number fluxes. In 1D, the hydrodynamic effects are not large, with increases in the stalled shock radius by of order ten to twenty kilometers that abate within a few hundred milliseconds. In 2D, the hydrodynamic effect of the FFC is a bit more noticeable, resulting in slightly earlier explosions for models for lower-mass progenitors, but also potentially inhibiting explosions for some higher-mass progenitors. Fast-flavor conversion continues to operate at larger radii at later times. The net result is a shift upward in the $\nu_{\mu}$ energy and number luminosities and a shift downward in the same quantities for both the $\nu_e$ and $\bar{\nu}_e$ neutrinos. There seems to be a trend at very large radii and later times towards partial species and spectral equipartition. If this is true, it could be an interesting feature of supernova neutrino detection at later times in underground and under-ice facilities.</description>

      <title>Massive Double White Dwarf Binary Mergers from the Moon: Extending the Reach of Multi-messenger Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of lunar-based gravitational-wave detectors to broaden the multi-messenger astrophysics landscape by detecting mergers of massive ($\gtrsim 1~M_{\odot}$) double white dwarf (WD) binaries. These systems are potential progenitors of Type Ia supernovae and could serve as independent probes of cosmic expansion. We examine two proposed lunar gravitational-wave detector concepts operating in the sub-hertz band (0.1-1 Hz): the Gravitational-Wave Lunar Observatory for Cosmology (a proxy for suspended test mass detectors) and the Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna (a proxy for seismic array detectors). Using both contact and Roche lobe overflow merger scenarios, we estimate that these detectors could reach distances of up to ~1 Gpc for the most massive mergers. We show that lunar detectors could observe up to dozens of massive WD mergers annually, including those originating from globular clusters. Lunar detectors would constrain the masses of these WDs with an unprecedented accuracy of one part in a million. Furthermore, these detectors would provide early warnings of weeks before merger, including sky-localization of square arcminute resolution, enabling a new era of coordinated multi-messenger follow-up of electromagnetic transients-whether they evolve into Type Ia supernovae or accretion-induced collapse events.</description>

      <title>SN 2024iss: Double-Peaked Light Curves and Implications for a Yellow Supergiant Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the multi-band photometric observations of the Type IIb supernova (SN)
  2024iss with ultra-violet (UV), optical, and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths
  starting one day after the explosion. The UV and optical light curves show the first peak two days after the explosion date. Following a first peak,
  a secondary maximum is observed in the optical and NIR bands, similar to SNe IIb with double-peaked light curves.
  The quasi-bolometric light curve shows the fast decay until a week after the explosion.
  From the analysis of the bolometric light curve, the ejecta mass and kinetic energy are estimated to be $M_{ej}=2.8\pm0.6~M_{\odot}$ and $E_{kin}=9.4\pm4.1\times10^{50}$ erg. The
  mass of the radioactive $^{56}$Ni is estimated to be $M(^{56}Ni)=0.2~M_{\odot}$.
  Fitting a black-body function to the spectral energy distribution reveals that the photospheric temperature exhibits a rapid exponential decline during the first week after the explosion.
  An analytic model describing the cooling emission after shock breakout provides a reasonable explanation for the observed temperature evolution.
  From these ejecta parameters, we calculated the progenitor radius to be $R_{pro}=50-340$~$R_{\odot}$. We conclude that these explosion properties are consistent with a core-collapse explosion from a yellow supergiant (YSG) progenitor.</description>

      <title>Search for spatial coincidence between magnetars and IceCube detected neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a search for spatial coincidence between high energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube neutrino detector (using the publicly available 10-year muon track data) and 33 magnetars, including two extragalactic ones. We use the unbinned maximum likelihood method for our analysis. We do not find any such spatial association between any of the galactic magnetars and IceCube-detected neutrinos. Therefore, we conclude that none of the known galactic or extragalactic magnetars contribute to the diffuse neutrino flux observed in IceCube.</description>

      <title>Strong Amplitude Modulation of Hard-band X-ray QPO with Soft-band Flux in RE J1034+396</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) is a remarkable form of variability in systems of compact object accretion. RE J1034+396, harboring the most significant X-ray QPO in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), is the most noteworthy source for in-depth analysis of AGN X-ray QPO properties. A long-term evolution of its QPO has been observed over the course of the observations. However, the short-term variability of its QPO properties remains unexplored within each observation that has long good time intervals (GTIs). We collect 12 XMM-Newton observations of RE J1034+396 with GTIs longer than 60 ks from publicly available data and conduct a detailed wavelet analysis focusing on the short-time modulation of the QPO. The QPO signals are found to undergo amplitude modulation in both the soft and hard bands, with a typical timescale of 17 ks. The soft flux is significantly higher when the hard QPO is present. They are highly correlated, with an average cross-correlation function (CCF) peak coefficient of 0.61 and a lag of approximately 3 ks. This novel finding provides fresh insights into the potential connection between the components of the corona emitting soft and hard X-ray photons. The CCF lag between the soft flux and the hard QPO evolves across the observations, potentially sharing the same origin as the previously observed interconnected evolution between QPO frequency and time lag.</description>

      <title>Radio pulse search from Aql X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 12 observations of the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar Aql X-1, taken from August 2022 to October 2023 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope at 1250 MHz. These observations covered both the quiescence and X-ray outburst states, as determined by analyzing the X-ray data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer and the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image. Periodicity and single-pulse searches were conducted for each observation, but no pulsed signals were detected. The obtained upper limit flux densities are in the range of 2.86-5.73 uJy, which provide the lowest limits to date. We discuss several mechanisms that may prevent detection, suggesting that Aql X-1 may be in the radio-ejection state during quiescence, where the radio pulsed emissions are absorbed by the matter surrounding the system.</description>

      <title>A Possible Common Physic Picture Reflected by the Gamma Ray Emission of the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term observations of the Galactic center by Fermi and HESS have revealed a novel phenomenon: the high-energy gamma-ray spectrum from the Galactic center exhibits a double power-law structure. In this study, we propose a new explanation for this phenomenon. We suggest that the low-energy (GeV) power-law spectrum originates from interactions between trapped background ``sea" cosmic ray particles and the dense gaseous environment near the Galactic center. In contrast, the bubble-like structure in the high-energy (TeV) spectrum is produced by protons accelerated during active phases of the Galactic center, through the same physical process. Based on this framework, we first calculate the gamma-ray emission generated by cosmic ray protons accelerated in the Galactic center. Then, using a spatially-dependent cosmic ray propagation model, we compute the energy spectrum of background ``sea" cosmic ray protons and their associated diffuse gamma-ray emission in the Galactic center region. The results closely reproduce the observations from Fermi-LAT and HESS, suggesting that their long-term data support this picture: high-energy cosmic rays in the local region originate from nearby cosmic ray sources, while low-energy cosmic rays are a unified contribution from distant cosmic ray sources. We predict that some extended Galactic sources, which remain undetectable in the GeV energy range, may become observable in the TeV range. We hope that future observations will detect more such sources, allowing us to further test and validate our model.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of the X-ray flares in the 2023 outburst of the new black binary transient Swift J1727.8--1613 observed with Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new black hole transient Swift J1727.8--1613 exhibited a series of X-ray flares during its 2023 outburst extensively observed with Insight-HXMT. We analyze the spectra of the flaring period using a series of models consisting of a multi-color disk and several different non-thermal components, and several consistent conclusions are obtained among these models. First, Swift J1727.8--1613 was in the transition process from the hard intermediate state (HIMS) to the very high state (VHS) during the first flaring period (MJD 60197--60204), and afterwards it exhibited typical VHS parameter characteristics, such as high temperature of the disk inner radius and a steep power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2.6. Second, the flares in the VHS are characterized by a rapid increase in the flux of accretion disk, accompanied by a simultaneous rapid expansion of the inner radius, which could be apparent if the accretion disk hardening factor varies significantly. The strong power-law component during the VHS is likely produced by synchrotron self-Compton process in the relativistic jets, in agreement with the observed weak reflection component and lack of correlation with the disk component.</description>

      <title>Sidebands to mHz QPOs in 4U 1626$-$67 in the second spin-down state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results from an $AstroSat$ Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) observation of 4U 1626$-$67, performed on 2023 May 18, soon after the discovery of torque reversal to spin-down in the source. The X-ray emission exhibited significant dependence on both energy and torque state. This work highlights the comparison of timing features of 4U 1626$-$67 with a previous $AstroSat$ observation from 2018, when the neutron star was in the spin-up state. The power density spectrum (PDS) of the 2023 observation comprised a sharp peak corresponding to $\nu_{\rm NS}\sim$130 mHz X-ray pulsations along with a prominent quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) feature at $\nu_{\rm QPO}\sim$46 mHz with $\sim$20\% rms amplitude, which was positively correlated with energy. We also report the detection of sidebands to QPO occurring at a beat frequency ($\nu_{\rm NS}-\nu_{\rm QPO}$) of $\sim$83 mHz with $\sim$8\% rms amplitude, having $&gt;3\sigma$ detection significance. Additionally, we utilized $Nuclear ~Spectroscopic ~Telescope ~ARray$ ($NuSTAR$) observations from the same torque state (2023 May-July) to analogize the presence and energy dependence of sidebands. The source retains timing properties in this spin-down torque state, similar to those seen in the previous spin-down phase. In sharp contrast, PDS from the 2018 observation was dominated by red noise, an absence of QPOs and a broadening in the wings of the pulse frequency peak, indicating a coupling between periodic and low-frequency aperiodic variability. Furthermore, we detected the known cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) at 37 keV in the Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter (LAXPC) spectrum. We explore various mechanisms that could possibly explain the presence of QPOs exclusively during the spin-down state.</description>

      <title>NGC 1851A: Revealing an ongoing three-body encounter in a dense globular cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR J0514$-$4002A is a binary millisecond pulsar located in the globular cluster NGC 1851. The pulsar has a spin period of 4.99 ms, an orbital period of 18.8 days, and is in a very eccentric ($e = 0.89$) orbit around a massive companion. In this work, we present the updated timing analysis of this system, obtained with an additional 1 yr of monthly observations using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and 2.5 yrs of observations using the MeerKAT telescope. This has allowed for a precise measurement of the proper motion of the system, implying a transverse velocity of $30\,\pm\,7\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ relative to the cluster. This is smaller than the cluster's escape velocity and consistent with the pulsar's association to NGC 1851. We have confirmed a large second spin frequency derivative and large associated jerk, which has increased the spin frequency derivative by a factor of 27 since the mid-2000s. The third spin frequency derivative showed that the strength of this jerk has increased by $\sim 65\%$ in the same time period. We take the effect of the changing acceleration into account and this allows for much improved estimates of the orbital period derivative. The large and fast-increasing jerk implies the presence of a third body in the vicinity of the pulsar (no counterpart is detectable within distance limit in HST images). Based on our measured parameters, we constrain the mass, distance and orbital parameters for this third body. The induced tidal contributions to the post-Keplerian parameters are small, and the precise measurement of these parameters allowed us to obtain precise mass measurements for the system: $M_\mathrm{tot} = 2.4734(3)$ M$_{\odot}$, $M_\mathrm{p} = 1.39(3)$ M$_{\odot}$, $M_\mathrm{c} = 1.08(3)$ M$_{\odot}$. This indicates that the pulsar's companion is a massive white dwarf and resolves the earlier ambiguity regarding its nature.</description>

      <title>On the use of the Axelrod formula for thermal electron collisions in Astrophysical Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Axelrod approximation is widely used in astrophysical modelling codes to evaluate electron-impact excitation effective collision strengths for forbidden transitions. Approximate methods such as this are a necessity for many heavy elements with open shells where collisional data is either non existent or sparse as the use of more robust methods prove prohibitively expensive. Atomic data for such forbidden transitions are essential for producing full collisional radiative models that do not assume Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium (LTE). In this short work we repeat the optimization of the simple Axelrod formula for a large number of $R$-matrix data sets, ranging from Fe and Ni to the first r-process peak elements of Sr, Y and Zr, to higher Z systems Te, W, Pt and Au. We show that the approximate treatment of forbidden transitions can be a significant source of inaccuracy in such collisional radiative models. We find a large variance of the optimized coefficients for differing systems and charge states, although some general trends can be seen based on the orbital structure of the ground-state-configurations. These trends could potentially inform better estimates for future calculations for elements where $R$-matrix data is not available.</description>

      <title>Double Narrow-Line Signatures of Dark Matter Decay and New Constraints from XRISM Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the indirect detection search of the two-body decay of dark matter particles into final states containing a photon, a process predicted in various promising dark matter models such as axion-like particles and sterile neutrinos. Recent and near-future photon detectors with a resolution $
R \equiv \lambda/\Delta\lambda = O(1000) $ are primarily optimized for the velocity dispersion of dark matter in the Milky Way. When performing indirect detection of dark matter in objects other than the Milky Way, one should take into account the contribution from Milky Way dark matter. As a result, the dark matter signal observed by a detector is predicted to exhibit a two-peak structure in many targets, owing to the Doppler shift, differences in radial velocities and the good energy resolution. An analysis incorporating this two-peak effect was performed using the latest XRISM observation data of the Centaurus galaxy cluster~\cite{XRISM:2025axf}. Although, due to the relatively short observation time, our derived limit is weaker than some existing limits, among dark matter searches in galaxy clusters our limit is one of the most stringent (at least in certain mass ranges). We also perform the usual single-peak analysis, for considering the various scenarios, that prefer narrow-line photon from the faraway galaxy cluster. Future data releases from XRISM as well as other observatories will further strengthen our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Impact of Perfect Fluid Dark Matter on the Thermodynamics of $AdS$ Ay\'{o}n--Beato--Garc\'{i}a Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the black hole solution in the context of nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) coupled to a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) field. The resulting black hole solution interpolates between the $AdS$ Ay\'{o}n--Beato--Garc\'{i}a (ABG) black hole in the absence of the PFDM field and the Schwarzschild black hole devoid of magnetic monopole charges and PFDM influence. A numerical investigation of the horizon structure and thermodynamic properties, including both local and global stability, is conducted for the obtained black hole solution. The thermodynamic quantities are shown to be modified by the presence of the NLED and PFDM fields. We observe that the behaviour of thermodynamical quantities of black holes depends on these parameters significantly. We also discuss the stability and phase transition dependency on these parameters.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Induced Non-Gaussian Spectral Distortion in the Microwave Sky from Photon-Axion Conversion in Galaxy Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conversion of CMB photons to axions (or axion-like particles (ALPs)) can lead to a unique spectral distortion in the temperature and polarization sky which can be explored in upcoming CMB experiments. In this work we have developed a numerical simulation-based technique of photons to ALPs conversion in the galaxy clusters and show for the first time that this physical process can lead to large non-Gaussian signal in the temperature and polarization field, which is impacted by the presence of inhomogeneities and turbulence in the electron density and magnetic field. Our simulation-based technique can simulate the theoretical signal for different scenarios of cluster electron density and magnetic field turbulence and provides testable predictions to discover ALPs from galaxy clusters using spatially non-Gaussian and anisotropic spectral distortion of the microwave sky. We show that the presence of turbulence in the magnetic field and electron density can impact the Gaussian part of the signal captured in terms of the angular power spectra of the signal by more than an order of magnitude. Also, the presence of turbulence in different clusters will lead the temperature and polarization fluctuations around the cluster region to have varying non-Gaussian distribution, with peaks and tails different from the Gaussian statistics of the CMB anisotropy. This new numerical technique has made it possible to calculate also the non-Gaussian signals and can be used in future CMB analysis in synergy with X-ray and radio observations to unveil ALPs coupling with photons in the currently unexplored ranges, for the masses between about $10^{-14}$ eV--$10^{-11}$ eV.</description>

      <title>FR I Radio Galaxy 3C 348 Accumulation Patterns and Dust Ring Occlusion Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio galaxies can be classified into two types, FR I and FR II, depending on their morphology. So far, the reasons for the different behaviour of FR I and FR II in observations have not been clarified. While the Unified Model suggests that the viewing angle and the obscuring effect of the dust ring are the main reasons for the difference in the classification of FR I and FR II radio galaxies, it has been found that the accretion rate and the accretion pattern of the central engine may play a more crucial role. In order to investigate the physical properties of these sources, the cloudy program was used to simulate the 3C 348 radio source outlook ionisation model, and it was found that its optical emission in the nuclear region is significantly lower than the theoretical prediction, which suggests the existence of an obscuration effect, which was later further proved by the spectral decomposition method. And using the thermometric photometry-jet relationship, it is found that the accretion rate in its nuclear region is much lower than the accretion rate inverted from the total jet power, indicating that its accretion mode is in the critical stage of the transition from the standard thin disc to the ADAF. Combined with its Bondi accretion rate, the fitted energy spectrum of the nuclear region shows that the evolution of its jet power is controlled by the change of the central accretion engine.</description>

      <title>Resonant Drag Instabilities for Polydisperse Dust, I. The Acoustic Resonant Drag Instability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust grains embedded in gas flow give rise to a class of hydrodynamic instabilities that can occur whenever there exists a relative velocity between gas and dust. These instabilities have predominantly been studied for single grain sizes, for which a strong interaction can be found between drifting dust and a travelling gas wave, leading to fast-growing perturbations (growth rates $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$) even at small dust-to-gas ratios $\mu$. They are called resonant drag instabilities. We focus on the acoustic resonant drag instability, which is potentially important in AGB star outflows, around supernova remnants and star clusters in starburst galaxies. We study the acoustic resonant drag instability, taking into account a continuous spectrum of grain sizes, to determine whether it survives in the polydisperse regime and how the resulting growth rates compare to the monodisperse case. We solve the linear equations for a polydisperse fluid for the acoustic drag instability, focusing on small dust-to-gas ratios. Size distributions of realistic width turn the fast-growing perturbations $\propto \sqrt{\mu}$ of the monodisperse limit into slower growing perturbations $\propto \mu$ due to the fact that the backreaction on the gas involves an integration over the resonance. Furthermore, the large wave numbers that grow fastest in the monodisperse regime are stabilized by a size distribution, severely limiting the growth rates in the polydisperse regime. The acoustic resonant drag instability turns from a singularly perturbed problem in $\mu$ in the monodisperse limit into a regular perturbation for a sufficiently wide size distribution. It can still grow exponentially in the polydisperse regime, but at a slower pace compared to the single size case.</description>

      <title>Studying the radiation of a white dwarf star falling onto a black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11525v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate electromagnetic and gravitational radiation generated during the process of the tidal stripping of a white dwarf star circulating a black hole. We go beyond Chandrasekhar's ideas and not only consider a white dwarf itself as a quantum object, but also describe the dynamics of a produced accretion disk in a quantum way. We model the white dwarf star as a Bose-Fermi droplet and use the quantum hydrodynamic equations to simulate the evolution of the black hole-white dwarf binary system. While going through the periastron, the white dwarf loses a small fraction of its mass. The mass falling onto a black hole is a source of powerful electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. Bursts of ultraluminous radiation are flared at each periastron passage. This resembles the recurrent flaring of X-ray sources discovered recently by Irwin et al. Gravitational energy bursts occur mainly through emission at very low frequencies. The accretion disk, formed due to stripping of the white dwarf, starts at some point to contribute continuously to radiation of both electromagnetic and gravitational types.</description>

      <title>Very Local Impact on the Spectrum of Cosmic-Ray Nuclei below 100 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent measurements of primary and secondary CR spectra, their arrival directions, and our improved knowledge of the magnetic field geometry around the heliosphere allow us to set a bound on the distance beyond which a puzzling 10-TeV ``bump'' and certain related spectral features \emph{cannot} originate. The sharpness of the spectral breaks associated with the bump, the abrupt change of the CR intensity across the local magnetic equator ($90^{\circ}$ pitch angle), and the similarity between the primary and secondary CR spectral patterns point to a local reacceleration of the bump particles out of the background CRs. We argue that, owing to a steep preexisting CR spectrum, a nearby shock may generate such a bump by boosting particle rigidity by a mere factor of $\sim$1.5 in the range below 50 TV. Reaccelerated particles below $\sim$0.5 TV are convected with the interstellar medium flow and do not reach the Sun. The particles above this rigidity then form the bump. This single universal process is responsible for the observed spectral features of all CR nuclei, primary and secondary, in the rigidity range below 100 TV. We propose that one viable candidate is the system of shocks associated with $\epsilon$ Eridani star at 3.2 pc of the Sun, which is well aligned with the direction of the local magnetic field. Other shocks, such as old supernova shells, may produce a similar effect. We provide a simple formula that reproduces the spectra of all CR species with only three parameters uniquely derived from the CR proton data. We show how our formalism predicts helium, boron, carbon, oxygen, and iron spectra. Our model thus unifies all the CR spectral features observed below 50 TV.</description>

      <title>Rapid, strongly magnetized accretion in the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there exist two qualitatively distinct turbulent states of the zero-net-vertical-flux shearing box. The first, which has been studied in detail previously, is characterized by a weakly magnetized ($\beta\sim50$) midplane with slow periodic reversals of the mean azimuthal field (dynamo cycles). The second, the 'low-$\beta$ state,' which is the main subject of this paper, is characterized by a strongly magnetized $\beta\sim 1$ midplane dominated by a coherent azimuthal field with much stronger turbulence and much larger accretion stress ($\alpha \sim 1$). The low-$\beta$ state emerges in simulations initialized with sufficiently strong azimuthal magnetic fields. The mean azimuthal field in the low-$\beta$ state is quasi steady (no cycles) and is sustained by a dynamo mechanism that compensates for the continued loss of magnetic flux through the vertical boundaries; we attribute the dynamo to the combination of differential rotation and the Parker instability, although many of its details remain unclear. Vertical force balance in the low-$\beta$ state is dominated by the mean magnetic pressure except at the midplane, where thermal pressure support is always important (this holds true even when simulations are initialized at $\beta \ll 1$, provided the thermal scale height of the disk is well resolved). The efficient angular momentum transport in the low-$\beta$ state may resolve long-standing tension between predictions of magnetorotational turbulence (at high $\beta$) and observations; likewise, the bifurcation in accretion states we identify may be important for understanding the state transitions observed in dwarf novae, X-ray binaries, and changing-look AGN. We discuss directions for future work, including the implications of our results for global accretion disk models and simulations.</description>

      <title>Subphotospheric Emission from Short Gamma-Ray Bursts. II.~Signatures of Non-Thermal Dissipation in the Multi-Messenger Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) jet with initial magnetization $\sigma_0=150$, propagating through the dynamical ejecta from a binary neutron star merger, we identify regions of energy dissipation driven by magnetic reconnection and collisionless sub-shocks within different scenarios. We solve the transport equations for photons, electrons, protons, neutrinos, and intermediate particles up to the photosphere, accounting for all relevant radiative processes, including electron and proton acceleration, and investigate the potential impact of magnetic reconnection occurring in different regions along the jet. We find the photon spectra undergo non-thermal modifications below the photosphere, observable in both on-axis and off-axis emission directions, as well as across different scenarios of energy dissipation and subsequent particle acceleration. Interestingly, the spectral index of the photon energy distribution can at most vary by $\sim20\%$ across all different dissipation scenarios. Depending on the dissipation mechanism at play, neutrino signatures may accompany the photon signal, pointing to efficient proton acceleration and shedding light on jet physics. Although our findings are based on one jet simulation, they point to a potential universal origin of the non-thermal features of the Band spectrum observed in sGRBs.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Numerical Studies of the Collapse of Dense Clouds Induced by Herbig-Haro Stellar Jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of Herbig-Haro jets on initiating star formation in dense environments. When molecular clouds are nearing gravitational instability, the impact of a protostellar jet could provide the impetus needed to catalyze star formation. A high-energy-density experiment was carried out at the LULI2000 laser facility, where a supersonic jet generated by a nanosecond laser was used to compress a foam or plastic ball, mimicking the interaction of a Herbig-Haro jet with a molecular cloud. Simulations using the 3D radiation hydrodynamics code TROLL provided comprehensive data for analyzing ball compression and calculating jet characteristics. After applying scaling laws, similarities between stellar and experimental jets were explored. Diagnostic simulations-including density gradient, emission, and X-ray radiographies-showed strong agreement with experimental data. The results of the experiment, supported by simulations, demonstrate that the impact of a protostellar jet on a molecular cloud could reduce the Bonnor-Ebert mass by approximately 9%, thereby initiating collapse.</description>

Abstract: The Ultraviolet Explorer (UVEX) is expected to fly in 2030 and will have the opportunity -- and the rapid near/far ultraviolet (UV) capabilities -- to glean unprecedented insight into the bright UV emission present in kilonovae like that of AT 170817gfo, the electromagnetic counterpart to binary neutron star merger GW170817. To do so, it will need to perform prompt target-of-opportunity observations following detection of binary neutron star mergers by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational observatories. We present initial simulations to develop UVEX target-of-opportunity strategies for such events and provide the community with detailed initial estimates of the prospects for and characteristics of UVEX target-of-opportunity observations following gravitational-wave events, considering fiducial scenarios for the fifth and sixth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs. Additionally, in light of the relatively few binary neutron star mergers observed since GW170817, we consider variant target-of-opportunity strategies for UVEX to maximize scientific gain in the case of a lowered binary neutron star merger rate.</description>

      <title>Observing Rayleigh-Taylor stable and unstable accretion through a Kalman filter analysis of X-ray pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global, three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic simulations of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the disk-magnetosphere boundary of rotating, magnetized, compact stellar objects reveal that accretion occurs in three regimes: the stable regime, the chaotic unstable regime, and the ordered unstable regime. Here we track stochastic fluctuations in the pulse period $P(t)$ and aperiodic X-ray luminosity $L(t)$ time series of 24 accretion-powered pulsars in the Small Magellanic Cloud using an unscented Kalman filter to analyze Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data. We measure time-resolved histories of the magnetocentrifugal fastness parameter $\omega(t)$ and we connect $\omega(t)$ with the three Rayleigh-Taylor accretion regimes. The 24 objects separate into two distinct groups, with 10 accreting in the stable regime, and 14 accreting in the ordered unstable regime. None of the 24 objects except SXP 293 visit the chaotic unstable regime for sustained intervals, although several objects visit it sporadically. The Kalman filter output also reveals a positive temporal cross-correlation between $\omega(t)$ and the independently measured pulse amplitude $A(t)$, which agrees with simulation predictions regarding the pulse-forming behavior of magnetospheric funnel flows in the three accretion regimes.</description>

      <title>Leaking Outside the Box: Kinetic Turbulence with Cosmic-Ray Escape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study particle acceleration in strongly turbulent pair plasmas using novel 3D Particle-in-Cell simulations, featuring particle injection from an external heat bath and diffusive escape. We demonstrate the formation of steady-state, nonthermal particle distributions with maximum energies reaching the Hillas limit. The steady state is characterized by the equilibration of plasma kinetic and magnetic pressures, which imposes upper limits on the acceleration rate. With growing cold plasma magnetization $\sigma_0$, nonthermal power-law spectra become harder, and the fraction of energy channeled into escaping cosmic rays increases. At $\sigma_0 \gtrsim 1$, the escaping cosmic rays amount to more than 50% of the dissipated energy. Our method allows for kinetic studies of particle acceleration under steady-state conditions, with applications to a variety of astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Quark Stars as Hideouts For Color-spin-locked Quark Matter: Implications for Powering High-energy Electromagnetic Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15811v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possibility of compact stars as hideouts for color-spin-locked (CSL) quark matter (QM) is investigated in both MIT bag model and Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Within the framework of NJL model, the idea of absolutely stable quark matter and the existence of conventional pure quark star (QS) are not supported; in addition, there appears to be no stable hybrid configuration above $2M_\odot$ as the hideout for CSL QM. The stable configurations of massive strange quark stars could be reproduced in the MIT bag model with QCD corrections being taken into account; moreover, they could act as the hiding place for the CSL QM. An interesting scenario is proposed that the phase transition to the CSL phase could occur in the cooling process. The CSL quark matter is an electromagnetic (EM) superconductor of Type-I, and a complete Meissner effect is expected. However, the analysis for this sizable superconductor indicates that most of the magnetic field is frozen inside the quark core with a critical strength, while in some special cases a small fraction could be expelled from a thin layer near the surface in a short time. The analysis on energetics and time scale suggests that this process could act as an inducement mechanism to power typical fast radio bursts, but as a single source of energy, it is unlikely to generate other EM emissions such as gamma-ray bursts and giant flares.</description>
