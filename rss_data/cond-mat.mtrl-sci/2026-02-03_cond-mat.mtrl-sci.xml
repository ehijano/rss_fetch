      <title>Towards Agentic Intelligence for Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of artificial intelligence and materials science presents a transformative opportunity, but achieving true acceleration in discovery requires moving beyond task-isolated, fine-tuned models toward agentic systems that plan, act, and learn across the full discovery loop. This survey advances a unique pipeline-centric view that spans from corpus curation and pretraining, through domain adaptation and instruction tuning, to goal-conditioned agents interfacing with simulation and experimental platforms. Unlike prior reviews, we treat the entire process as an end-to-end system to be optimized for tangible discovery outcomes rather than proxy benchmarks. This perspective allows us to trace how upstream design choices-such as data curation and training objectives-can be aligned with downstream experimental success through effective credit assignment.
  To bridge communities and establish a shared frame of reference, we first present an integrated lens that aligns terminology, evaluation, and workflow stages across AI and materials science. We then analyze the field through two focused lenses: From the AI perspective, the survey details LLM strengths in pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and natural language processing for literature mining, materials characterization, and property prediction; from the materials science perspective, it highlights applications in materials design, process optimization, and the acceleration of computational workflows via integration with external tools (e.g., DFT, robotic labs). Finally, we contrast passive, reactive approaches with agentic design, cataloging current contributions while motivating systems that pursue long-horizon goals with autonomy, memory, and tool use. This survey charts a practical roadmap towards autonomous, safety-aware LLM agents aimed at discovering novel and useful materials.</description>

      <title>QUASAR: A Universal Autonomous System for Atomistic Simulation and a Benchmark of Its Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into materials science offers a transformative opportunity to streamline computational workflows, yet current agentic systems remain constrained by rigid tool-calling approaches and narrowly scoped agents. In this work, we introduce QUASAR, a universal autonomous system for atomistic simulation designed to facilitate production-grade scientific discovery. QUASAR autonomously orchestrates complex multi-scale workflows across diverse methods, including density functional theory, machine learning potentials, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations. The system incorporates robust mechanisms for adaptive planning, context-efficient memory management, and hybrid knowledge retrieval to navigate real-world research scenarios without human intervention. We benchmark QUASAR against a series of three-tiered tasks, progressing from routine tasks to frontier research challenges such as photocatalyst screening and novel material assessment. These results suggest that QUASAR can function as a general atomistic reasoning system rather than a task-specific automation framework. They also provide initial evidence supporting the potential deployment of agentic AI as a component of computational chemistry research workflows, while identifying areas requiring further development.</description>

      <title>Gradient-expansion of the inhomogeneous electron-gas revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we revisit the problem of the inhomogeneous electron gas under the influence of a weak external potential, which allows us to calculate the gradient corrections to the density functional within linear response, an approach known as the gradient expansion approximation. To obtain the exchange ($b_x$) and correlation ($b_{c}$) contributions to the coefficient $b_{xc}$, i.e., to the prefactor of the $q^2$ term of the proper-polarization function, we revisited all the previous calculations and expose misconceptions which led to incorrect conclusions. We used various ways to apply a necessary regularization to the singular Coulomb interaction potential. We found that the separate exchange ($b_x$) and correlation ($b_c$) contributions to the coefficient $b_{xc}$ have regularization-scheme dependent values even though the regulator is set to zero at the end of the calculation. This implies that it is impossible to define such a separation meaningfully. On the contrary, we found that when the regulator is set to zero at the end of the calculation, the combination $b_{xc}$ is regularization-scheme independent and, thus, has a unique value. We conclude that it is incorrect to separate those two terms when constructing a generalized-gradient-approximation (GGA) contribution to the density functional. This appears to be a common approach in most popular GGA functionals, where various constraints are applied to each contribution separately.</description>

      <title>A seven-facet polyhedron captures the composition-only formation-energy landscape of inorganic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates that the convex hull of formation energies for solid compounds involving elements from hydrogen to uranium admits a remarkably simple description over the 92-dimensional space of chemical compositions, despite the enormous combinatorial complexity of possible atomic structures. By training an interpretable max-affine model directly on near-hull formation energies from the Materials Project density-functional theory (DFT) database, we find that the hull can be reconstructed to DFT accuracy using a polyhedron with only seven facets. These facets define seven chemically coherent materials classes, with just seven coefficients per element sufficing to capture the dominant energetic trends across composition space. Remarkably, this compact, composition-only representation generalizes far beyond bulk formation energies. Without retraining or structural input, the same model reproduces trends in DFT-calculated defect formation energies, captures experimentally observed elemental mixing correlations in high-entropy materials, and enables the construction and optimization of Pourbaix diagrams for electrochemical stability. Together, these results show that many materials properties governed by energy differences can be expressed as simple linear combinations of a small set of interpretable, element-specific parameters. The result is a bonding-geometry-free thermodynamic framework that unifies stability, defects, mixing, and electrochemistry, and enables rapid, interpretable screening across vast chemical spaces.</description>

      <title>Defects, Corrugation and Temperature Govern Rarefied-Air Drag on Graphene Coatings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In rarefied atmospheric environments, where continuum fluid dynamics breaks down, aerodynamic drag is governed by gas-surface momentum exchange, making surface structure and chemistry key design knobs. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that coating the $\alpha$-Al2O3(0001) surface with graphene markedly reduces the tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC) of N2, shifting scattering toward more specular reflection and thereby lowering drag; we further benchmark this response against graphite. The reduction strengthens up to 900 K. While structural defects can increase TMAC via defect-induced corrugation and local atomic and electronic rearrangements, graphene retains its performance at experimentally relevant defect densities.</description>

      <title>Interatomic potentials for platinum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two new interatomic potentials for platinum (Pt) in angular-dependent potential (ADP) and modified Tersoff (MT) formats. Both potentials have been trained on a reference database of first-principles calculations without using experimental data. The properties of Pt predicted by the ADP and MT potentials agree better with DFT calculations and experimental data than the potentials available in the literature. Future applications of the MT model to mixed-bonding metal-covalent systems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Continuously tunable dipolar exciton geometry for controlling bosonic quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometry and binding energy of excitons, set by electron-hole wavefunction distributions, are fundamental factors that underpin their many-body interactions and determine optoelectronic properties of semiconductors. However, in typical solid-state systems, these quantities are fixed by material composition and structure. Here we introduce a polarizable interlayer exciton hosted in a two-dimensional tetralayer heterostructure whose dipole length, in-plane radius, and binding energy can be continuously programmed in situ over a wide range, enabling direct control over the nature of excitonic many-body phase transitions. An out-of-plane electric field redistributes layer-hybridized electron-hole wavefunctions, realizing in situ control of exciton geometry through a strong quadratic Stark response. This tunability further regulates the nature of interaction-driven Mott transition, transforming it from gradual to abrupt. Our results establish exciton geometry as a continuously tunable materials parameter, opening routes to exciton-based quantum phase-transition simulators and guiding the design of emergent optoelectronic functionalities from programmable excitonic materials.</description>

      <title>Ammonia Catalyst Evolution Under Reactor Conditions Revealed by Environmental and Multimodal Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bimetallic catalysts provide new routes toward sustainable ammonia synthesis, but the structural dynamics controlling their performance under real-world conditions remain poorly understood. Here, we combine in situ gas-cell and multimodal electron microscopy to disentangle the temperature-, pressure-, and chemistry-dependent restructuring of AuRu catalysts, revealing pathways accessible only at atmospheric pressure. As synthesized, AuRu nanocatalysts are polycrystalline face-centered-cubic alloys with Au/Ru intermixing that phase-segregate into Au- and Ru-rich domains with elevated temperature (&gt;450 {\deg}C). Increased pressure (~1 atm in 3:1, hydrogen:nitrogen) unlocks pronounced faceting and internal nanovoid formation, which systematic gas-chemistry variation identifies as hydrogen-driven. Density functional theory-based interatomic potentials show that hydrogen can amplify Au/Ru diffusion asymmetry, promoting nanovoid formation via a gas-mediated Kirkendall mechanism. Together, these results bridge the pressure gap between traditional in situ electron microscopy and benchtop ammonia reactors, enabling resolution of distinct restructuring stimuli in multicomponent systems.</description>

      <title>Upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpy in multi-component cubic halide perovskite alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical properties intermediate between constituents of alloys can be achieved as downward convex positive bowing, upward concave negative bowing, or zero bowing. Such bowing effects are essential for band gap engineering in semiconductor alloys. Upward band gap bowing effects are rather rare, hindering the exploration on half of the available physical property space of alloys. Part of the this being a rare event is related to the need to stabilize an alloy with low mixing enthalpy, so it does not phase separate. In this paper we find via density functional theory that one can satisfy the simultaneous conditions of negative mixing enthalpy and upward band gap bowing in four-component ABX3 halide perovskite alloys in the cubic perovskite structure. Such perovskite alloys have the B-site occupied by a mixture of group IVB and IIB elements that have the IVB-s and IIB-s states in the valence bands and conduction bands, respectively, leaving the delocalized s states strongly repel each other. This s-s repulsion leads to the upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpies simultaneously. Remarkably, we identify a perovskite alloy that has a band gap much larger than all its components. Analogous trends of upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpy also appear in the corresponding three-component and two-component ABX3 halide perovskite alloys. These observations of upward band gap bowing and negative mixing enthalpy will significantly accelerate the design of stable upward band gap bowing alloys in a broad range of material families.</description>

      <title>Synergistic effect of the electronic band delocalization and bond anharmonicity on the thermoelectric performance of Cs2TeX6(X=Cl, Br, I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural, mechanical, and thermoelectric properties of lead-free double halide perovskites Cs2TeX6 (X = Cl, Br, I) using first-principles calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. The HSE06 band gap is incorporated using the scissor correction method along with PBE calculated electronic band structures including spin orbit coupling to accurately predict transport properties. The band gap values are 3.27, 2.50, and 1.55 eV for Cs2TeX6 (X = Cl, Br, I), respectively. The coexistence of heavy and light bands in the Cs2TeI6 band structure helps mitigate the trade-off between the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity. Among these systems, Cs2TeI6 exhibits superior performance with a ZT of 1.97 at 800 K and an electronic concentration of 3.35 x 10^19 cm^-3. Such a high ZT at relatively low carrier concentration arises from high electrical conductivity combined with low lattice thermal conductivity. The lattice thermal conductivity of Cs2TeI6 is found to be 0.41 W m^-1 K^-1 at room temperature. This low lattice thermal conductivity is attributed to weak Te-I bonding and non-uniform out-of-phase displacement of Cs atoms. The presence of local TeX6 units together with weak bonds strongly resists heat conduction, leading to significant suppression of lattice thermal conductivity. In particular, transverse acoustic phonons and optical phonons play a key role in limiting lattice thermal conductivity. These results identify Cs2TeI6 as a promising candidate for high performance thermoelectric applications.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Machine Learning for Integrating Heterogeneous Analytical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships in complex materials requires integrating complementary measurements across multiple length scales. Here we propose an interpretable "multimodal" machine learning framework that unifies heterogeneous analytical systems for end-to-end characterization, demonstrated on carbon nanotube (CNT) films whose properties are highly sensitive to microstructural variations. Quantitative morphology descriptors are extracted from SEM images via binarization, skeletonization, and network analysis, capturing curvature, orientation, intersection density, and void geometry. These SEM-derived features are fused with Raman indicators of crystallinity/defect states, specific surface area from gas adsorption, and electrical surface resistivity. Multi-dimensional visualization using radar plots and UMAP reveals clear clustering of CNT films according to crystallinity and entanglements. Regression models trained on the multimodal feature set show that nonlinear approaches, particularly XGBoost, achieve the best predictive accuracy under leave-one-out cross-validation. Feature-importance analysis further provides physically meaningful interpretations: surface resistivity is primarily governed by junction-to-junction transport length scales, crystallinity/defect-related metrics, and network connectivity, whereas specific surface area is dominated by intersection density and void size. The proposed multimodal machine learning framework offers a general strategy for data-driven, explainable characterization of complex materials.</description>

      <title>Momentum- and frequency-resolved collective electronic excitations in solids: insights from spectroscopy and first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective electronic excitations, including plasmons, excitons, and intra- and interband transitions, play a central role in determining the dynamic screening, optical response, and energy transport properties of materials. Recent advances in momentum- and frequency-resolved spectroscopies, such as electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) and inelastic x-ray scattering (IXS), together with progress in first-principles many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations, now allow collective excitations to be mapped with considerable precision across the Brillouin zone. This topical review surveys current developments in the representation and interpretation of both experimental and theoretical dielectric-response spectra. Particular emphasis is placed on recent ways of representing spectral band structures (SBS) of the direct and inverse dielectric functions, such as analytical approaches based on multipole-Pad\'e approximants in momentum and frequency (MPA($\q$)), which provide a combined band-like description of the dispersion of the main collective excitations. We discuss how features observed in metals, semiconductors, and low dimensional systems reflect the interplay between electronic structure, screening strength, and local-field effects, and how post-processing procedures can improve the quantitative comparison between experiment and theory. Finally, we provide perspectives on open challenges and potential developments in quantitative dielectric-function analyses.</description>

      <title>A New Workflow for Materials Discovery Bridging the Gap Between Experimental Databases and Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating Machine Learning (ML) into material property prediction has become a crucial step in accelerating materials discovery. A key challenge is the severe lack of training data, as many properties are too complicated to calculate with high-throughput first principles techniques. To address this, recent research has created experimental databases from information extracted from scientific literature. However, most existing experimental databases do not provide full atomic coordinate information, which prevents them from supporting advanced ML architectures such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this work, we propose to bridge this gap through an alignment process between experimental databases and Crystallographic Information Files (CIF) from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD). Our approach enables the creation of a database that can fully leverage state-of-the-art model architectures for material property prediction. It also opens the door to utilizing transfer learning to improve prediction accuracy. To validate our approach, we align NEMAD with the ICSD and compare models trained on the resulting database to those trained on NEMAD originally. We demonstrate significant improvements in both Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Correct Classification Rate (CCR) in predicting the ordering temperatures and magnetic ground states of magnetic materials, respectively.</description>

      <title>Disproportionate influence of site disorder on the evolution of magnetic phases in anti-Heusler alloy Al$_2$MnFe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anti-Heusler alloys, being a new addition to the Heusler alloys family, exhibit atomic disorders, and almost all of them are reported as a re-entrant spin-glass system. Although such spin-glass feature is generally attributed to the inherent atomic disorder, a comprehensive and extensive investigation on the individual roles of different types of disorders in magnetic interactions remains lacking for any of the reported anti-Heusler systems. As an illustrative case, we have carried out an in-depth experimental as well as theoretical investigation of structural, magnetic, and transport properties of a polycrystalline anti-Heusler alloy, Al$_2$MnFe. While the major atomic disorder is found to be among Fe and Mn atoms, which are randomly distributed among the two octahedral sites, 4$a$ and 4$b$ (B2-type disorder), a relatively small fraction ($\sim$12\%) of Mn atoms also replace Al atoms at the tetrahedral 8$c$ site. Magnetically, the system undergoes two transitions: a paramagnetic to a ferromagnetic transition at $T_{\rm C}\sim$113~K, followed by a spin-glass phase transition below $T_{\rm f}\sim$20~K. Here, the magnetic moment is primarily confined to Mn atoms. Very interestingly, our theoretical analysis reveals that the ferromagnetic spin arrangement remains rather robust in spite of the 50\% disorder of moment-carrying Mn atoms between the two octahedral sites, but a much smaller ($\sim$12\%) cross-distribution of Mn atoms between octahedral and tetrahedral sites are sufficient to impose a reentrant spin-glass state at low temperature. Our analysis brings forth the importance of understanding the role of individual types of swap-disorder on magnetic properties in the anti-Heusler family of materials.</description>

      <title>Robust Machine Learning Framework for Reliable Discovery of High-Performance Half-Heusler Thermoelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) can facilitate efficient thermoelectric (TE) material discovery essential to address the environmental crisis. However, ML models often suffer from poor experimental generalizability despite high metrics. This study presents a robust workflow, applied to the half-Heusler (hH) structural prototype, for figure of merit (zT) prediction, to improve the generalizability of ML models. To resolve challenges in dataset handling and feature filtering, we first introduce a rigorous PCA-based splitting method that ensures training and test sets are unbiased and representative of the full chemical space. We then integrate Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with k-best feature filtering across three architectures-Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks - while employing SISSO symbolic regression for physical insight and comparison. Using SHAP and SISSO analysis, we identify A-site dopant concentration (xA'), and A-site Heat of Vaporization (HVA) as the primary drivers of zT besides Temperature (T). Finally, a high-throughput screening of approximately 6.6x10^8 potential compositions, filtered by stability constraints, yielded several novel high-zT candidates. Breaking from the traditional focus of improving test RMSE/R^2 values of the models, this work shifts the attention on establishing the test set a true proxy for model generalizability and strengthening the often neglected modules of the existing ML workflows for the data-driven design of next-generation thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>AI Meets Plasticity: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly emerging as a new paradigm of scientific discovery, namely data-driven science, across nearly all scientific disciplines. In materials science and engineering, AI has already begun to exert a transformative influence, making it both timely and necessary to examine its interaction with materials plasticity. In this study, we present a holistic survey of the convergence between AI and plasticity, highlighting state-of-the-art AI methodologies employed to discover, construct surrogate models for, and emulate the plastic behavior of materials. From a materials science perspective, we examine cause-and-effect relationships governing plastic deformation, including microstructural characterization and macroscopic responses described through plasticity constitutive models. From the perspective of AI methodology, we review a broad spectrum of applied approaches, ranging from frequentist techniques such as classical machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and physics-informed models to probabilistic frameworks that incorporate uncertainty quantification and generative AI methods. These data-driven approaches are discussed in the context of materials characterization and plasticity-related applications. The primary objective of this survey is to develop a comprehensive and well-organized taxonomy grounded in AI methodologies, with particular emphasis on distinguishing critical aspects of these techniques, including model architectures, data requirements, and predictive performance within the specific domain of materials plasticity. By doing so, this work aims to provide a clear road map for researchers and practitioners in the materials community, while offering deeper physical insight and intuition into the role of AI in advancing materials plasticity and characterization, an area of growing importance in the emerging AI-driven era.</description>

      <title>Magnetic, transport and electronic properties of Ni$_2$FeAl Heusler alloy nanoparticles: Experimental and theoretical investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of structural, magnetic and transport properties of Ni$_2$FeAl Heusler alloy nanoparticles (NPs) synthesized via template-less chemical route. The NPs exhibit high saturation magnetization of 3.02 $\mu_ {\rm B}$/f.u. at 5~K, large magnetic anisotropy of 0.238 MJ/m$^3$, and a Curie temperature of 874~K. Magnetocaloric analysis reveals a magnetic entropy change of 3.1 J.kg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 70 kOe. Low-temperature transport measurements show a weak resistivity upturn, following a $-T^{1/2}$ dependence, indicative of disorder-enhanced electron-electron interactions. First-principles calculations based on density functional theory yield a magneto-crystalline anisotropy energy of 0.987 MJ/m$^3$, consistent with experiment and demonstrate pronounced surface and finite-size effects through comparison of bulk and nanocluster geometries. The combination of high Curie temperature, sizable perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and moderate spin polarization and magnetic entropy change make the Ni$_2$FeAl as promising candidate for various applications.</description>

      <title>Towards knowledge-based workflows: a semantic approach to atomistic simulations for mechanical and thermodynamic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical and thermodynamic properties, including the influence of crystal defects, are critical for evaluating materials in engineering applications. Molecular dynamics simulations provide valuable insight into these mechanisms at the atomic scale. However, current practice often relies on fragmented scripts with inconsistent metadata and limited provenance, which hinders reproducibility, interoperability, and reuse. FAIR data principles and workflow-based approaches offer a path to address these limitations. We present reusable atomistic workflows that incorporate metadata annotation aligned with application ontologies, enabling automatic provenance capture and FAIR-compliant data outputs. The workflows cover key mechanical and thermodynamic quantities, including equation of state, elastic tensors, mechanical loading, thermal properties, defect formation energies, and nanoindentation. We demonstrate validation of structure-property relations such as the Hall-Petch effect and show that the workflows can be reused across different interatomic potentials and materials within a coherent semantic framework. The approach provides AI-ready simulation data, supports emerging agentic AI workflows, and establishes a generalizable blueprint for knowledge-based mechanical and thermodynamic simulations.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic Ferroelectricity due to Orbital Ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realization of ferromagnetic ferroelectricity, combining two ferroic orders in a single phase, is the longstanding problem of great practical importance. One of the difficulties is that ferromagnetism alone cannot break inversion symmetry $\mathcal{I}$. Therefore, such a phase cannon be obtained by purely magnetic means. Here, we show how it can be designed by making orbital degrees of freedom active. The idea can be traced back to a basic principle of interatomic exchange, which states that an alternation of occupied orbitals along a bond (i.e., antiferro orbital order) favors ferromagnetic coupling. Moreover, the antiferro orbital order breaks $\mathcal{I}$, so that the bond becomes not simply ferromagnetic but also ferroelectric. Then, we formulate main principles governing the realization of such a state in solids, namely: (i) The magnetic atoms should not be located in inversion centers, as in the honeycomb lattice; (ii) The orbitals should be flexible enough to adjust they shape and minimize the energy of exchange interactions; (iii) This flexibility can be achieved by intraatomic interactions, which are responsible for Hund's second rule and compete with the crystal field splitting; (iv) For octahedrally coordinated transition-metal compounds, the most promising candidates appear to be iodides with a $d^{2}$ configuration and relatively weak $d$-$p$ hybridization. Such a situation is realized in the van der Walls compound VI$_3$, which we expect to be ferromagnetic ferroelectric.</description>

      <title>Degenerate Soft Modes and Selective Condensation in BaAl$_2$O$_4$ via Inelastic X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BaAl$_2$O$_4$ is a ferroelectric material that exhibits structural quantum criticality through chemical composition tuning. Although theoretical calculations and several diffraction experiments have suggested the involvement of a soft mode in its ferroelectric structural phase transition, direct experimental verification is still lacking. In this study, we successfully observed two soft modes of BaAl$_2$O$_4$ using x-ray inelastic scattering, providing direct experimental evidence for their role in the structural phase transition. Furthermore, we reveal that the soft modes at the M and K points are nearly degenerate in energy, indicating a delicate balance in which either mode could potentially freeze. The K-point mode simultaneously softens toward the transition temperature ($T_{\rm C}$) in a manner nearly identical to the M-point mode. However, the phase transition condenses only at the M point, with the M-point mode stabilizing as an acoustic mode in the low-temperature structure and the K-point mode hardening as temperature decreases.</description>

      <title>Morphological Evolution of Nickel-Fullerene Thin Film Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid systems consisting of metal-fullerene composites exhibit intriguing properties but often suffer from thermal instability. With proper control, such instability can be harnessed to enable the formation of sophisticated nanostructures with nanometric precision. These self-organization phenomena are not limited to thermal stimulation alone but can also be triggered by other external stimuli. In this work, we investigate the morphological evolution of thin films composed of evaporated C60 and sputtered nickel mixtures, focusing on how external stimuli influence both their structural and electrical properties. Thin films were prepared under controlled deposition conditions, and their surface morphology was analyzed using advanced characterization techniques. Progressive changes in film morphology were observed as a function of composition and external treatment, highlighting the interplay between metallic and molecular components. In particular, it was observed that, due to the annealing treatment, the sample undergoes strong phase separation, with the formation of structures tens of microns in diameter and an increase in electrical resistance, exhibiting insulating behavior. These findings provide insights into the mechanisms governing hybrid thin film formation and suggest potential applications in electronic, optoelectronic, and energy-related devices.</description>

      <title>Facilitating electrical and laser-induced skyrmion nucleation with a dipolar-field enhanced effective DMI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate experimentally how the nucleation of skyrmions in an Ir, Co, and Pt based magnetic multilayer is affected by introducing a layer dependent sign for the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). In one stack, the bottom half of the stack is given a positive DMI and the top half a negative DMI, and as a result, the in-plane component of the dipolar field is aligned parallel to the effective field of the DMI in every layer, enhancing the effective DMI. We show that this enhanced DMI facilitates the nucleation and stability of skyrmions using both current-driven and laser-induced skyrmion nucleation. In the devices with an enhanced effective DMI, the density of nucleated skyrmions is greater by up to a factor 20 and skyrmions can be observed in stronger magnetic fields - suggesting that their stability is also improved. These results show that skyrmion nucleation depends strongly on the magnitude of the effective DMI in a magnetic multilayer and that the dipolar field within such a multilayer presents an effective route towards controlling the effective DMI, and thereby, the nucleation of chiral magnetic textures.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Parameter Estimation for Predictive Modeling of Illumination-Dependent Current-Voltage Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning enables rapid estimation of material parameters in solar cells via neural-network-based surrogate models. However, the reliability of extracted parameters depends on underlying assumptions such as the choice of one-dimensional drift-diffusion model and selection of free material parameters. To validate the inferred parameters, we perform predictive modeling of light-intensity-dependent current-voltage (JV) characteristics. Well-known physical effects, including the influence of external resistance and recombination dynamics on illumination-dependent device performance, are reflected in parameter estimation and prediction workflow. We show that correct treatment of dark shunt resistance and emphasizing shifted current (J + Jsc) during fitting enhances prediction accuracy at low to intermediate illumination level. Additionally, we analyze the information content of various input JV curve combinations, demonstrating that including at least one illuminated JV, preferably not under high illumination due to series resistance effects, is critical for reliable parameter estimation and device performance prediction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uranium dioxide has been widely used as a nuclear fuel in commercial light water reactors due to its high uranium density and chemical stability. However, its relatively low thermal conductivity is not optimal from the viewpoints of fuel integrity and safety margins, particularly during loss-of-coolant accidents. Although the development of accident-tolerant fuels with higher thermal conductivity is strongly desired, many potential uranium compounds remain unexplored due to constraints associated with handling radioactive materials. To efficiently screen promising uranium compounds with high thermal conductivity, past studies have leveraged machine-learning models to accelerate the discovery process. In this study, we experimentally examine the model's predictions by fabricating UCo and measuring its high-temperature thermophysical properties. Our results show that the thermal conductivity of UCo predicted by machine learning is in good agreement with the experimental measurements. Despite slight discrepancies, additional SHAP analysis suggests that the model's decision logic is consistent with known physical trends. Overall, this study fills a gap in reported thermophysical properties of UCo and provides experimental support for machine-learning-assisted screening of uranium compounds relevant to advanced fuel development.</description>

      <title>Fe-DCA Metal-Organic Frameworks on the Bi2Se3(0001) Topological Insulator Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of two-dimensional metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) on an inert surface of a topological insulator (TI) is a pathway to engineer quantum materials with exotic properties. MOFs featuring ferromagnetically coupled metal atoms are theoretically predicted to induce an exchange gap in the TI surface band structure, potentially leading to a quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, achieving ordered MOFs on TI surfaces remains challenging due to the limited knowledge of self-assembly on these substrates. In this paper, we demonstrate self-assembly of Fe atoms and dicyanoanthracene (DCA) molecules into 2D MOFs on the Bi2Se3(0001) surface at room temperature, investigated via a combination of low-energy electron microscopy and diffraction (LEEM/LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and ab initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). Two competing Fe-DCA phases form. The first phase corresponds to a close-packed Fe1DCA3 structure. In contrast, the second phase exhibits a larger unit cell with no match to either known or DFT-calculated systems, indicating a more complex bonding environment. These findings advance the understanding of the growth of MOFs on a strong topological insulator surface and provide insights for designing MOFs/TI interfaces with tailored electronic and magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>FluxNet: Learning Capacity-Constrained Local Transport Operators for Conservative and Bounded PDE Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive learning of time-stepping operators offers an effective approach to data-driven PDE simulation on grids. For conservation laws, however, long-horizon rollouts are often destabilized when learned updates violate global conservation and, in many applications, additional state bounds such as nonnegative mass and densities or concentrations constrained to [0,1]. Enforcing these coupled constraints via direct next-state regression remains difficult. We introduce a framework for learning conservative transport operators on regular grids, inspired by lattice Boltzmann-style discrete-velocity transport representations. Instead of predicting the next state, the model outputs local transport operators that update cells through neighborhood exchanges, guaranteeing discrete conservation by construction. For bounded quantities, we parameterize transport within a capacity-constrained feasible set, enforcing bounds structurally rather than by post-hoc clipping. We validate FluxNet on 1D convection-diffusion, 2D shallow water equations, 1D traffic flow, and 2D spinodal decomposition. Experiments on shallow-water equations and traffic flow show improved rollout stability and physical consistency over strong baselines. On phase-field spinodal decomposition, the method enables large time-steps with long-range transport, accelerating simulation while preserving microstructure evolution in both pointwise and statistical measures.</description>

      <title>Optical properties of Fermi polarons in a GaInP/MoSe2 monolayer heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering optical properties, such as luminescence purity and charge transfer, is crucial for harnessing the application potential of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). While electrostatic gating is widely applied to gain charge control in TMDC monolayers, charge transfer can also be engineered via coupling of TMDC monolayers at semiconductor III/V, organic, or van der Waals interfaces. This confers great advantages, such as ease in implementation and compatibility in device integration. Here, we shed light on the optical properties of many-particle complexes emerging at the GaInP/MoSe2 interface as a highly relevant material combination to manipulate the optical properties of TMDCs in integrated photonic devices. Our study verifies its nature as a type II hetero-interface, which bears the feasibility to display disorder-free photoluminescence. Through optical absorption measurements, we verify that the charged complexes acquire substantial oscillator strength. Furthermore, temperature-dependent photoluminescence, supported by a microscopic theory framework, evidences the suppression of the characteristic carrier recoil effect that was previously observed in the photoluminescence of trions in TMDCs. These phenomena allow us to identify the optical signatures at the TMDC-GaInP interface as Fermi polaron quasiparticle resonances, which are of high importance in researching Bose-Fermi mixtures in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Triplet Envelope Functions for increasing machine learning interatomic potential efficiency and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central to interatomic potential efficiency is the radial envelope function that enables linear scaling with computational cost by defining a local neighborhood of atoms. This has enabled MLIPs to revolutionize materials science over the past decade by providing DFT accuracy with linear scaling computational cost in molecular dynamics workflows. However, MLIPs still have a relatively high computational cost compared to empirical interatomic potentials, preventing them from transforming molecular dynamics workflows. A central issue is that MLIPs use relatively large cutoff radii, converging to 6A over the last few years. The large cutoffs prioritize accuracy of any material over efficiency in any particular region of phase space, capturing dispersion effects and low density materials at the expense of increased computational cost in higher density materials. Past work has aimed to address this with KNN graph sparsification, which, while significantly reducing cost, has the drawback of breaking energy conservation. In this work, we propose higher-order envelope functions that prune local atomic neighborhoods through physically inspired geometric functions to provide the memory and efficiency benefits of KNN graph sparsification while eliminating non-conservative energy dynamics. Through numerical experiments on solids and liquids with 5-8A cutoffs, we show that triplet envelope functions complement radial envelope functions by doubling training and inference speed, tripling memory efficiency, and increasing simulation stability while not impacting accuracy or data efficiency for the most common 6A cutoff. Moreover, experiments with 8A radial cutoffs show triplet envelope functions create a pathway to larger cutoff radii for efficiently and accurately modeling open structures with large interatomic distances, showing a promising new direction for engineering MLIP efficiency.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-restricted energy landscapes as a benchmark for machine learned interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a standard method for DFT-level accurate molecular dynamics simulation and large-scale studies of crystal energetics. Increasingly popular are universal pre-trained potentials, also called foundation models, based one, e.g. the MACE, CHGNet, M3GNet, ORB, and SevenNet architectures. While there are many benchmarks of these models using validation errors and materials discovery tasks, their fidelity in reproducing the detailed features of potential energy surfaces (PES) is not understood to the same degree. We evaluate the accuracy of these potentials by systematically probing their predicted energy landscapes. Two-dimensional slices of the potential energy surface are constructed where the atomic positions are varied along selected Wyckoff degrees of freedom within a fixed crystal symmetry. This approach enables a direct, visual comparison of the interatomic potentials and DFT-calculated surfaces which reveals potential artifacts e.g., arising from unique local environments. Our analysis highlights the strengths and limitations of different potentials in capturing local minima, saddle points, and overall PES topology, offering insights into the physical accuracy of current pre-trained IAPs and providing benchmarks for future model development.</description>

      <title>Energy-Transfer-Enhanced Emission and Quantum Sensing of VB- Defects in hBN-PbI2 Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin defects in two-dimensional materials hold significant potential for quantum information technologies and sensing applications. The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has attracted considerable attention as a quantum sensor due to its demonstrated sensitivity to temperature, magnetic fields, and pressure.1 However, its applications have thus far been limited by inherently dim photoluminescence (PL). By fabricating a van der Waals heterostructure with a sensitizing donor layer, lead iodide (PbI2), we effectively enhance the PL intensity from the VB- by 5-45x, while maintaining compatibility with other heterostructures and vdW optoelectronic platforms. The type-I band alignment at the heterojunction enables efficient exciton migration while suppressing back-electron transfer, and the strong spectral overlap between the PbI2 emission and defect absorption supports efficient fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) predicts a photon-ratcheting mechanism that boosts absorption and emission while maintaining magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast through minimal hybridization. Experimentally, the heterostructure exhibits enhanced continuous-wave ODMR sensitivity and functions as a precise probe of external magnetic fields. This work establishes a proof-of-concept for amplifying weak defect signals in nanomaterials, highlighting a new strategy for engineering their optical and magnetic responses.</description>

      <title>Mechanics of incompatible asymmetric grain boundary migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grain boundary (GB) migration governs microstructure evolution and can mediate plastic deformation through sliding or shear coupling. Numerous experimental and numerical studies have reported a wide range of behaviors associated with boundary migration, such as defect emission or mode switching. Notably, recent studies have reported directionally asymmetric migration rates under symmetric loading, attributing this behavior to intrinsically asymmetric mobility; however, a mechanistic mesoscale explanation for this behavior remains lacking. In this work, we introduce a constitutive flow rule for grain-boundary eigendeformation within a multiphase-field framework, in which interfacial shear evolves in response to its mechanically conjugate driving force through the phase field Allen-Cahn equations. The formulation systematically employs regularized grain boundary shear kinematics informed by crystallography, and enables elastic compatibility to modulate boundary motion. Migration thresholds, residual back-stress, and apparent directional asymmetry appear naturally as emergent mechanical behavior. Simulations of symmetric and asymmetric tilt grain boundaries under mechanical, synthetic, and curvature-driven loading reveal persistent defect-like residuals following incompatible migration, transitions from planar motion to lamination at large inclinations, and even "ratcheting" behavior. These results provide a mechanically transparent explanation for behaviors such as effective mobility asymmetry and establish elastic compatibility as a constitutive mechanism in mesoscale models of boundary-mediated plasticity.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Systematic Error in Thin Film Conductivity Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical conductivity is the most fundamental charge transport parameter, and measurements of conductivity are a basic part of materials characterization for nearly all conducting materials. In thin films, conductivity is often measured in four bar architectures in which the current source and voltage measurement are spatially separated to eliminate systematic error due to contact resistance. Despite the apparent simplicity of these measurements, we demonstrate here that the four bar architecture is subject to significant systematic error arising from the finite conductivity of the metal electrodes. Remarkably, these systematic errors can in some cases become unbounded, producing arbitrarily high measured conductivity at modest true film conductivities, within the range relevant to emerging thin film thermoelectric materials such as conducting polymers. These unbounded errors, which can occur even in properly conducted four-point measurements of patterned films, likely explain literature reports of extremely high conductivities in conducting polymers, and can lead to anomalous scaling in temperature dependent studies, potentially leading to incorrect interpretation of the relevant charge transport mechanism. We characterize the device geometric factors that control these errors, which stand partially at odds with those required for accurate Seebeck coefficient measurements. Our analyses allow us to identify device architectures that provide small systematic errors for conductivity and Seebeck coefficient while still providing a low measurement resistance, critical to reducing noise in thermal voltage measurements. These findings provide important guidelines for accurate measurements in the growing field of thin-film thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Spherical Balls Settling Through a Quiescent Cement Paste Measured by X-ray Tomography: Influence of the Paste Thixotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The settling of spherical balls in quiescent cement pastes of increasing age is studied. Metallic spheres with radii of 2, 2.5 and 3mm are dropped into the paste and allowed to settle, while their position is tracked using X-ray tomography. The instantaneous velocity of the spheres, calculated from their movement, is observed to be quasi-constant during their fall, and an average is estimated. The results show that the average velocity of the balls decreases logarithmically with paste age until ball stoppage, for all three ball sizes. In parallel, the rheological properties of the cement paste are measured using a rheometer with a vane geometry. The evolution of the paste static yield stress over time is evaluated, and proves to be a reliable predictor for ball stoppage. Finally, thixotropic models of increasing complexity are evaluated. These models consider four forms of structural growth and breakdown parameters, and their ability to capture the ball settling velocity as a function of paste age is compared. This emphasizes the importance of considering paste breakdown in relation to shearing of the paste when the ball passes through it.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Multi-Agent AI for High-Throughput Polymer Informatics: From Property Prediction to Generative Design Across Synthetic and Bio-Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an integrated multiagent AI ecosystem for polymer discovery that unifies high-throughput materials workflows, artificial intelligence, and computational modeling within a single Polymer Research Lifecycle (PRL) pipeline. The system orchestrates specialized agents powered by state-of-the-art large language models (DeepSeek-V2 and DeepSeek-Coder) to retrieve and reason over scientific resources, invoke external tools, execute domain-specific code, and perform metacognitive self-assessment for robust end-to-end task execution. We demonstrate three practical capabilities: a high-fidelity polymer property prediction and generative design pipeline, a fully automated multimodal workflow for biopolymer structure characterization, and a metacognitive agent framework that can monitor performance and improve execution strategies over time. On a held-out test set of 1,251 polymers, our PolyGNN agent achieves strong predictive accuracy, reaching R2 = 0.89 for glass-transition temperature (Tg ), R2 = 0.82 for tensile strength, R2 = 0.75 for elongation, and R2 = 0.91 for density. The framework also provides uncertainty estimates via multiagent consensus and scales with linear complexity to at least 10,000 polymers, enabling high-throughput screening at low computational cost. For a representative workload, the system completes inference in 16.3 s using about 2 GB of memory and 0.1 GPU hours, at an estimated cost of about $0.08. On a dedicated Tg benchmark, our approach attains R2 = 0.78, outperforming strong baselines including single-LLM prediction (R2 = 0.67), group-contribution methods (R2 = 0.71), and ChemCrow (R2 = 0.66). We further demonstrate metacognitive control in a polystyrene case study, where the system not only produces domain-level scientific outputs but continually monitors and optimizes its own behavior through tactical, strategic, and meta-strategic self-assessment.</description>

      <title>Information Propagation and Encoding in Solids: A Quantitative Approach Towards Mechanical Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineered systems typically separate mechanical function from information processing, whereas biological systems can exploit physical structure as a medium for information processing and computation. Motivated by this contrast, recent work in mechanics has explored embedding information-processing capabilities directly into mechanical structures. However, quantitative frameworks for evaluating such capabilities remain limited. Here we address a foundational question: how does information propagate through a solid body? Using elastic bodies as a model system, we apply information-theoretic tools to treat an elastic domain as an information encoder and quantify how information transmits from applied loads to discrete sensor locations. We further connect these measures to familiar mechanical phenomena, including Saint-Venant's effect and principal stress lines. Moving toward design, we show how geometry and architected materials can tune transmission, enabling elastic domains to either transmit or block information. Overall, this work advances quantifiable metrics and benchmark tasks for mechanical intelligence, supporting comparable designs of mechanically embodied information processing.</description>

      <title>Effects of PLGA coating on biological and mechanical behaviors of tissue engineering scaffolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaffolds have a key role in the clinical success of tissue engineering for the regeneration of damaged tissues. Their bio-performance is often described as the extent to which they can provide an extracellular matrix-like environment for cells embedded where their function and growth can effectively continue. For this purpose, tissue engineering scaffolds should exhibit biodegradability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, delivery, and mechanical performance. The use of polymer coatings, especially poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), on tissue engineering scaffolds has been found to be one of the most effective methods to improve the scaffold properties. This paper reviews the techniques used to coat tissue engineering scaffolds with PLGA and its effects on the mechanical characteristics, biodegradability, biocompatibility, Molecular delivery, and osteointegration of the scaffolds. It is concluded that apart from apatite-formation ability, all bio-functionalities can be tuned through PLGA coatings. This reflects the great potential of this modification approach to be used in tissue regeneration and therapeutic delivery applications.</description>

      <title>Plasticity, hysteresis, and recovery mechanisms in spider silk fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spider silk is a remarkable biomaterial with exceptional stiffness, strength, and toughness stemming from a unique microstructure. While recent studies show that silk fibers exhibit plasticity, hysteresis, and recovery under cyclic loading, the underlying microstructural mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In this work, we propose a mechanism explaining the loading-unloading-relaxation response through microstructural evolution: initial loading distorts intermolecular bonds, resulting in a linear elastic regime. Upon reaching the yield stress, these bonds dissociate and the external load is transferred to the polypeptide chains, which deform entropically to allow large deformations. Unloading is driven by entropic shortening until a traction free state with residual stretch is achieved. Subsequently, the fiber recovers as chains reorganize and bonds reform, locking the microstructure into a new stable equilibrium that increases stiffness in subsequent cycles. Following these mechanisms, we develop a microscopically motivated, energy-based model that captures the macroscopic response of silk fibers under cyclic loading. The response is decoupled into two parallel networks: (1) an elasto-plastic network of inter- and intramolecular bonds governing the initial stiffness and yield stress, and (2) an elastic network of entropic chains that enable large deformations. The model is validated against experimental data from Argiope bruennichi dragline silk. The findings from this work are three-fold: (1) explaining the mechanisms that govern hysteresis and recovery and linking them to microstructural evolution; (2) quantifying the recovery process of the fiber, which restores and enhances mechanical properties; and (3) establishing a predictive foundation for engineering synthetic fibers with customized properties.</description>

      <title>A room-temperature cavity-magnonic source of correlated microwave pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated microwave photon sources are key enablers for technologies in quantum-limited sensing, signal amplification and communication, but the reliance on millikelvin operating temperature limits their scalability for broader applications. Here, at room temperature, we demonstrate strong correlated microwave signals emitted from a hybrid magnon-photon platform. Different from traditional parametrically induced magnons with degenerate frequencies, we achieve non-degenerate excitations by coupling magnon modes simultaneously with two cavity photon modes. Through the magnon-photon interactions in the corresponding linear and nonlinear regimes, one input microwave photon splits into a pair of magnon polaritons that possess distinct frequencies but maintain strong inter-mode correlations. The nonlinear magnon polariton dynamics empowered by this new parametric platform brings both verified true randomness and robust multi-channel correlations, from which we construct a microwave communication experiment for noise resilient signal transmission with added security. This work establishes cavity magnonics as a versatile and compact platform for generating correlated multi-mode microwave signals, opening new avenues for applications in classical and quantum domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time generative models for crystalline materials enable inverse materials design by learning to predict stable crystal structures, but incorporating explicit target properties into the generative process remains challenging. Policy-gradient reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled mechanism for aligning generative models with downstream objectives but typically requires access to the score, which has prevented its application to flow-based models that learn only velocity fields. We introduce Open Materials Generation with Inference-time Reinforcement Learning (OMatG-IRL), a policy-gradient RL framework that operates directly on the learned velocity fields and eliminates the need for the explicit computation of the score. OMatG-IRL leverages stochastic perturbations of the underlying generation dynamics preserving the baseline performance of the pretrained generative model while enabling exploration and policy-gradient estimation at inference time. Using OMatG-IRL, we present the first application of RL to crystal structure prediction (CSP). Our method enables effective reinforcement of an energy-based objective while preserving diversity through composition conditioning, and it achieves performance competitive with score-based RL approaches. Finally, we show that OMatG-IRL can learn time-dependent velocity-annealing schedules, enabling accurate CSP with order-of-magnitude improvements in sampling efficiency and, correspondingly, reduction in generation time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron gases in low dimensional materials exhibit unconventional transport and optical phenomena due to reduced phase space, enhanced interactions, and strong sensitivity to lattice symmetry. While commonly realized in quantum confined systems and engineered heterostructures, such states are rare in naturally occurring materials. Hyperbolic materials provide a compelling alternative, as extreme lattice anisotropy can host unconventional electronic states and novel electron-phonon interactions. Here, we investigate the angle resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) response of MoOCl2, the first naturally occurring hyperbolic material whose hyperbolicity originates from a highly anisotropic electron gas. We observe pronounced polarization dependent Fano line shapes, revealing coherent coupling between phonons and an anisotropic electronic continuum. We characterize the directional response of this continuum, incorporating it into effective Raman tensors that quantitatively reproduce the ARPR measurements and capture the distinct Raman fingerprint of MoOCl2. Excitation energy and thickness dependent ARPR measurements further demonstrate a tunable quasi 1D electronic continuum with weak interlayer coupling, establishing MoOCl2 as a model system for Raman studies of electron-phonon coupling in hyperbolic materials</description>

Abstract: We revisit the geometric theory of defects. In the differential-geometric models of defects that have been adopted since the 1950s, dislocations have been associated with torsion, disclinations with the full curvature, and point defects with the first kind trace of non-metricity. The mainstream formulation exhibits several conceptual and technical shortcomings, most notably a hierarchy inconsistency, the non-exictence of a genuine metric formulation, and the potential emergence of Ostrogradsky-type instabilities. These issues have motivated us to develop a new framework, namely a generalized teleparallel geometric theory of defects. In our model, dislocations are identified with the trace of torsion, disclinations with the second kind trace of the non-metricity, and point defects with the first kind trace of the non-metricity. In addition, we retain the scalar part torsion as a free parameter for describing some possible unknown degrees of freedom in the theory of defects. The proposed geometric theory of defects is free from all of the aforementioned drawbacks and is therefore worthy of further investigation. To ensure the coherence and completeness of the discussion, we begin our analysis with elastic deformations, then summarize the existing metric-affine geometric theory of defects, and finally proceed to our original contribution, namely the new theory introduced here. We formulate the entire theory in Eulerian coordinates. Naturally, all results can be reformulated in Lagrangian coordinates as well. All analyses and formulae are expressed in the language of exterior algebra and are carried out in coordinate-independent orthonormal frames.</description>

      <title>Steady-state skin effect in bosonic topological edge states under parametric driving</title>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have attracted significant theoretical interest due to their extreme properties. However, realizations have mostly been limited to classical applications or artificial setups. In this study, we focus on the quantum nature inherent in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) systems, which from the perspective of spectral theory corresponds to non-Hermiticity. Based on this insight, we propose a steady-state skin effect in quantum condensed matter utilizing such BdG non-Hermiticity. Specifically, we introduce BdG quantum terms arising from parametric pumping to the edge states of an underlying bosonic Hermitian Chern insulator, thereby realizing non-Hermiticity without dissipation. This system design has the advantage of being largely independent of microscopic model details. Through analysis using non-equilibrium Green's functions, we find that under open boundary conditions, a steady state exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect is realized. The pronounced corner particle accumulation observed in this steady state shows quadrature anisotropy, which manifests the bosonic quantum nature. Our results bridge the gap between the fascinating mathematics of non-Hermitian matrices and practical quantum physical systems.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Generative AI Enabling Labour Free Segmentation For Microscopy Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation of microscopy images is a critical task for high-throughput materials characterisation, yet its automation is severely constrained by the prohibitive cost, subjectivity, and scarcity of expert-annotated data. While physics-based simulations offer a scalable alternative to manual labelling, models trained on such data historically fail to generalise due to a significant domain gap, lacking the complex textures, noise patterns, and imaging artefacts inherent to experimental data. This paper introduces a novel framework for labour-free segmentation that successfully bridges this simulation-to-reality gap. Our pipeline leverages phase-field simulations to generate an abundant source of microstructural morphologies with perfect, intrinsically-derived ground-truth masks. We then employ a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) for unpaired image-to-image translation, transforming the clean simulations into a large-scale dataset of high-fidelity, realistic SEM images. A U-Net model, trained exclusively on this synthetic data, demonstrated remarkable generalisation when deployed on unseen experimental images, achieving a mean Boundary F1-Score of 0.90 and an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.88. Comprehensive validation using t-SNE feature-space projection and Shannon entropy analysis confirms that our synthetic images are statistically and featurally indistinguishable from the real data manifold. By completely decoupling model training from manual annotation, our generative framework transforms a data-scarce problem into one of data abundance, providing a robust and fully automated solution to accelerate materials discovery and analysis.</description>

      <title>Machine learning determines the Mg2SiO4 P-T phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions among Mg2SiO4 and its high-pressure polymorphs (wadsleyite and ringwoodite) are central to mantle dynamics and deep-mantle material cycling. However, the locations and Pressure-Temperature (P-T) dependences of these phase boundaries remain debated, largely due to experimental limitations at extreme conditions and the high computational cost of first-principles free-energy calculations. Here, a machine-learning-potential driven workflow combining non-equilibrium thermodynamic integration (NETI) and two-phase coexistence simulations is employed to enable large-scale, long-timescale molecular dynamics sampling. Within this workflow, the melting curve of forsterite is evaluated and a complete P-T phase diagram is constructed. Relative to conventional ab initio approaches, this strategy reduces computational expense while retaining thermodynamic consistency in phase-stability assessment. The workflow is applicable to efficient evaluation of phase stability and thermodynamic properties in deep-Earth silicate systems.</description>

      <title>Weyl-Dirac nodal line phonons with type-selective surface states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The band complex formed by multiple topological states has attracted extensive attention for the emergent properties produced by the interplay among the constituent states. Here, based on group theory analysis, we present a scheme for rapidly identifying the Weyl-Dirac nodal lines (a complex of Weyl and Dirac nodal lines) in bosonic systems. We find only 5 of the 230 space groups host Weyl-Dirac nodal line phonons. Notably, the Dirac nodal line resides along the high-symmetry line, whereas the Weyl nodal line is distributed on the high-symmetry plane and is interconnected with the Dirac nodal line, jointly forming a composite nodal network structure. Unlike traditional nodal nets, this nodal network exhibits markedly distinct surface states on different surfaces, which can be attributed to the fundamental differences in the topological properties between the Weyl and Dirac nodal lines. This unique property thus allows the material to present distinct surface states in a termination-selective manner. Furthermore, by first-principles calculations, we identify the materials NdRhO$_{3}$ and ZnSe$_{2}$O$_{5}$ as candidate examples to elaborate the Weyl-Dirac nodal line and their related topological features. Our work provides an insight for exploring and leveraging topological properties in systems with coexisting multiple topological states.</description>

      <title>Intersubband electric dipole spin resonance in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of inter-spin-subband electric dipole spin resonance in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers is proposed. Our symmetry analysis demonstrates that, in contrast to monolayers, the reduced symmetry of heterobilayers enables coupling between conduction band spin subbands by an electric field. We establish the optical selection rules for all six high-symmetry stacking configurations. The microscopic mechanism of the effect is identified as the spin-orbit coupling induced mixing of Bloch states from different conduction bands, which generates a non-zero momentum matrix element between the spin-split states. It also leads to the linear-in-wavevector spin-dependent terms in the effective Hamiltonian, i.e., the Rashba effect. Our estimates show that the rate of electric-dipole spin-flip transitions exceeds by far that of the magnetic-dipole transitions in transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Unidirectional Density Wave and Band splitting in a Single-Domain Trilayer Nickelate Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unraveling the interplay between density-wave (DW) instabilities and multi-orbital physics is critical for understanding superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, yet intrinsic electronic features have been persistently obscured by material inhomogeneity and thus the multi-domain averaging effect. Here, we employ micro-focused angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy ($\mu$-ARPES) on single-domain Pr$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ to disentangle the complex hierarchy of intrinsic and back-folded bands, explicitly identifying the electronic states driving the DW phase transition. We provide decisive spectroscopic evidence that the low-energy reconstruction is governed by inter-orbital nesting between the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands. Specifically, we resolve a orbital-dependent gap of $\sim44$ meV on the $\alpha$ pocket, a value quantitatively consistent with prior measurements, unifying previously conflicting experimental reports regarding the locus and magnitude of the DW gap. Furthermore, we reveal strong orbital-selective mass renormalization in the $d_{z^2}$ states and successfully resolve the long-sought intrinsic trilayer $\beta$-band splitting, establishing a critical lower bound for the outer-layer hopping. These results define a coherent microscopic fingerprint for the trilayer nickelates, identifying the specific nesting channels and correlation effects that underpin the phase diagram.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When multifrequency Raman scattering is driven in the transient regime by two chirped pump pulses, the resulting anti-Stokes orders exhibit asymmetric spectral broadening toward lower frequencies, leading to a characteristic double-peaked structure in each order. In this Letter, frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG) is used to investigate the spectral evolution of the first anti-Stokes Raman component. To interpret the observed features, we introduce a double-pulse interference model and employ an adaptive learning-based reconstruction algorithm using the Adam optimizer to retrieve the temporal field evolution. The simulation results show good agreement with the experimental measurements. Our analysis indicates that the observed red-shifted spectral component originates from linear Raman processes within the two-photon dressed-state framework.</description>

      <title>A continuous symmetry breaking measure for finite clusters using Jensen-Shannon divergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quantitative measure of symmetry breaking is introduced that allows the quantification of which symmetries are most strongly broken due to the introduction of some kind of defect in a perfect structure. The method uses a statistical approach based on the Jensen-Shannon divergence. The measure is calculated by comparing the transformed atomic density function with its original. Software code is presented that carries the calculations out numerically using Monte Carlo methods. The behavior of this symmetry breaking measure is tested for various cases including finite size crystallites (where the surfaces break the crystallographic symmetry), atomic displacements from high symmetry positions, and collective motions of atoms due to rotations of rigid octahedra. The approach provides a powerful tool for assessing local symmetry breaking and offers new insights that can help researchers understand how different structural distortions affect different symmetry operations.</description>

Abstract: The difference between free surface energy and fracture toughness in amorphous silica is studied via multi-scale simulations. We combine the homogenization of a molecular dynamics fracture model with a phase-field approach to track and quantify the various energy contributions. We clearly separate free surface energy localized as potential energy on the surface and damage diffusion over a 16-23 A range around the crack path. The plastic contribution is negligible. These findings, which clarify brittle fracture mechanisms in amorphous materials, align with toughness measurements in silica.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) printing is a versatile technique to realize micro/nano-scale additive manufacturing of functional materials, including metals and semiconductors. However, the crystallization phenomena during LIFT printing have not been well understood, which is critical to determine the resulting microstructure and properties. In this work, we systematically investigate silicon crystallization during LIFT printing using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Specifically, MD simulation with Stillinger-Weber (SW) potential is used to investigate the size effect and surface influence on the crystallization of Si nanoparticles during transportation in air. We found that with a decrease in nanoparticle size, crystallization becomes increasingly rare, even at low cooling rates. The nucleation location of different particles is also analyzed and almost always starts at a sub-surface location (below 5 {\AA}). The evolution of the atomic structure during solidification is also monitored to guide LIFT printing of Si. Our simulation results indicate that nano-confinement induced by the surface layer can lead to single-crystal structure formation, which may shed light on additive manufacturing of single-crystal structures and devices.</description>

      <title>Dominant orbital magnetization in the prototypical altermagnet MnTe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnetism is an unconventional form of antiferromagnetism characterized by momentum-dependent spin polarization of electronic states and zero net magnetization, arising from specific crystalline symmetries. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken time-reversal symmetry, altermagnets can exhibit finite net magnetization and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), phenomena typically associated with ferromagnets. Due to the dependence of AHE on magnetization, understanding the interplay between spin and orbital contributions to magnetization is essential for interpreting experiments and designing altermagnetic devices. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the intrinsic spin and orbital magnetization of the magnetic ground state of the prototypical altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe. We find that SOC induces weak ferromagnetism through spin canting, accompanied by a slight in-plane rotation of the N\'eel vector. Notably, we identify a significant net orbital magnetization of 0.176 {\mu}B per unit cell oriented along the z-axis, while the spin magnetization in the same direction is much smaller at 0.002 {\mu}B. By varying the chemical potential, we show that the spin magnetization is tunable through hole doping, whereas the orbital magnetization remains robust against carrier density changes. These results highlight the important role of orbital magnetization and establish its relevance for orbital-based phenomena in altermagnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft-solid molecular crystals consist of crystalline grains and fluid grain boundaries (GB) that enhance grain binding and transport of Li+ ions between the grains. The total ionic conductivity consists of ion migration in both the grains and GBs. To unravel these contributions in adiponitrile (Adpn)-LiPF6 molecular crystals, the GB volume fraction was varied by changing the size of the crystals and the Adpn-LiPF6 molar ratio. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations indicate that ion motion was sub-diffusive in the grains and well-diffusive in the GBs, with GBs characterized as disordered nano-confined regions of higher charge carrier concentration (1M) than in saturated Adpn-LiPF6 solutions (0.04M), and Li+ ions predominantly solvated by cyano groups with few contact ion pairs. The diffusivity in the GBs is at least an order of magnitude higher than in the crystalline grains. The emergent picture is the grains as a reservoir of ions that migrate to the faster-conducting GBs.</description>

Abstract: We present the synthesis and study of the magnetic and electronic properties of NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 heterostructure. The {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 interface hosts a high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with large spin-orbit coupling, making it promising for spintronics applications if it can be coupled to a suitable source of spin currents. Here, we synthesize a ferrimagnetic insulating NiFe2O4(001) layer on {\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001) using a low-temperature reactive sputtering at 150 deg C without compromising the mobility and charge carrier density of the 2DEG at the {\gamma}-Al2O3(001)/SrTiO3(001) interface. The sheet resistance of both {\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 and NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 exhibits metallic behavior down to cryogenic temperatures, with a low temperature upturn driven by the Kondo-like scattering. Most importantly, NiFe2O4/{\gamma}-Al2O3/SrTiO3 behaves as a magnetic diode at low temperatures, and its rectification performance increases significantly with increasing magnetic field strength giving rise to a robust magneto-electronic rectification effect at low temperatures, which provides a first step towards the development of all-oxide heterostructures capable of efficient spin-charge conversion.</description>

Abstract: Field evaporation in atom probe tomography (APT) includes known processes related to surface migration of atoms, such as the so-called roll-up mechanism. They lead to trajectory aberrations and artefacts on the detector. These processes are usually neglected in simulations. The inclusion of such processes is crucial for providing reliable models for the development and verification of APT reconstruction algorithms, a key part of the whole methodology. Here we include stochastic lateral velocity perturbations and a roll-up mechanism to simulations performed using the Robin--Rolland model. By comparing with experimental data from Al and Ni systems, we find the stochastic perturbation energy distributions that allow us to very accurately reproduce the detector patterns seen experimentally and thus greatly improve the accuracy of the simulations. We also explore the possible causes of remaining discrepancies between the experimental and simulated detector patterns.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of large twist ferroelectricity and swirling dislocations in bilayer hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With its atomically thin structure and intrinsic ferroelectric properties, heterodeformed bilayer hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has gained prominence in next-generation non-volatile memory applications. However, studies to date have focused almost exclusively on small$-$twist bilayer hBN, leaving the question of whether ferroelectricity can persist under small heterostrain and large heterodeformation entirely unexplored. In this work, we establish the crystallographic origin of ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN configurations heterodeformed relative to high-symmetry configurations such as the AA-stacking and the $21.786789^\circ$ twisted configuration ($\Sigma 7$), using Smith normal form bicrystallography. We then demonstrate out-of-plane ferroelectricity in bilayer hBN across configurations vicinal to both the AA and $\Sigma7$ stackings. Atomistic simulations reveal that AA-vicinal systems support ferroelectricity under both small twist and small strain, with polarization switching in the latter governed by the deformation of swirling dislocations rather than the straight interface dislocations seen in the former. For $\Sigma7$-vicinal systems, where existing interatomic potentials underperform particularly under extreme out-of-plane compression, we develop a density-functional-theory-informed continuum framework-the bicrystallography-informed frame-invariant multiscale (BFIM) model, which captures out-of-plane ferroelectricity in heterodeformed configurations vicinal to the $\Sigma 7$ stacking. Interface dislocations in these large heterodeformed bilayer configurations exhibit markedly smaller Burgers vectors compared to the interface dislocations in small-twist and small-strain bilayer hBN. The BFIM model reproduces experimental results and provides a powerful, computationally efficient framework for predicting ferroelectricity in large-unit-cell heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Are diffusion models ready for materials discovery in unexplored chemical space?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While diffusion models are attracting increasing attention for the design of novel materials, their ability to generate low-energy structures in unexplored chemical spaces has not been systematically assessed. Here, we evaluate the performance of two diffusion models, MatterGen and DiffCSP, against three databases: a ternary oxide set (constructed by a genetic algorithm), a ternary nitride set (constructed by template informatics), and the GNoME database (constructed by a combination of both). We find that diffusion models generally perform stably in well-sampled chemical spaces (oxides and nitrides), but are less effective in uncommon ones (GNoME), which contains many compositions involving rare-earth elements and unconventional stoichiometry. Finally, we assess their size-extrapolation capability and observe a significant drop in performance when the number of atoms exceeds the trained range. This is attributed to the limitations imposed by periodic boundary conditions, which we refer to as the curse of periodicity. This study paves the way for future developments in materials design by highlighting both the strength and the limitations of diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Automated laboratory x-ray diffractometer and fluorescence spectrometer for high-throughput materials characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials research has created demand for automated, high-throughput characterization techniques capable of rapidly generating large data sets. We describe here a new instrument for simultaneous X-ray diffraction and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, optimized for high-throughput studies of combinatorial specimens. A bright, focused, high-energy X-ray beam (24 keV) combined with a pixel array area detector allows spatially-resolved (~200 {\mu}m) transmission diffraction measurements through thick (100 {\mu}m) specimens of structural metals with exposure times as short as 1 s. Simultaneously, a silicon drift detector records X-ray fluorescence from the specimen for spatially-resolved measurement of composition. Specimen handling is fully automated, with a robot inside the X-ray enclosure manipulating the sample for measurements at different locations. Data orchestration is also automated, with data streamed off the instrument and processed autonomously. In this paper we assess the performance of the instrument in terms of throughput, resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio, and provide an example of its capabilities through a combinatorial study of Cu-Ti alloys to demonstrate rapid data set creation.</description>

      <title>On The Finetuning of MLIPs Through the Lens of Iterated Maps With BPTT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate structural relaxation is critical for advanced materials design. Traditional approaches built on physics-derived first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, motivating the creation of machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), which strive to faithfully reproduce first-principles computed forces. We propose a fine-tuning method to be used on a pretrained MLIP in which we create a fully-differentiable end-to-end simulation loop that optimizes the predicted final structures directly. Trajectories are unrolled and gradients are tracked through the entire relaxation. We show that this method consistently improves performance across all evaluated pretrained models; resulting in an average of roughly 32% reduction in prediction error. Interestingly, we show the process is robust to substantial variation in the relaxation setup, achieving negligibly different results across varied hyperparameter and procedural modifications.</description>

      <title>Multimode Jahn-Teller Effect in Negatively Charged Nitrogen-Vacancy Center in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a first-principles study of the multimode Jahn-Teller (JT) effect in the exctied $^{3}E$ state of the negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. Using density functional theory combined with an intrinsic distortion path (IDP) analysis, we resolve the full activation pathways of the JT distortion and quantitatively decompose the distortion into contributions from individual vibrational modes. We find that multiple vibrational modes participate cooperatively in the JT dynamics, giving rise to a shallow adiabatic potential energy surface with low barriers, consistent with thermally activated pseudorotation. The dominant JT-active modes are found to closely correspond to vibrational features observed in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES), in agreement with recent ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our results establish a microscopic, mode-resolved picture of vibronic coupling in the excited-state NV center and provide new insight into dephasing, relaxation, and optically driven dynamics relevant to solid-state quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Matter with apparent and hidden spin physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials with interesting physical properties are often designed based on our understanding of the target physical effects. The physical properties can be either explicitly observed ("apparent") or concealed by the perceived symmetry ("hidden") but still exist. Both are enabled by specific symmetries and induced by certain physical interactions. Using the underlying approach of condensed matter theory of real materials (rather than schematic model Hamiltonians), we discuss apparent and hidden physics in real materials focusing on the properties of spin splitting and spin polarization. Depending on the enabling symmetries and underlying physical interactions, we classify spin effects into four categories with each having two subtypes; representative materials are pointed out. We then discuss the electric tunability and switch of apparent and hidden spin splitting and polarization in antiferromagnets. Finally, we extend "hidden effects" to views that are farsighted in the sense of resolving the correct atomistic and reciprocal symmetry and replaced by the incorrect higher symmetry. This framework could guide and enable systematic discovery of such intriguing effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials discovery is a cornerstone of modern technological advancement, yet it remains constrained by traditional trial-and-error paradigms and the inherent bias of human intuition. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative tool in materials science by effectively modeling structure-property relationships. Despite substantial efforts to enhance model expressiveness, data efficiency remains an equally critical challenge, given the limited availability of experimental and computational resources. Active learning (AL), as a data-driven machine learning paradigm, has shown great promise for discovering novel materials and enabling the efficient navigation of vast materials spaces. In this review, we follow the evolution of sampling strategy design techniques in AL, from Bayesian optimization to advanced deep learning-based strategies. We then highlight how AL enhances data efficiency across various data regimes, ranging from task-specific settings with limited data to the development of general-purpose datasets and large-scale models. We further provide a systematic overview of AL applications throughout the materials research pipeline, including computational simulation, composition and structural design, process optimization, and self-driving laboratory systems. Finally, we pinpoint key challenges and future perspectives of AL in materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Metal Halide Perovskites for Violet and Ultraviolet Light Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emissive metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as excellent candidates for next-generation optoelectronics due to their sharp color purity, inexpensive processing, and bandgap tunability. However, the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs has lagged behind due to challenges related to material and device stability, charge carrier transport, tunability into the ultraviolet spectrum, toxicity, and scalability. Here, we review the progress of both violet and ultraviolet MHP nanomaterials and light-emitting diodes, including materials synthesis and device fabrication across various crystal structures and dimensions (e.g., bulk thin films, 2D thin films, nanoplatelets, colloidal nanocrystals, and more) as well as lead-free platforms (e.g., rare-earth metal halide perovskites). By highlighting several pathways to continue the development of violet and ultraviolet light-emitting MHPs while also proposing tactics to overcome their outstanding challenges, we demonstrate the potential of state-of-the-art violet and ultraviolet MHP materials and devices for important applications in public health, 3D printing, nanofabrication, and more.</description>

      <title>Specific heat of Gd$^{3+}$ and Eu$^{2+}$-based magnetic compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23519v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied theoretically the specific heat of a large number of non-frustrated magnetic structures described by the Heisenberg model for systems with total angular momentum $J=7/2$, corresponding to the 4f$^7$ configuration of Gd$^{+3}$ and Eu$^{+2}$. For a given critical temperature (determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a high degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary parameters: the effective number of neighbors $z$, which dictates the extent of spatial and quantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy $K$. The universality of $z$ (its ability to describe specific heat across diverse lattices) holds robustly for systems where exchange interactions do not strongly increase with distance and in the absence of frustration. Otherwise, deviations from universality emerge. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a remarkable agreement. The present approach enables the extraction of magnetic interaction parameters not accessible through mean-field theory, offering a powerful tool for interpreting specific heat data in 4f$^7$ systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The logarithmic corotational derivative is a key concept in rate-type constitutive relations in continuum mechanics. The derivative is defined in terms of the logarithmic spin tensor, which is a skew-symmetric tensor/matrix given by a relatively complex formula. Using a newly developed commutator based functional calculus, we derive a new representation formula for the logarithmic spin tensor. In addition to the result on the logarithmic corotational derivative we also use the newly developed functional calculus to answer some problems regarding the matrix logarithm and the monotonicity of stress-strain relations. These results document that the commutator based functional calculus is of general use in tensor/matrix analysis, and that the calculus allows one to seamlessly work with tensor/matrix valued functions and their derivatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale atomistic simulations are essential to bridge computational materials and chemistry to realistic materials and drug discovery applications. In the past few years, rapid developments of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have offered a solution to scale up quantum mechanical calculations. Parallelizing these interatomic potentials across multiple devices poses a challenging, but promising approach to further extending simulation scales to real-world applications. In this work, we present DistMLIP, an efficient distributed inference platform for MLIPs based on zero-redundancy, graph-level parallelization. In contrast to conventional spatial partitioning parallelization, DistMLIP enables efficient MLIP parallelization through graph partitioning, allowing multi-device inference on flexible MLIP model architectures like multi-layer graph neural networks. DistMLIP presents an easy-to-use, flexible, plug-in interface that enables distributed inference of pre-existing MLIPs. We demonstrate DistMLIP on four widely used and state-of-the-art MLIPs: CHGNet, MACE, TensorNet, and eSEN. We show that DistMLIP can simulate atomic systems 3.4x larger and up to 8x faster compared to previous multi-GPU methods. We show that existing foundation potentials can perform near-million-atom calculations at the scale of a few seconds on 8 GPUs with DistMLIP.</description>

      <title>Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organic Quantum Chains (OQCs) represent a newly synthesized class of carbon-based nanostructures whose quasi-one-dimensional nature gives rise to unconventional electronic and transport phenomena. Here we investigate the electronic and transport properties of recently synthesized OQCs [Nature Communications, 12, 5895 (2021)]. Structural stability was first assessed through molecular dynamics relaxation combined with density functional theory (DFT). The optimized coordinates are then used in a tight-binding model with exponentially decaying hopping parameterization, which reproduces the DFT results with high accuracy. Our calculations reveal a robust and nearly constant energy gap across several OQC configurations, in agreement with experimental data. We also identify emergent hierarchical states, characterized by distinct localization behaviors within sets of localized bands. Finally, we analyze different transport responses in scenarios involving the one-dimensional OQC coupled to carbon corrals, as observed in the experimental data, highlighting their potential as promising systems for application in carbon nanodevices.</description>

Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</description>

      <title>Fast Evaluation of Unbiased Atomic Forces in ab initio Variational Monte Carlo via the Lagrangian Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05222</link>

Abstract: Ab initio quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are state-of-the-art electronic structure calculations based on highly parallelizable stochastic frameworks for accurate solutions of the many-body Schr{\"o}dinger equation, suitable for modern many-core supercomputer architectures. Despite its potential, one of the major drawbacks that still hinders QMC applications, especially when targeting dynamical properties of large systems or extensive datasets, is the lack of an affordable method to compute atomic forces that are consistent with the corresponding potential energy surfaces (PESs), also known as unbiased atomic forces. Recently, one of the authors in the present paper proposed a way to obtain unbiased forces with the Jastrow-correlated Slater determinant ansatz, where the determinant part is frozen to the values obtained by a mean-field method, such as Density Functional Theory. However, the proposed method has a significant drawback for its applications: for a system with $N$ nuclei, one requires 6$N$ additional DFT calculations to get unbiased forces. This paper presents a way to replace the 6$N$ DFT calculations with a single coupled-perturbed Kohn-Sham calculation, following the so-called Lagrangian technique established in quantum chemistry. We also demonstrate that the developed unbiased VMC force calculation improves not only the consistency with PESs, but also its accuracy, by investigating three molecules from the rMD17 benchmark set, and comparing the unbiased VMC forces with those obtained by CCSD(T) calculations. We found that the bare VMC forces are biased from the CCSD(T) ones, while the unbiased ones give values closer to those of the CCSD(T) ones. Our benchmark test also reveals that the unbiased VMC forces yield very consistent values with hybrid and meta GGAs, but do not necessarily yield values that are very close to those of CCSD(T).</description>

      <title>Chiral orbital current driven topological Hall effect in Mn3Si2Te6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral orbital current (COC) plays a crucial role in governing the magnetization and transport behaviour in the layered ferrimagnetic nodal-line semiconductor Mn3Si2Te6. Here, we observe that the topological Hall effect (THE), typically attributed to Berry curvature from chiral spin textures, originates from COC, which produces an emergent magnetic field for conduction electrons due to its real-space orbital textures. We find that the THE signal strengthens as we move down from bulk to nanoflakes, but tends to disappear with increasing current, along with the disappearance of the COC state. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and the observed THE, suggesting that large Berry curvature and topological transport can arise purely from orbital degrees of freedom, providing a new platform for engineering dissipationless transport in 2D magnets.</description>

      <title>Emulating 2D Materials with Magnons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin waves (magnons) in 2D materials have received increasing interest due to their unique states and potential for tunability. However, many interesting features of these systems, including Dirac points and topological states, occur at high frequencies, where experimental probes are limited. Here, we study a crystal formed by patterning a hexagonal array of holes in a perpendicularly magnetized thin film. Through simulation, we find that the magnonic band structure imitates that of graphene, but additionally has some kagome-like character and includes a few flat bands. Surprisingly, its nature can be understood using a 9-band tight-binding Hamiltonian. This clear analogy to 2D materials enables band-gap engineering in 2D, topological magnons along 1D phase boundaries, and spectrally isolated modes at 0D point defects. Interestingly, the 1D phase boundaries allow access to the valley degree of freedom through a magnonic analog of the quantum valley-Hall insulator. These approaches can be extended to other magnonic systems, but are potentially more general due to the simplicity of the model, which resembles existing results from electron, phonon, photon, and cold atom systems. This finding brings the physics of spin waves in 2D materials to more experimentally accessible scales, augments it, and outlines a few principles for controlling magnonic states.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory and Unusual Dielectric Functions of Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the spatially nonlocal dielectric functions of graphene at any frequency derived starting fromthe first principles of thermal quantum field theory using the formalism of the polarization tensor. After a brief review of this formalism, the longitudinal and transverse dielectric functions are considered at any relationship between the frequency and the wave vector. The analytic properties of their real and imaginary parts are investigated at low and high frequencies. Emphasis is given to the double pole at zero frequency which arises in the transverse dielectric function. The role of this unusual property for solving the problem of disagreement between experiment and theory in the Casimir effect is discussed. We guess that a more complete dielectric response of ordinary metals should also be spatially nonlocal and its transverse part may possess the double pole in the region of evanescent waves.</description>
