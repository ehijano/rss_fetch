      <title>Unveiling Energy Pathways in AGN Accretion Flows with the Warm Corona Model for the Soft Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The soft excess in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) may arise through a combination of relativistic reflection and the effects of a warm corona at the surface of the accretion disc. Detailed examination of the soft excess can therefore constrain models of the transport and dissipation of accretion energy. Here, we analyze 34 XMM-Newton observations from 14 Type I AGNs with the reXcor spectral model which self-consistently combines emission from a warm corona with relativistic reflection assuming a lamppost corona. The model divides accretion energy between the disc, the warm corona, and the lamppost. The XMM-Newton observations span a factor of 188 in Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}$) and 350 in black hole mass, and we find that a warm corona is a significant contributor to the soft excess for 13 of the 14 AGNs with a mean warm corona heating fraction of $0.51$. The reXcor fits reveal that the fraction of accretion energy dissipated in the lamppost is anti-correlated with $\lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}$. In contrast, the relationship between $\lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}$ and both the optical depth and heating fraction of the warm corona appears to transition from an anti-correlation to a correlation at $\lambda_{\mathrm{obs,t}} \approx 0.15$. Therefore, at least one other physical process in addition to the accretion rate is needed to explain the evolution of the warm corona. Overall, we find that a warm corona appears to be a crucial depository of accretion energy in AGNs across a broad range of $\lambda_{\mathrm{obs}}$ and black hole mass.</description>

      <title>Have any LISA verification binaries been found?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some electromagnetically observed ultra-compact binaries will be strong gravitational wave sources for space-based detectors like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). These sources have historically been referred to as "verification binaries" under the assumption that they will be exploited to assess mission performance. This paper quantitatively interrogates that scenario by considering targeted analyses of known galactic sources in the context of a full simulation of the galactic gravitational wave foreground. We find that the analysis of the best currently known LISA binaries, even making maximal use of the available information about the sources, is susceptible to ambiguity or biases when not simultaneously fitting to the rest of the galactic population. While galactic binaries discovered electromagnetically in advance of, or during, the LISA survey are highly valuable multimessenger systems, the need for a global treatment of the galactic gravitational wave foreground calls into question whether or not they are the best sources for data characterization.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of the W-shaped O II Lines in Spectra of Type I Superluminous Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: H-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) are characterized by O II lines around 4,000 - 4,500 A in pre-/near-maximum spectra, so-called W-shaped O II lines. As these lines are from relatively high excitation levels, they have been considered a sign of non-thermal processes, which may give a hint of power sources of SLSNe-I. However, the conditions for these lines to appear have not been understood well. In this work, we systematically calculate synthetic spectra to reproduce observed spectra of eight SLSNe-I, parameterizing departure coefficients from the nebular approximation in the SN ejecta (expressed as b_neb). We find that most of the observed spectra can be reproduced well with b_neb ~&lt; 10, which means that no strong departure is necessary for the formation of the W-shaped O II lines. We also show that the appearance of the W-shaped O II lines is sensitive to temperature; only spectra with temperatures T ~ 14,000 - 16,000 K can produce the W-shaped O II lines without large departures. Based on this, we constrain the non-thermal ionization rate near the photosphere. Our results suggest that spectral features of SLSNe-I can give independent constraints on the power source through the non-thermal ionization rates.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of Debris Disk Creation in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of GW170817/AT2017gfo inaugurated an era of multimessenger astrophysics, in which gravitational wave and multiwavelength photon observations complement one another to provide unique insight on astrophysical systems. A broad theoretical consensus exists in which the photon phenomenology of neutron star mergers largely rests upon the evolution of the small amount of matter left on bound orbits around the black hole or massive neutron star remaining after the merger. Because this accretion disk is far from inflow equilibrium, its subsequent evolution depends very strongly on its initial state, yet very little is known about how this state is determined. Using both snapshot and tracer particle data from a numerical relativity/MHD simulation of an equal-mass neutron star merger that collapses to a black hole, we show how gravitational forces arising in a non-axisymmetric, dynamical spacetime supplement hydrodynamical effects in shaping the initial structure of the bound debris disk. The work done by hydrodynamical forces is ${\sim}10$ times greater than that due to time-dependent gravity. Although gravitational torques prior to remnant relaxation are an order of magnitude larger than hydrodynamical torques, their intrinsic sign symmetry leads to strong cancellation; as a result, hydrodynamical and gravitational torques have comparable effect. We also show that the debris disk's initial specific angular momentum distribution is sharply peaked at roughly the specific angular momentum of the merged neutron star's outer layers, a few $r_g c$, and identify the regulating mechanism.</description>

      <title>Searching for binary black hole sub-populations in gravitational wave data using binned Gaussian processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysically motivated population models for binary black hole observables are often insufficient to capture the imprints of multiple formation channels. This is mainly due to the strongly parametrized nature of such investigations. Using a non-parametric model for the joint population-level distributions of binary black hole component masses and effective inspiral spins, we find hints of multiple subpopulations in the third gravitational wave transient catalog. The higher (more positive) spin subpopulation is found to have a mass-spectrum without any feature at the $30-40M_{\odot}$, which is consistent with the predictions of isolated stellar binary evolution, simulations for which place the pile up due to pulsational pair-instability supernovae near $50M_{\odot}$ or higher. The other sub-population with effective spins closer to zero shows a feature at $30-40M_{\odot}$ and is consistent with binary black holes formed dynamically in globular clusters, which are expected to peak around $30M_{\odot}$. We also compute merger rates for these two subpopulations and find that they are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the corresponding formation channels. We validate our results by checking their robustness against variations of several model configurations and by analyzing large simulated catalogs with the same model.</description>

      <title>Relation between the keV-MeV and TeV emission of GRB 221009A and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to launch relativistic jets, which generate prompt emission by their internal processes and drive external shocks into surrounding medium, accounting for the long-lasting afterglow emission. However, how the jet powers the external shock is an open question. The unprecedented observations of the keV-MeV emission with GECAM and the TeV emission with LHAASO of so far the brightest burst, GRB 221009A, offer a great opportunity to study the prompt-to-afterglow transition and the early dynamical evolution of the external shock. In this letter, we find that the cumulative light curve of keV-MeV emission could well fit the rising stage of the TeV light curve of GRB 221009A, with a time delay of $4.45^{+0.26}_{-0.26}$\,s for TeV emission. Moreover, both the rapid increase in the initial stage and the excess from about \T+260\,s to 270\,s in the TeV light curve could be interpreted by inverse Compton (IC) scatterings of the inner-coming photons by the energetic electrons in external shock. Our results not only reveal a close relation between the keV-MeV and TeV emission, but also indicate a continuous, rather than impulsive, energy injection to the external shock. Assuming an energy injection rate proportional to the keV-MeV flux, we build a continuous energy injection model which well fits the TeV light curve of GRB 221009A, and provides an estimate of the Lorentz factor of the jet.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Emission Properties of Flux Ropes from Two-Temperature GRMHD Simulations with Multiple Magnetic Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flux ropes erupting from the vicinity of the black hole are thought to be a potential model for the flares observed in Sgr\,A$^*$. In this study, we examine the radiative properties of flux ropes that emerged from the vicinity of the black hole. We have performed three-dimensional two-temperature General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of magnetized accretion flows with alternating multiple magnetic loops, and General Relativistic Radiation Transfer (GRRT) calculations. In GRMHD simulations, two different sizes of initial magnetic loops are implemented. In the small loop case, magnetic dissipation leads to a weaker excitement of magneto-rotational instability inside the torus which generates a lower accretion rate compared to the large loop case. However, it makes more generation of flux ropes due to frequent reconnection by magnetic loops with different polarities. By calculating the thermal synchrotron emission, we found that the variability of light curves and emitting region are tightly related. At $230\,\rm GHz$ and higher frequency, the emission from the flux ropes is relatively stronger compared with the background, which is responsible for the filamentary structure in the images. At lower frequencies, e.g. $43\,\rm GHz$, emission comes from more extended regions, which have a less filamentary structure in the image. Our study shows self-consistent electron temperature models are essential for the calculation of thermal synchrotron radiation and the morphology of the GRRT images. Flux ropes contribute considerable emission at frequencies $\gtrsim 230\,\rm GHz$.</description>

      <title>Heating of Millisecond Pulsars by Magnetic Field Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are believed to be very old neutron stars (NSs) whose age may exceed significantly $10^8$ yrs. Although cooling scenarios of isolated NSs predict for that age a surface temperature $T_s\sim 10^4$ K, observations of the nearest MSP J0437-4715 indicate $T_s$ well above that value. Besides the heating of the polar cap surface by backflowing charged particles, Joule heating in the crust can contribute to the overall heat budget of MSPs. Since the dipolar field component, derived from $P$ and $\dot{P}$ measurements, is much too weak for remarkable heating, smaller-scale structures should be analysed whether they can supply the demanded heat. For this purpose we study the small scale field structure of radio pulsars. Magnetic field components, significantly stronger than the dipolar one, may exist especially at the surface of MSPs. We assign upper limits to the strength of single field components up to a multipolarity of $l=10$ and the corresponding deviations from axial symmetry $m \le l$. Arguments are provided that the decay of the small-scale components with $l=3$ or $l=4$ of the crustal magnetic field may cause the relatively high surface temperature of isolated MSPs.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Magnetic Horizon on the Interpretation of the Pierre Auger Observatory Spectrum and Composition Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flux of ultra-high energy cosmic rays reaching Earth above the ankle energy (5 EeV) can be described as a mixture of nuclei injected by extragalactic sources with very hard spectra and a low rigidity cutoff. Extragalactic magnetic fields existing between the Earth and the closest sources can affect the observed CR spectrum by reducing the flux of low-rigidity particles reaching Earth. We perform a combined fit of the spectrum and distributions of depth of shower maximum measured with the Pierre Auger Observatory including the effect of this magnetic horizon in the propagation of UHECRs in the intergalactic space. We find that, within a specific range of the various experimental and phenomenological systematics, the magnetic horizon effect can be relevant for turbulent magnetic field strengths in the local neighbourhood of order $B_{\rm rms}\simeq (50-100)\,{\rm nG}\,(20\rm{Mpc}/{d_{\rm s})( 100\,\rm{kpc}/L_{\rm coh}})^{1/2}$, with $d_{\rm s}$ the typical intersource separation and $L_{\rm coh}$ the magnetic field coherence length. When this is the case, the inferred slope of the source spectrum becomes softer and can be closer to the expectations of diffusive shock acceleration, i.e., $\propto E^{-2}$. An additional cosmic-ray population with higher source density and softer spectra, presumably also extragalactic and dominating the cosmic-ray flux at EeV energies, is also required to reproduce the overall spectrum and composition results for all energies down to 0.6~EeV.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mean free path in neutron stars in the presence of hyperons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the neutrino elastic differential cross-section (NDCS) and corresponding mean free path for neutral current scattering in the dense matter of a neutron star. A wide range of observed neutron star (NS) masses is considered, including the presence of $\Lambda$, $\Xi^{-}$, and $\Xi^{0}$ hyperons in the heaviest stars. Their presence significantly decreases the total neutrino mean free path in the heavier stars.</description>

      <title>High energy head-on particle collisions near event horizons: classifcation of scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider head-on collisions of two particles near the event horizon. Particle 1 is outgoing, particle 2 is ingoing. We elucidate, in which case the energy $E_{c.m.}$ in the center of mass frame can grow unbounded. If the proper time between the horizon and an arbitrary point outside it for particle 1 is finite, we deal with a white hole. If it is infinite, we deal with a black hole. Particles can be either free or experience the action of a finite force. Our results are complementary to those for the standard BSW effect when particles move in the same direction. The results rely on classification of particles developed in our previous work H.V. Ovcharenko, O.B. Zaslavskii, Phys. Rev. D 108, 064029 (2023).</description>

      <title>Chandra X-ray Analysis of Herbig Ae/Be Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars are intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars, characterized by infrared excess and emission lines. They are observed to emit X-rays, whose origin is a matter of discussion and not settled yet. X-ray emission is not expected in HAeBe stars, as they lack the sub-surface convective zone. In this study, we retrieved observations from the Chandra archive for 62 HAeBe stars, among which 44 sources (detection fraction $\sim$71%) were detected in X-rays, with 7 being new detections. We use this sample as a test bed to conduct a comparative analysis of the X-ray properties of HAeBe stars and their low-mass counterparts, T Tauri Stars (TTSs). Further, we compare the X-ray properties of HAeBe stars and TTSs with optical and IR properties to constrain the X-ray emission mechanism in HAeBe stars. We found no correlation between X-ray emission and disk properties of HAeBe stars, confirming that X-rays are not related to accretion shocks. About 56% of HAeBe stars without any known sub-arcsec companions have lower plasma temperatures (kT $\leq$ 2 keV). We observe flaring/variability in HAeBe stars with confirmed low-mass companions. These stars show plasma temperatures &gt; 2 keV, similar to TTSs. Guided by this information we discuss the role of a T Tauri companion for X-ray emission seen in our sample of HAeBe stars. From the results obtained in this paper, we suggest that X-ray emission from HAeBe stars may not be related to accretion shocks or hidden TTS, but rather can be due to magnetically driven coronal emission.</description>

      <title>SUSHI: An algorithm for source separation of hyperspectral images with non-stationary spectral variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral images are data cubes with two spatial dimensions and a third spectral dimension, providing a spectrum for each pixel, and thus allow the mapping of extended sources' physical properties. In this article, we present the Semi-blind Unmixing with Sparsity for Hyperspectral Images (SUSHI), an algorithm for non-stationary unmixing of hyperspectral images with spatial regularization of spectral parameters. The method allows for the disentangling of physical components without the assumption of a unique spectrum for each component. Thus, unlike most source separation methods used in astrophysics, all physical components obtained by SUSHI vary in spectral shape and in amplitude across the data cube.
  Non-stationary source separation is an ill-posed inverse problem that needs to be constrained. We achieve this by training a spectral model and applying a spatial regularization constraint on its parameters. For the spectral model, we used an Interpolatory Auto-Encoder, a generative model that can be trained with limited samples. For spatial regularization, we applied a sparsity constraint on the wavelet transform of the model parameter maps.
  We applied SUSHI to a toy model meant to resemble supernova remnants in X-ray astrophysics, though the method may be used on any extended source with any hyperspectral instrument. We compared this result to the one obtained by a classic 1D fit on each individual pixel. We find that SUSHI obtains more accurate results, particularly when it comes to reconstructing physical parameters. We applied SUSHI to real X-ray data from the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A and to the Crab Nebula. The results obtained are realistic and in accordance with past findings but have a much better spatial resolution. Thanks to spatial regularization, SUSHI can obtain reliable physical parameters at fine scales that are out of reach for pixel-by-pixel methods.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Matter Equation of State in the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock Approach and Standard Skyrme Energy-Density Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter as well as the neutron and proton effective masses and their partial-wave and spin-isospin decomposition are analyzed within the Brueckner--Hartree--Fock approach. Theoretical uncertainties for all these quantities are estimated by using several phase-shift-equivalent nucleon-nucleon forces together with two types of three-nucleon forces, phenomenological and microscopic. It is shown that the choice of the three-nucleon force plays an important role above saturation density, leading to different density dependencies of the energy per particle. These results are compared to the standard form of the Skyrme energy-density functional and we find that it is not possible to reproduce the BHF predictions in the $(S,T)$ channels in symmetric and neutron matter above saturation density, already at the level of the two-body interaction, and even more including the three-body interaction.</description>

      <title>Testing the Boundary-to-Bound Correspondence with Numerical Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Boundary-to-Bound (B2B) correspondence, which connects orbital and radiative observables between bound and unbound orbits, has recently been introduced and demonstrated in the perturbative regime. We produce a large number of numerical relativity simulations of bound and unbound encounters between two nonspinning equal mass black holes in order to test this correspondence in the non-perturbative regime. We focus on testing the radiated energy and angular momentum, as well as orbital parameters such as the period and periastron advance. We find that, across a wide range of eccentricities, the B2B relationships do not hold in the non-perturbative regime, thereby placing a clear limit on the applicability of these relationships. We also approximate the separatrix between bound and unbound relativistic encounters as a function of their initial energies and angular momenta.</description>

      <title>Identifying Quasars from the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) cosmology survey includes a Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) which will yield spectra for over ten million bright galaxies (r&lt;20.2 AB mag). The resulting sample will be valuable for both cosmological and astrophysical studies. However, the star/galaxy separation criterion implemented in the nominal BGS target selection algorithm excludes quasar host galaxies in addition to bona fide stars. While this excluded population is comparatively rare (~3-4 per square degrees), it may hold interesting clues regarding galaxy and quasar physics. Therefore, we present a target selection strategy that was implemented to recover these missing active galactic nuclei (AGN) from the BGS sample. The design of the selection criteria was both motivated and confirmed using spectroscopy. The resulting BGS-AGN sample is uniformly distributed over the entire DESI footprint. According to DESI survey validation data, the sample comprises 93% quasi-stellar objects (QSOs), 3% narrow-line AGN or blazars with a galaxy contamination rate of 2% and a stellar contamination rate of 2%. Peaking around redshift z=0.5, the BGS-AGN sample is intermediary between quasars from the rest of the BGS and those from the DESI QSO sample in terms of redshifts and AGN luminosities. The stacked spectrum is nearly identical to that of the DESI QSO targets, confirming that the sample is dominated by quasars. We highlight interesting small populations reaching z&gt;2 which are either faint quasars with nearby projected companions or very bright quasars with strong absorption features including the Lyman-apha forest, metal absorbers and/or broad absorption lines.</description>

      <title>SN 2022oqm: A Bright and Multi-peaked Calcium-rich Transient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of SN 2022oqm, a nearby multi-peaked hydrogen- and helium-weak calcium-rich transient (CaRT). SN 2022oqm was detected 13.1 kpc from its host galaxy, the face-on spiral galaxy NGC 5875. Extensive spectroscopic coverage reveals an early hot (T &gt;= 40,000 K) continuum and carbon features observed $\sim$1~day after discovery, SN Ic-like photospheric-phase spectra, and strong forbidden calcium emission starting 38 days after discovery. SN 2022oqm has a relatively high peak luminosity (MB = -17 mag) for (CaRTs), making it an outlier in the population. We determine that three power sources are necessary to explain the light curve (LC), with each corresponding to a distinct peak. The first peak is powered by an expanding blackbody with a power law luminosity, suggesting shock cooling by circumstellar material (CSM). Subsequent LC evolution is powered by a double radioactive decay model, consistent with two sources of photons diffusing through optically thick ejecta. From the LC, we derive an ejecta mass and 56Ni mass of ~0.6 solar masses and ~0.09 solar masses. Spectroscopic modeling suggests 0.6 solar masses of ejecta, and with well-mixed Fe-peak elements throughout. We discuss several physical origins for SN 2022oqm and find either a surprisingly massive white dwarf progenitor or a peculiar stripped envelope model could explain SN 2022oqm. A stripped envelope explosion inside a dense, hydrogen- and helium-poor CSM, akin to SNe Icn, but with a large 56Ni mass and small CSM mass could explain SN 2022oqm. Alternatively, helium detonation on an unexpectedly massive white dwarf could also explain SN 2022oqm.</description>

      <title>What is the hard spectral state in X-ray binaries? Insights from GRRMHD accretion flows simulations and polarization of their X-ray emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray binaries are known to exhibit different spectral states which are often associated with different black hole accretion modes. The exact geometry and properties of these accretion modes is still uncertain. Recent IXPE measurements of linear polarization of X-ray emission in canonical X-ray binary system Cygnus X-1 allow us to test models for the hard spectral state of accretion in a unique way. We show that general relativistic radiative magnetohydrodynamic (GRRMHD) simulations of accreting stellar black hole in a hard X-ray state may be consistent with the new observational information. In the presented framework, where first-principle models have limited number of free parameters, the polarimetric X-ray observations put constraints on the viewing angle of the inner hot accretion flow.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Pulsar Timer for Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing is a powerful tool that, by accounting for every rotation of a pulsar, precisely measures the spin frequency, spin frequency derivatives, astrometric position, binary parameters when applicable, properties of the ISM, and potentially general relativistic effects. Typically, this process demands fairly stringent scheduling requirements for monitoring observations as well as deep domain knowledge to "phase connect" the timing data. We present an algorithm that automates the pulsar timing process for binary pulsars, whose timing solutions have an additional level of complexity, although the algorithm works for isolated pulsars as well. Using the statistical F-test and the quadratic dependence of the reduced $\chi ^2$ near a minimum, the global rotation count of a pulsar can be determined efficiently and systematically. We have used our algorithm to establish timing solutions for two newly discovered binary pulsars, PSRs J1748$-$2446aq and J1748$-$2446at, in the globular cluster Terzan 5, using $\sim$70 Green Bank Telescope observations from the last 13 years.</description>

      <title>Underluminous 1991bg-like Type Ia supernovae are standardizable candles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that the width-luminosity relation used to standardize normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) breaks down in underluminous, 1991bg-like SNe Ia. This breakdown may be due to the choice of parameter used as a stand-in for the width of the SN Ia light curve. Using the colour stretch parameter $s_\mathrm{BV}$ instead of older parameters resolves this issue. Here, I assemble a sample of 14 nearby 1991bg-like SNe Ia from the literature, all of which have independent host-galaxy distance moduli and little to no reddening. I use Gaussian process regression to fit the light curves of these SNe in $U/u$, $B$, $V$, $g$, $R/r$, $I/i$, and $H$, and measure their peak absolute magnitudes. I find statistically significant ($&gt;5\sigma$ confidence level in the optical and $&gt;4\sigma$ in the near-infrared) correlations between the peak absolute magnitudes of the 1991bg-like SNe Ia and their $s_\mathrm{BV}$ values in the range $0.2&lt;s_\mathrm{BV}&lt;0.6$. These correlations are broadly consistent with fits to $s_\mathrm{BV}&lt;0.7$ SNe Ia with preliminary $B$- and $V$-band peak absolute magnitudes from the Carnegie Supernova Project and significantly inconsistent with similar fits to normal and transitional SNe Ia (with $0.7&lt;s_\mathrm{BV}&lt;1.1$). The underluminous width-luminosity relation shown here needs to be properly calibrated with a homogeneous sample of 1991bg-like SNe Ia, after which it could be used as a rung on a new cosmological distance ladder. With surface-brightness fluctuations (or another non-Cepheid method) used to calibrate distances to nearby 1991bg-like SNe Ia, such a ladder could produce an independent measurement of the Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre Constant, $H_\mathrm{0}$.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the X-ray Emission in Heavily Obscured Compact Radio Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray continuum emission of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) may be reflected by circumnuclear dusty tori, producing prominent fluorescence iron lines at X-ray frequencies. Here we discuss the broad-band emission of three radio-loud AGN belonging to the class of compact symmetric objects (CSOs), with detected narrow Fe\,K$\alpha$ lines. CSOs have newly-born radio jets, forming compact radio lobes with projected linear sizes of the order of a few to hundreds of parsecs. We model the radio--to--$\gamma$-ray spectra of compact lobes in {J1407+2827}, J1511+0518, and {J2022+6137}, which are among the nearest and the youngest CSOs known to date, and are characterized by an intrinsic X-ray absorbing column density of $N_{\rm H} &gt; 10^{23}$\,cm$^{-2}$. In addition to the archival data, we analyze the newly acquired \chandra\ X-ray Observatory and Sub-Millimeter Array (SMA) observations, and also refine the $\gamma$-ray upper limits from the \fermi\ Large Area Telescope (LAT) monitoring. The new \chandra\ data exclude the presence of the extended X-ray emission components on scales larger than $1.5^{\prime \prime}$. The SMA data unveil a correlation of the spectral index of the electron distribution in the lobes and $N_{\rm H}$, which can explain the $\gamma$-ray quietness of heavily obscured CSOs. Based on our modeling, we argue that the inverse-Compton emission of compact radio lobes may account for the intrinsic X-ray continuum in all these sources. Furthermore, we propose that the observed iron lines may be produced by a reflection of the lobes' continuum from the surrounding cold dust.</description>

      <title>Impact of Ejecta Temperature and Mass on the Strength of Heavy Element Signatures in Kilonovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A kilonova, the electromagnetic emission produced by compact binary mergers, is formed through a delicate interplay of physical processes, involving r-process nucleosynthesis and interactions between heavy elements and photons through radiative transfer. This complexity makes it difficult to achieve a comprehensive understanding of kilonova spectra. In this study, we aim to enhance our understanding and establish connections between physical parameters and observables through radiative-transfer simulations. Specifically, we investigate how ejecta temperature and element mass influence the resulting kilonova spectrum. For each species, the strength of its line features depends on these parameters, leading to the formation of a distinct region in the parameter space, dubbed the Prominent Signature Region (PSR), where the line signature of that species is notably evident in the kilonova spectrum. We explore the origin and applications of PSRs. Among explored r-process elements (31$\leq$Z$\leq$92), we find that four species -- Sr$_{\rm II}$, Y$_{\rm II}$, Ba$_{\rm II}$, and Ce$_{\rm II}$ -- exhibit large and strong PSRs, suggesting their significant contributions to kilonova spectra at specific wavelengths. In addition, we discuss potential challenges and future perspectives in observable heavy elements and their masses in the context of PSRs.</description>

Abstract: Geminga is the first pulsar around which a remarkable TeV gamma-ray halo extending over a few degrees was discovered by MILAGRO, HAWC and later by H.E.S.S., and by Fermi-LAT in the GeV band. More middle-aged pulsars have exhibited gamma-ray halos, and they are now recognized as an emerging class of Galactic gamma-ray sources. The emission appears in the late evolution stage of pulsars, and is most plausibly explained by inverse Compton scattering of CMB and interstellar photons by relativistic electrons and positrons escaping from the pulsar wind nebulae. These observations pose a number of theoretical challenges. Tackling these questions requires constraining the ambient magnetic field properties, which can be achieved through X-ray observations. If the gamma-ray halos originate from a distribution of highly energetic electrons, synchrotron losses in the ambient magnetic fields of the same particles are expected to produce a diffuse X-ray emission with a similar spatial extension. We present the most comprehensive X-ray study of the Geminga pulsar halo to date, utilising archival data from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. Our X-ray analysis covers a broad bandwidth ($0.5\rm{-}79$ keV) and large field of view ($\sim 4^\circ$) for the first time. This is achieved by accurately measuring the background over the entire field of view, and taking into account both focused and stray-light X-ray photons with NuSTAR. We find no significant emission and set robust constraints on the X-ray halo flux. These are translated to stringent constraints on the ambient magnetic field strength and the diffusion coefficient by using a physical model considering particle injection, diffusion and cooling over the pulsar's lifetime, which is tuned by fitting multi-wavelength data. Our novel methodology for modelling and searching for synchrotron X-ray halos can be applied to other pulsar halo candidates.</description>

      <title>Optical variability of the blazar 3C 371: from minute to year timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The BL Lac object 3C 371 has been observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (\textit{TESS}) for approximately a year, between July 2019 and July 2020, with an unmatched 2-minute observing cadence. In parallel, the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT) Collaboration organized an extensive observing campaign, providing three years of continuous optical monitoring between 2018 and 2020. These datasets allow for a thorough investigation of the variability of the source. The goal of this study is evaluating the optical variability of 3C 371. Taking advantage of the remarkable cadence of \textit{TESS} data, we aim to characterize the intra-day variability (IDV) displayed by the source and identify its shortest variability timescale. With this estimate, constraints on the size of the emitting region and black hole mass can be calculated. Moreover, WEBT data is used to investigate long-term variability (LTV), including understanding spectral behaviour of the source and the polarization variability. Based on the derived characteristics, information on the origin of the variability on different timescales is extracted. We evaluated the variability applying the variability amplitude tool that quantifies how variable the emission is. Moreover, we employed common tools like ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAariance) tests, wavelet and power spectral density (PSD) analyses to characterize the shortest variability timescales present in the emission and the underlying noise affecting the data. Short- and long-term colour behaviours have been evaluated to understand the spectral behaviour of the source. The polarized emission was analyzed, studying its variability and possible rotation patterns of the electric vector position angle (EVPA). Flux distributions of IDV and LTV were also studied with the aim of linking the flux variations to turbulent and/or accretion disc related processes.</description>

      <title>MHD Simulation in Galactic Center Region with Radiative Cooling and Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of magnetic field on the gas dynamics in a galactic bulge region by three dimensional simulations with radiative cooling and heating. While high-temperature corona with $T&gt;10^6\ {\rm K}$ is formed in the halo regions, the temperature near the mid-plane is $\lesssim 10^4\ {\rm K}$ following the thermal equilibrium curve determined by the radiative cooling and heating. Although the thermal energy of the interstellar gas is lost by radiative cooling, the saturation level of the magnetic field strength does not significantly depend on the radiative cooling and heating. The magnetic field strength is amplified to $10\ {\rm \mu G}$ on average, and reaches several hundred ${\rm \mu G}$ locally. We find the formation of magnetically dominated regions at mid-latitudes in the case with the radiative cooling and heating, which is not seen in the case without radiative effect. The vertical thickness of the mid-latitude regions is $50-150\ {\rm pc}$ at the radial location of $0.4-0.8\ {\rm kpc}$ from the galactic center, which is comparable to the observed vertical distribution of neutral atomic gas. When we take the average of different components of energy density integrated over the galactic bulge region, the magnetic energy is comparable to the thermal energy. We conclude that the magnetic field plays a substantial role in controlling the dynamical and thermal properties of the galactic bulge region.</description>

      <title>Clockwork axion footprint on nano-hertz stochastic gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) nano-Hz gravitational wave (GW) background signal can be naturally induced by the annihilation of domain walls (DWs) formed at a symmetry-breaking scale $f\simeq 200$~TeV in the clockwork axion framework. Based on our first successful and precise prediction, we for the first time suggest that the recent PTA observations strongly support the novel mechanism of the QCD instanton-induced DW annihilation in the clockwork axion framework. We also for the first time discover a novel correlation between dark matter (DM) relic abundance and nano-Hz GW background, which in turn indicates a natural connection between the axion decay constant and the symmetry-breaking scale in the clockwork framework. We find that the GW signal has a peak $h^2\Omega_{\rm GW}\simeq 10^{-6.6}-10^{-6.1}$ at about 50~nHz, which is definite and testable for future PTA data at frequencies $\gtrsim 25$~nHz and CMB-S4 experiment. We also propose various phenomena that may appear in PTAs and future GW interferometers.</description>

      <title>Spherically symmetric elastic bodies in general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this review it to present a renewed perspective of the problem of self-gravitating elastic bodies under spherical symmetry. It is also a companion to the papers [Phys. Rev. D105, 044025 (2022)], [Phys. Rev. D106, L041502 (2022)], and [arXiv:2306.16584 [gr-qc]], where we introduced a new definition of spherically symmetric elastic bodies in general relativity, and applied it to investigate the existence and physical viability, including radial stability, of static self-gravitating elastic balls. We focus on elastic materials that generalize fluids with polytropic, linear, and affine equations of state, and discuss the symmetries of the energy density function, including homogeneity and the resulting scale invariance of the TOV equations. By introducing invariant characterizations of physical admissible initial data, we numerically construct mass-radius-compactness diagrams, and conjecture about the maximum compactness of stable physically admissible elastic balls.</description>

      <title>Sound in a Bubbly Hybrid Neutron Star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00129v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Increasingly precise astrophysical observations of the last decade in combination with intense theoretical studies allow for drawing a conclusion about potential Quark Matter presence in Neutron Stars interiors. Quark Matter may form the Neutron Star inner core or be immersed in the form of bubbles, or droplets. We consider the second scenario and demonstrate that even a small fraction of quark matter bubbles can lead to a high nonlinearity of the sound wave. Below the bubble resonant frequency the sound speed is lower than the ambient value. At the resonance it sharply grows. The peak is constrained by viscous dissipation. Above the resonance the speed exceeds the pure neutron star matter value. The dispersion equation for the bubbly neutron star compressibility is derived.</description>

      <title>Thermalization and Annihilation of Dark Matter in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The capture of dark matter, and its subsequent annihilation, can heat old, isolated neutron stars. In order for kinetic heating to be achieved, the captured dark matter must undergo sufficient scattering to deposit its kinetic energy in the star. We find that this energy deposit typically occurs quickly, for most of the relevant parameter space. In order for appreciable annihilation heating to also be achieved, the dark matter must reach a state of capture-annihilation equilibrium in the star. We show that this can be fulfilled for all types of dark matter - baryon interactions. This includes cases where the scattering or annihilation cross sections are momentum or velocity suppressed in the non-relativistic limit. Importantly, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium, and hence maximal annihilation heating, can be achieved without complete thermalization of the captured dark matter. For scattering cross sections that saturate the capture rate, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium is typically reached on a timescale of less than $1$ year for vector interactions and $10^4$ years for scalar interactions.</description>
