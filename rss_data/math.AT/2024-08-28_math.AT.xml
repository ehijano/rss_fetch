      <title>Cellular complexes and embeddings into Euclidean spaces: M\"obius strip, torus, and projective plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In algebraic topology, we usually represent surfaces by mean of cellular complexes. This representation is intrinsic, but requires to identify some points through an equivalence relation. On the other hand, embedding a surface in a Euclidean space is not intrinsic but does not require to identify points. In the present paper, we are interested in the M\"obius strip, the torus, and the real projective plane. More precisely, we construct explicit homeomorphisms, as well as their inverses, from cellular complexes to surfaces of 3-dimensional (for the M\"obius strip and the torus) and 4-dimensional (for the projective plane) Euclidean spaces. All the embeddings were already known, but we are not aware if explicit formulas for their inverses exist.</description>

      <title>Decomposing the Persistent Homology Transform of Star-Shaped Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the geometric decomposition of the degree-$0$ Persistent Homology Transform (PHT) as viewed as a persistence diagram bundle. We focus on star-shaped objects as they can be segmented into smaller, simpler regions known as ``sectors''. Algebraically, we demonstrate that the degree-$0$ persistence diagram of a star-shaped object in $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be derived from the degree-$0$ persistence diagrams of its sectors. Using this, we then establish sufficient conditions for star-shaped objects in $\mathbb{R}^2$ so that they have ``trivial geometric monodromy''. Consequently, the PHT of such a shape can be decomposed as a union of curves parameterized by $S^1$, where the curves are given by the continuous movement of each point in the persistence diagrams that are parameterized by $S^{1}$. Finally, we discuss the current challenges of generalizing these results to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Determination of the fifth Singer algebraic transfer in some degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P_k$ be the graded polynomial algebra $\mathbb F_2[x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_k]$ over the prime field $\mathbb F_2$ with two elements and the degree of each variable $x_i$ being 1, and let $GL_k$ be the general linear group over $\mathbb F_2$ which acts on $P_k$ as the usual manner. The algebra $P_k$ is considered as a module over the mod-2 Steenrod algebra $\mathcal A$. In 1989, Singer [22] defined the $k$-th homological algebraic transfer, which is a homomorphism $$\varphi_k :{\rm Tor}^{\mathcal A}_{k,k+d} (\mathbb F_2,\mathbb F_2) \to (\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}P_k)_d^{GL_k}$$ from the homological group of the mod-2 Steenrod algebra $\mbox{Tor}^{\mathcal A}_{k,k+d} (\mathbb F_2,\mathbb F_2)$ to the subspace $(\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathcal A}P_k)_d^{GL_k}$ of $\mathbb F_2{\otimes}_{\mathcal A}P_k$ consisting of all the $GL_k$-invariant classes of degree $d$.
  In this paper, by using the results of the Peterson hit problem we present the proof of the fact that the Singer algebraic transfer of rank five is an isomorphism in the internal degrees $d= 20$ and $d = 30$. Our result refutes the proof for the case of $d=20$ in Ph\'uc [17].</description>

      <title>Formal category theory in $\infty$-equipments II: Lax functors, monoidality and fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the framework of $\infty$-equipments which is designed to produce well-behaved theories for different generalizations of $\infty$-categories in a synthetic and uniform fashion. We consider notions of (lax) functors between these equipments, closed monoidal structures on these equipments, and fibrations internal to these equipments. As a main application, we will demonstrate that the foundations of internal $\infty$-category theory can be readily obtained using this formalism.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Topological Models for Phylogenetic Networks and the Mergegram Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutations of genetic sequences are often accompanied by their recombinations, known as phylogenetic networks. These networks are typically reconstructed from coalescent processes that may arise from optimal merging or fitting together a given set of phylogenetic trees. Nakhleh formulated the phylogenetic network reconstruction problem (PNRP): Given a family of phylogenetic trees over a common set of taxa, is there a unique minimal phylogenetic network whose set of spanning trees contains the family?
  Inspired by ideas from topological data analysis (TDA), we devise lattice-diagram models for phylogenetic networks and filtrations, the cliquegram and the facegram, both generalizing the dendrogram (filtered partition) model of phylogenetic trees. Both models allow us to solve the PNRP rigorously. The solutions are obtained by taking the join of the dendrograms on the lattice of cliquegrams or facegrams. Furthermore, computing the join-facegram is polynomial in the size and number of the input trees.
  Cliquegrams and facegrams can be challenging to work with when the number of taxa is large. We propose a topological invariant of facegrams and filtrations, called the mergegram, by extending a construction by Elkin and Kurlin defined on dendrograms. We show that the mergegram is invariant of weak equivalences of filtrations which, in turn, implies that it is a 1-Lipschitz stable invariant with respect to M\'emoli's tripod distance. The mergegram, can be used as a computable proxy for phylogenetic networks and filtrations of datasets. We illustrate the utility of these new TDA-concepts to phylogenetics, by performing experiments with artificial and biological data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce polyhedral products in an $\infty$-categorical setting. We generalize a splitting result by Bahri, Bendersky, Cohen, and Gitler that determines the stable homotopy type of the a polyhedral product. We also introduce a motivic refinement of moment-angle complexes and use the splitting result to compute cellular $\mathbb{A}^1$-homology, and $\mathbb{A}^1$-Euler characteristics.</description>

      <title>The connectivity of Vietoris-Rips complexes of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey what is known and unknown about Vietoris-Rips complexes and thickenings of spheres. Afterwards, we show how to control the homotopy connectivity of Vietoris-Rips complexes of spheres in terms of coverings of spheres and projective spaces. Let $S^n$ be the $n$-sphere with the geodesic metric, and of diameter $\pi$, and let $\delta &gt; 0$. Suppose that the first nontrivial homotopy group of the Vietoris-Rips complex $\mathrm{VR}(S^n;\pi-\delta)$ of the $n$-sphere at scale $\pi-\delta$ occurs in dimension $k$, i.e., suppose that the connectivity is $k-1$. Then $\mathrm{cov}_{S^n}(2k+2) \le \delta &lt; 2\cdot \mathrm{cov}_{\mathbb{R}P^n}(k)$. In other words, there exist $2k+2$ balls of radius $\delta$ that cover $S^n$, and no set of $k$ balls of radius $\frac{\delta}{2}$ cover the projective space $\mathbb{R}P^n$. As a corollary, the homotopy type of $\mathrm{VR}(S^n;r)$ changes infinitely many times as the scale $r$ increases.</description>

      <title>On the mod-2 cohomology of the product of the infinite lens space and the space of invariants in a generic degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07485v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb S^{\infty}/\mathbb Z_2$ be the infinite lens space and $\mathscr A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the binary field $\mathbb F_2.$ The cohomology $H^{*}((\mathbb S^{\infty}/\mathbb Z_2)^{\oplus s}; \mathbb F_2)$ is known to be isomorphic to the graded polynomial ring $\mathcal {P}_s:= \mathbb F_2[x_1, \ldots, x_s]$ on $s$ generators of degree 1, viewed as an unstable $\mathscr A$-module. The Kameko squaring operation $(\widetilde {Sq^0_*})_{(s; N)}: (\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathscr A} \mathcal {P}_s)_{2N+s} \longrightarrow (\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathscr A} \mathcal {P}_s)_{N}$ is rather useful in studying an open problem of determining the dimension of the indecomposables $(\mathbb F_2\otimes_{\mathscr A} \mathcal {P}_s)_N.$ As a continuation of our recent works, this paper deals with the kernel of the Kameko $(\widetilde {Sq^0_*})_{(s; N_d)}$ for the case where $s = 5$ and the "generic" degree $N_d$ is of the form $N_d = 5(2^{d} - 1) + 11.2^{d+1}$ for arbitrary $d &gt; 0.$ We then rectify almost all of the main results that were inaccurate in an earlier publication [Rev. Real Acad. Cienc. Exactas Fis. Nat. Ser. A-Mat. \textbf{116}:81 (2022)] by Nguyen Khac Tin. We have also constructed several advanced algorithms in \texttt{SageMath} to validate our results. These new algorithms make an important contribution to tackling the intricate task of explicitly determining both the dimension and the basis for the indecomposables $\mathbb F_2 \otimes_{\mathscr A} \mathcal {P}_s$ at positive degrees, a problem concerning algorithmic approaches that had not previously been addressed by any author. Also, the present study encompasses an investigation of the behavior of the cohomological transfer in bidegrees $(5, 5+N_d)$, with the internal degree $N_d$ mentioned above. The interplay between the papers by Nguyen Sum \cite{SM, N.S3} and our preceding studies \cite{D.P3, D.P7-1} is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal M\"obius Inversion and Grassmannian Persistence Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Orthogonal M\"obius Inversion $\mathsf{OI}$, a concept analogous to M\"obius inversion on finite posets, which is applicable to order-preservings functions from a finite poset to the Grassmannian $\mathsf{Gr}(V)$ of an inner product space $V$. Orthogonal Inversion is a special case of the broader concept of Orthomodular Inversion, where the target space is any orthomodular lattice, which we also identify.
  We apply $\mathsf{OI}$ in order to construct a "non-negative" persistence diagram for multiparameter filtrations $\mathsf{F}$ of a finite simplicial complex $K$ indexed over an arbitrary finite poset $P$, by applying it to the birth-death spaces of $\mathsf{F}$. Analogously to $1$-parameter classical persistence diagrams, these multiparameter Grassmannian persistence diagrams offer straightforward interpretability. Specifically, to a segment $(b, d) \in \mathsf{Seg}(P)$, (1) the Grassmannian persistence diagram canonically assigns a vector subspace of $C_q^K$ consisting of cycles that are born at $b$ and become boundaries at $d$ and (2) this assignment is exhaustive at the homology level.
  In the case of 1-parameter filtrations, we also study a variant of $\mathsf{OI}$ that is applicable to persistent Laplacian kernels.</description>

      <title>Persistence Diagram Estimation : Beyond Plug-in Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) used to summarize the topology underlying data. It can be conveniently represented through persistence diagrams. Observing a noisy signal, common strategies to infer its persistence diagram involve plug-in estimators, and convergence properties are then derived from sup-norm stability. This dependence on the sup-norm convergence of the preliminary estimator is restrictive, as it essentially imposes to consider regular classes of signals. Departing from these approaches, we design an estimator based on image persistence. In the context of the Gaussian white noise model, and for large classes of piecewise-constant signals, we prove that the proposed estimator is consistent and achieves parametric rates.</description>

      <title>Persistence-based Modes Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating multiple modes of a multivariate density, using persistent homology, a key tool from Topological Data Analysis. We propose a procedure, based on a preliminary estimation of the $H_{0}-$persistence diagram, to estimate the number of modes, their locations, and the associated local maxima. For large classes of piecewise-continuous functions, we show that these estimators are consistent and achieve nearly minimax rates. These classes involve geometric control over the set of discontinuities of the density, and differ from commonly considered function classes in mode(s) inference. Interestingly, we do not suppose regularity or even continuity in any neighborhood of the modes.</description>
