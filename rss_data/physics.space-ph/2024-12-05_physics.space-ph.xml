      <title>Direct Evidence of a Highest Wave-Driven Energetic Electron Flux at the Earth's Magnetopause</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacecraft observations of high-energy electron flux enhancement up to 125 keV at Earth's magnetopause are typically linked to the magnetic reconnection. Here, we report the first ever observation of prolonged electron flux enhancement reaching very high energy up to 650 keV at magnetopause near the subsolar point, notably without reconnection signatures. The observation reveals that the high-energy electron flux enhancement near the magnetopause is associated with the simultaneous occurrence of electron cyclotron wave harmonics, whistler waves, and Langmuir waves. Theoretical modeling confirms the wave generation by electron temperature anisotropy and the electron loss cone distribution. This direct, in-situ observation of high-energy electron flux linked to cascaded wave-particle interactions will help us advance our understanding about the tiniest electron-scale intricacies affecting near-Earth space weather.</description>

      <title>Energy Dissipation in Strong Collisionless Shocks: The Crucial Role of Ion-to-Electron Scale Separation in Particle-in-Cell Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy dissipation in collisionless shocks is a key mechanism in various astrophysical environments. Its non-linear nature complicates analytical understanding and necessitate Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. This study examines the impact of reducing the ion-to-electron mass ratio ($m_r$), to decrease computational cost, on energy partitioning in 1D3V (one spatial and three velocity-space dimensions) PIC simulations of strong, non-relativistic, parallel electron-ion collisionless shocks using the SHARP code. We compare simulations with a reduced mass ratio ($m_r = 100$) to those with a realistic mass ratio ($m_r = 1836$) for shocks with high ($\mathcal{M}_A = 21.3$) and low ($\mathcal{M}_A = 5.3$) Alfv$\acute{\text{e}}$n Mach numbers. Our findings show that the mass ratio significantly affects particle acceleration and thermal energy dissipation. At high $\mathcal{M}_A$, a reduced mass ratio leads to more efficient electron acceleration and an unrealistically high ion flux at higher momentum. At low $\mathcal{M}_A$, it causes complete suppression of electron acceleration, whereas the realistic mass ratio enables efficient electron acceleration. The reduced mass ratio also results in excessive electron heating and lower heating in downstream ions at both Mach numbers, with slightly more magnetic field amplification at low $\mathcal{M}_A$. Consequently, the electron-to-ion temperature ratio is high at low $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to reduced ion heating and remains high at high $\mathcal{M}_A$ due to increased electron heating. In contrast, simulations with the realistic $m_r$ show that the ion-to-electron temperature ratio is independent of the upstream magnetic field, a result not observed in reduced $m_r$ simulations.</description>
