      <title>Slant sums of quiver gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a notion of slant sum of quiver gauge theories, a type of surgery on the underlying quiver. Under some mild assumptions, we relate torus fixed points on the corresponding Higgs branches, which are Nakajima quiver varieties. Then we prove a formula relating the quasimap vertex functions before and after a slant sum, which is a type of ``branching rule" for vertex functions.
  Our construction is motivated by a conjecture, which we make here, for the factorization of the vertex functions of zero-dimensional quiver varieties. The branching rule allows this conjecture to be approached inductively. In special cases, it also provides a formula for the $\hbar=q$ specialization of vertex functions for quiver varieties not necessarily of Dynkin type as a sum over reverse plane partitions. When passed through the quantum Hikita conjecture, such expressions provide conjectural formulas for graded traces of Verma modules on the 3d mirror dual side.
  We also consider the Coulomb side. We make some conjectures reflecting what can be seen on the Higgs side and prove them in ADE type. We study slant sums of Coulomb branches and their quantizations. We prove that for one-dimensional framing, slant sum operation on the Coulomb branch side corresponds to taking products.</description>

      <title>Feit's conjecture, the canonical Brauer induction formula, and Adams operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by a strong version of Feit's conjecture, first formulated by the authors in joint work with A. Kleshchev and P. H. Tiep in 2025, concerning the conductor $c(\chi)$ of an irreducible character $\chi$ of a finite group $G$. We connect the conjecture with the following construction: For any positive integer $n$ dividing the exponent of $G$ and for any character $\chi$ of $G$, we introduce an integer-valued invariant $S(G,\chi,n)$ which can be defined as the sum of certain coefficients of the canonical Brauer induction formula of $\chi$, or alternatively as the multiplicity of the trivial character in a specified integral linear combination of Adams operations of $\chi$. We show two facts about this invariant. The first seems of independent interest (apart from Feit's conjecture): $S(G,\chi,n)$ is always non-negative, and it is positive if and only if a representation affording $\chi$ involves an eigenvalue of order $n$. Secondly, the strong version of Feit's conjecture holds for an irreducible character $\chi$ if and only if $S(G,\chi, c(\chi))&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Tilting Objects via Recollements and $p$-Cycles on Weighted Projective Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a new method for constructing tilting objects in a triangulated category via recollements. The $p$-cycle approach to exceptional curve processes significant advantages in constructing recollements and ladders, due to the existence of reduction/insertion functors. In order to construct tilting objects in the stable category of vector bundles over a weighted projective line, we give explicit expressions for line bundles and extension bundles due to the $p$-cycles constuctions. Furthermore, we provide an essential proof for tilting cuboic object and tilting objects consisting of Auslander bundles. Moreover, we construct certain new tilting objects in the stable category of vector bundles over a weighted projective line.</description>

      <title>On the pro-\'etale cohomology of quotient stacks of Drinfeld spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}^{n-1}_{K}$ denote the $(n-1)$-dimensional Drinfeld space over a $p$-adic field $K$. We give an explicit description of the $\ell$-adic and $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of quotient stacks $[\mathcal{H}^{n-1}_{K}/\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathcal{O}_K)]$ and $[\mathcal{H}^{n-1}_{K}/\operatorname{GL}_n(K)]$, which are moduli stacks of special formal $\mathcal{O}_D$-modules. The computation makes use of the isomorphism between the Lubin-Tate tower and the Drinfeld tower due to Faltings and Scholze--Weinstein, as well as the $p$-adic pro-\'etale cohomology of the Drinfeld spaces computed by Colmez--Dospinescu--Niziol. As an application, we also compute the continuous group cohomology of $\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ over duals of generalized Steinberg representations over $\mathbb{Q}_p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish new restrictions on the values of the lifting obstruction for projective unitary representations of second countable, locally compact Hausdorff groups on operator algebras. Using these, we show that every projective representation on the Jiang--Su algebra lifts to a genuine group representation. We also characterise the possible values of lifting obstructions for finite group projective representations on UHF-algebras of infinite type and Cuntz algebras. Finally we show that certain 2-cocycles of Property (T) groups cannot arise as lifting invariants of projective representations on the Hyperfinite II$_{1}$ factor.</description>

      <title>New perspectives in Kac-Moody algebras associated to higher dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we present a general framework for the construction of Kac-Moody (KM) algebras associated to higher-dimensional manifolds. Starting from the classical case of loop algebras on the circle $\mathbb{S}^{1}$, we extend the approach to compact and non-compact group manifolds, coset spaces, and soft deformations thereof. After recalling the necessary geometric background on Riemannian manifolds, Hilbert bases and Killing vectors, we present the construction of generalized current algebras $\mathfrak{g}(\mathcal{M})$, their semidirect extensions with isometry algebras, and their central extensions. We show how the resulting algebras are controlled by the structure of the underlying manifold, and illustrate the framework through explicit realizations on $SU(2)$, $SU(2)/U(1)$, and higher-dimensional spheres, highlighting their relation to Virasoro-like algebras. We also discuss the compatibility conditions for cocycles, the role of harmonic analysis, and some applications in higher-dimensional field theory and supergravity compactifications. This provides a unifying perspective on KM algebras beyond one-dimensional settings, paving the way for further exploration of their mathematical and physical implications.</description>

      <title>Abstract Cluster Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a framework for encoding cluster combinatorics using categorical methods. We give a definition of an abstract cluster structure, which captures the essence of cluster mutation at a tropical level and show that cluster algebras, cluster varieties, cluster categories and surface models all have associated abstract cluster structures. For the first two classes, we also show that they can be constructed from abstract cluster structures.
  By defining a suitable notion of morphism of abstract cluster structures, we introduce a category of these and show that it has several desirable properties, such as initial and terminal objects and finite products and coproducts. We also prove that rooted cluster morphisms of cluster algebras give rise to morphisms of the associated abstract cluster structures, so that our framework includes a version of the extant category of cluster algebras.
  We can do more, however, because we can relate different types of representation of abstract cluster structures (cluster algebra, varieties, categories) directly via morphisms of their associated abstract cluster structures, even though no direct map from e.g. a cluster category to the associated cluster algebra is possible.
  In fact, we do much of the above in the setting of abstract quantum cluster structures, with some analysis of the difference between the category of these and that of the unquantized version. In order to show the relationship between abstract quantum cluster structures and quantum cluster algebras, we reformulate the usual construction of the latter in a way that is more amenable to our purposes and which we expect will be of independent interest and use.</description>

Abstract: This paper initiates the study of invariants of links associated to infinite-dimensional representations of $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ using graphical representation for quantum $6j$-symbols, the shadow world. We obtain formulae for $q3j$-symbols and $q6j$-symbols for Verma modules and study their properties. This hints at the structure of the possible target category for Reshetikhin-Turaev functor for such an invariant.</description>

      <title>Resolving subcategories for gentle algebras I: Monogeneous resolving subcategories for gentle trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the first part of a series that intends to study the resolving subcategories for gentle algebras over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$.
  In a general setting, we improve the precision of an algorithm from Takahashi for resolving closure calculations in well-behaved abelian categories. Then, we modify the geometric model of Baur--Coelho-Sim\~oes and Opper--Plamondon--Schroll to compute such subcategories for gentle quivers that have a finite global dimension.
  Finally, we focus on gentle quivers $(Q,R)$ such that $Q$ is a directed tree, and we study the monogeneous resolving subcategories, which are the ones generated by a single non-projective indecomposable $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R \rangle$-module. By the way, we prove that these subcategories are the join-irreducible elements of the poset of all the resolving subcategories ordered by inclusion.</description>

      <title>Resolving subcategories for gentle algebras II: Resolving subcategories for gentle trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the second part of a series that intends to study the resolving subcategories for gentle algebras over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$.
  As in the first part, we continue to focus on gentle quivers $(Q,R)$, where $Q$ is a directed tree, known as gentle trees. In our previous work, via a modified surface model for gentle algebras with finite global dimension, we studied the join-irreducible elements of the lattice of resolving subcategories of $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R \rangle - \text{mod}$, which happen to be those generated by a non-projective indecomposable object.
  In this paper, we notice that this lattice is not semidistributive in general and, accordingly, introduce a so-called upper join-decomposition, replacing the canonical one. Together with the techniques we develop in our geometric model, it allows us to describe the resolving subcategories of any gentle tree. These same techniques let us explicitly construct the resolving subcategory generated by any collection of indecomposable $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R\rangle$-modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any cluster-tilting object $\mathsf{T}$ in the cluster category $\mathscr{C}_{n}$ of type $\mathbb{A}_{n}$, we construct a rank-four oriented matroid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ such that stackable triangulations of $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ are in bijection with equivalence classes of maximal green sequences with initial cluster $\mathsf{T}$. This generalises the result that equivalence classes of maximal green sequences of linearly oriented $\mathbb{A}_{n}$ are in bijection with triangulations of a three-dimensional cyclic polytope. The definition of the oriented matroid $\mathcal{M}_{\mathsf{T}}$ arises from the extriangulated structure on $\mathscr{C}_{n}$ which makes $\mathsf{T}$ projective.</description>

      <title>Quasi-flag manifolds and moment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new class of topological $G$-spaces generalizing the classical flag manifolds $G/T$ of compact connected Lie groups. These spaces, which we call the $m$-quasi-flag manifolds $ F_m = F_m(G,T) $, are topological realizations of the algebras $ Q_k(W) $ of $k$-quasi-invariant polynomials of the Weyl group $ W $ in the sense that their (even-dimensional) $G$-equivariant cohomology $ H_G(F_m, {\mathbb C}) $ is naturally isomorphic to $ Q_k(W) $, where $ m $ is a $W$-invariant integer-valued multiplicity function on the system of roots of $W$ and $ k = \frac{m}{2}$ or $ \frac{m+1}{2}$ depending on whether $m$ is even or odd. Many topological properties and algebraic structures related to the flag manifolds can be extended to quasi-flag manifolds. We compute the cohomology of quasi-flag manifolds by constructing their rational algebraic models in terms of coaffine stacks -- a certain kind of derived stacks introduced by B.To\"en and J. Lurie to provide an algebro-geometric framework for rational homotopy theory. Besides cohomology, we also compute the equivariant K-theory of quasi-flag manifolds and extend some of our cohomological results to the multiplicative setting. On the topological side, our approach is strongly influenced by the classical work on homotopy decompositions of classifying spaces of compact Lie groups; however, the diagrams that we use in our decompositions do not arise from collections of subgroups of $G$ but rather from moment graphs -- combinatorial objects introduced in a different area of topology called the GKM theory.</description>

      <title>Totally positive Toeplitz matrices: classical and modern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By a theorem of Edrei, an infinite, normalised totally nonnegative upper-triangular Toeplitz matrices is determined by a pair of nonnegative parameter sequences, the `Schoenberg parameters', where nonzero parameters correspond to the roots and poles of a naturally associated generating function. These totally nonnegative Toeplitz matrices and their parameters also arise in the classification of characters of the infinite symmetric group by later work of Thoma. Moreover the Schoenberg parameters have an asymptotic interpretation in terms of irreducible representations of S_n and their Young diagrams by Vershik-Kerov. In this article we consider infinite totally positive Toeplitz matrices as limits of finite ones, and we obtain two further asymptotic descriptions of the Schoenberg parameters that are now related to quantum cohomology of the flag variety as n goes to infinity. One is related to asymptotics of normalised quantum parameters, and the other to asymptotics of the Chern classes of the tautological line bundles. We also describe the asymptotics of (quantum) Schubert classes in terms of the Schoenberg parameters. Our limit formulas relate to and were motivated by a tropical analogue of this theory that we survey. In the tropical setting one finds an asymptotic relationship between the `tropical Schoenberg parameters' and the weight map from Lusztig's parametrisation of the canonical basis.</description>
