      <title>Enhanced Performance of Highly Activated Carbon and Surface-Treated Porous Polymers as Physical Adsorbents for Chemical Warfare Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) in modern warfare cannot be disregarded due to their ease of use and potential for large-scale incapacitation. An effective countermeasure involves the physical adsorption of these agents, preventing their entry through the respiratory tract by non-specific adsorption. In this study, we investigate the physical interaction between potential adsorbents and model gases mimicking CWAs, thereby identifying sufficient conditions for higher physical adsorption performance. Our findings reveal that the physical adsorption capacity is highly sensitive to the surface properties of the adsorbents, with uniform development of micropores, rather than solely high surface area, emerging as a critical factor. Additionally, we identified the potential of porous organic polymers as promising alternatives to conventional activated carbon-based adsorbents. Through a facile introduction of polar sulfone functional groups on the polymer surface, we demonstrated that these polar surface polymers exhibit physical adsorption capabilities for formaldehyde under ambient conditions comparable to high-performance activated carbons. Notably, the superior activated carbon possessed a high BET surface area of 2400 m^2/g and an exceptionally uniform micropore structure with an average pore size of approximately 11 Angstroms. This research paves the way for designing adsorbents with high physical adsorption capacities tailored for CWAs protection, offering a significant advancement in developing next-generation protective materials.</description>

      <title>Acid Base Chemistry of Short Hydrogen Bonds: A Tale of Schr\"odinger's Cat in Glutamine-Derived Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short hydrogen bonds (SHBs), defined by donor-acceptor distances below 2.5 Angstrom, represent a distinct regime in acid-base chemistry where conventional models of hydrogen bonding break down. In an organic crystal formed via a temperature-induced chemical transformation of L-glutamine, we previously identified an SHB that is permissive to proton transfer, leading to a characteristic double-well potential implying an activated process. Herein, using path-integral ab initio molecular dynamics (PI-AIMD), we show that nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) completely eliminate the classical barrier, leading to a symmetrization of the proton along the hydrogen bond. While in the classical case the proton transfer is strongly coupled to the rocking modes of the ammonium ion in the crystal, NQEs significantly reduce these correlations. Examining the electronic structure through Wannier centers (WCs) further reveals a quantum-driven redistribution of bonding electrons, blurring the distinction between hydrogen bonding and covalency. Taken together, our findings indicate that NQEs in this organic crystal lead to a situation where both the donor and acceptor can simultaneously act as both an acid and a base.</description>

      <title>SpectraMatcher: A Python Program for Interactive Analysis and Peak Assignment of Vibronic Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SpectraMatcher is a cross-platform desktop application for interactive comparison of experimental and computed vibronic spectra, designed to assist in the recognition and assignment of spectral patterns. It provides an intuitive graphical interface -- with no coding or scripting required -- for importing experimental spectra, visualizing them alongside the corresponding theoretical spectra constructed from Gaussian frequency calculations, and adjusting key parameters such as peak width, intensity scaling factors, and vibration-type-specific anharmonic corrections. SpectraMatcher features an automated peak-matching algorithm that assigns experimental and computed peaks based on their intensity ratio and proximity. Assignments and spectra can be exported in multiple formats for publication or for further analysis. The software remains responsive even for large datasets, and supports efficient and reproducible interpretation of vibronic spectra.</description>

      <title>EDBench: Large-Scale Electron Density Data for Molecular Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing molecular machine learning force fields (MLFFs) generally focus on the learning of atoms, molecules, and simple quantum chemical properties (such as energy and force), but ignore the importance of electron density (ED) $\rho(r)$ in accurately understanding molecular force fields (MFFs). ED describes the probability of finding electrons at specific locations around atoms or molecules, which uniquely determines all ground state properties (such as energy, molecular structure, etc.) of interactive multi-particle systems according to the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. However, the calculation of ED relies on the time-consuming first-principles density functional theory (DFT) which leads to the lack of large-scale ED data and limits its application in MLFFs. In this paper, we introduce EDBench, a large-scale, high-quality dataset of ED designed to advance learning-based research at the electronic scale. Built upon the PCQM4Mv2, EDBench provides accurate ED data, covering 3.3 million molecules. To comprehensively evaluate the ability of models to understand and utilize electronic information, we design a suite of ED-centric benchmark tasks spanning prediction, retrieval, and generation. Our evaluation on several state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that learning from EDBench is not only feasible but also achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we show that learning-based method can efficiently calculate ED with comparable precision while significantly reducing the computational cost relative to traditional DFT calculations. All data and benchmarks from EDBench will be freely available, laying a robust foundation for ED-driven drug discovery and materials science.</description>

      <title>DIALECT, a software package for exciton spectra and dynamics in large molecular assemblies from weak to strong light-matter coupling regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The software package DIALECT is introduced, which provides the capability of calculating excited-state properties and nonadiabatic dynamics of large molecular systems and can be applied to simulate energy and charge-transfer processes in molecular materials. To this end, we employ the FMO-LC-TDDFTB methodology, which combines the use of the fragment molecular orbital approach with the density-functional tight-binding method and an excitonic Hamiltonian including local and charge-transfer excitations. In this work, we present the features and capabilities of the DIALECT software package in simulating the excited state dynamics of molecules and molecular aggregates using exemplary trajectory surface hopping as well as decoherence corrected Ehrenfest dynamics calculations in the framework of LC-TDDFTB and FMO-LC-TDDFTB. In addition, the capability of simulating the polaritonic excited state properties is highlighted by the calculation of the polariton dispersion of an aggregate of naphthalene molecules. The development of the DIALECT program will facilitate the investigation of exciton and charge transport in large and complex molecular systems, such as biological aggregates, nanomaterials and other complex organic molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Probing the Temporal Response of Liquid Water to a THz Pump Pulse Using Machine Learning-Accelerated Non-Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast, time-resolved spectroscopies enable the direct observation of non-equilibrium processes in condensed-phase systems and have revealed key insights into energy transport, hydrogen-bond dynamics, and vibrational coupling. While ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) provides accurate, atomistic resolution of such dynamics, it becomes prohibitively expensive for non-equilibrium processes that require many independent trajectories to capture the stochastic nature of excitation and relaxation. To address this, we implemented a machine learning potential that incorporates time-dependent electric fields in a perturbative fashion, retaining AIMD-level accuracy. Using this approach, we simulate the time-dependent response of liquid water to a 12.3 THz Gaussian pump pulse (1.3 ps width), generating 32 ns of total trajectory data. With access to ab initio-quality electronic structure, we compute absorption coefficients and frequency-dependent refractive indices before, during, and after the pulse. The simulations reproduce key experimental observables, including transient birefringence and relaxation times. We observe energy transfer from the excited librational modes into translational and intramolecular vibrations, accompanied by a transient, nonlinear response of the hydrogen-bond network and a characteristic 0.7 ps timescale associated with librational energy dissipation. These findings demonstrate the method's ability to capture essential non-equilibrium dynamics with theoretical time-dependent IR spectroscopy and establish a broadly applicable framework for studying field-driven processes in complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Estimation of oil recovery due to wettability changes in carbonate reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low salinity waterflooding (LSWF) enhances oil recovery at low cost in carbonate reservoirs, but its effectiveness requires precise control of injected water chemistry and interaction with reservoir minerals. This study develops an integrated reactive transport model coupling geochemical surface complexation modeling (SCM) with multiphase compositional dynamics to quantify wettability alteration during LSWF. The framework combines PHREEQC-based equilibrium calculations of the Total Bond Product (TBP), a wettability indicator derived from oil-calcite ionic bridging, with Corey-type relative permeability interpolation, resolved via COMSOL Multiphysics. Core flooding simulations, compared with experimental data from calcite systems at 100 degrees Celsius and 220 bar, reveal that magnesium and sulfate concentrations modulate TBP, reducing oil-rock adhesion under controlled low-salinity conditions. Parametric analysis demonstrates that acidic crude oils (TAN higher than 1 mg KOH per gram) exhibit TBP values approximately 2.5 times higher than sweet crudes, due to carboxylate-calcite bridging, while pH elevation (above 7.5) amplifies wettability shifts by promoting deprotonated carboxyl interactions. The model further identifies synergistic effects between magnesium (50 to 200 millimoles per kilogram of water) and sulfate (above 500 millimoles per kilogram of water), which reduce calcium-mediated oil adhesion through competitive mineral surface binding. By correlating TBP with fractional flow dynamics, this framework could support the optimization of injection strategies in carbonate reservoirs, suggesting that ion-specific adjustments are more effective than bulk salinity reduction.</description>

      <title>Learned Free-Energy Functionals from Pair-Correlation Matching for Dynamical Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (cDFT) and dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) are modern statistical mechanical theories for modelling many-body colloidal systems at the one-body density level. The theories hinge on knowing the excess free-energy accurately, which is however not feasible for most practical applications. Dijkman et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056103 (2025)] recently showed how a neural excess free-energy functional for cDFT can be learned from inexpensive bulk simulations via pair-correlation matching. In this Letter, we demonstrate how this same functional can be applied to DDFT, without any retraining, to simulate non-equilibrium overdamped dynamics of inhomogeneous densities. We evaluate this on a 3D Lennard-Jones system with planar geometry under various complex external potentials and observe good agreement of the dynamical densities with those from expensive Brownian dynamic simulations, up to the limit of the adiabatic approximation. We further develop and apply an extension of DDFT to a grand-canonical system modeled after breakthrough gas adsorption studies, finding similarly good agreement. Our results demonstrate a practical route for leveraging learned free-energy functionals in DDFT, paving the way for accurate and efficient modeling of non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of GFN Methods in Geometry Optimization of Small Organic Semiconductor Molecules: A DFT Benchmarking Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study benchmarks the geometric, frequency, non-covalent (GFN) semi-empirical methods, GFN1-xTB, GFN2-xTB, GFN0-xTB, and GFN-FF, against density functional theory (DFT) for the geometry optimization of small organic semiconductor molecules. Two datasets are evaluated: a QM9-derived subset of small organic molecules and the Harvard Clean Energy Project (CEP) database of extended $\pi$-systems relevant to organic photovoltaics. Structural agreement is quantified using heavy-atom RMSD, equilibrium rotational constants, bond lengths, angles, and HOMO-LUMO energy gaps. Computational efficiency is assessed via CPU time and scaling behavior. GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB demonstrate the highest structural fidelity, while GFN-FF offers an optimal balance between accuracy and speed, particularly for larger systems. The results indicate that GFN-based methods are suitable for high-throughput molecular screening of small organic semiconductors, the choice of the method depending on the accuracy-cost trade-offs. The findings support the deployment of GFN approaches in computational pipelines for the discovery of organic electronics and materials, providing information on their strengths and limitations relative to established DFT methods.</description>

      <title>Considerations in the use of ML interaction potentials for free energy calculations</title>

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) promise to accurately describe the potential energy surface of molecules at the ab initio level of theory with improved computational efficiency. Within MLFFs, equivariant graph neural networks (EQNNs) have shown great promise in accuracy and performance and are the focus of this work. The capability of EQNNs to recover free energy surfaces (FES) remains to be thoroughly investigated. In this work, we investigate the impact of collective variables (CVs) distribution within the training data on the accuracy of EQNNs predicting the FES of butane and alanine dipeptide (ADP). A generalizable workflow is presented in which training configurations are generated with classical molecular dynamics simulations, and energies and forces are obtained with ab initio calculations. We evaluate how bond and angle constraints in the training data influence the accuracy of EQNN force fields in reproducing the FES of the molecules at both classical and ab initio levels of theory. Results indicate that the model's accuracy is unaffected by the distribution of sampled CVs during training, given that the training data includes configurations from characteristic regions of the system's FES. However, when the training data is obtained from classical simulations, the EQNN struggles to extrapolate the free energy for configurations with high free energy. In contrast, models trained with the same configurations on ab initio data show improved extrapolation accuracy. The findings underscore the difficulties in creating a comprehensive training dataset for EQNNs to predict FESs and highlight the importance of prior knowledge of the system's FES.</description>

      <title>The allosteric lever: towards a principle of specific allosteric response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Allostery, the phenomenon by which the perturbation of a molecule at one site alters its behavior at a remote functional site, enables control over biomolecular function. Allosteric modulation is a promising avenue for drug discovery and is employed in the design of mechanical metamaterials. However, a general principle of allostery, i.e. a set of quantitative and transferable "ground rules", remains elusive. It is neither a set of structural motifs nor intrinsic motions. Focusing on elastic network models, we here show that an allosteric lever -- a mode-coupling pattern induced by the perturbation -- governs the directional, source-to-target, allosteric communication: a structural perturbation of an allosteric site couples the excitation of localized hard elastic modes with concerted long range soft-mode relaxation. Perturbations of non-allosteric sites instead couple hard and soft modes uniformly. The allosteric response is shown to be generally non-linear and non-reciprocal, and allows for minimal structural distortions to be efficiently transmitted to specific changes at distant sites. Allosteric levers exist in proteins and "pseudoproteins" -- networks designed to display an allosteric response. Interestingly, protein sequences that constitute allosteric transmission channels are shown to be evolutionarily conserved. To illustrate how the results may be applied in drug design, we use them to successfully predict known allosteric sites in proteins.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic rules for de novo design of enzymes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enzymes are nano-scale machines that have evolved to drive chemical reactions out of equilibrium in the right place at the right time. Given the complexity and specificity of enzymatic function, bottom-up design of enzymes presents a daunting task that is far more challenging than making passive molecules with specific binding affinities or building nano-scale mechanically active devices. We present a thermodynamically-consistent model for the operation of such a fuelled enzyme, which uses the energy from a favourable reaction to undergo non-equilibrium conformational changes that in turn catalyze a chemical reaction on an attached substrate molecule. We show that enzymatic function can emerge through a bifurcation upon appropriate implementation of momentum conservation on the effective reaction coordinates of the low dimensional description of the enzyme, and thanks to a generically present dissipative coupling. Our results can complement the recently developed strategies for de novo enzyme design based on machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Measurement Problem: A Review of Recent Trends</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Left on its own, a quantum state evolves deterministically under the Schr\"odinger Equation, forming superpositions. Upon measurement, however, a stochastic process governed by the Born rule collapses it to a single outcome. This dual evolution of quantum states -- the core of the Measurement Problem -- has puzzled physicists and philosophers for nearly a century. Yet, amid the cacophony of competing interpretations, the problem today is not as impenetrable as it once seemed. This paper reviews the current status of the Measurement Problem, distinguishing between what is well understood and what remains unresolved. We examine key theoretical approaches, including decoherence, many-worlds interpretation, objective collapse theories, hidden-variable theories, dualistic approaches, deterministic models, and epistemic interpretations. To make these discussions accessible to a broader audience, we also reference curated online resources that provide high-quality introductions to central concepts.</description>
