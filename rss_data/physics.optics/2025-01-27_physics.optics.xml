      <title>Grover-Sagnac interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a nontraditional design of the Sagnac interferometer by replacing the commonly used beam splitter with a linear-optical Grover multiport. This substitution creates a pole at the origin of the device parameter space with an associated resonance in the output intensity. The structure of this resonance is dictated only by the non-reciprocal portion of the phase acquired in the Sagnac loop. This property directly results from adopting the more symmetric and higher-dimensional central scattering coin, and allows for a different approach to registering and detecting the non-reciprocal Sagnac phase. This parameter may be extracted from the width of a peak or dip in the interferogram instead of tracing small changes in power as in traditional Sagnac interferometry. We discuss how losses affect the system and potential metrological applications.</description>

      <title>Self-configuring high-speed multi-plane light conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-plane light converters (MPLCs) - also known as linear diffractive neural networks - are an emerging optical technology, capable of converting an orthogonal set of optical fields into any other orthogonal set via a unitary transformation. MPLC design is a non-linear problem typically solved by optimising a digital model of the optical system. However, inherently high levels of design complexity mean that even a minor mismatch between this digital model and the physically realised MPLC leads to a severe reduction in real-world performance. Here we address this challenge by creating a self-configuring free-space MPLC. Despite the large number of parameters to be optimised (typically tens of thousands or more), our proof-of-principle device converges in minutes using a method in which light only needs to be transmitted in one direction through the MPLC. Two innovations make this possible. Firstly, we devise an in-situ optimisation algorithm combining wavefront shaping with the principles of wavefront matching that would conventionally be used to inverse-design MPLCs offline in simulation. Secondly, we introduce a new MPLC platform incorporating a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) phase-only light modulator - allowing rapid MPLC switching at up to kiloHertz rates. Our scheme automatically accounts for the physical characteristics of all system components and absorbs any unknown misalignments and aberrations into the final design. We demonstrate self-configured MPLCs capable of mapping random orthogonal speckle input fields to well-defined Laguerre-Gaussian and Hermite-Gaussian output modes, as well as universal mode sorters. Our work paves the way towards large-scale ultra-high-fidelity fast-switching MPLCs and diffractive neural networks, which promises to unlock new applications in areas ranging from optical communications to optical computing and imaging.</description>

      <title>"Molecular waveplate" for the control of ultrashort pulses carrying orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrashort laser pulses carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) have become essential tools in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical (AMO) studies, particularly for investigating strong-field light-matter interactions. However, controlling and generating ultrashort vortex pulses presents significant challenges, since their broad spectral content complicates manipulation with conventional optical elements, while the high peak power inherent in short-duration pulses risks damaging optical components. Here, we introduce a novel method for generating and controlling broadband ultrashort vortex beams by exploiting the non-adiabatic alignment of linear gas-phase molecules induced by vector beams. The interaction between the vector beam and the gas-phase molecules results in spatially varying polarizability, imparting a phase modulation to a probe laser. This process effectively creates a tunable ``molecular waveplate'' that adapts naturally to a broad spectral range. By leveraging this approach, we can generate ultrashort vortex pulses across a wide range of wavelengths. Under optimized gas pressure and interaction length conditions, this method allows for highly efficient conversion of circularly polarized light into the desired OAM pulse, thus enabling the generation of few-cycle, high-intensity vortex beams. This molecular waveplate, which overcomes the limitations imposed by conventional optical elements, opens up new possibilities for exploring strong-field physics, ultrafast science, and other applications that require high-intensity vortex beams.</description>

      <title>Bi-stability and period-doubling cascade of frequency combs in exceptional-point lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that a laser can self-generate frequency combs when tuned near an exceptional point (EP), where two cavity modes coalesce. These EP combs induce periodic modulation of the population inversion in the gain medium, and their repetition rate is independent of the laser cavity's free spectral range. In this work, we perform a stability analysis that reveals two notable properties of EP combs, bi-stability and a period-doubling cascade. The period-doubling cascade enables halving of the repetition rate while maintaining the comb's total bandwidth, presenting opportunities for the design of highly compact frequency comb generators.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Design Wavelength Demultiplexer for On-Chip Photoluminescence Sorting in TMDC Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer a promising platform for on-chip integrated photonics because of their unique optical and electronic properties. Their naturally passivated surfaces make them highly tolerant to lattice mismatch, enabling seamless heterogeneous integration by stacking different van der Waals materials, a crucial step in the development of advanced photonic devices. Here, we demonstrate the use of an inverse design wavelength demultiplexing waveguides for on-chip sorting and routing of distinct photoluminescence from the heterojunction formed by WS2 and WSe2 monolayers. The integrated nanophotonic chip splits and sorts excitonic emission into individual waveguides at room temperature. Our demonstration opens up new perspectives for integrating light sources in van der Waals materials with functional integrated photonics, offering a versatile platform for both fundamental research and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Snapshot multi-spectral imaging through defocusing and a Fourier imager network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-spectral imaging, which simultaneously captures the spatial and spectral information of a scene, is widely used across diverse fields, including remote sensing, biomedical imaging, and agricultural monitoring. Here, we introduce a snapshot multi-spectral imaging approach employing a standard monochrome image sensor with no additional spectral filters or customized components. Our system leverages the inherent chromatic aberration of wavelength-dependent defocusing as a natural source of physical encoding of multi-spectral information; this encoded image information is rapidly decoded via a deep learning-based multi-spectral Fourier Imager Network (mFIN). We experimentally tested our method with six illumination bands and demonstrated an overall accuracy of 92.98% for predicting the illumination channels at the input and achieved a robust multi-spectral image reconstruction on various test objects. This deep learning-powered framework achieves high-quality multi-spectral image reconstruction using snapshot image acquisition with a monochrome image sensor and could be useful for applications in biomedicine, industrial quality control, and agriculture, among others.</description>

      <title>Phase retrieval via Zernike phase contrast microscopy with an untrained neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zernike's phase contrast microscopy (PCM) is among the most widely used techniques for observing phase objects, but it lacks quantitative nature, as it cannot directly provide phase information. Current methods for computationally extracting phase distributions from PCM images, however, rely heavily on empirical regularization parameter tuning. In this paper we extend an existing approach by employing an untrained neural network as an image prior, removing the need for manual regularization. We quantitatively demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness in phase retrieval compared to existing methods, using numerical and experimental PCM images. Our results confirm the feasibility of applying deep priors for phase retrieval in incoherent illumination setups.</description>

      <title>On z-coherence in self-focusing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both the intensity distribution and the degree of coherence between pairs of points along the propagation axis (z-coherence) are derived in closed form for a phenomenon of self-focusing produced by circularly coherent light. The first confirms results previously obtained numerically, while the second exhibits new complex features. The physical interpretation is obtained by a suitable pseudo-modal expansion that suggests an analogy with a simple two-mode structure.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast neural sampling with spiking nanolasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to their significant advantages in terms of bandwidth, power efficiency and especially speed, optical neuromorphic systems have arisen as interesting alternatives to conventional semiconductor devices. Recently, photonic crystal nanolasers with excitable behaviour were first demonstrated. Depending on the pumping strength, they emit short optical pulses -- spikes -- at various intervals on a nanosecond timescale. In this theoretical work, we show how networks of such photonic spiking neurons can be used for Bayesian inference through sampling from learned probability distributions. We provide a detailed derivation of translation rules from conventional sampling networks such as Boltzmann machines to photonic spiking networks and demonstrate their functionality across a range of generative tasks. Finally, we provide estimates of processing speed and power consumption, for which we expect improvements of several orders of magnitude over current state-of-the-art neuromorphic systems.</description>

      <title>Dichroism of coupled multipolar plasmonic modes in twisted triskelion stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of the optical response to circularly polarized illumination in twisted stacked plasmonic nanostructures. The system consissts in two identical, parallel gold triskelia centrally aligned and rotated at a central angle relative to each other. Sample fabrication was acomplished through a double electron beam lithograpy process. This stack holds two plasmonic modes of multipolar character in the near-infrared range, showing a strong dependence of their excitation intensities on the handedness of the circularly polarized incident light. This translates in a large circular dicrhoism which can be modulated by adjusting the twist angle of the stack. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and numerical simulations were employed to characterize the spectral features of the modes. Remarkable, in contrast to previous results in other stacked nanostructures, the system's response exhibits a behavious analogous to that of two interacting dipoles only at small angles. As the angle approaches 15 degrees, where the maximum dichroism is observed, more complex modes of the stack emerge. These modes evolve towards two in-phase multipolar excitations of the two triskelia as the angle increases uo to 60 degrees. Finally, simulations for a triangular array of such stacked elements show a sharp mode arising from the hybridization of a surface lattice resonance with the low-energy mode of the stack.</description>

      <title>Affine diffractive beam dividers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffractive optical elements that divide an input beam into a set of replicas are used in many optical applications ranging from image processing to communications. Their design requires time-consuming optimization processes, which, for a given number of generated beams, are to be separately treated for one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases because the corresponding optimal efficiencies may be different. After generalizing their Fourier treatment, we prove that, once a particular divider has been designed, its transmission function can be used to generate numberless other dividers through affine transforms that preserve the efficiency of the original element without requiring any further optimization.</description>

      <title>Design of Silicon Slab Waveguides based all-optical Logic Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logic gates are an indispensable part of digital circuits, and therefore such devices with fast operating speeds and simple designs are vital for all kinds of electronic applications. This paper proposes simple Y-shaped designs of all-optical AND, OR, and NOT logic gates in two dimensions that are operational in both TE and TM modes. These gates are designed using silicon slab waveguides, which makes them relatively easy to fabricate. The logic gates are designed, analyzed, and optimized at 1.55 $\mu$m using the finite difference time domain method. The truth table of the proposed all-optical logic gates is realized for every input case. The propagation delay time is determined to be of the order of femtoseconds ($10^{-15}$ s), which is very fast compared to the response time of the currently existing all-optical logic gates ($10^{-9}$ s - $10^{-12}$ s).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining a beam's full trajectory requires tracking both its position and momentum (angular) information. However, the product of position and momentum uncertainty in a simultaneous measurement of the two parameters is bound by the Heisenberg uncertainty limit (HUL). In this work, we present a proof-of-principle demonstration of a quantum-enhanced beam tracking technique, leveraging the inherent position and momentum entanglement between photons produced via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). We show that quantum entanglement can be exploited to achieve a beam tracking accuracy beyond the HUL in a simultaneous measurement. Moreover, with existing detection technologies, it is already possible to achieve near real-time beam tracking capabilities at the single-photon level. The technique also exhibits high resilience to background influences, with negligible reduction in tracking accuracy even when subjected to a disruptive beam that is significantly brighter than SPDC.</description>

      <title>Thermal and dimensional stability of photocatalytic material ZnPS$_3$ under extreme environmental conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zinc phosphorus trisulfide (ZnPS$_3$), a promising material for photocatalysis and energy storage, is shown in this study to exhibit remarkable stability under extreme conditions. We explore its optical and structural properties under high pressure and cryogenic temperatures using photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, Raman scattering, and density functional theory (DFT). Our results identify a pressure-induced phase transition starting at 6.75 GPa and stabilizing by 12.5 GPa, after which ZnPS$_3$ demonstrates robust stability across a broad pressure range of 15 to 100 GPa. DFT calculations predict a semiconductor-to-semimetal transition at 100 GPa, while PL measurements reveal defect-assisted emissions that quench under pressure due to enhanced non-radiative recombination. At cryogenic temperatures, PL quenching intensifies as non-radiative processes dominate, driven by a rising Gr\"uneisen parameter and reduced phonon population. Cryogenic X-ray diffraction (XRD) also reveals a high mean thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) of (4.369 $\pm$ 0.393) $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ K$^{-1}$, among the highest reported for 2D materials. This unique combination of tunable electronic properties under low pressure and high thermal sensitivity makes ZnPS$_3$ a strong candidate for sensing applications in extreme environments.</description>

Abstract: Recent terahertz-pump second-harmonic-generation(SHG)-probe measurements of quantum paraelectrics observed a significant long-lived non-oscillatory SHG component following an ultrafast resonant excitation of the soft mode, which was interpreted as a signature of terahertz-induced transient ferroelectric order. Here we propose a temperature-dependent dynamic model incorporating the hot-phonon effect to simulate the soft-mode behaviors under ultrafast terahertz excitation. Its application to paraelectric KTaO3 produces quantitatively most of the features exhibited in our time-resolved SHG measurements and those in existing literature, including a long-lived non-oscillatory SHG response, SHG oscillations at twice the soft-mode frequency, SHG dampings as well as temperature and field-strength dependencies. We conclude that the observed terahertz-induced non-oscillatory SHG response in quantum paraelectrics is a consequence of the induced nonequilibrium hot-phonon effect, offering an alternative to its existing interpretation as a signature of transient ferroelectric order.</description>

      <title>Estimation-theoretic analysis of lensless imaging</title>

Abstract: We analyze lensless imaging systems with estimation-theoretic techniques based on Fisher information. Our analysis evaluates multiple optical encoder designs on objects with varying sparsity, in the context of both Gaussian and Poisson noise models. Our simulations verify that lensless imaging system performance is object-dependent and highlight tradeoffs between encoder multiplexing and object sparsity, showing quantitatively that sparse objects tolerate higher levels of multiplexing than dense objects. Insights from our analysis promise to inform and improve optical encoder designs for lensless imaging.</description>

      <title>Ultra-narrow linewidth light generation based on an optoelectronic oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02490</link>

Abstract: Narrow-linewidth light sources are essential for both fundamental research and various technological applications, yet they are challenging to generate directly due to instabilities in active laser cavities and the misalignment between closely spaced resonator modes and broad gain bandwidth. In this study, we demonstrate the direct generation of low-noise light from an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO). By minimizing the delay in the optoelectronic link and employing a high-quality optical resonator, a phase-modulation to intensity-modulation (PM-IM) conversion OEO can simultaneously generate both a low-phase-noise optical oscillation that is resilient to phase fluctuations of its pump laser, and a radio frequency (RF) oscillation that captures these fluctuations. We leverage these RF-domain fluctuations to implement a high-performance feedback loop, which stabilizes the pump laser and significantly enhances the performance of the optical oscillation. This approach achieves an outstanding phase noise level of -100 dBc/Hz at a 1 kHz offset and an integrated linewidth as narrow as 0.23 Hz. The integration of optoelectronic oscillation and feedback loop represents a significant advance in generating narrow-linewidth light, paving the way for developments in fields such as coherent optical communications, atomic spectroscopy, metrology, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Impact of polarization mode dispersion on entangled photon distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01754v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in optical fibers poses a major challenge for maintaining the fidelity of quantum states for quantum communications. In this work, a comprehensive model linking the probability of quantum measurement errors (infidelity) to PMD is developed and validated by experimental measurements of differential group delay and quantum bit error rate (QBER). Our research proposes effective methods to mitigate PMD effects for broadband entangled photons and evaluates the impact of higher-order PMD effects. The model provides an experimentally verified framework for the optimization of commercial quantum key distribution systems in deployed fiber optic lines.</description>
