      <title>Radiative corrections of the order $\alpha\,(Z\,\alpha)^6$ for rotational states of two-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytical calculation of the complete $\alpha\,(Z\,\alpha)^6$ one-loop radiative correction to energies of two-body systems with the angular momenta $l&gt;0$, consisting of a pointlike particle and an extended-size nucleus with arbitrary masses and spin 1/2, is presented. The obtained results apply to a wide variety of two-body systems, such as hydrogen, muonium, positronium, and antiprotonic atoms.</description>

      <title>Large-scale quantum reservoir learning with an analog quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning has gained considerable attention as quantum technology advances, presenting a promising approach for efficiently learning complex data patterns. Despite this promise, most contemporary quantum methods require significant resources for variational parameter optimization and face issues with vanishing gradients, leading to experiments that are either limited in scale or lack potential for quantum advantage. To address this, we develop a general-purpose, gradient-free, and scalable quantum reservoir learning algorithm that harnesses the quantum dynamics of neutral-atom analog quantum computers to process data. We experimentally implement the algorithm, achieving competitive performance across various categories of machine learning tasks, including binary and multi-class classification, as well as timeseries prediction. Effective and improving learning is observed with increasing system sizes of up to 108 qubits, demonstrating the largest quantum machine learning experiment to date. We further observe comparative quantum kernel advantage in learning tasks by constructing synthetic datasets based on the geometric differences between generated quantum and classical data kernels. Our findings demonstrate the potential of utilizing classically intractable quantum correlations for effective machine learning. We expect these results to stimulate further extensions to different quantum hardware and machine learning paradigms, including early fault-tolerant hardware and generative machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum coarsening and collective dynamics on a programmable quantum simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the collective quantum dynamics of nonequilibrium many-body systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum science. In particular, dynamics driven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic quantum phases of matter \cite{altman2023quantum}, fundamental high-energy processes \cite{bauer2023highenergy}, quantum metrology \cite{degen2017sensing, li2023scrambling}, and quantum algorithms \cite{ebadi2022quantum}. Here, we use a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally study collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After crossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of correlations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered domains~\cite{Samajdar2024}. By deterministically preparing and following the evolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the curvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with proximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these phenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter, corresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode \cite{pekker2015amplitude}. These observations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in strongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.</description>

      <title>Theoretical studies on multiple ionisation and electron capture processes in heavy ion induced M-shell ionisation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple ionisation and electron capture are found to be vital mechanisms for K and L x-ray emissions along with the direct coulomb ionisation in heavy ion-atom collisions. Naturally, these two mechanisms may also be significant for M x-ray emissions also. However, these mechanisms associating with the M-shell are highly complex and not yet studied convincingly. We, in this work, have discussed about theoretical techniques to study these mechanisms in more general way, which in turn, almost resolved the wide gap between the theories and experiments regarding M-shell prevalent in literature up to a good extent. We have justified this technique with a few representative cases; for example, the silicon and sulphur projectile ions colliding with the gold and bismuth targets at beam energies ranging from 5 to 10 MeV. Here, we see that the capture contribution is much higher than that coming from the multiple ionisation effect. The combined effects of direct coulomb ionisation associated with simultaneous multiple ionisation and electron capture give a better agreement with the measurements up to a good extent.</description>

      <title>Searching for New Fundamental Interactions via Isotopic Shifts in Molecular Lattice Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision measurements with ultracold atoms and molecules are primed to probe beyond-the-Standard Model physics. Isotopologues of homonuclear molecules are a natural testbed for new Yukawa-type mass-dependent forces at nanometer scales, complementing existing mesoscopic-body and neutron scattering experiments. Here we propose using isotopic shift measurements in molecular lattice clocks to constrain these new interactions from new massive scalar particles in keV$/c^2$ range: the new interaction would impart an extra isotopic shift to molecular levels on top of one predicted by the Standard Model. For the strontium dimer, a Hz-level agreement between experiment and theory could constrain the coupling of the new particles to hadrons by up to an order-of-magnitude over the most stringent existing experiments.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Theory for Optical Cooling of a Trapped Atom with Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooling atoms to the ground-state of optical tweezers is becoming increasingly important for high-fidelity imaging, cooling, and molecular assembly. While extensive theoretical work has been conducted on cooling in free space, fewer studies have focused on cooling in bound states. In this work, we present a unified formalism for optical cooling mechanisms in neutral atom tweezers, including resolved and unresolved sideband cooling with different trapping potentials, polarization gradient cooling, gray molasses cooling, $\Lambda$-enhanced gray molasses cooling, and Raman sideband cooling. We perform simulations and demonstrate good agreement with a simplified spin model. We derive and discuss the fundamental limits of each cooling mechanism and propose new strategies for achieving ground-state cooling in optical tweezers. Our findings provide valuable insights into optimizing cooling schemes for neutral atoms in optical tweezers, paving the way for minimizing thermal decoherence in Rydberg and molecular gates and improving efficiencies of molecular assembly.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal spin-relaxation optimization for miniaturized optically pumped magnetometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The microfabrication of cesium vapor cells for optically pumped magnetometry relies on optimization of buffer gas pressure in order to maximize atomic coherence time and sensitivity to external magnetic signals. We demonstrate post-bond nitrogen buffer gas pressure tuning through localized heating of an integrated micro-pill dispenser. We characterize the variation in the intrinsic longitudinal relaxation rate, $\gamma_{10}$, and magnetic sensitivity, as a function of the resulting nitrogen buffer gas pressure. Measurements are conducted through employing an optically pumped magnetometer operating in a free-induction-decay configuration. $\gamma_{10}$ is extracted across a range of nitrogen pressures between $\sim$~60~-~700~Torr, measuring a minimum of 140~Hz at 115~Torr. Additionally, we achieve sensitivities as low as 130 ~fT/$\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at a bias field amplitude of $\sim 50~\mu$T. With the optimal nitrogen buffer gas pressure now quantified and achievable post-fabrication, these mass-producible cells can be tailored to suit a variety of sensing applications, ensuring peak magnetometer performance.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Engineering of collective XYZ spin models in an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation using synthetic quantum systems offers unique opportunities to explore open questions in many-body physics and a path for the generation of useful entangled states. Nevertheless, so far many quantum simulators have been fundamentally limited in the models they can mimic. Here, we are able to realize an all-to-all interaction with arbitrary quadratic Hamiltonian or effectively an infinite range tunable Heisenberg XYZ model. This is accomplished by engineering cavity-mediated four-photon interactions between 700 rubidium atoms in which we harness a pair of momentum states as the effective pseudo spin or qubit degree of freedom. Using this capability we realize for the first time the so-called two-axis counter-twisting model at the mean-field level. The versatility of our platform to include more than two relevant momentum states, combined with the flexibility of the simulated Hamiltonians by adding cavity tones opens rich opportunities for quantum simulation and quantum sensing in matter-wave interferometers and other quantum sensors such as optical clocks and magnetometers</description>

      <title>Fast photon-mediated entanglement of continuously-cooled trapped ions for quantum networking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We entangle two co-trapped atomic barium ion qubits by collecting single visible photons from each ion through in-vacuo 0.8 NA objectives, interfering them through an integrated fiber-beamsplitter and detecting them in coincidence. This projects the qubits into an entangled Bell state with an observed fidelity lower bound of F &gt; 94%. We also introduce an ytterbium ion for sympathetic cooling to remove the need for recooling interruptions and achieve a continuous entanglement rate of 250 1/s.</description>
