      <title>Investigating the 2024 swarm like activity offshore Kefalonia Island aided by Machine Learning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In March 2024, a swarm like seismic activity occurred north of Kefalonia Island, in the central Ionian Islands area. Following a machine-learning aided workflow, we compiled an enhanced seismic catalog of 2495 low to moderate magnitude earthquakes throughout a 2 month period. Spatiotemporal analysis reveals a narrow epicentral distribution of nearly E-W alignment, approximately 5km long, much longer than the length anticipated by common scaling laws for the aftershock area extension of the stronger earthquakes that did not exceed M4.0. The findings of the study indicate that the swarm like activity is possibly triggered by a combination of fluid movements and Coulomb stress changes. The strongest earthquakes appear beyond the diffusivity curves that are within the expected upper crust values and are possibly triggered by stress transfer by the first strong earthquake. Fluid effects rapidly diminish within the first days, while the changes in the stress field due to the combined effect of the two strongest earthquakes promote the triggering of most of the weaker earthquakes of the excitation. The findings of this study reinforce the idea of swarm-like activity initiating due to interactions between stress redistributions and fluid movements in the upper crust. The rapid employment of ML tools for the compilation of robust seismic catalogs can vastly improve our understanding of the processes that drive seismicity in highly productive areas such as the Central Ionian Islands, thus leading to improved seismic hazard assessment.</description>

      <title>Direct Estimation of Earthquake Source Properties from a Single CCTV Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first direct measurement of the slip-rate function during a natural coseismic rupture, recorded during the 28 March 2025, Mw 7.7 Mandalay earthquake (Myanmar). This measurement was made on a video footage of the surface rupture captured by a security camera located only meters away from the fault trace. Using direct image analysis, we measured the relative slip at each time step and deduced the slip rate. Our results show a local slip duration of 1.3 s, and that the surface slip velocity peaked at nearly 3 m/s during the passage of the slip front, with a cumulative slip of approximately 3 m. These findings demonstrate the pulse-like nature of the seismic rupture, at least at the location of the recording. Using analytical rupture models, we obtain the complete mechanical properties of this pulse including the energy release rate.</description>

      <title>Towards Understanding the Benefits of Neural Network Parameterizations in Geophysical Inversions: A Study With Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we employ neural fields, which use neural networks to map a coordinate to the corresponding physical property value at that coordinate, in a test-time learning manner. For a test-time learning method, the weights are learned during the inversion, as compared to traditional approaches which require a network to be trained using a training dataset. Results for synthetic examples in seismic tomography and direct current resistivity inversions are shown first. We then perform a singular value decomposition analysis on the Jacobian of the weights of the neural network (SVD analysis) for both cases to explore the effects of neural networks on the recovered model. The results show that the test-time learning approach can eliminate unwanted artifacts in the recovered subsurface physical property model caused by the sensitivity of the survey and physics. Therefore, NFs-Inv improves the inversion results compared to the conventional inversion in some cases such as the recovery of the dip angle or the prediction of the boundaries of the main target. In the SVD analysis, we observe similar patterns in the left-singular vectors as were observed in some diffusion models, trained in a supervised manner, for generative tasks in computer vision. This observation provides evidence that there is an implicit bias, which is inherent in neural network structures, that is useful in supervised learning and test-time learning models. This implicit bias has the potential to be useful for recovering models in geophysical inversions.</description>
