      <title>Graphs with nonnegative resistance curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces and studies a new class of graphs motivated by discrete curvature. We call a graph resistance nonnegative if there exists a distribution on its spanning trees such that every vertex has expected degree at most two in a random spanning tree; these are precisely the graphs that admit a metric with nonnegative resistance curvature, a discrete curvature introduced by Devriendt and Lambiotte. We show that this class of graphs lies between Hamiltonian and $1$-tough graphs and, surprisingly, that a graph is resistance nonnegative if and only if its twice-dilated matching polytope intersects the interior of its spanning tree polytope. We study further characterizations and basic properties of resistance nonnegative graphs and pose several questions for future research.</description>

      <title>On solving basic equations over the semiring of functional digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Endowing the set of functional graphs (FGs) with the sum (disjoint union of graphs) and product (standard direct product on graphs) operations induces on FGs a structure of a commutative semiring R. The operations on R can be naturally extended to the set of univariate polynomials R[X] over R. This paper provides a polynomial time algorithm for deciding if equations of the type AX=B have solutions when A is just a single cycle and B a set of cycles of identical size. We also prove a similar complexity result for some variants of the previous equation.</description>

      <title>Radio labelling of two-branch trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A radio labelling of a graph $G$ is a mapping $f : V(G) \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2,\ldots\}$ such that $|f(u)-f(v)| \geq diam(G) + 1 - d(u,v)$ for every pair of distinct vertices $u,v$ of $G$, where $diam(G)$ is the diameter of $G$ and $d(u,v)$ is the distance between $u$ and $v$ in $G$. The radio number $rn(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that $G$ admits a radio labelling $f$ with $\max\{f(v):v \in V(G)\} = k$. The weight of a tree $T$ from a vertex $v \in V(T)$ is the sum of the distances in $T$ from $v$ to all other vertices, and a vertex of $T$ achieving the minimum weight is called a weight center of $T$. It is known that any tree has one or two weight centers. A tree is called a two-branch tree if the removal of all its weight centers results in a forest with exactly two components. In this paper we obtain a sharp lower bound for the radio number of two-branch trees which improves a known lower bound for general trees. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition for this improved lower bound to be achieved. Using these results, we determine the radio number of two families of level-wise regular two-branch trees.</description>

      <title>An Enumerative Perspective on Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connectivity (or equivalently, unweighted maximum flow) is an important measure in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. Given a graph $G$ with vertices $s$ and $t$, the connectivity $\lambda(s,t)$ from $s$ to $t$ is defined to be the maximum number of edge-disjoint paths from $s$ to $t$ in $G$.
  Much research has gone into designing fast algorithms for computing connectivities in graphs. Previous work showed that it is possible to compute connectivities for all pairs of vertices in directed graphs with $m$ edges in $\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ time [Chueng, Lau, and Leung, FOCS 2011], where $\omega \in [2,2.3716)$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication. For the related problem of computing "small connectivities," it was recently shown that for any positive integer $k$, we can compute $\min(k,\lambda(s,t))$ for all pairs of vertices $(s,t)$ in a directed graph with $n$ nodes in $\tilde{O}((kn)^\omega)$ time [Akmal and Jin, ICALP 2023].
  In this paper, we present an alternate exposition of these $\tilde{O}(m^\omega)$ and $\tilde{O}((kn)^\omega)$ time algorithms, with simpler proofs of correctness. Earlier proofs were somewhat indirect, introducing an elegant but ad hoc "flow vector framework" for showing correctness of these algorithms. In contrast, we observe that these algorithms for computing exact and small connectivity values can be interpreted as testing whether certain generating functions enumerating families of edge-disjoint paths are nonzero. This new perspective yields more transparent proofs, and ties the approach for these problems more closely to the literature surrounding algebraic graph algorithms.</description>
