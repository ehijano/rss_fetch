      <title>Scaled packing pressures on subsets for amenable group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the properties of the scaled packing topological pressures for topological dynamical system $(X,G)$, where $G$ is a countable discrete infinite amenable group. We show that the scaled packing topological pressures can be determined by the scaled Bowen topological pressures. We obtain Billingsley's Theorem for the scaled packing pressures with a $G$-action. Then we get a variational principle between the scaled packing pressures and the scaled measure-theoretic upper local pressures. Finally, we give some restrictions on the scaled sequence $\mathbf{b}$, then in the case of the set $X_{\mu}$ of generic points, we prove that
  $$P^{P}(X_{\mu},\left\{F_{n}\right\},f,\mathbf{b})=h_{\mu}(X)+\int_{X} f \mathrm{d}\mu,$$
  if $\left\{F_{n}\right\}$ is tempered and $\mu$ is a $G$-invariant ergodic Borel probability measure.</description>

      <title>H\"older estimates and uniformity in arithmetic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we study common preperiodic points of rational maps of the Riemann Sphere. We show that given any degrees $d_1,d_2\geq2$, outside a Zariski closed subset of the space of pairs of rational maps $(f,g)$ of degree $d_1$ and $d_2$ respectively, the maps $f$ and $g$ share at most a uniformly bounded number of common preperiodic points. This generalizes a result of DeMarco and Mavraki to maps of possibly different degrees. Our main contribution is the use of H\"older properties of the Green function of a rational map to obtain height estimates.</description>

      <title>A model of information propagation in transportation networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new macroscopic perspective for simulating transportation networks. The idea is to look at the network as connected nodes. Each node sends an information package to its neighbors. Basically, the information package contains a state change that a specific node experienced, and it might affect the traffic network state in the future. Different types of information can be counted in transportation network. Each information type has different characteristics. It propagates through the network and interacts with other IPs and nodes. As a result, the model enables implementing and analyzing dynamic and inconvenient control strategies. This paper focus on flow dynamics and demand routing information under complex environment. The flow dynamics flows the LWR theory along the links. The demand routing follows a node equilibrium model. The node model takes into account the users preferences and choices under dynamic control agents such as dynamic tolling and sends the needed information for other facilities to operate. A DNL model is developed based on the IPM. Several case studies demonstrate the use IPM and its potential to provide a reliable and results for real world complicated transportation applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}(n)$ be the maximum number of limit cycles that a planar polynomial vector field of degree $n$ can have. In this paper we prove that $\mathcal{H}(n)$ is realizable by structurally stable vector fields with only hyperbolic limit cycles and that it is a strictly increasing function whenever it is finite.</description>

      <title>Mean Hausdorff Dimension of Some Infinite Dimensional Fractals for Amenable Group Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the calculation of the mean Hausdorff dimension of some infinite dimensional fractal systems for the countable discrete amenable group actions. We mainly consider the self-similar systems, homogeneous systems in the infinite-dimensional torus and infinite-dimensional carpets, which generalizes [23] from actions of a single transformation to amenable group actions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In connection with the results of Tim Austin, and Wen Huang, Song Shao, Xiangdong Ye we present the following assertion: there are infinite automorphisms $S,T$, some set $A$ of positive finite measure and a sequence $N_m$ with $|N_{m+1}|/|N_m|\ \to\infty$ such that $T^iA\cap S^iA=\phi$ for $i\in [N_{4k}, N_{4k+1}]$ and $T^iA=S^iA$ for $i\in [N_{4k+2}, N_{2k+3}]$. For the corresponding deterministic Gaussian and Poisson suspensions $S_\circ,T_\circ$ over $S,T$ for some $f\in L_\infty$ there is not a limit of $ \frac 1 N \sum_{n=1}^N T_\circ^nf\,S_\circ^nf$ in $ L_2$.</description>

      <title>A Formal Analysis of Iterated TDD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we formally analyze the software methodology called (iterated) Test Driven Development (TDD). We formally define Specification, Software, Testing, Equivalence Partitions, Coupling, to argue about the nature of the software development in terms of TDD. We formalize Iterative TDD and find a context in which iterated TDD ``provably produce'' ``provably correct code'' from ``specifications'' while being stable in terms of iterated code churns. We demonstrate that outside this context iterated TDD will exhibit chaotic behavior, implying unpredictable messy amount of code churn. We argue that the research finding of ``ineffective'' iterated TDD found by earlier researches are due to missing this context, while the findings of ``effective'' iterated TDD is due to accidentally falling into the context or simply placebo.</description>

      <title>Clustering Time-Evolving Networks Using the Dynamic Graph Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-evolving graphs arise frequently when modeling complex dynamical systems such as social networks, traffic flow, and biological processes. Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the dynamic graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the dynamic graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</description>

      <title>A non-intrusive data-based reformulation of a hybrid projection-based model reduction method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel data-driven reformulation of the iterative SVD-rational Krylov algorithm (ISRK), in its original formulation a Petrov-Galerkin (two-sided) projection-based iterative method for model reduction combining rational Krylov subspaces (on one side) with Gramian/SVD based subspaces (on the other side). We show that in each step of ISRK, we do not necessarily require access to the original system matrices, but only to input/output data in the form of the system's transfer function, evaluated at particular values (frequencies). Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of the new data-driven formulation.</description>

      <title>The integration problem for principal connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the Integration Problem for principal connections. Just as a principal connection on a principal bundle $\phi:Q\rightarrow M$ may be used to split $TQ$ into horizontal and vertical subbundles, a discrete connection may be used to split $Q\times Q$ into horizontal and vertical submanifolds. All discrete connections induce a connection on the same principal bundle via a process known as the Lie or derivative functor. The Integration Problem consists of describing, for a principal connection $\mathcal{A}$, the set of all discrete connections whose associated connection is $\mathcal{A}$. Our first result is that for \emph{flat} principal connections, the Integration Problem has a unique solution among the \emph{flat} discrete connections. More broadly, under a fairly mild condition on the structure group $G$ of the principal bundle $\phi$, we prove that the existence part of the Integration Problem has a solution that needs not be unique. Last, we see that, when $G$ is abelian, given compatible continuous and discrete curvatures the Integration Problem has a unique solution constrained by those curvatures.</description>

      <title>Experimental Results on Potential Markov Partitions for Wang Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we discuss potential Markov partitions for three different Wang tile protosets. The first partition is for the order-24 aperiodic Wang tile protoset that was recently shown in the Ph.D. thesis of H. Jang to encode all tilings by the Penrose rhombs. The second is a partition for an order-16 aperiodic Wang protoset that encodes all tilings by the Ammann A2 aperiodic protoset. The third partition is for an order-11 Wang tile protoset identified by Jeandel and Rao as a candidate order-11 aperiodic Wang tile protoset. The emphasis is on some experimental methodology to generate potential Markov partitions that encode tilings. We also apply some of the theory developed by Labb\'{e} in analyzing such an experimentally discovered partition.</description>

      <title>Higher order interactions lead to "reluctant" synchrony breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To model dynamical systems on networks with higher order (non-pairwise) interactions, we recently introduced a new class of ODEs on hypernetworks. Here we consider one-parameter synchrony breaking bifurcations in such ODEs. We call a synchrony breaking steady state branch ``reluctant'' if it is tangent to a synchrony space, but does not lie inside it. We prove that reluctant synchrony breaking is ubiquitous in hypernetwork systems, by constructing a large class of examples that support it. We also give an explicit formula for the order of tangency to the synchrony space of a reluctant steady state branch.</description>

      <title>On the Exact Linearization of Minimally Underactuated Configuration Flat Lagrangian Systems in Generalized State Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the exact linearization of configuration flat Lagrangian control systems in generalized state representation with p degrees of freedom and p-1 control inputs by quasi-static feedback of its generalized state. We formally introduce generalized Lagrangian control systems, which are obtained when configuration variables are considered as inputs instead of forces. This work presents all possible lengths of integrator chains achieved by an exact linearization with a quasi-static feedback law of the generalized state that allows for rest-to-rest transitions. We show that such feedback laws can be systematically derived without using Brunovsk\'y states.</description>

      <title>Geometry and Local Recovery of Global Minima of Two-layer Neural Networks at Overparameterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Under mild assumptions, we investigate the geometry of the loss landscape for two-layer neural networks in the vicinity of global minima. Utilizing novel techniques, we demonstrate: (i) how global minima with zero generalization error become geometrically separated from other global minima as the sample size grows; and (ii) the local convergence properties and rate of gradient flow dynamics. Our results indicate that two-layer neural networks can be locally recovered in the regime of overparameterization.</description>

      <title>Regularity of invariant densities for random switching between two linear odes in Rd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a paper entitled singularities of invariant densities for random switching between two linear odes in 2D, Bakhtin et al [5], consider a Markov process obtained by random switching between two stable linear vector fields in the plane and characterize the singularities of the invariant density in terms of the switching and contraction rates. This paper considers a generalization of this model obtained by random switching between two stable linear vector fields in Rd and provides sufficient conditions ensuring that the invariant distribution is absolutely continuous and has a Cr density. In dimension greater than 3 it provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully non-elliptic example of random switching for which quantitative conditions guaranteeing smoothness of the invariant density can be proved.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal Homeostasis in Mass-Action Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Homeostasis occurs in a biological system when a chosen output variable remains approximately constant despite changes in an input variable. In this work we specifically focus on biological systems which may be represented as chemical reaction networks and consider their infinitesimal homeostasis, where the derivative of the input-output function is zero. The specific challenge of chemical reaction networks is that they often obey various conservation laws complicating the standard input-output analysis. We derive several results that allow to verify the existence of infinitesimal homeostasis points both in the absence of conservation and under conservation laws where conserved quantities serve as input parameters. In particular, we introduce the notion of infinitesimal concentration robustness, where the output variable remains nearly constant despite fluctuations in the conserved quantities. We provide several examples of chemical networks which illustrate our results both in deterministic and stochastic settings.</description>
