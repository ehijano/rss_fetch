      <title>Phase-field modelling of cohesive fracture. Part III: From mathematical results to engineering application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concludes a three-part effort aimed at developing a consistent and unified framework for the phase-field modeling of cohesive fracture. Building on the theoretical foundations established in the first two parts, which included a $\Gamma$-convergence result for a broad class of phase-field energy functionals and the presentation of a rigorous analytical methodology for constructing models tailored to specific cohesive laws, this third paper explores the mechanical response of phase-field models, most of which are novel, associated with different cohesive fracture behaviors within a one-dimensional framework. Particular emphasis is placed on the possibility of formulating distinct phase-field models that, despite exhibiting different evolutions of their phase-field and displacement profiles, yield identical cohesive fracture responses. Thus, this work aims at providing a practical interpretation of the mathematical framework connecting the theoretical insights established in the previous parts for physical relevant applications.</description>

      <title>Estimates for harmonic functions near pseudo-corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that derivatives of solutions to elliptic boundary value problems may become unbounded near the corner of a domain with a conical singularity, even if the data are smooth. When the corner domain is approximated by more regular domains, then higher order Sobolev norms of the solutions on these domains can blow up in the limit. We study this blow-up in the simple example of the Laplace operator with Dirichlet conditions in two situations: The rounding of a corner in any dimension, and the two-dimensional situation where a polygonal corner is replaced by two or more corners with smaller angles. We show how an inner expansion derived from a more general recent result on converging expansions into generalized power series can be employed to prove simple and explicit estimations for Sobolev norms and singularity coefficients by powers of the approximation scale.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the fractional Yamabe flow for arbitrary initial energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the seminal paper of Graham and Zworski (Invent. Math. 2003), conformal geometric problems are studied in the fractional setting. We consider the convergence of fractional Yamabe flow, which is previously known under small initial energy assumption. Inspired by the deep work of Brendle (J. Diff. Geom. 2005), we obtain the full convergence result for arbitrary initial energy, whenever the (fractional) positive mass conjecture is valid.</description>

      <title>On the Kneser property of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the connectedness and compactness of the attainability set of weak solutions to the three-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations with damping. Depending on the value of the parameter \b{eta}, which controls the damping term, we establish these results with respect to either the weak or the strong topology of the phase space. In the latter case, we also prove that the global attractor is connected. Additionally, we establish results concerning the regularity of the global attractor and provide a new proof of its existence for strong solutions.</description>

      <title>Radial solutions of truncated Laplacian equations in punctured balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider equations involving the truncated laplacians and having lower order terms with singular potentials posed in punctured balls. We study both the principal eigenvalue problem and the problem of classification of solutions, in dependence of their asymptotic behaviour near the origin, for equations having also superlinear absorbing lower order terms. In the case of the maximising truncated Laplacian "Pk+", owing to the mild degeneracy of the operator, we obtain results which are analogous to the results for the Laplacian in dimension k. On the other hand, for minimising operator "Pk-" we show that the strong degeneracy in ellipticity of the operator produces radically different results.</description>

      <title>Positive solutions to fractional $p$-Laplacian Choquard equation on lattice graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the fractional $p$-Laplacian Choquard equation $$ (-\Delta)_{p}^{s} u+h(x)|u|^{p-2} u=\left(R_{\alpha} *F(u)\right)f(u) $$ on lattice graphs $\mathbb{Z}^d$, where $s\in(0,1)$, $ p\geq 2$, $\alpha \in(0, d)$ and $R_\alpha$ represents the Green's function of the discrete fractional Laplacian that behaves as the Riesz potential. Under suitable assumptions on the potential function $h$, we first prove the existence of a strictly positive solution by the mountain-pass theorem for the nonlinearity $f$ satisfying some growth conditions. Moreover, if we add some monotonicity condition, we establish the existence of a positive ground state solution by the method of Nehari manifold.</description>

      <title>Regularity Properties of Solutions of a Model for Morphoelastic Growth in the Presence of Nutrients in One Spatial Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regularity properties of solutions for a class of quasi-stationary models in one spatial dimension for stress-modulated growth in the presence of a nutrient field are proven. At a given point in time the configuration of a body after pure growth is determined by means of a family of ordinary differential equations in every point in space. Subsequently, an elastic deformation, which is given by the minimizer of a hyperelastic variational integral, is applied in order to restore Dirichlet boundary conditions. While the ordinary differential equations governing the growth process depend on the elastic stress and the pullback of a nutrient concentration in the current configuration, the hyperelastic variational problem is solved on the intermediate configuration after pure growth. Additionally, the coefficients of the reaction-diffusion equation determining the nutrient concentration in the current configuration depend on the elastic deformation and the deformation due to pure growth.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study solutions $u$ of parabolic systems in divergence form with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions in the upper-half cylinder $Q_1^+\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, where the coefficients are weighted by $x_n^\alpha$, $\alpha\in(-\infty,1)$. We establish higher-order boundary Schauder type estimates of $x_n^\alpha u$ under the assumption that the coefficients have partially Dini mean oscillation. As an application, we also achieve higher-order boundary Harnack principles for degenerate or singular equations with H\"older continuous coefficients.</description>

      <title>Inverse spectral problems with sparse data and applications to passive imaging on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by inverse problems with a single passive measurement, we introduce and analyze a new class of inverse spectral problems on closed Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, we establish two general uniqueness results for the recovery of a potential in the stationary Schr\"odinger operator from partial spectral data, which consists of a possibly sparse subset of its eigenvalues and the restrictions of the corresponding eigenfunctions to a nonempty open subset of the manifold. Crucially, the eigenfunctions are not assumed to be orthogonal, and no information about global norming constants is required.
  The partial data formulation of our inverse spectral problems is naturally suited to the analysis of inverse problems with passive measurements, where only limited observational access to the solution is available. Leveraging this structure, we establish generic uniqueness results for a broad class of evolutionary PDEs, in which both the coefficients and the initial or source data are to be recovered from knowledge of the solution restricted to a subset of spacetime. These results introduce a spectral framework for passive imaging and extend inverse spectral theory into a regime characterized by highly incomplete, yet physically realistic, data.</description>

      <title>On some typicality and density results for nonsmooth vector fields and the associated ODE and continuity equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes address two problems. First, we investigate the question of ``how many'' are (in Baire sense) vector fields in $L^1_t L^q_x$, $q \in [1, \infty)$, for which existence and/or uniqueness of local, distributional solutions to the associated continuity equation holds. We show that, in certain regimes, existence of solutions (even locally in time, for at least one nonzero initial datum) is a meager property, whereas, on the contrary, uniqueness of solutions is a generic property. Secondly, despite the fact that non-uniqueness is a meager property, we prove that (Sobolev) counterexamples to uniqueness, both for the continuity equation and for the ODE, in the spirit of [Bru\`e, Colombo, Kumar 2024] and [Kumar 2024] respectively, form a dense subset of the natural ambient space they live in.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the rate of propagation of chaos for a McKea--Vlasov equation with conditional expectation terms in the drift. We use a (regularized) Nadaraya-Watson estimator at a particle level to approximate the conditional expectations; we then combine relative entropy methods in the spirit of Jabin and Wang (2018) with information theoretic inequalities to obtain the result. The nonparametric nature of the problem requires higher regularity for the density of the McKean-Vlasov limit, which we obtain with a bootstrap argument and energy estimates.</description>

      <title>Pulsatile Flows for Simplified Smart Fluids with Variable Power-Law: Analysis and Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fully-developed, time-periodic motion of a shear-dependent non-Newtonian fluid with variable exponent rheology through an infinite pipe $\Omega:= \mathbb{R}\times \Sigma\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $d\in \{2,3\}$, of arbitrary cross-section $\Sigma\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d-1}$. The focus is on a generalized $p(\cdot)$-fluid model, where the power-law index is position-dependent (with respect to $\Sigma$), $\textit{i.e.}$, a function $p\colon \Sigma\to (1,+\infty)$. We prove the existence of time-periodic solutions with either assigned time-periodic flow-rate or pressure-drop, generalizing known results for the Navier-Stokes and for $p$-fluid equations.
  In addition, we identify explicit solutions, relevant as benchmark cases, especially for electro-rheological fluids or, more generally, $\textit{`smart fluids'}$. To support practical applications, we present a fully-constructive existence proof for variational solutions by means of a fully-discrete finite-differences/-elements discretization, consistent with our numerical experiments. Our approach, which unifies the treatment of all values of $p(\overline{x})\in (1,+\infty)$, $\overline{x}\in \Sigma$, without requiring an auxiliary Newtonian term, provides new insights even in the constant exponent case. The theoretical findings are reviewed by means of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Helmholtz boundary integral methods and the pollution effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with solving the Helmholtz exterior Dirichlet and Neumann problems with large wavenumber $k$ and smooth obstacles using the standard second-kind boundary integral equations (BIEs) for these problems. We consider Galerkin and collocation methods - with subspaces consisting of $\textit{either}$ piecewise polynomials (in 2-d for collocation, in any dimension for Galerkin) $\textit{or}$ trigonometric polynomials (in 2-d) - as well as a fully discrete quadrature (a.k.a., Nystr\"om) method based on trigonometric polynomials (in 2-d).
  For each of these methods, we address the fundamental question: how quickly must $N$, the dimension of the approximation space, grow with $k$ to maintain accuracy as $k\to\infty$? For the methods involving piecewise-polynomials, we give sufficient conditions for $k$-uniform quasi-optimality. For the Galerkin method we prove that these are, in fact, necessary and sufficient. In particular, we prove that, when applied to the Neumann BIEs when the obstacle is a ball, the Galerkin method $\textit{suffers from the pollution effect}$; i.e., $N$ growing like $k^{d-1}$ is not sufficient for $k$-uniform quasi-optimality. For the Dirichlet BIEs, we prove that pollution occurs for the ball for certain choices of coupling parameter, and we give numerical experiments illustrating pollution for trapping domains with the standard coupling parameter. For all the methods involving trigonometric polynomials, we show that, up to potential factors of $k^\varepsilon$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, these methods do not suffer from the pollution effect (even for trapping obstacles).
  These are the first results about $k$-explicit convergence of collocation or Nystr\"om methods applied to the Dirichlet BIEs, and the first results about $k$-explicit convergence of any method used to solve the standard second-kind Neumann BIEs.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of mean-field models on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a mean-field model of $n$ interacting particles whose state space is the unit circle, a generalization of the classical Kuramoto model. Global synchronization is said to occur if after starting from almost any initial state, all particles coalesce to a common point on the circle. We propose a general synchronization criterion in terms of $L_1$-norm of the third derivative of the particle interaction function. As an application we resolve a conjecture for the so-called self-attention dynamics (stylized model of transformers), by showing synchronization for all $\beta \ge -0.16$, which significantly extends the previous bound of $0\le \beta \le 1$ from Criscitiello, Rebjock, McRae, and Boumal (2024). We also show that global synchronization does not occur when $\beta &lt; -2/3$.</description>

      <title>On the stability of symmetric flows in a two-dimensional channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stability of symmetric flows in a two-dimensional
  channel (including the Poiseuille flow). In 2015 Grenier, Guo, and
  Nguyen have established instability of these flows in a particular
  region of the parameter space, affirming formal asymptotics results
  from the 1940's. We prove that these flows are stable outside this
  region in parameter space. More precisely we show that the
  Orr-Sommerfeld operator
  $$ {\mathcal B} =\Big(-\frac{d^2}{dx^2}+i\beta(U+i\lambda)\Big)\Big(\frac{d^2}{dx^2}-\alpha^2\Big) -i\beta U^{\prime\prime}\,, $$
  which is defined on $$
  D({\mathcal B})=\{u\in H^4(0,1)\,,\, u^\prime(0)=u^{(3)}(0)=0 \mbox{ and }\, u(1)=u^\prime(1)=0\}. $$ is bounded on the half-plane $\Re \lambda \geq 0$ for $\alpha \gg \beta^{-1/10}$ or $\alpha \ll \beta^{-1/6}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15179v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by a classical identity proved by James Simons, we establish a new geometric formula in a nonlocal, possibly fractional, setting.
  Our formula also recovers the classical case in the limit, thus providing an approach to Simons' work that does not heavily rely on differential geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We look for traveling wave solutions to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a subsonic speed, covering several physical models with Sobolev subcritical nonlinear effects. Our approach is based on a variant of Sobolev-type inequality involving the momentum and we show the existence of its minimizers solving the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Construction of blow-up solutions for the focusing energy-critical nonlinear wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^4$ and $\mathbb{R}^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct solutions $u(x,t)$ to the focusing, energy-critical, nonlinear wave equation \begin{equation} \partial_{tt}u - \Delta u - |u|^{p-1}u = 0, \quad t \geq 0, \ x \in \mathbb{R}^d, \ d \geq 3, \ p = (d+2)/(d-2) \end{equation} in dimension $d \in \{4,5\}$, exhibiting finite-time Type II blow-up precisely at $x = t = 0$ with a prescribed polynomial blow-up rate of $t^{-1-\nu}$, where $\nu &gt; 1$ for $d = 4$ and $\nu &gt; 3$ for $d = 5$. Such solutions have been constructed by Krieger-Schlag-Tataru for $d = 3$ and by Jendrej for $d = 5$. The work of Jendrej includes the extremal case $\nu = 3$, which our method does not address, and the regime $\nu &gt; 8$. The major difference between dimensions $4$ and $5$ consists in the renormalization procedure. In $d = 4$, we essentially follow the Krieger-Schlag-Tataru scheme developed for the 3-dimensional equation. This scheme has been applied with success for other equations such as the 3D-critical NLS, Schr\"odinger maps or wave maps. In all of these cases, the polynomial structure of the nonlinearity permits the use of simple algebraic manipulations to control error terms. By contrast, the case $d = 5$ requires a modified setup due to the lower regularity of the nonlinearity, which complicates the treatment of nonlinear error terms.</description>

      <title>Global self-similar solutions for the 3D Muskat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of global self-similar solutions to the 3D Muskat equation when the two fluids have the same viscosity but different densities. These self-similar solutions are globally defined in both space and time, with exact cones as their initial data. Furthermore we estimate the difference between our self-similar solutions and solutions of the linearized equation around the flat interface in terms of critical spaces and some weighted $\dot{W}^{k,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ spaces for $k=1,2$. The main ingredients of the proof are new estimates in the sense of $\dot{H}^{s_1}(\mathbb{R}^2) \cap \dot{H}^{s_2}(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with $3/2&lt;s_1&lt;2&lt;s_2&lt;3$, which is continuously embedded in critical spaces for the 3D Muskat problem: $\dot{H}^2(\mathbb{R}^2)$ and $\dot{W}^{1,\infty}(\mathbb{R}^2)$.</description>

      <title>Fractional $p$-Laplace systems with critical Hardy nonlinearities: Existence and Multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a bounded open set containing zero, $s \in (0,1)$ and $p \in (1, \infty)$. In this paper, we first deal with the existence, non-existence and some properties of ground-state solutions for the following class of fractional $p$-Laplace systems \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;(-\Delta_p)^s u= \frac{\alpha}{q} \frac{|u|^{\alpha-2}u|v|^{\beta}}{|x|^m} \;\;\text{in}\;\Omega,\\ &amp;(-\Delta_p)^s v= \frac{\beta}{q} \frac{|v|^{\beta-2}v|u|^{\alpha}}{|x|^m}\;\;\text{in}\;\Omega,\\ &amp;u=v=0\, \mbox{ in }\mathbb{R}^d\setminus \Omega, \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} where $d&gt;sp$, $\alpha + \beta = q$ where $p \leq q \leq p_{s}^{*}(m)$ where $p_{s}^{*}(m) = \frac{p(d-m)}{d-sp}$ with $0 \leq m \le sp$. Additionally, we establish a concentration-compactness principle related to this homogeneous system of equations. Next, the main objective of this paper is to study the following non-homogenous system of equations \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{aligned} &amp;(-\Delta_p)^s u = \eta |u|^{r-2}u + \gamma \frac{\alpha}{p_{s}^{*}(m)} \frac{|u|^{\alpha-2}u|v|^{\beta}}{|x|^m} \;\;\text{in}\;\Omega,\\ &amp;(-\Delta_p)^s v = \eta |v|^{r-2}v + \gamma \frac{\beta}{p^{*}_{s}(m)} \frac{|v|^{\beta-2}v|u|^{\alpha}}{|x|^m}\;\;\text{in}\;\Omega,\\ &amp;u=v=0\, \mbox{ in }\mathbb{R}^d\setminus \Omega, \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} where $\eta, \gamma &gt; 0$ are parameters and $p \leq r &lt; p_{s}^{*}(0)$. Depending on the values of $\eta, \gamma$, we obtain the existence of a non semi-trivial solution with the least energy. Further, for $m=0$, we establish that the above problem admits at least $\text{cat}_{\Omega}({\Omega})$ nontrivial solutions.</description>

      <title>Three solutions for a double phase variable exponent Kirchhoff problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study a double-phase variable-exponent Kirchhoff problem and show the existence of at least three solutions. The proposed model, as a generalization of the Kirchhoff equation, is interesting since it is driven by a double-phase operator that governs anisotropic and heterogeneous diffusion associated with the energy functional, as well as encapsulating two different types of elliptic behavior within the same framework. To tackle the problem, we obtain regularity results for the corresponding energy functional, which makes the problem suitable for the application of a well-known critical point result by Bonanno and Marano. We introduce an $n$-dimensional vector inequality, not covered in the literature, which provides a key auxiliary tool for establishing essential regularity properties of the energy functional such as $C^1$-smoothness, the $(S_+)$-condition, and sequential weak lower semicontinuity.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions for the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we find normalized solutions to the following Schr\"{o}dinger equation \begin{equation}\notag \begin{aligned} &amp;-\Delta u-\frac{\mu}{|x|^2}h(x)u+\lambda u =f(u)\quad\text{in}\quad\mathbb{R}^{N},\\ &amp; u&gt;0,\quad \int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}u^2dx=a^2, \end{aligned} \end{equation} where $N\geq3$, $a&gt;0$ is fixed, $f$ satisfies mass-subcritical growth conditions and $h$ is a given bounded function with $||h||_\infty\le 1$. The $L^2(\mathbb{R}^N)$-norm of $u$ is fixed and $\lambda$ appears as a Lagrange multiplier. Our solutions are constructed by minimizing the corresponding energy functional on a suitable constraint. Due to the presence of a possibly nonradial term $h$, establishing compactness becomes challenging. To address this difficulty, we employ the splitting lemma to exclude both the vanishing and the dichotomy of a given any minimizing sequence for appropriate $a &gt; 0$.
  Furthermore, we show that if $h$ is radial, then radial solutions can be obtained for any $a&gt;0$. In this case, the radial symmetry allows us to prove that such solutions converge to a ground state solution of the limit problem as $\mu \to 0^+$.</description>

      <title>Exponentially mixing flows with slow enhanced dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a passive scalar which is advected by an incompressible flow $u$ and has small molecular diffusivity $\kappa$. Previous results show that if $u$ is exponentially mixing and $C^1$, then the dissipation time is $O(|\log \kappa|^2)$. We produce a family of incompressible flows which are $C^0$ and exponentially mixing, uniformly in $\kappa$; however have a dissipation time of order $1/\kappa$ (i.e. exhibits no enhanced dissipation). We also estimate the dissipation time of mixing flows, and obtain improved bounds in terms of the mixing rate with explicit constants, and allow for a time inhomogeneous mixing rate which is typical for random constructions of mixing flows.</description>
