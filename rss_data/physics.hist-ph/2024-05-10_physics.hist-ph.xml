      <title>Ising's roots and the transfer-matrix eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, the Ising model is an archetype describing collective ordering processes. And, as such, it is widely known in physics and far beyond. Less known is the fact that the thesis defended by Ernst Ising 100 years ago (in 1924) contained not only the solution of what we call now the `classical 1D Ising model' but also other problems. Some of these problems, as well as the method of their solution, are the subject of this note. In particular, we discuss the combinatorial method Ernst Ising used to calculate the partition function for a chain of elementary magnets. In the thermodynamic limit, this method leads to the result that the partition function is given by the roots of a certain polynomial. We explicitly show that `Ising's roots' that arise within the combinatorial treatment are also recovered by the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix, a concept that was introduced much later. Moreover, we discuss the generalization of the two-state model to a three-state one presented in Ising's thesis, but not included in his famous paper of 1925 ( \i E. Ising, Z. Physik {\bf 31} (1925) 253}). The latter model can be considered as a forerunner of the now abundant models with many-component order parameters.</description>

      <title>Everything is Entangled in Quantum Mechanics: Are the Orthodox Measures Physically Meaningful?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even though quantum entanglement is today's most essential concept within the new technological era of quantum information processing, we do not only lack a consistent definition of this kernel notion, we are also far from understanding its physical meaning [35]. These failures have lead to many problems when attempting to provide a consistent measure or quantification of entanglement. In fact, the two main lines of contemporary research within the orthodox literature have created mazes where inconsistencies and problems are found everywhere. While the operational-instrumentalist approach has failed to explain how inequalities are able to distinguish the classical from the quantum, the geometrical approach has failed to provide a consistent meaningful account of their entropic measure. Taking distance from orthodoxy, in this work we address the quantification and measure of quantum entanglement by considering a recently presented objective-invariant definition in terms of the coding of intensive relations [21] which allows to escape the widespread relativist account of bases and factorizations [24, 25]. Going beyond the orthodox dualistic reference to "quantum particles" and "clicks" in detectors, we will argue that this new line of research is capable not only to evade the many open problems which appear within the mainstream literature, but is also able to present a consistent and coherent physical understanding of entanglement. The main conclusion of this work is that in quantum mechanics --contrary to what is generally presupposed-- all operational expressions found within the laboratory are intrinsically entangled.</description>
