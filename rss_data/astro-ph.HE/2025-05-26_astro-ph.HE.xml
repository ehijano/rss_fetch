      <title>Super-SNID : an expanded set of SNID classes and templates for the new era of wide-field surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an expanded template library for the supernova identification (SNID) software, along with updated source files that make it easy to merge our templates - and other major SNID libraries - into the base code. This expansion, dubbed 'Super-SNID', increases the number of spectra for under-represented supernova classes (e.g., SNe Ia-02cx, Ibn) and adds new classes (e.g., SLSNe, TDEs, LFBOTs). Super-SNID includes 841 spectral templates for 161 objects, primarily from the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of Transient Objects (PESSTO) Data Releases 1-4. The library is available on GitHub with simple installation instructions.</description>

      <title>New estimates of the spin and accretion rate of the black hole M87*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use the imaging results of M87* from the EHT to calculate the rotational velocity of the inner edge of the accretion disk and find a value of $\sim$0.14c. We then calculate the dimensionless spin parameter, $a$, of the black hole, obtaining a value of $a \sim 0.8$. We deduce that this is probably a lower limit. We go on to use the results of the EHT polarization study of the magnetic field direction in the accretion disk of M87* as a proxy for the direction of motion of the spiralling accreting matter in this highly ionized disk. This direction is defined by the vector sum of the tangential rotation velocity and the inward radial accretion velocity. We thus calculate the accretion velocity to be $\sim$ (7 $\pm$ 0.7) $\times$ $10^7$~ms$^{-1}$. We go on to estimate a range of values for the accretion rate from the inner disk to be $\sim$4 $\times$ 10$^{{-5}}$ to $\sim$4 $\times$ 10$^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$, and a range of values for the accretion power to be $\sim$10$^{34}$ to 10$^{38}$ J/s. This is the same range as the power of the jet, making it consistent with accretion-driven jet models.</description>

      <title>Luminosity function of Type II GRBs:differences from long GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally categorized into long and short bursts based on their duration ($T_{90}$). Recently, it has been proposed that GRBs can also be classified into type I (merger) and type II (collapsar) bursts based on the different origin. From a sample of \textit{Swift} long GRBs~(LGRBs) with a redshift completeness of 60\% and $P \geq 2.6 \, \text{ph} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$, collected through the end of 2023, we identify a pure sample of 146 Type II GRBs. With this sample, we construct the luminosity function (LF) using both the Broken Power Law (BPL) and Triple Power Law (TPL) models. Our results indicate that, similar to LGRBs, a strong redshift evolution in either luminosity or density is necessary to accurately account for the observations, regardless of the specific form of the LF assumed. The LF of LGRBs remains a topic of debate, with some studies suggesting it follows a BPL form, while others advocate for a TPL form. In our study, we find that the LF of Type II GRBs tends to favor a BPL model.</description>

      <title>Fast inflowing ionized absorber tracing the gas dynamics at sub-parsec scale around Mrk 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion onto supermassive black hole (SMBH) releases energy via radiation, jets or winds, providing feedback effects on the circumnuclear gas environment. However, the dynamics of accreting gas on sub-parsec scales near the SMBH remains poorly understood. With high-resolution X-ray spectra of Mrk 3, we detect a fast inflowing ionized absorber characterized by redshifted Fe XXV and Fe XXVI absorption lines. Photoionization modeling reveals the inflowing absorber is located at $\lesssim0.04-0.74\rm~pc$ and is decelerating from $6.1\pm0.5\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ to $3.4\pm0.3\times10^3\rm~km~s^{-1}$ over 11 years. Only $\sim0.6$\%--$3$\% of the inflowing material is estimated to reach the event horizon. This direct evidence of sub-parsec scale fueling inflow bridges the gap between the torus and the outer accretion disk. Furthermore, a $0.86$-keV gas component with sub-solar metallicity ($Z\sim0.22$), outflowing at a velocity of $\sim330\rm~km~s^{-1}$, is detected in the soft X-ray band. It may corresponds to the [O III] biconical outflow in the narrow-line region. A putative ultra-fast disk wind outside our line-of-sight, or clouds within the broad-line region, are promising candidates for decelerating the inflowing absorber.</description>

      <title>High-time-resolution properties of 35 fast radio bursts detected by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present microsecond-resolution, coherently-dedispersed, polarimetric measurements of 35 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected during the Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) incoherent sum (ICS) survey with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). We find a wide diversity of time-frequency morphology and polarisation properties broadly consistent with those of currently known non-repeating FRBs. The high S/N and fine time-resolution of our data however reveals a wealth of new information. Key results include (i) the distribution of scattering timescales, ${\tau}_{obs}$, is limited purely by instrumental effects, with no downturn at high ${\tau}_{obs}$ as expected from a log-normal distribution; (ii) for the 29 FRBs with known redshift, ${\tau}_{obs}$ is uncorrelated with dispersion measure (DM) fluctuations about the Macquart relation, in contrast to expectations from pulsar scattering-DM relations; (iii) all FRBs probably have multiple components, and at least a large fraction have variable PA, the identification of which is limited by scattering; (iv) at least half of all FRBs exhibit PA microstructure at 200 ${\mu}s$-200 ns timescales, with behaviour most closely resembling a sub-category of Crab main pulses; (v) that there is a break in the FRB circular polarisation distribution at Stokes V $\gtrsim$ 20%, which is suggestive of a discrete sub-population.</description>

      <title>SN 2023gpw: exploring the diversity and power sources of hydrogen-rich superluminous supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our observations and analysis of SN~2023gpw, a hydrogen-rich superluminous supernova (SLSN~II) with broad emission lines in its post-peak spectra. Unlike previously observed SLSNe~II, its light curve suggests an abrupt drop during a solar conjunction between $\sim$80 and $\sim$180~d after the light-curve peak, possibly analogous to a normal hydrogen-rich supernova (SN). Spectra taken at and before the peak show hydrogen and helium `flash' emission lines attributed to early interaction with a dense confined circumstellar medium (CSM). A well-observed ultraviolet excess appears as these lines disappear, also as a result of CSM interaction. The blackbody photosphere expands roughly at the same velocity throughout the observations, indicating little or no bulk deceleration. This velocity is much higher than what is seen in spectral lines, suggesting asymmetry in the ejecta. The high total radiated energy ($\gtrsim9\times10^{50}$~erg) and aforementioned lack of bulk deceleration in SN~2023gpw are difficult to reconcile with a neutrino-driven SN simply combined with efficient conversion from kinetic energy to emission through interaction. This suggests an additional energy source such as a central engine. While magnetar-powered models qualitatively similar to SN~2023gpw exist, more modeling work is required to determine if they can reproduce the observed properties in combination with early interaction. The required energy might alternatively be provided by accretion onto a black hole created in the collapse of a massive progenitor star.</description>

      <title>Two Periodic Activity Epochs in FRB 20201124A: Coincident with Critical RM Evolution Epochs and Its Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17880v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20201124A by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) revealed a second-scale periodic modulation ($\sim$1.7\,s) in burst activity during two distinct observational windows. We find that these two periodic activity epochs temporally coincide with the transitional states of the source's Faraday rotation measure (RM), and the chance coincidence is only about 0.07$\%$. This correlation is can be understood within the magnetar/Be-star binary system framework. Considering that only the polar cap region can remain stable for such an extended period, we apply a coherent linear periodic evolution model to jointly constrain the initial burst period \( P_0 \) and the period derivative \( \dot{P} \) across both observation windows (MJD 59310 and MJD 59347). We obtain spin parameters consistent with blind search results: an initial spin period $P_0 = 1.7060155$\,s at the reference time and spin period derivative $\dot{P} = 6.1393 \times 10^{-10}$\,s\,s$^{-1}$. We conclude that during these two observational windows, the magnetar was just crossing the disk of the Be star. The disk-magnetar interaction at these two geometric positions may surpress the multi-polar magnetic fields at low latitudes of the magnetar, which enhances the dominance of the polar cap region emissions and makes the periodic activity detectable.</description>

      <title>Modelling multiwavelength afterglows of the VHE-GRB population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of very high energy (VHE, $&gt;$ 100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission from gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has provided new insights into afterglow physics. Understanding the temporal and spectral evolution of VHE GRBs requires detailed modelling of multiwavelength observations spanning radio to VHE $\gamma$ rays. Previous studies on afterglow emission of VHE GRBs were interpreted using a range of frameworks, including single- and multi-zone jet configurations, synchrotron radiation from forward and reverse shocks, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) processes, as well as hadronic emission processes. We conducted a detailed multiwavelength modelling of five long-duration VHE GRBs - GRB 180720B, GRB 190114C, GRB 190829A, GRB 201216C and GRB 221009A; using the NAIMA code and modifications to it. The code deals with single-zone synchrotron radiation, SSC and external Compton (EC) radiation with complete Klein Nishina cross-section, extragalactic background light correction, and the Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Our analysis constrains key parameters governing the emission and surrounding environments of these GRBs. The results indicate that SSC is the dominant VHE emission mechanism, with negligible contribution from EC. Most VHE GRBs are well described by the forward shock model in a spherical jet configuration, where constant density interstellar medium is preferred over wind medium. Additionally, we find that VHE GRBs tend to occur in environments with lower magnetic fields and higher ambient medium densities. Interestingly, VHE GRBs lie at the edge of the 3-$\sigma$ region of the $E_{\rm k,iso}$ - $\epsilon_B$ correlation observed in other energetic GRBs. Our model slightly over predicts the radio fluxes, indicating that a more complicated modelling might be required in some cases. These findings provide crucial constraints on VHE GRB emission sites and mechanisms (Abridged).</description>

      <title>On the global Gaussian bending measure and its applications in stationary spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02195v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified gravity theories have been suggested to address the limitations of general relativity, each exhibiting differences, particularly in their strong-field limits. Nonetheless, there lacks effective means to distinguish or test these theories through local strong-field measurements. In this work, we define a global Gaussian bending measure over singular spacetime regions, establish a corresponding global theory, and demonstrate its applications in a general stationary spacetime. The global theory is based on differential geometry, rather than on specific gravity theories, allowing it to depict various physics within general relativity and beyond. For example, it can be applied to describe the gravitational bending of massless or massive messengers, such as photons, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and possibly massive gravitational waves predicted in certain theories of gravity. Besides, the global theory is applicable to any stationary spacetime regions outside a rotating black hole. As an instance of its direct applications, we investigate the highly-curved spacetime effects of the black hole in its immediate surrounding regions and design local strong-field experiments involving different shapes of singular lensing patches. New means can be therefore anticipated to be developed according to the global theory to differentiate between different gravity theories and test them in their strong-field regions.</description>

      <title>Explosion sites of SN 1994W-like transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a sample of narrow-line transients that share characteristics with the Type IIn classified supernova (SN) 1994W, a prototypical member of this class of events, via investigation of their explosion sites and spectrophotometric data. The normalised cumulative rank (NCR) method was used to compare the explosion sites of 10 events to the star-formation distributions of their host galaxies, and to the sites of different evolved massive stars. The resulting sample mean value of NCR$_{\mathrm{H}\alpha} = 0.170 \pm 0.076$ is low, while the NCR$_{\mathrm{NUV}}$ distribution is flat with a mean value of $0.488 \pm 0.084$. The NCR distribution of SN 1994W-like events is consistent with relatively low-mass red supergiants (RSGs) and, despite the small sample size, inconsistent with high-mass stars such as luminous blue variables. To explain the nature of SN 1994W-like transients, interaction between an expanding ejecta and a relatively massive circumstellar medium is likely required, with the latter possibly having been produced by a H envelope ejection via a nuclear flash event, or a luminous red nova (LRN) from a stellar merger; both channels are consistent with low-mass RSGs suggested by the NCR results. In this context, we find the early $-26$ d spectrum from light curve maximum of SN 2003G to share similarities to those of F8-type supergiant stars and LRNe. Finally, based on late-time HST imaging, we set the deepest limits for the surviving precursor of SN 2011ht to $M_{\mathrm{F438W}} &gt; -3.8$ and $M_{\mathrm{F555W}} &gt; -4.0$ mag. This would exclude most supergiants as a non-terminal progenitor, assuming that such a star is not completely obscured by newly formed dust.</description>

      <title>Stellar-mass black holes in young massive and open stellar clusters -- VI. Role of external galactic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Young massive clusters (YMC) and open clusters (OC) are widely considered as potential environments for assembling merging binary stellar-remnant black holes (BBH) via dynamical interactions. However, such moderate mass systems are susceptible to being disrupted by the external tidal field of their host galaxies, potentially limiting their effectiveness as GW sources. In this study, I investigate the formation of BBH mergers in tidally dissolving star clusters. This is achieved with a newly computed grid consisting of 95 evolutionary model star clusters, where the clusters are subjected to a varying extent of tidal stripping. The cluster evolutions are computed with the direct N-body integrator NBODY7 that includes, among others, treatments for post-Newtonian (PN) effects in compact-binary members, mass loss due to stellar evolution, formation of stellar remnants, and tidal stripping. It is found that even strong tidal stripping does not quench the formation of a black hole (BH) core inside a cluster or the formation of dynamical BBH mergers in the system. The overall properties of BBH mergers, e.g., the form of the distribution of merger delay time, primary mass, and mass ratio, and the redshift evolution of merger rate are not significantly altered by the extent of tidal stripping of the parent cluster population. Furthermore, even strongly tidally stripped clusters are capable of dynamically forming Gaia-BH-like detached BH--main-sequence-star binaries that escape into the galactic field. Limitations of the present study and potential future improvements are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Ambient dark matter (DM) around binary black holes can imprint characteristic signatures on gravitational waves emitted from their merger. The exact signature depends sensitively on the DM density profile around the black holes. We run very high resolution cosmological hydrodynamics simulations of first star formation that follow the collapse of a $3\times10^{5}\,M_\odot$ mini-halo from $z=49$ to $z\simeq22$. Our flagship model achieves a DM particle mass of $3.7\times10^{-4}\,M_\odot$ and resolves the inner-most structure down to $0.02\,$pc. We show that the halo experiences a two-stage gravitational collapse, where a rotating, constant-density core with $r\lesssim3\,$pc is formed first, surrounded by an extended outskirts. Baryonic infall toward the center continues to raise the local Keplerian velocity and promotes adiabatic contraction of DM. The resulting density profile has an approximately power-law shape of $\rho_{\rm dm} \propto r^{-0.6}$ inside $\sim\!1\,$pc.We find that a piecewise power-law fit reproduces the simulation result to better than 10\%, and also find numerical convergence down to $\simeq\!0.01\,$pc. The DM density profile is typical for ordinary Pop~III halos, but our additional simulations reveal that inner slope varies significantly with halo-to-halo scatter, and the effect of Lyman-Werner irradiation and of supersonic baryon-DM streaming velocities, implying a wide distribution of slopes rather than a single universal curve. The large variation should be considered when calculating the predicted DM-induced dephasing of gravitational waves by up to an order of magnitude relative to the classical analytic model of the DM spike.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the standard relativistic geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disk in the background of a deformed compact object. The main purpose of this work is to determine whether such a deformed object possesses its own observational fingerprint that can distinguish it from Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. Our analysis reveals the properties of this relativistic accretion disk model and its dependence on the initial parameters.</description>

      <title>A 1.8 m class pathfinder Raman LIDAR for the Northern Site of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory -- Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Barcelona Raman LIDAR (BRL) will provide continuous monitoring of the aerosol extinction profile along the line of sight of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). It will be located at its Northern site (CTAO-N) on the Observatorio del Roque de Los Muchachos. This article presents the performance of the pathfinder Barcelona Raman LIDAR (pBRL), a prototype instrument for the final BRL. Power budget simulations were carried out for the pBRL operating. under various conditions, including clear nights, moon conditions, and dust intrusions. The LIDAR PreProcessing (LPP) software suite is presented, which includes several new statistical methods for background subtraction, signal gluing, ground layer and cloud detection and inversion, based on two elastic and one Raman lines. Preliminary test campaigns were conducted, first close to Barcelona and later at CTAO-N, albeit during moonlit nights only. The pBRL, under these non-optimal conditions, achieves maximum ranges up to about 35 km, range resolution of about 50 m for strongly absorbing dust layers, and 500 m for optically thin clouds with the Raman channel only, leading to similar resolutions for the LIDAR ratios and Angstrom exponents. Given the reasonable agreement between the extinction coefficients obtained from the Raman and elastic lines independently, an accuracy of aerosol optical depth retrieval in the order of 0.05 can be assumed with the current setup. The results show that the pBRL can provide valuable scientific results on aerosol characteristics and structure, although not all performance requirements could be validated under the conditions found at the two test sites. Several moderate hardware improvements are planned for its final upgraded version [truncated].</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of magnetized BPS baryonic layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics, BPS magnetized Baryonic layers (possessing both baryonic charge and magnetic flux) have been constructed in the gauged non-linear sigma model (G-NLSM), which is one of the most relevant effective theories for Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the strongly interacting low-energy limit. Since the topological charge that naturally appears on the right hand side of the BPS bound is a non-linear function of the baryonic charge, the thermodynamics of these magnetized Baryonic layers is highly non-trivial. In this work, using tools from the theory of Casimir effect, we derive analytical relationship between baryonic charge, topological charge, magnetic flux and relevant thermodynamical quantities (such as pressure, specific heat and magnetic susceptibility) of these layers. The critical Baryonic chemical potential is identified. Quite interestingly, the grand canonical partition function can be related with the Riemann zeta function. On the technical side, it is quite a remarkable result to derive explicit expressions for all these thermodynamics quantities of a strongly interacting magnetized system at finite Baryon density. On the physical side, such expressions allow a direct physical interpretation which we discuss.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cosmic-Ray Transport: Magnetized versus Unmagnetized Motion in Astrophysical Magnetic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray transport in turbulent astrophysical environments remains a multifaceted problem, and despite decades of study the impact of complex magnetic field geometry -- evident in simulations and observations -- has only recently received more focused attention. To understand how ensemble-averaged transport behavior emerges from the intricate interactions between cosmic rays and structured magnetic turbulence, we run test-particle experiments in snapshots of a strongly turbulent magnetohydrodynamics simulation. We characterize particle-turbulence interactions via the gyro radii of particles and their experienced field-line curvatures, which reveals two distinct transport modes: magnetized motion, where particles are tightly bound to strong coherent flux tubes and undergo large-scale mirroring; and unmagnetized motion characterized by chaotic scattering through weak and highly tangled regions of the magnetic field. We formulate an effective stochastic process for each mode: compound subdiffusion with long mean free paths for magnetized motion, and a Langevin process with short mean free paths for unmagnetized motion. A combined stochastic walker that alternates between these two modes accurately reproduces the mean squared displacements observed in the test-particle data. Our results emphasize the critical role of coherent magnetic structures in comprehensively understanding cosmic-ray transport and lay a foundation for developing a theory of geometry-mediated transport.</description>

      <title>On the Broadening of the Characteristic Frequency Range towards Higher Photon Energies in the X-ray Variability of the Black Hole Transient MAXI J1820+070</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy-dependent X-ray power spectral states and Band-Limited Noise (BLN) components have been seen in the low-hard state and intermediate states of black hole X-ray binaries. Here we report our analysis of Insight-HXMT observations of the black hole transient MAXI J1820$+$070 during its 2018 outburst when the source was brightest. We found opposite trends of low-frequency ($&lt;$ 0.1 Hz) and high-frequency ($&gt;$ 10 Hz) BLN components, i.e., decreasing vs. increasing in frequency with increasing photon energy, respectively. This establishes an apparent two-way broadening of the power spectral plateau formed by multiple BLNs towards higher photon energies. The trend of the highest BLN component with increasing photon energy has been interpreted as that the corresponding seed photons originated from a region relatively more central in the corona previously. The decreasing trend of the characteristic frequency of the lowest frequency BLN component with increasing photon energy can then be interpreted as that the corresponding seed photons originated from further out in the disk but on the opposite side of the central corona to the observer. These opposite trends then imply that the power spectral plateau represents the radial extension of the accretion disk that contributed the seed photons producing the BLNs, and show that the higher the photon energy is, the wider the plateau and the smaller the fractional variability. The plateau shows the analogy to the flat power spectrum with a low fractional variability of the Power-Law Noise seen in the high-soft state, which corresponds to photons from the entire x-ray disk.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 Yr Data Set: Removing Pulsars One by One from the Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evidence has emerged for a stochastic signal correlated among 67 pulsars within the 15-year pulsar-timing data set compiled by the NANOGrav collaboration. Similar signals have been found in data from the European, Indian, Parkes, and Chinese PTAs. This signal has been interpreted as indicative of the presence of a nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background. To explore the internal consistency of this result we investigate how the recovered signal strength changes as we remove the pulsars one by one from the data set. We calculate the signal strength using the (noise-marginalized) optimal statistic, a frequentist metric designed to measure correlated excess power in the residuals of the arrival times of the radio pulses. We identify several features emerging from this analysis that were initially unexpected. The significance of these features, however, can only be assessed by comparing the real data to synthetic data sets. After conducting identical analyses on simulated data sets, we do not find anything inconsistent with the presence of a stochastic gravitational wave background in the NANOGrav 15-year data. The methodologies developed here can offer additional tools for application to future, more sensitive data sets. While this analysis provides an internal consistency check of the NANOGrav results, it does not eliminate the necessity for additional investigations that could identify potential systematics or uncover unmodeled physical phenomena in the data.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark matter annihilation in the Large Magellanic Cloud from multiple low-frequency radio observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-frequency radio emission from the Large Magellanic Cloud~(LMC) is assumed to be dominated by nonthermal synchrotron radiation from energy loss of energetic $e^+/e^-$ in magnetic field. Two different kinds of sources of $e^+/e^-$, dark matter~(DM) annihilation and cosmic rays~(CR) related to massive stars, are taken into account in this paper. We fit the multiple low-frequency radio observations, from 19.7 MHz to 1.4 GHz, with a double power-law model $S_{nth} =S_{DM}(\frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{DM}}+S_{CR}( \frac {\nu}{\nu_{\star}})^{-\alpha_{CR}} $. $\nu_{\star}$ is set to be $1.4$ GHz and $S_{CR}$ could be determined from the 24 $\mu m$ luminosity based on the global radio-infrared correlation. Our best fit with a fixed $\alpha_{CR}$ changing from $0.80$ to $0.55$ yields $\alpha_{DM}$ ranging from $0.21$ to $0.66$. Given a fixed value of $\alpha_{CR}$, we derive the upper limits of synchrotron emission induced by dark matter annihilation at different radio frequencies. Larger value of $\alpha_{CR}$ represents for a harder $e^+/e^-$ spectrum from cosmic rays, which leads to a smaller value of $\alpha_{DM}$ and allow less synchrotron emission resulted from dark matter annihilation in lower frequency. Under the same assumption on the magnetic field, we find that the lower the frequency, the stronger the restriction on DM parameter space. Meanwhile, as the peak frequency of synchrotron radiation decrease with the energy of $e^+/e^-$, constraints on DM properties obtained from lower frequency are more severe in the case of DM with lower mass. Future low-frequency radio survey should be considered a promising and powerful way to constrain DM.</description>

      <title>A Study of thin relativistic magnetic accretion disk around a distorted black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accretion disks, swirling structures of matter spiraling into black holes, play a pivotal role in our understanding of binary star systems and their intricate evolutionary processes. While current models often simplify these complex phenomena by neglecting the influence of powerful magnetic fields, particularly within warped or distorted black hole geometries, this study delves into the crucial impact of such fields. Focusing on a thin accretion disk encircling a Schwarzschild black hole, we meticulously investigate how the presence of a quadrupole moment, an inherent distortion in the black hole's shape, affects its spectral characteristics. By analyzing key parameters like total pressure, magnetic pressure, temperature, height scale, surface density, and radiative flux (the energy emitted by the disk) we reveal significant alterations induced by incorporating both magnetic fields and a quadrupole moment. Notably, our findings demonstrate that negative quadrupoles exert a more pronounced influence on these disk properties, highlighting the intricate interplay between these factors. This comprehensive study provides invaluable insights into the dynamics of accretion disks surrounding distorted black holes with magnetic fields, paving the way for a more accurate and nuanced understanding of these fascinating astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Neutrinos by Hydrogen-rich Supernovae interacting with low-massive Circumstellar Medium: The Case of SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In hydrogen-rich (H-rich) Supernova (SN) events, the collision between the H-rich ejecta and the Circum-Stellar Medium (CSM) can accelerate particles and produce high-energy neutrinos (HE-$\nu$, TeV-PeV) through proton-proton inelastic scattering. Despite understanding the production mechanism of these neutrinos, the lack of direct observations raises questions about particle acceleration efficiency and the involved astrophysical conditions. This study focuses on neutrino emission from H-rich SNe with low-mass CSM, such as SN 2023ixf. We developed a semi-analytical model to characterize the progenitor and CSM at the explosion time, allowing us to infer the expected neutrino flux at Earth during the SN's interaction phase. Our model shows that neutrino emission depends not only on shock velocity and CSM mass but also on the spatial matter distribution of the CSM. By analysing the bolometric light curve of SN 2023ixf beyond 100 days post-explosion, we find that its ejecta, consisting of $9\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ (including $0.07\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ of radioactive $^{56}$Ni) and having a kinetic energy of $1.8\,\text{foe}$, collides with a low-mass CSM of $0.06\,\text{M}_{\rm \odot}$ distributed according to a power-law density profile with an exponent of $s=2.9$. Through these parameters, we estimate that up to $4\pm1\times 10^{-2}$ muon (anti-)neutrino events could be detected by IceCube within 50 days post-explosion. Although the predicted flux ($\lesssim 3\times 10^{-9}\,\text{GeV} \, \text{cm}^{-2} \, \text{s}^{-1}$) is below current IceCube sensitivity, future telescopes like IceCube-Gen2 and KM3NeT could detect HE-$\nu$ from similar SN events.</description>

      <title>The very high X-ray polarisation of accreting black hole IGRJ17091-3624 in the hard state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first detection of the X-ray polarisation of the transient black hole X-ray binary IGRJ17091-3624 taken with the Imaging X-ray polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in March 2025, and present the results of an X-ray spectro-polarimetric analysis. The polarisation was measured in the 2--8 keV band with 5.2$\sigma$ statistical confidence. We report a polarisation degree (PD) of $9.1\pm1.6$ per cent and a polarisation angle of $83^{\circ} \pm 5^{\circ}$ (errors are $1\sigma$ confidence). There is a hint of a positive correlation of PD with energy that is not statistically significant. We report that the source is in the corona-dominated hard state, which is confirmed by a hard power-law dominated spectrum with weak reflection features and the presence of a Type-C quasi-periodic oscillation at $\sim0.2$~Hz. The orientation of the emitted radio jet is not known, and so we are unable to compare it with the direction of X-ray polarization, but we predict the two to be parallel if the geometry is similar to that in Cygnus X-1 and Swift J1727.8-1613, the two hard state black hole binaries previously observed by IXPE. In the Comptonisation scenario, the high observed PD requires a very favourable geometry of the corona, a high inclination angle (supported by the presence of a dip in the light curve) and possibly a mildly relativistic outflow and/or scattering in an optically thick wind.</description>

Abstract: In \citet{Guillemot2023} we presented a new method for calibrating pulsar observations conducted with the Nan\c{c}ay decimetric Radio Telescope (NRT), which significantly improved NRT polarimetric measurements and pulsar timing quality for data taken after this method was developed, in November 2019. Results hinted at a dependence of the polarimetric response of the NRT on the observed direction. We investigated this potential dependence, since unaccounted variations of the instrumental response could degrade polarimetric measurements. Additionally, we aimed to develop a method for properly calibrating NRT pulsar observations conducted before November 2019. We conducted three series of observations of bright pulsars over wide declination ranges, in a special observation mode in which the feed horn rotates by $\sim$ 180$^\circ$ degrees across the observation, enabling us to determine the full polarimetric response of the NRT while modeling potential variations of calibration parameters with hour angle and declination. In addition, we used the METM technique to improve the calibration of pre-November 2019 data. From the analysis of the series of observations of bright pulsars with horn rotation, we found that the polarimetric response of the NRT does not appear to vary with hour angle or declination. On the other hand, the new METM-based calibration method appears to significantly improve the calibration of pre-November 2019 data. By analyzing NRT data on a selection of millisecond pulsars we found that the new polarimetric profiles are more homogeneous, they generally have larger signal-to-noise ratios, and found that the TOA data for these MSPs are more accurate and contain lower levels of noise, especially when combining the new calibration method with the \textit{Matrix Template Matching} (MTM) method for extracting TOAs from pulsar observations.</description>

      <title>The Long Road to Alignment: Measuring Black Hole Spin Orientation with Expanding Gravitational-Wave Datasets</title>

Abstract: Measuring the distribution of spin tilts-the angles between the spin vectors and the binary orbital angular momentum-in stellar-mass binary black holes detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA would provide valuable insight into their astrophysical origins. Analyses of the 69 binary black holes detected through LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's third observing run yielded model-dependent conclusions, particularly regarding whether the spin tilt distribution exhibits a peak near alignment, as expected for binaries formed in galactic fields. In this work, we simulate populations of up to 1500 binary black hole systems with parameters consistent with the default GWTC-3 analysis, while introducing a correlation that favors small spin tilts for binaries with mass ratios near unity. We find that: (a) spurious peaks away from perfect alignment are possible even with catalogs of up to 300 sources; (b) establishing a definitive peak at alignment remains difficult even with 1500 detections; (c) integrated measurements -- such as the fraction of events with tilt angles smaller than $10^\circ$ or greater than $90^\circ$ -- are more robust and should be preferred, achieving relative $90\%$ credible uncertainties of $\sim20\%-80\%$ with 1500 sources; and (d) even with the largest simulated catalogs, evidence for a mass ratio-tilt correlation remains inconclusive. Our results suggest that identifying the formation channels of merging black holes using spin tilts will remain challenging, but that model-independent measurements may yield more informative insights over model parameters themselves.</description>

      <title>Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis with Vela.jl: an overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15858v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present Vela, an efficient, modular, easy-to-use Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis package written in Julia. Vela provides an independent, efficient, and parallelized implementation of the full non-linear pulsar timing and noise model along with a Python binding named pyvela. One-time operations such as data file input, clock corrections, and solar system ephemeris computations are performed by pyvela with the help of the PINT pulsar timing package. Its reliability is ensured via careful design utilizing Julia's type system, strict version control, and an exhaustive test suite. This paper describes the design and usage of Vela focusing on the narrowband paradigm.</description>

      <title>Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis with Vela.jl: the wideband paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vela.jl is a package for performing Bayesian pulsar timing &amp; noise analysis written in Julia and Python. In the wideband paradigm of pulsar timing, simultaneous time of arrival and dispersion measure measurements are derived from a radio observation using frequency-resolved integrated pulse profiles and templates without splitting the observation into multiple frequency sub-bands. We describe the implementation of the wideband timing paradigm in Vela.jl, and demonstrate its usage using the NANOGrav 12.5-year wideband data of PSR J1923+2515. Vela.jl is the first software package to provide this functionality.</description>

      <title>Study on physical properties and characteristics of an anisotropic compact star model using Karmarkar Condition in F(Q) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main aim of this study is to examine the behaviour of physical parameters of an anisotropic compact star model demonstrating spherical symmetry in F(Q) modified gravity. To evaluate the behaviour and the stability of an anisotropic compact star model, we utilise the measured mass and radius of an anisotropic compact star model. This study obtained an anisotropic compact star model by solving Einstein field equations. The field equations have been simplified by an appropriate selection of the metric elements and the Karmarkar condition. By solving the field equation to develop a differential equation that establishes a relationship between two essential components of spacetime. A physical analysis of this model reveals that the resulting stellar structure for anisotropic matter distribution is a physically plausible representation of a compact star with an energy density of order $10^14 g/cm^3$. Using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, causality condition and Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov Condition, we investigate the hydrostatic equilibrium and stability of the compact star Cen X-3. We further determined the mass-radius relation of this compact star for different values of delta}1.</description>
