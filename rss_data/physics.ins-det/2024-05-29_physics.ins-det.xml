      <title>A beam profile monitor for GeV photon with high spatial resolution and fast readout capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A beam profile monitor (BPM) has been developed to measure photon beams at the BM4 beamline of the Mikamine site, Research Center for Accelerator and Radioisotope Science (RARIS-Mikamine; previously known as ELPH) at Tohoku University. The BPM comprises plastic scintillation fibers and SiPMs, enabling high-precision, real-time measurements of photon beams in the 1 GeV region. Data acquisition utilized streaming TDC, a firmware commonly employed in the J-PARC Hadron-hall, enabling real-time detection of high-intensity photon beams with count rates reaching several tens of MHz. With sufficient statistical data, the BPM achieved a 1 s beam-profiling accuracy of 10 {\mu}m. The proposed BPM serves as a valuable resource for future physics experiments at the BM4 photon beamline and will contribute significantly to ongoing accelerator research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Charge Amplification in Low Pressure CF4:SF6:He Mixtures with a Multi-Mesh ThGEM for Directional Dark Matter Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CYGNO collaboration is developing next generation directional Dark Matter (DM) detection experiments, using gaseous Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), as a robust method for identifying Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) below the Neutrino Fog. SF6 is potentially ideal for this since it provides a high fluorine content, enhancing sensitivity to spin-dependent interactions and, as a Negative Ion Drift (NID) gas, reduces charge diffusion leading to improved positional resolution. CF4, although not a NID gas, has also been identified as a favourable gas target as it provides a scintillation signal which can be used for a complimentary light/charge readout approach. These gases can operate at low pressures to elongate Nuclear Recoil (NR) tracks and facilitate directional measurements. In principle, He could be added to low pressure SF6/CF4 without significant detriment to the length of 16S, 12C, and 19F recoils. This would improve the target mass, sensitivity to lower WIMP masses, and offer the possibility of atmospheric operation; potentially reducing the cost of a containment vessel. In this article, we present gas gain and energy resolution measurements, taken with a Multi-Mesh Thick Gaseous Electron Multiplier (MMThGEM), in low pressure SF6 and CF4:SF6 mixtures following the addition of He. We find that the CF4:SF6:He mixtures tested were able to produce gas gains on the order of 10^4 up to a total pressure of 100 Torr. These results demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement in charge amplification in NID gas mixtures with a He component.</description>

      <title>Letter of Intent: Towards a Vacuum Birefringence Experiment at the Helmholtz International Beamline for Extreme Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum field theory predicts a nonlinear response of the vacuum to strong electromagnetic fields of macroscopic extent. This fundamental tenet has remained experimentally challenging and is yet to be tested in the laboratory. A particularly distinct signature of the resulting optical activity of the quantum vacuum is vacuum birefringence. This offers an excellent opportunity for a precision test of nonlinear quantum electrodynamics in an uncharted parameter regime. Recently, the operation of the high-intensity laser ReLaX provided by the Helmholtz International Beamline for Extreme Fields (HIBEF) has been inaugurated at the High Energy Density (HED) scientific instrument of the European XFEL. We make the case that this worldwide unique combination of an x-ray free-electron laser and an ultra-intense near-infrared laser together with recent advances in high-precision x-ray polarimetry, refinements of prospective discovery scenarios, and progress in their accurate theoretical modelling have set the stage for performing an actual discovery experiment of quantum vacuum nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Charge Collection Performance of 4H-SiC LGAD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 4H-SiC material exhibits good detection performance, but there are still many problems like signal distortion and poor signal quality. The 4H-SiC low gain avalanche detector (LGAD) has been fabricated for the first time to solve these problems, which named SICAR (SIlicon CARbide). The results of electrical characteristics and charge collection performance of the 4H-SiC LGAD are reported. The influence of different metal thicknesses on the leakage current of the device is studied.~By optimizing the fabrication process, the leakage current of the detector is reduced by four orders of magnitude. The experimental results confirm this 4H-SiC LGAD has an obvious gain structure, the gain factor of the SICAR is reported to be about 2 at 150 V. The charge collection efficiency (CCE) of the device was analyzed using $\alpha$ particle incidence of 5.54 MeV, and the CCE is 90\% @100~V. This study provides a novel 4H-SiC LGAD radiation detector for application in the field of high energy particle physics.</description>

      <title>Batch VUV4 Characterization for the SBC-LAr10 scintillating bubble chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Scintillating Bubble Chamber (SBC) collaboration purchased 32 Hamamatsu VUV4 silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) for use in SBC-LAr10, a bubble chamber containing 10~kg of liquid argon. The VUV4 SiPMs, or Quads, underwent a characterization at two temperatures which measured the breakdown voltage ($V_{\text{BD}}$), the SiPM gain ($g_{\text{SiPM}}$), the rate of change of $g_{\text{SiPM}}$ with respect to voltage ($m$), the dark count rate (DCR), and the probability of a correlated avalanche (P$_{\text{CA}}$) as well as the temperature coefficients of these parameters. A Peltier-based chilled vacuum chamber was developed at Queen's University to cool down the Quads to $233.15\pm0.2$~K and $255.15\pm0.2$~K with average stability of $\pm20$~mK. A mostly assumption-free analysis was derived to estimate $V_{\text{BD}}$ to tens of mV precision and DCR close to Poissonian error. The temperature dependence of $V_{\text{BD}}$ was found to be $56\pm2$~mV~K$^{-1}$, and $m$ on average across all Quads was found to be $(459\pm3(\rm{stat.})\pm23(\rm{sys.}))\times 10^{3}~e^-$~PE$^{-1}$~V$^{-1}$. The average DCR temperature coefficient was estimated to be $0.099\pm0.008$~K$^{-1}$ corresponding to a reduction factor of 7 for every 20~K drop in temperature. The average temperature dependence of P$_{\text{CA}}$ was estimated to be $4000\pm1000$~ppm~K$^{-1}$. P$_{\text{CA}}$ estimated from the average across all SiPMs is a better estimator than the P$_{\text{CA}}$ calculated from individual SiPMs, whereas all of the other parameters, the opposite is true. All the estimated parameters were measured to the precision required for SBC-LAr10, and the Quads will be used in conditions to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Accounting for Clock-Induced Charge Production in the EMCCD Gain Register</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) is often used for taking images with space telescopes and other devices. Photons hit the pixels and photo-electrons are created, and these are multiplied via impact ionization as they travel through the gain register from one gain stage to the next. A high gain means a high multiplication factor, and this is achieved through a high voltage difference across a gain stage. If the gain is high enough, the chance of clock-induced charge production in the gain register increases. The probability distribution function governing the gain process in the literature only accounts for charge multiplication if one or more electrons enters the gain register. I derive from first principles the modified probability distribution that accounts for clock-induced charge production in the gain register. I also examine some EMCCD data and show through maximum likelihood estimation that the data conform better to the modified distribution versus the usual one in the literature. The use of the modified distribution would in principle improve the accuracy of signal extraction from a frame.</description>

      <title>Calibration Error in 21-centimeter Global Spectrum Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The redshifted 21 cm line signal is a powerful probe of the cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization. The global spectrum can potentially be detected with a single antenna and spectrometer. However, this measurement requires an extremely accurate calibration of the instrument to facilitate the separation of the 21 cm signal from the much brighter foregrounds and possible variations in the instrument response. Understanding how the measurement errors propagate in a realistic instrument system and affect system calibration is the focus of this work. We simulate a 21 cm global spectrum observation based on the noise wave calibration scheme. We focus on how measurement errors in reflection coefficients affect the noise temperature and how typical errors impact the recovery of the 21 cm signal, especially in the frequency domain. Results show that for our example set up, a typical vector network analyzer (VNA) measurement error in the magnitude of the reflection coefficients of the antenna, receiver, and open cable, which are 0.001, 0.001, and 0.002 (linear), respectively, would result in a 200 mK deviation on the detected signal, and a typical measurement error of 0.48 degree, 0.78 degree, or 0.15 degree in the respective phases would cause a 40 mK deviation. The VNA measurement error can greatly affect the result of a 21 cm global spectrum experiment using this calibration technique, and such a feature could be mistaken for or be combined with the 21 cm signal</description>

      <title>Prediction of Energy Resolution in the JUNO Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the energy resolution study in the JUNO experiment, incorporating the latest knowledge acquired during the detector construction phase. The determination of neutrino mass ordering in JUNO requires an exceptional energy resolution better than 3\% at 1 MeV. To achieve this ambitious goal, significant efforts have been undertaken in the design and production of the key components of the JUNO detector. Various factors affecting the detection of inverse beta decay signals have an impact on the energy resolution, extending beyond the statistical fluctuations of the detected number of photons, such as the properties of liquid scintillator, performance of photomultiplier tubes, and the energy reconstruction algorithm. To account for these effects, a full JUNO simulation and reconstruction approach is employed. This enables the modeling of all relevant effects and the evaluation of associated inputs to accurately estimate the energy resolution. The study reveals an energy resolution of 2.95\% at 1 MeV. Furthermore, the study assesses the contribution of major effects to the overall energy resolution budget. This analysis serves as a reference for interpreting future measurements of energy resolution during JUNO data taking. Moreover, it provides a guideline in comprehending the energy resolution characteristics of liquid scintillator-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Data-driven background model for the CUORE experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the model we developed to reconstruct the CUORE radioactive background based on the analysis of an experimental exposure of 1038.4 kg yr. The data reconstruction relies on a simultaneous Bayesian fit applied to energy spectra over a broad energy range. The high granularity of the CUORE detector, together with the large exposure and extended stable operations, allow for an in-depth exploration of both spatial and time dependence of backgrounds. We achieve high sensitivity to both bulk and surface activities of the materials of the setup, detecting levels as low as 10 nBq kg$^{-1}$ and 0.1 nBq cm$^{-2}$, respectively. We compare the contamination levels we extract from the background model with prior radio-assay data, which informs future background risk mitigation strategies. The results of this background model play a crucial role in constructing the background budget for the CUPID experiment as it will exploit the same CUORE infrastructure.</description>

      <title>All-mirror wavefront division interferometer for mid-infrared spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we address the core of any Fourier transform (FT) spectrometer$\unicode{x2013}$the interferometer$\unicode{x2013}$in perspective of the recent emergence of spatially coherent broadband infrared (IR) sources. As a result, we report on the design of a wavefront-division interferometer for spectroscopic applications in the mid-IR and beyond. The theoretical framework of the proposed wavefront division interferometer is discussed, and an analytical solution to determine the far-field interference pattern is derived. The solution is verified by both optical propagation simulations and experimentally. In view of the practical significance, we apply the wavefront division interferometer for FTIR spectroscopy. It features a simple architecture, ultra-broad achromaticity (limited only by the spectral profiles of the mirrors), high optical throughput, variable arms split ratio, and a two-fold increase in scan length and spectral resolution (demonstrated up to 0.2 $cm^{-1}$), respectively. Further, the employed design inherently enables the measurement of the complex refractive index. Experimental verification of the mentioned properties is provided by coupling the spectrometer with a mid-IR supercontinuum source for various applied spectroscopic studies: high-resolution transmission measurements of polymers (polypropylene) and gas (methane), as well as reflectance measurements of dried pharmaceuticals (insulin products on a metal surface).</description>

      <title>Simulation and Experimental Analysis of Aerogel Attenuation for High Energy Alpha Particles in Fission Fusion Fragment Rocket Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging studies are geared toward exploring new methods of nuclear rocket propulsion to provide more efficient space transit beyond Earth's orbit. One method is to employ a Fission Fragment Rocket Engine utilizing fissionable layers embedded in a low-density aerogel. A quantitative understanding of particle attenuation is essential for developing a functional prototype that permits fission fragments to escape the layers and contribute to specific impulse rather than being attenuated and generating waste heat. In this investigation, the MCNP code was used to theoretically analyze the attenuation of alpha particles from Am-241 sources within aerogel materials. Simulations were conducted on aerogels with various densities and compositions. These simulations aimed to predict the expected intensity of alpha particles reaching a detector. CR-39 was employed as a Plastic Nuclear Track Detector to assess particle attenuation by the aerogels. The threshold areal density of atoms was found to be around $10^{ 20}$ atoms/$cm^{ 2}$ for the three materials studied in this project. Using a 0.22 mm thick SiO$_2$ aerogel with a density of 90 mg/$cm^{ 3}$, which exceeds the threshold, nearly all alpha particles were attenuated. Conversely, employing a 1.6 mm thick graphene aerogel with a density of 12.5 mg/$cm^{ 3}$ resulted in an average attenuation of 32.3%.</description>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is poised to transform the design of complex, large-scale detectors like the ePIC at the future Electron Ion Collider. Featuring a central detector with additional detecting systems in the far forward and far backward regions, the ePIC experiment incorporates numerous design parameters and objectives, including performance, physics reach, and cost, constrained by mechanical and geometric limits. This project aims to develop a scalable, distributed AI-assisted detector design for the EIC (AID(2)E), employing state-of-the-art multiobjective optimization to tackle complex designs. Supported by the ePIC software stack and using Geant4 simulations, our approach benefits from transparent parameterization and advanced AI features. The workflow leverages the PanDA and iDDS systems, used in major experiments such as ATLAS at CERN LHC, the Rubin Observatory, and sPHENIX at RHIC, to manage the compute intensive demands of ePIC detector simulations. Tailored enhancements to the PanDA system focus on usability, scalability, automation, and monitoring. Ultimately, this project aims to establish a robust design capability, apply a distributed AI-assisted workflow to the ePIC detector, and extend its applications to the design of the second detector (Detector-2) in the EIC, as well as to calibration and alignment tasks. Additionally, we are developing advanced data science tools to efficiently navigate the complex, multidimensional trade-offs identified through this optimization process.</description>

Abstract: Axions are one of the well-motivated candidates for dark matter, originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem in particle physics. Dark matter Axion search with riNg Cavity Experiment (DANCE) is a new experimental project to broadly search for axion dark matter in the mass range of $10^{-17}~\mathrm{eV} &lt; m_a &lt; 10^{-11}~\mathrm{eV}$. We aim to detect the rotational oscillation of linearly polarized light caused by the axion-photon coupling with a bow-tie cavity. The first results of the prototype experiment, DANCE Act-1, are reported from a 24-hour observation. We found no evidence for axions and set 95% confidence level upper limit on the axion-photon coupling $g_{a \gamma} \lesssim 8 \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ in $10^{-14}~\mathrm{eV} &lt; m_a &lt; 10^{-13}~\mathrm{eV}$. Although the bound did not exceed the current best limits, this optical cavity experiment is the first demonstration of polarization-based axion dark matter search without any external magnetic field.</description>
