      <title>Habit Formation, Labor Supply, and the Dynamics of Retirement and Annuitization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decision to annuitize wealth in retirement planning has become increasingly complex due to rising longevity risk and changing retirement patterns, including increased labor force participation at older ages. While an extensive literature studies consumption, labor, and annuitization decisions, these elements are typically examined in isolation. This paper develops a unified stochastic control and optimal stopping framework in which habit formation and endogenous labor supply shape retirement and annuitization decisions under age-dependent mortality. We derive optimal consumption, labor, portfolio, and annuitization policies in a continuous-time lifecycle model. The solution is characterized via dynamic programming and a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman variational inequality. Our results reveal a rich sequence of retirement dynamics. When wealth is low relative to habit, labor is supplied defensively to protect consumption standards. As wealth increases, agents enter a work-to-retire phase in which labor is supplied at its maximum level to accelerate access to retirement. Human capital acts as a stabilizing asset, justifying a more aggressive pre-retirement investment portfolio, followed by abrupt de-risking upon annuitization. Subjective mortality beliefs are a key determinant in shaping retirement dynamics. Agents with pessimistic longevity beliefs rationally perceive annuities as unattractive, leading them to avoid or delay annuitization. This framework provides a behavior-based explanation for low annuity demand and offers guidance for retirement planning jointly linking labor supply, portfolio choice, and the timing of annuitization.</description>

      <title>On the Mean-Field limit of diffusive games through the master equation: $L^{\infty}$ estimates and extreme value behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an $N$-player game where the states of the players evolve with time as Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) with interaction only in the drift terms. Each player controls the drift of the SDE satisfied by her state process, aiming to minimize the expected value of a cost that depends on the paths of the player's state and the empirical measure of the states of all the players until a terminal time. When $N \to \infty$, previous works have established Central Limit Theorems and Large Deviation Principles for the state processes when the game is in Nash Equilibrium (the Nash states), by using the Master Equation to construct approximations of those processes that evolve with time as SDEs with classical Mean-Field interaction. Staying in this framework, we improve an existing $L^{1}$ estimate for the total error of approximating all the Nash states to an $L^{\infty}$ one, and we also establish the $N \to \infty$ asymptotic behavior of the upper order statistics of the Nash states. The latter initiates the development of an Extreme Value Theory for Stochastic Differential Games.</description>
