      <title>Bacterial chemotaxis considering memory effects (letter)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemotaxis in bacteria such as \textit{E.\ coli} is controlled by the slow methylation of chemoreceptors. As a consequence, intrinsic time and length scales of tens of seconds and hundreds of micrometers emerge, making the Keller--Segel equations invalid when the chemical signal changes on these scales, as occurs in several natural environments. Using a kinetic approach, we show that chemotaxis is described using the concentration field of the protein that controls tumbling in addition to bacterial density. The macroscopic equations for these fields are derived, which describe the nonlocal response.</description>

      <title>Bacterial chemotaxis considering memory effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial chemotaxis for E.coli is controlled by methylation of chemoreceptors, which in a biochemical pathway regulates the concentration of the CheY-P protein that finally controls the tumbling rate. As a consequence, the tumbling rate adjusts to changes in the concentration of relevant chemicals, to produce a biased random walk toward chemoattractants of against the repellers. Methylation is a slow process, implying that the internal concentration of CheY-P is not instantaneously adapted to the environment, and the tumbling rate presents memory. This implies that the Keller-Segel (KS) equations used to describe chemotaxis at the macroscopic scale, which assume a local relation between the bacterial flux and the chemical gradient, are not fully valid as memory and the associated nonlocal response are not considered. To derive the equations that replace the KS ones, we use a kinetic approach, in which a kinetic equation for the bacterial transport is written considering the dynamics of the protein concentration. When memory is large, the protein concentration field must be considered a relevant variable as the bacterial density. Working out the Chapman-Enskog (CE) method, the dynamical equations for these fields are obtained, which have the form of reaction-diffusion equations with flux and source terms depending on the gradients on the chemical signal. The transport coefficients are obtained entirely in terms of the microscopic dynamics, giving their values of the case of E.coli. Solving the equations for an inhomogeneous signal it is shown that the response is nonlocal, with a smoothing length as large as $170\mu$m for E.coli. The homogeneous response and the relaxational dynamics are also studied. The case of small memory is also studied, in which case the CE method reproduces the KS equations, with explicit expressions for the transport coefficients.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal wave-mediated interactions power a classical time crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An acoustic standing wave acts as a lattice of evenly spaced potential energy wells for sub-wavelength-scale objects. Trapped particles interact with each other by exchanging waves that they scatter from the standing wave. Unless the particles have identical scattering properties, their wave-mediated interactions are nonreciprocal. Pairs of particles can use this nonreciprocity to harvest energy from the wave to sustain steady-state oscillations despite viscous drag and the absence of periodic driving. We show in theory and experiment that a minimal system composed of two acoustically levitated particles can access five distinct dynamical states, two of which are emergently active steady states. Under some circumstances, these emergently active steady states break spatiotemporal symmetry and therefore constitute a classical time crystal.</description>

      <title>Emergent epithelial elasticity governed by interfacial surface mechanics and substrate interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the life of animals, epithelial tissues undergo extensive deformations--first to form organs during embryogensis and later to preserve integrity and function in adulthood. To what extent these deformations resemble that of non-living elastic materials is not well understood. We derive an elasticity theory of epithelia, supported by a thin layer of extracellular material and the stroma, in which the mechanics of individual cells are dominated by differential interfacial tensions stemming from cell cortical tension and adhesion. Upon coarse-graining a discrete single-cell-level mechanics model, we obtain a harmonic deformation energy and derive the critical conditions for the elastic instability, where an initially flat tissue either buckles out of plane or forms wrinkles. Due to the distinct origin of elasticity, the scaling of the critical load to induce an instability and the wrinkling wavelength with layer thickness is fundamentally different than in solid plates. The theory also naturally describes reversal of the groove-to-crest thickness-modulation phase--a recently observed epithelial shape feature which cannot be explained by the classical elasticity theory. Our work provides a guideline for understanding the relative role of cell surface tensions and the interaction of tissues with substrates during epithelial morphogenesis.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave turbulence describes the long-time statistical behavior of out-of-equilibrium systems composed of weakly interacting waves. Non-Hermitian media ranging from open quantum systems to active materials can sustain wave propagation in so-called $PT$-symmetric states where gain and loss are effectively balanced. Here, we derive the kinetic equations governing wave turbulence in a prototypical non-Hermitian medium: a three-dimensional fluid with odd viscosity. We calculate its exact anisotropic solution, the so-called Kolmogorov-Zakharov spectrum, and validate the existence of this regime using direct numerical simulations. This non-Hermitian wave turbulence generates a direct cascade that is sustained down to the smallest scales, suppressing the transition to strong turbulence typically observed in rotating fluids and electron magnetohydrodynamics. Beyond odd viscous fluids, this qualitative mechanism applies to any non-linear system of waves where non-Hermitian effects are enhanced at small scales through gradient terms in the dynamical equations, e.g. via odd elastic moduli or other non-reciprocal responses.</description>

      <title>Defects, Sound Damping, and the Boson Peak in Amorphous Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two nearly universal and anomalous properties of glasses, the peak in the specific heat and plateau of the thermal conductivity, occur around the same temperature. This coincidence suggests that the two phenomena are related. Both effects can be rationalized by assuming Rayleigh scaling of sound attenuation and this scaling leads one to consider scattering from defects. Identifying defects in glasses, which are inherently disordered, is a long-standing problem that was approached in several ways. We examine candidates for defects in glasses that represent areas of strong sound damping. We show that some defects are associated with quasi-localized excitations, which may be associated with modes in excess of the Debye theory. We also examine generalized Debye relations, which relate sound damping and the speed of sound to excess modes. We derive a generalized Debye relation that does not resort to an approximation used by previous authors. We find that our relation and the relation given by previous authors are almost identical at small frequencies and also reproduce the independently determined density of states. However, the different generalized Debye relations do not agree around the boson peak. While generalized Debye relations accurately predict the boson peak in two-dimensional glasses, they under estimate the boson peak in three-dimensional glasses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript establishes a pathway to reconstruct material parameters from measurements within the Landau-de Gennes model for nematic liquid crystals. We present a Bayesian approach to this inverse problem and analyse its properties using given, simulated data for benchmark problems of a planar bistable nematic device. In particular, we discuss the accuracy of the Markov chain Monte Carlo approximations, confidence intervals and the limits of identifiability.</description>

      <title>A phase-field model for solutions of DNA-made particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a phase-field model based on the Cahn-Hilliard equation to investigate the properties of phase separation in DNA nanostar systems. Leveraging a realistic free-energy functional derived from Wertheim theory, our model captures the thermodynamic properties of self-assembling DNA nanostars under various conditions. This approach allows for the study of both one-component and multi-component systems, including mixtures of different nanostar species and cross-linkers. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the model ability to replicate experimental observations, including liquid-liquid phase separation, surface tension variation, and the structural organisation of multi-component systems. Our results highlight the versatility and predictive power of the Cahn-Hilliard framework, particularly for complex systems where detailed simulations are computationally prohibitive. This work provides a robust foundation for studying DNA-based materials and their potential applications in nanotechnology and biophysics, including liquid-liquid phase separation in cellular environments.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Competing Effects of Dynamic Solvation Structures on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shifts of Battery Electrolytes via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the solvation structure of electrolytes is critical for optimizing the electrochemical performance of rechargeable batteries, as it directly influences properties such as ionic conductivity, viscosity, and electrochemical stability. The highly complex structures and strong interactions in high-concentration electrolytes make accurate modeling and interpretation of their ``structure-property" relationships even more challenging with spectroscopic methods. In this study, we present a machine learning-based approach to predict dynamic $^7$Li NMR chemical shifts in LiFSI/DME electrolyte solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive structural analysis to interpret the observed chemical shift behavior in our experiments, particularly the abrupt changes in $^7$Li chemical shifts at high concentrations. Using advanced modeling techniques, we quantitatively establish the relationship between molecular structure and NMR spectra, offering critical insights into solvation structure assignments. Our findings reveal the coexistence of two competing local solvation structures that shift in dominance as electrolyte concentration approaches the concentrated limit, leading to anomalous reverse of $^7$Li NMR chemical shift in our experiment. This work provides a detailed molecular-level understanding of the intricate solvation structures probed by NMR spectroscopy, leading the way for enhanced electrolyte design.</description>

      <title>A study of pendular liquid bridge between two equal solid spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pendular liquid bridges with concave meridians between two equal rigid spheres are mathematically studied emphasizing some less analyzed facts in the literature. Discrepancies from the numerical solution of the Young-Laplace equation are examined among typical simplifying approximations and a few curve-fitting formulas. An in-depth analysis is provided about the important role of separation distance between spheres played in pendular ring formation via capillary condensation at a given relative humidity and the strength of subsequent capillary forces. For most practical situations, the toroidal approximation could be reasonably accurate (especially with diminishing separation distance) and provide valuable mathematical insights at least in a qualitative sense with its relatively simple analytical formulas. Using the elliptic meridional profile generally offers more accurate approximations, but with such complicated analytical formulas that it would limit its convenience for practical applications. With a few examples, the present study shows that curve-fitting formulas cannot be perfect and, by their approximative nature, would always leave room for improvements; therefore, care should be taken when applying curve-fitting formulas, to avoid undesirable errors</description>
