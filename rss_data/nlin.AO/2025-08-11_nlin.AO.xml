      <title>Moment Estimate and Variational Approach for Learning Generalized Diffusion with Non-gradient Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01854v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven learning framework for identifying governing laws of generalized diffusions with non-gradient components. By combining energy dissipation laws with a physically consistent penalty and first-moment evolution, we design a two-stage method to recover the pseudo-potential and rotation in the pointwise orthogonal decomposition of a class of non-gradient drifts in generalized diffusions. Our two-stage method is applied to complex generalized diffusion processes including dissipation-rotation dynamics, rough pseudo-potentials and noisy data. Representative numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for learning physical laws in non-gradient generalized diffusions.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Inherently Safer AGI through Language-Mediated Active Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for developing safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by combining Active Inference principles with Large Language Models (LLMs). We argue that traditional approaches to AI safety, focused on post-hoc interpretability and reward engineering, have fundamental limitations. We present an architecture where safety guarantees are integrated into the system's core design through transparent belief representations and hierarchical value alignment. Our framework leverages natural language as a medium for representing and manipulating beliefs, enabling direct human oversight while maintaining computational tractability. The architecture implements a multi-agent system where agents self-organize according to Active Inference principles, with preferences and safety constraints flowing through hierarchical Markov blankets. We outline specific mechanisms for ensuring safety, including: (1) explicit separation of beliefs and preferences in natural language, (2) bounded rationality through resource-aware free energy minimization, and (3) compositional safety through modular agent structures. The paper concludes with a research agenda centered on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) benchmark, proposing experiments to validate our framework's safety properties. Our approach offers a path toward AGI development that is inherently safer, rather than retrofitted with safety measures.</description>

      <title>Self-Balancing of Cell Populations via Martingale Turnover with Amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive control in biological systems, such as intestinal immunity, remains poorly understood despite detailed knowledge of underlying networks. We propose an alternative regulatory framework based on stochastic martingale turnover, where cells proliferate through mutual competition and decay without cell-type-specific regulation. Through stochastic simulations and mathematical analyses, we show that this process autonomously achieves balanced population states characterized by low decay probabilities. The dynamics are governed by a modified Langevin equation, in which conserved mass is replaced by a composition-dependent fitness variable. A random walk with step lengths that shorten near a target, together with its mathematical solution, demonstrates autonomous convergence of composition, due to the large number of possible microstates. These results suggest a biologically plausible, generic mechanism for adaptability.</description>

      <title>Micellization in active matter of asymmetric self-propelled particles: Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter composed of self-propelled particles features fascinating self-organization phenomena, spanning from motility-induced phase separation to phototaxis to topological excitations depending on the nature and parameters of the system. In the present paper, we consider micelle formation by active particles with a broken symmetry having a circular back and a sharpened nose toward which the particles accelerate. As we demonstrate in experiments with robotic swarms, such particles can either remain in the isotropic phase or form micelles depending on the location of their center of inertia, in accordance with a recent theoretical proposal [T. Kruglov and A. Borisov, Presentations and Videos to 7th Edition of the International Conference on Particle-based Methods (2021), Vol. CT07, p. 2]. Such a behavior is observed for both nonchiral particles moving linearly and placed in a parabolic potential and for chiral particles moving along circular trajectories on a flat surface. By performing experiments with single robots and two-robot collisions, we unveil that the observed emergence of micellization associated with shifting robots' center of inertia towards their noses is governed by at least two-particle effects, in particular, by a difference in the formation of stable two-robot clusters. Finally, we consider the dependence of micelle lifetime and formation probability as well as two-robot collisions on friction between the lateral surfaces of the robots. Crucially, the predicted micellization does not involve any solvation shells that give rise to the micellization of surfactants but is instead driven by an interplay of activity and particle shape asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Nested economies of scale in global city mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A longstanding puzzle in urban science is whether there's an intrinsic match between human populations and the mass of their built environments. Previous findings have revealed various urban properties scaling nonlinearly with population, yet existing models of city built mass are still dominated by per-capita linear thinking. Our analysis of &gt;3,000 cities globally reveals universal sublinear scaling of city mass with population at both the city (\{beta}=0.90) and neighborhood levels ({\delta}=0.75). This means that larger cities and denser neighborhoods achieve economies of scale with less per-capita built mass. Our theoretical framework further shows that city-level scaling emerges naturally from within-city disparities. This multi-scale understanding redefines "over-built" and "under-built" conditions as deviations from expected scaling patterns, implying either excessive environmental impacts or inadequate living standards. Effective urban policy thus requires moving beyond simple per-capita assumptions, adopting scale-adjusted metrics and managing cities as nested, complex systems.</description>
