      <title>Weak-Lensing Characterization of the Dark Matter in 29 Merging Clusters that Exhibit Radio Relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiwavelength analysis of 29 merging galaxy clusters that exhibit radio relics. For each merging system, we perform a weak-lensing analysis on Subaru optical imaging. We generate high-resolution mass maps of the dark matter distributions, which are critical for discerning the merging constituents. Combining the weak-lensing detections with X-ray emission, radio emission, and galaxy redshifts, we discuss the formation of radio relics from the past collision. For each subcluster, we obtain mass estimates by fitting a multi-component NFW model with and without a concentration-mass relation. Comparing the two mass estimate techniques, we find that the concentration-mass relation underestimates (overestimates) the mass relative to fitting both parameters for high- (low-) mass subclusters. We compare the mass estimates of each subcluster to their velocity dispersion measurements and find that they preferentially lie below the expected velocity dispersion scaling relation, especially at the low-mass end (~$10^{14}\ M_\odot$). We show that the majority of the clusters that exhibit radio relics are in major mergers with a mass ratio below 1:4. We investigate the position of the mass peak relative to the galaxy luminosity peak, number density peak, and BCG locations and find that the BCG tends to better trace the mass peak position. Finally, we update a golden sample of 8 galaxy clusters that have the simplest geometries and can provide the cleanest picture of the past merger, which we recommend for further investigation to constrain the nature of dark matter and the acceleration process that leads to radio relics.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity interpretation of the evolving dark energy in light of DESI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration has recently released measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) from the first year of observations. A joint analysis of DESI BAO, CMB, and SN Ia probes indicates a preference for time-evolving dark energy. We evaluate the robustness of this preference by replacing the DESI distance measurements at $z&lt;0.8$ with the SDSS BAO measurements in a similar redshift range. Assuming the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we find an evolution of the dark energy equation of state parameters consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. Our analysis of $\chi^2$ statistics across various BAO datasets shows that DESI's preference for evolving dark energy is primarily driven by the two LRG samples at $z_{\rm eff}=0.51$ and $z_{\rm eff}=0.71$, with the latter having the most significant impact.
  Taking this preference seriously, we study a general Horndeski scalar-tensor theory, which provides a physical mechanism to safely cross the phantom divide, $w=-1$. Utilizing the Effective Field Theory of dark energy and adopting the $w_0w_a$CDM background cosmological model, we derive constraints on the parameters $w_0=-0.856\pm0.062$ and $w_a=-0.53_{-0.26}^{+0.28}$ at $68\%$ CL from Planck CMB, Planck and ACT CMB lensing, DESI BAO, and Pantheon+ datasets, showing good consistency with the standard $w_0w_a$CDM model. The modified gravity model shows a preference over $\Lambda$CDM at the $2.4\sigma$ level, while for $w_0w_a$CDM it is at $2.5\sigma$. We conclude that modified gravity offers a viable physical explanation for DESI's preference for evolving dark energy.</description>

      <title>Repository for extended dark matter object constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended dark matter objects (EDOs) are popular dark matter candidates that interact gravitationally with the Standard Model. These gravitational interactions can be used to constrain their allowed parameter space. However, EDOs can have different formation mechanisms, sizes, and shapes, requiring a case-by-case analysis when studying their impact on different areas of cosmology. We thus present a repository of all available bounds for these objects, with a code that allows plotting user-defined combinations of all up-to-date bounds for a given shape and different radii. We propose a standard for the EDOs' mass profiles so that different sets of bounds are consistent with each other, and provide instructions on using the code and contributing to the repository.</description>

      <title>Percolation Statistics in the MillenniumTNG Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistical analysis of cosmic large-scale structure is most often based on simple two-point summary statistics, like the power spectrum or the two-point correlation function of a sample of galaxies or other types of tracers. In contrast, topological measures of clustering are also sensitive to higher-order correlations, and thus offer the prospect to access additional information that may harbor important constraining power. We here revisit one such geometric measure of the cosmic web in the form of the so-called percolation analysis, using the recent MillenniumTNG simulation suite of the LCDM paradigm. We analyze continuum percolation statistics both for high resolution dark matter particle distributions, as well as for galaxy mock catalogues from a semi-analytic galaxy formation model within a periodic simulation volume of 3000 Mpc on a side. For comparison, we also investigate the percolation statistics of random particle sets and neutrino distributions with two different summed particle masses. We find that the percolation statistics of the dark matter distribution evolves strongly with redshift and thus clustering strength, yielding progressively lower percolation threshold towards later times. However, there is a sizable residual dependence on numerical resolution which we interpret as a residual influence of different levels of shot noise. This is corroborated by our analysis of galaxy mock catalogues whose results depend on sampling density more strongly than on galaxy selection criteria. While this limits the discriminative power of percolation statistics, our results suggest that it still remains useful as a complementary cosmological test when controlled for sampling density.</description>

      <title>Elevated UV luminosity density at Cosmic Dawn explained by non-evolving, weakly-mass dependent star formation efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered unexpectedly high cosmic star formation activity in the early Universe, mere hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang. These observations are often understood to reflect an evolutionary shift in star formation efficiency (SFE) caused by changing galactic conditions during these early epochs. We present FIREbox-HR, a high-resolution, cosmological hydrodynamical simulation from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project, which offers insights into the SFE of galaxies during the first billion years of cosmic time. FIREbox-HR re-simulates the cosmic volume (L = 22.1 cMpc) of the original FIREbox run with eight times higher mass resolution (m_b ~ 7800 M_sun), but with identical physics, down to z ~ 6. FIREbox-HR predicts ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions in good agreement with available observational data. The simulation also successfully reproduces the observed cosmic UV luminosity density at z ~ 6 - 14, demonstrating that relatively high star formation activity in the early Universe is a natural outcome of the baryonic processes encoded in the FIRE-2 model. According to FIREbox-HR, the SFE - halo mass relation for intermediate mass halos (M_halo ~ 10^9 - 10^11 M_sun) does not significantly evolve with redshift and is only weakly mass-dependent. These properties of the SFE - halo mass relation lead to a larger contribution from lower mass halos at higher z, driving the gradual evolution of the observed cosmic UV luminosity density. A theoretical model based on the SFE - halo mass relation inferred from FIREbox-HR allows us to explore implications for galaxy evolution. Future observations of UV faint galaxies at z &gt; 12 will provide an opportunity to further test these predictions and deepen our understanding of star formation during Cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>Alcock-Paczy\'nski effect on void-finding: Implications for void-galaxy cross-correlation modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under the assumption of statistical isotropy, and in the absence of directional selection effects, a stack of voids is expected to be spherically symmetric, which makes it an excellent object to use for an Alcock-Paczy\'nski (AP) test. This is commonly done using the void-galaxy cross-correlation function (CCF), which has emerged as a competitive probe, especially in combination with the galaxy-galaxy auto correlation function. Current studies of the AP effect around voids assume that the void centre positions transform under the choice of fiducial cosmology in the same way as galaxy positions. We show that this assumption, though prevalent in the literature, is complicated by the response of void-finding algorithms to shifts in tracer positions. Using stretched simulation boxes to emulate the AP effect, we investigate how the void-galaxy CCF changes under AP, revealing an additional effect imprinted in the CCF that must be accounted for. The effect comes from the response of void finders to the distorted tracer field, reducing the amplitude of the AP signal in the CCF, and thus depends on the specific void finding algorithm used. We present results for four different void finding packages: $\texttt{revolver}$, $\texttt{vide}$, $\texttt{voxel}$, and the spherical void finder in the $\texttt{Pylians3}$ library, demonstrating how incorrect treatment of the AP effect results in biases in the recovered parameters for all of them. Finally, we propose a method to alleviate this issue without resorting to complex and finder-specific modelling of the void finder response to AP.</description>

Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves have crucial implications for the origin of the universe and fundamental physics. Using currently available cosmic microwave background data from Planck, WMAP, ACT and SPT separately or their combinations with BK18 B-mode polarization and DESI observations, we find the evidence of primordial gravitational waves at beyond the $5\,\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Linear Relativistic Corrections in the Spherical Fourier-Bessel Power Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-dimensional galaxy power spectrum is a powerful probe of primordial non-Gaussianity and additional general relativistic (GR) effects on large scales, which can be constrained by the current and upcoming large-scale structure surveys. In this work, we calculate the linear-order relativistic power spectrum in the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) basis, a coordinate system that preserves the geometry of the curved sky and fully accounts for the wide-angle effect. In particular, we model the GR effects present in the discrete SFB power spectrum, which is a more efficient and stable decomposition of the galaxy density field compared to the continuous SFB basis in the presence of radial windows. To validate our GR calculations, we introduce a mapping between the angular power spectrum and the SFB power spectrum, and we compare our calculations with outputs from CLASS. We discuss the rich pattern of GR effects in the SFB basis and compare the GR effects to the local primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) effect. The Doppler and lensing effects have different angular and Fourier dependence compared to the PNG in the SFB basis, while the gravitational potential term is more degenerate with the PNG and comparable to a signal of $f_{\rm NL}\sim 1$. We also discuss the potential opportunities of extracting the lensing effect through SFB modes in upcoming LSS surveys.</description>

      <title>Shaping Galaxies from the Beginning: Shaking the Cusp by Non-power-law Primordial Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider three cosmological models with non-power-law spectra of primordial density perturbations and test them against $\Lambda$CDM in density profiles. We found that, despite the significant difference in initial conditions, the mean density profiles of all models are still close to the Navarro-Frenk-White one, albeit with some dispersion. We demonstrate that the density profile slopes in the innermost part of halo have a significant evolution with $z$, which can be used to identify the cosmological model. We also present a toy model resulting in the appearance of core in the central part of gravitationally bound dark matter halo.</description>

      <title>Insights from Large-Scale Communications: Initiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper offers an original theoretical framework to quantify the information content associated with cosmological structure formation. The formalism is developed and employed to study the spectrum of information underlying the galaxy distribution in the observable Universe. Using data from SDSS DR18 we further quantify the information sharing across different parts of the studied volume. An attempt to validate the assumption of cosmic homogeneity is made, which rules out the presence of a Universal scale of uniformity below $130 h^{-1}$ Mpc. In addition, an analytical study is carried out to track back the evolution of global information content up to $z=20$, where a log-normal density distribution with redshift-dependent variance, skewness, and kurtosis is used to mimic the observable Universe. A staggering $ 8 \times 10^{144} TB$ of information loss is estimated, caused by the formation of large-scale structures in the present universe. We further illustrate how the global information budget is impacted at different epochs by the interaction between the expansion rate and growth rate of structure, taking the $\Lambda CDM$ model into account. It is found that while the growth rate of the global information content is slowing down, information loss is increasing dramatically despite an ongoing accelerated expansion.</description>

      <title>Effect of Lyman-$\alpha$ Radiative Transfer on Intensity Mapping Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emitting galaxies (LAEs) is a useful probe of cosmology. However, Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer (RT) effects, such as absorption, line shift, and line broadening, and their dependence on the large-scale density and velocity fields can modify the measured LAE clustering and line intensity mapping (LIM) statistics. We explore the effect of RT on the Ly$\alpha$ LIM power spectrum in two ways: using an analytic description based on linear approximations and using lognormal mocks. The qualitative effect of intergalactic Ly$\alpha$ absorption on the LIM auto- and cross-power spectrum is a scale-dependent, reduced effective bias, reduced mean intensity, and modified redshift-space distortions. The linear absorption model does not describe the results of the lognormal simulations well. The random line shift suppresses the redshift-space power spectrum similar to the Fingers-of-God effect. In cross-correlation of LAEs or Ly$\alpha$ intensity with a non-Ly$\alpha$ tracer, the Ly$\alpha$ line shift leads to a phase shift of the complex power spectrum, i.e. a cosine damping of the real part. Line broadening from RT suppresses the LIM power spectra in the same way as limited spectral resolution. We study the impact of Ly$\alpha$ RT effects on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) LAE and LIM power spectra using lognormal mocks. We find that even small amounts of IGM absorption will significantly change the measured LAE auto-power spectrum and the LAE-intensity cross-power spectrum. Therefore, HETDEX will be able to constrain Ly$\alpha$ RT effects.</description>

      <title>Closing Pandora's Box -- The deepest X-ray observations of Abell 2744 and a multi-wavelength merger picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abell 2744, also known as Pandora's Cluster, is a complex merging galaxy cluster. While a major merger is clear along the north-south axis, the dynamical state of the northwest subcluster has been highly uncertain. We present ultra-deep ($\approx$2.1 Ms) X-ray observations of Abell 2744 obtained with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and reinterpret the multi-wavelength picture with a suite of idealised simulations of galaxy cluster mergers. The new data reveal in unprecedented detail the disruption of cool cores in the three X-ray luminous subclusters and confirm the presence of a shock to the NW. A position-velocity clustering of the cluster member galaxies shows a clearly separated S2 component, with a $\Delta z$ implying a separation of 53 Mpc or a line-of-sight velocity of $4500\ \rm{km \ s^{-1}}$, or likely some combination of the two. While binary simulations allow NW to have undergone a gravitational slingshot after the first pericenter passage, triple merger simulations rule out this scenario, because the two mergers would have had to occur $\sim$0.5 Gyr apart, and the joint impact of the shocks from the two mergers would completely disrupt the SE and NW cool cores; they only reform after 1-2 Gyr, by which point the core separations greatly exceed observations. The scenario that best describes Abell 2744 is a head-on N-S merger $0.5-0.6$ Gyrs ago followed by a first infall of the NW subcluster. Furthermore, we note that a model with three cluster-size halos, with masses consistent with gravitational lensing constraints, nevertheless produces a lensing convergence and surface brightness lower than observed in most of the field of view, whereas the temperatures are consistent with observations. This suggests the presence of a large-scale overdensity, which contributes to the diffuse emission and total surface density without heating the densest gas.</description>

      <title>Measuring cosmic expansion with diffractive gravitational scintillation of nanoHertz gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ultra-long wavelength gravitational waves through the advent of pulsar timing arrays (PTA) has opened up new avenues for fundamental science. Here we show that every PTA source will be diffractively lensed by potentially hundreds of galactic disks transverse to its line of sight, leading to modest modulations in the strain, $\Delta h / h \sim 10^{-3} \lambda^{-1}_{1 \rm pc.}$, due to wave lensing effects. The induced interference, or scintillation, pattern will be resolvable by coherent PTAs and may be leveraged, alongside fore-ground redshift information, to make precise measurements of cosmic expansion. If future PTA experiments can achieve enough signal-to-noise to detect these small modulations, hundreds of redshift-distance pairs may be inferred from the diffractive lensing of an individual PTA source.</description>

      <title>Modelling the BOSS void-galaxy cross-correlation function using a neural-network emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an emulator-based method to model the cross-correlation between cosmological voids and galaxies. This allows us to model the effect of cosmology on void finding and on the shape of the void-galaxy cross-correlation function, improving on previous template-based methods. We train a neural network using the AbacusSummit simulation suite and fit to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey sample. We recover information on the growth of structure through redshift-space distortions (RSD), and the geometry of the Universe through the Alcock-Paczy\'nski (AP) effect, measuring $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.330\pm 0.020$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.777^{+0.047}_{-0.062}$ for a $\Lambda \rm{CDM}$ cosmology. Comparing to results from a template-based method, we find that fitting the shape of the void-galaxy cross-correlation function provides more information and leads to an improvement in constraining power. In contrast, we find that errors on the AP measurements were previously underestimated if void centres were assumed to have the same response to the AP effect as galaxies - a common simplification. Overall, we recover a $28\%$ reduction in errors for $\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ and similar errors on $\sigma_8$ with our new, more comprehensive, method. Given the statistical power of future surveys including DESI and Euclid, we expect the method presented to become the new baseline for the analysis of voids in these data.</description>

      <title>Searching for a dark matter induced galactic axion gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ultra-light axion with CP violating interactions with a dark sector and CP preserving interactions with the visible sector can act as a novel portal between dark matter and the Standard Model. In such theories, dark matter sources an axion field extending over the entire galaxy, the gradient of which can be searched for with precise spin precession experiments. A reinterpretation of existing co-magnetometer data already constrains theories that are consistent with astrophysical bounds, and near-future experiments will begin probing well-motivated models. The required interactions can arise from a confining hidden sector without necessitating fine-tuning of the axion's mass.</description>

      <title>Vortex-p: a Helmholtz-Hodge and Reynolds decomposition algorithm for particle-based simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical turbulent flows display an intrinsically multi-scale nature, making their numerical simulation and the subsequent analyses of simulated data a complex problem. In particular, two fundamental steps in the study of turbulent velocity fields are the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition (compressive+solenoidal; HHD) and the Reynolds decomposition (bulk+turbulent; RD). These problems are relatively simple to perform numerically for uniformly-sampled data, such as the one emerging from Eulerian, fix-grid simulations; but their computation is remarkably more complex in the case of non-uniformly sampled data, such as the one stemming from particle-based or meshless simulations. In this paper, we describe, implement and test vortex-p, a publicly available tool evolved from the vortex code, to perform both these decompositions upon the velocity fields of particle-based simulations, either from smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), moving-mesh or meshless codes. The algorithm relies on the creation of an ad-hoc adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) set of grids, on which the input velocity field is represented. HHD is then addressed by means of elliptic solvers, while for the RD we adapt an iterative, multi-scale filter. We perform a series of idealised tests to assess the accuracy, convergence and scaling of the code. Finally, we present some applications of the code to various SPH and meshless finite-mass (MFM) simulations of galaxy clusters performed with OpenGadget3, with different resolutions and physics, to showcase the capabilities of the code.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of ringdown with excitation factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In black hole perturbation formalism, the gravitational waveform is obtained by the convolution of the Green's function and the source term causing radiation emission. Hence, the ringdown properties, namely its start time, depend on both functions. The unknown time-shift encoded in the Green's function introduces a "time-shift problem" for ringdown. We study the ringdown time-shift problem by reconstructing a waveform via the excitation factors of quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a spinning black hole. For the first time, we reconstruct ringdown with a significant number of QNMs weighted with their excitation factors and confirm its excellent convergence. We then precisely identify the ringdown starting time. We also find (i) that for moderate or large spins and $\ell=m=2$, QNMs should be included up to around the $20$th prograde overtones and around fifth retrograde overtones to reconstruct the ringdown waveform for the delta-function source with a mismatch threshold ${\cal M} &lt; {\cal O}(10^{-3})$. For higher angular modes, a more significant number of QNMs are necessary to reconstruct it; (ii) that the time shift of ringdown caused by the Green's function is the same for different $(\ell, m, n)$ modes but that nontrivial sources can change this conclusion. Finally, we demonstrate (iii) that the greybody factor can be reconstructed with the superposed QNM spectrum in the frequency domain.</description>

      <title>A Precise Fitting Formula for Gravitational Wave Spectra from Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining a precise form for the predicted gravitational wave (GW) spectrum from a phase transition is a topic of great relevance for beyond Standard Model (BSM) physicists. Currently, the most sophisticated semi-analytic framework for estimating the dominant contribution to the spectrum is the sound shell model; however, full calculations within this framework can be computationally expensive, especially for large-scale scans. The community therefore generally manages with fit functions to the GW spectrum, the most widely used of which is a single broken power law. We provide a more precise fit function based on the sound shell model: our fit function features a double broken power law with two frequency breaks corresponding to the two characteristic length scales of the problem -- inter-bubble spacing and thickness of sound shells, the second of which is neglected in the single broken power law fit. Compared to previously proposed fits, we demonstrate that our fit function more faithfully captures the GW spectrum coming from a full calculation of the sound shell model, over most of the space of the thermodynamic parameters governing the phase transition. The physical origins of the fit parameters and their dependence on the thermodynamic parameters are studied in the underlying sound shell model: in particular, we perform a series of detailed scans for these quantities over the plane of the strength of the phase transition ($\alpha$) and the bubble wall velocity ($v_w$). Wherever possible, we comment on the physical interpretations of these scans. The result of our study can be used to generate accurate GW spectra with our fit function, given initial inputs of $\alpha$, $v_w$, $\beta/H$ (nucleation rate parameter) and $T_n$ (nucleation temperature) for the relevant BSM scenario.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum from inflation/bouncing Universe in VCDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the non-linear interactions within the VCDM model, a type II minimally modified gravity model with the same number of degrees of freedom as in General Relativity but not connected to the latter by field redefinitions. During an inflationary phase in the early universe, if the VCDM potential does not modify the slow-roll behavior of the inflaton field, we recover, up to the leading order, the standard results for the bispectrum in slow-roll inflation. On the other hand, if the VCDM potential becomes dominant, the interactions can strongly deviate and even violate the Maldacena's consistency relation for the local non-Gaussianities. Furthermore, we apply the formalism to the recently introduced bouncing model in VCDM, and show that the bispectrum still respects current observational constraints. Future measurements on non-Gaussianities of the local type should provide the test ground for the model's validity.</description>

      <title>High-speed reconstruction of long-duration gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals using sparse dictionary learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring accurate long-duration gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) could provide scientifically fruitful knowledge of massive black hole populations and robust tests for general relatively during the LISA mission. However, the immense computational requirements surrounding EMRI data processing and analysis makes their detection and analysis challenging. We further develop and explore a sparse dictionary learning (SDL) algorithm to expeditiously reconstruct EMRI gravitational waveforms lasting as long as 1 year. A suite of year-long EMRI systems are studied to understand the detection and accurate waveform retrieval prospects of the method. We show that full-year EMRIs can be reconstructed within 2 minutes, some with a false alarm rate less than 0.001/yr and with 1.16 day time windows with mismatch as low as 0.06. This provides an encouraging prospect to use the SDL method for long-duration GW searches like that for EMRIs in this study.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high Frequency Gravitational Waves from Scattering, Bremsstrahlung and Decay during Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate ultra-high frequency gravitational waves (GWs) from gravitons generated during inflationary reheating. Specifically, we study inflaton scattering with its decay product, where the couplings involved in this $2 \to 2$ scattering are the same as those in the $1 \to 3$ graviton Bremsstrahlung process. We compute the graviton production rate via such $2 \to 2$ scattering. Additionally, we compare the resulting GW spectrum with that from Bremsstrahlung as well as that from pure $2 \to 2$ inflaton scatterings. For completeness, the GW spectrum from graviton pair production through one-loop induced $1 \to 2$ inflaton decay is also analyzed. With a systematic comparison among the four sources of GWs, we find that $2 \to 2$ inflaton scattering with its decay product can dominate over Bremsstrahlung if the reheating temperature is larger than the inflaton mass. Pure inflaton $2 \to 2$ scattering is typically subdominant compared to Bremsstrahlung except in the high-frequency tail. The contribution from one-loop induced $1 \to 2$ inflaton decay is shown to be suppressed compared to Bremsstrahlung and pure inflaton $2 \to 2$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Spin speed correlations and the evolution of galaxy-halo systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy angular momenta (spins) contain valuable cosmological information, complementing their positions and velocities. The baryonic spin direction of galaxies has been probed as a reliable tracer of their host halos and the primordial spin modes. Here we use the TNG100 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project to study the spin magnitude correlations between dark matter, gas, and stellar components of galaxy-halo systems and their evolutions across cosmic history. We find that these components generate similar initial spin magnitudes from the same tidal torque in Lagrangian space. At low redshifts, the gas component still traces the spin magnitude of the dark matter halo and the primordial spin magnitude. However, the traceability of the stellar component depends on the $ex$ $situ$ stellar mass fraction, $f_{\rm acc}$. Our results suggest that the galaxy baryonic spin magnitude can also serve as a tracer of their host halo and the initial perturbations, and the galaxy-halo correlations are affected by the similarity of their evolution histories.</description>

      <title>Weighing Milky Way and Andromeda in an Expanding $\Lambda$CDM Universe: Resolving the Local Group mass tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of the Local Group (LG), especially the contribution of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies, is sensitive to the presence of dark energy. This work compares the evolution of the LG by considering it as a two-body problem in a homogeneous and isotropic expanding spacetime in a full $\Lambda$CDM background. Using the Timing Argument (which links LG dynamics to LG mass) we find that the full $\Lambda$CDM background predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ lower mass for the LG while $\Lambda$ alone predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ higher mass. By the calibration of the IllustrisTNG simulations, the TA mass is shown to be biased high, and modified to be $\left(3.89 \pm 0.62\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the MW Center Of Mass (COM) reduce the LG mass to be $\left(2.33 \pm 0.72\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. The overall estimated mass is compatible with the total sum of masses of MW and M31 (including their halos) estimated independently. The mass also is compatible with other estimations such as the Hubble flow, the Virial Theorem with the other dwarf galaxies and different Machine Learning methods based on LG-like pairs from simulations. These results resolve the controversy between the TA based estimations and the other probes in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate scalar-induced gravitational waves (GWs) generated in the post-inflationary universe to infer new limits on warm inflation. We specifically examine the evolution of primordial GWs produced by scalar perturbations produced during the radiation-dominated epoch. For this purpose, we assume a weak regime of warm inflation under the slow-roll approximation, with a dissipation coefficient linearly dependent on the temperature of the radiation bath. We then derive analytical expressions for the curvature power spectrum and the scalar index, in the cases of chaotic and exponential potentials of the inflationary field. Subsequently, we compare the theoretical predictions regarding the relic energy density of GWs with the stochastic GW background signal recently detected by the NANOGrav collaboration through the use of pulsar timing array measurements. In so doing, we obtain numerical constraints on the free parameters of the inflationary models under study. Finally, we conduct a model selection analysis through the Bayesian inference method to measure the statistical performance of the different theoretical scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Like many areas of astrophysics and cosmology, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be transformational for almost all the applications of strong lensing, thanks to the dramatic increase in the number of known strong lenses by two orders of magnitude or more and the readily available time-domain data for the lenses with transient sources. In this article, we provide an overview of the forecasted number of discovered lenses of different types and describe the primary science cases these large lens samples will enable. We provide an updated forecast on the joint constraint for the dark energy equation-of-state parameters, $w_0$ and $w_a$, from combining all strong lensing probes of dark energy. We update the previous forecast from the Rubin Observatory Dark Energy Science Collaboration's Science Review Document by adding two new crucial strong lensing samples: lensed Type Ia supernovae and single-deflector lenses with measured stellar kinematics. Finally, we describe the current and near-future activities and collaborative efforts within the strong lensing community in preparation for the arrival of the first real dataset from Rubin in early 2026.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy of the triply-lensed $z = 10.17$ galaxy MACS0647$-$JD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.03042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of MACS0647-JD, the triply-lensed $z \sim 11$ candidate discovered in HST imaging and spatially resolved by JWST imaging into two components A and B. Spectroscopy of component A yields a spectroscopic redshift $z=10.17$ based on 7 detected emission lines: CIII] $\lambda\lambda$1907,1909, [OII] $\lambda$3727, [NeIII] $\lambda$3869, [NeIII] $\lambda$3968, H$\delta$ $\lambda$4101, H$\gamma$ $\lambda$4340, and [OIII] $\lambda$4363. These are the second-most distant detections of these emission lines to date, in a galaxy observed just 460 million years after the Big Bang. Based on observed and extrapolated line flux ratios we derive a gas-phase metallicity $Z =$ log(O/H) = $7.5 - 8.0$, or $(0.06 - 0.2)$ $Z_\odot$, ionization parameter log($U$) $\sim -1.9\pm0.2$, and an ionizing photon production efficiency ${\rm log}(\xi_{\rm ion})=25.2\pm0.2\,$erg$^{-1}$ Hz. The spectrum has a softened Lyman-$\alpha$ break, evidence for a strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wing, suggesting that MACS0647-JD was unable to ionize its surroundings beyond its immediate vicinity ($R_{\text{HII}} \ll 1$ pMpc). The Ly$\alpha$ damping wing also suppresses the F150W photometry, explaining the slightly overestimated photometric redshift $z = 10.6 \pm 0.3$. MACS0647-JD has a stellar mass log($M/M_\odot$) = $8.1 \pm 0.3$, including $\sim$ 6$\times 10^7 M_\odot$ in component A, most of which formed recently (within $\sim$ 20 Myr) with a star formation rate $2\pm1 M_\odot$ / yr, all within an effective radius $70\pm24\,$pc. The smaller component B ($r \sim 20$) pc is likely older ($\sim$100 Myr) with more dust ($A_V \sim 0.1$ mag), as found previously. Spectroscopy of a fainter companion galaxy C separated by a distance of \about\ 3$\,$kpc reveals a Lyman break consistent with $z = 10.17$. MACS0647-JD is likely the most distant galaxy merger known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility that dark matter re-enters kinetic equilibrium with a radiation bath after kinetic decoupling, a scenario we dub kinetic recoupling. This naturally occurs, for instance, with certain types of resonantly-enhanced interactions, or as the result of a phase transition. While late kinetic decoupling damps structure on small scales below a cutoff, kinetic recoupling produces more complex changes in the power spectrum that depend on the nature and extent of the recoupling period. We explore the features that kinetic recoupling imprints upon the matter power spectrum, and discuss how such features can be traced to dark matter microphysics with future observations.</description>

This parameter is difficult to compute, especially in phase transitions in strongly coupled theories. In this work, we present a method to estimate the wall velocity for phase transitions with a large enthalpy jump, valid for weakly and strongly coupled theories. We find that detonations are disfavored in this limit, but wall velocities are not necessarily small. We also investigate the effect of two other features in the equation of state: non-conformal sound speeds and a limited range of temperatures for which the phases exist. We find that the former can increase the wall velocity for a given nucleation temperature, and the latter can restrict the wall velocities to small values. To test our approach, we use holographic phase transitions, which typically display these three features. We find excellent agreement with numerically obtained values of the wall velocity. We also demonstrate that the implications for gravitational waves can be significant.</description>

      <title>Overview and public data release of the augmented Auriga Project: cosmological simulations of dwarf and Milky Way-mass galaxies</title>

Abstract: We present an extended suite of the Auriga cosmological gravo-magnetohydrodynamical "zoom-in" simulations of 40 Milky Way-mass halos and 26 dwarf galaxy-mass halos run with the moving-mesh code Arepo. Auriga adopts the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmogony and includes a comprehensive galaxy formation physics model following the coupled cosmic evolution of dark matter, gas, stars, and supermassive black holes which has been shown to produce numerically well-converged galaxy properties for Milky Way-mass systems. We describe the first public data release of this augmented suite of Auriga simulations, which includes raw snapshots, group catalogues, merger trees, initial conditions, and supplementary data, as well as public analysis tools with worked examples of how to use the data. To demonstrate the value and robustness of the simulation predictions, we analyse a series of low-redshift global properties that compare well with many observed scaling relations, such as the Tully-Fisher relation, the star-forming main sequence, and HI gas fraction/disc thickness. Finally, we show that star-forming gas discs appear to build rotation and velocity dispersion rapidly for $z\gtrsim 3$ before they "settle" into ever-increasing rotation-dispersion ratios ($V/\sigma$). This evolution appears to be in rough agreement with some kinematic measurements from H$\alpha$ observations, and demonstrates an application of how to utilise the released data.</description>

      <title>Loop Blow-up Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new model of string inflation driven by a blow-up K\"ahler modulus of type IIb compactifications with a potential generated by string loops. Slow-roll is naturally realized thanks to the fact that the blow-up mode is a leading-order flat direction lifted by string loops which are unavoidable and generate a plateau at large field values. We check that throughout the whole inflationary dynamics the effective field theory is under control. We perform a phenomenological analysis determining the exact number of efoldings by studying the post-inflationary evolution. We determine the values of the microscopic parameters which lead to agreement with CMB data, together with the prediction of a tensor-to-scalar ratio of order $r\sim 10^{-5}$.</description>

      <title>Kinematic morphology of low-mass galaxies in IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of diverse kinematic morphologies observed in low-mass galaxies is unclear. In this study, we investigate the kinematic morphologies of central galaxies with stellar mass $10^{8.5-9.0} M_\odot$ at $z=0$ in the TNG50-1 cosmological simulation. The majority of the low-mass galaxies in TNG50-1 are dispersion-dominated, consistent with observations. By tracing the evolutionary histories of simulated low-mass galaxies, we find that while most stars form in rotating cold gas discs, the orientation of the star-forming discs relative to the galaxies may evolve with cosmic time. If the cold gas disc remains aligning with the galaxy during its evolution, stars formed at different times share the same rotational direction, leading to a rotation-dominated system. On the contrary, frequent misalignment of cold gas disc would result in a dispersion-dominated system. In addition, we also find that the two-body scattering can have a non-negligible numerical heating effect on the simulated galaxy morphology, especially at central regions of galaxies and for relatively low-mass galaxies. By comparing results of simulations with different resolutions, our results suggest that the simulated morphology of galaxies is roughly reliable when their number of stellar particles exceeds about $10^{4}$, and bulge morphology of galaxies can not be resolved robustly at the resolution level of TNG50-1.</description>
