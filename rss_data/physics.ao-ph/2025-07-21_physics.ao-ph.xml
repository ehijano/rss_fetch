      <title>A Simple Intermediate Coupled MJO-ENSO Model: Multiscale Interactions and ENSO Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) and the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are two dominant modes of tropical climate variability, each with profound global weather impacts. While their individual dynamics have been widely studied, their coupled interactions, particularly in the context of ENSO complexity, including spatial diversity (Central Pacific vs. Eastern Pacific events), temporal evolution (single-year and multi-year events), and intensity variations (moderate to extreme events), have received limited attention in modeling studies. In this paper, a simple intermediate coupled MJO-ENSO model is developed to address critical gaps in understanding their bidirectional feedback and its role in modulating ENSO complexity. The model integrates multiscale processes, bridging intraseasonal (MJO), interannual (ENSO), and decadal (Walker circulation) variability. Key mechanisms include: (1) interannual SST modulating MJO through latent heat and background states, (2) MJO-induced wind forcing triggering diverse ENSO events, and (3) decadal variability modulating the strength and occurrence frequency of Eastern Pacific and Central Pacific events. Effective stochastic parameterizations are incorporated to improve the characterization of multiscale MJO-ENSO interactions and the emergence of intermittency and extremes. The model captures several crucial observed MJO and ENSO features, including non-Gaussian statistics, seasonal cycles, energy spectra, and spatial event patterns. It also reproduces critical MJO-ENSO interactions: warm pool edge extension, convective activity adjustments that modulate SST, and ENSO's dependence on MJO-driven easterly and westerly wind anomalies. The model provides a useful tool to analyze long-term variations. It also advances the understanding of ENSO extreme events and their remote impacts, as well as seasonal forecasting and climate resilience.</description>

      <title>Learning Climate Sensitivity from Future Observations, Fast and Slow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate sensitivity has remained stubbornly uncertain since the Charney Report was published some 45 years ago. Two factors in future climate projections could alter this dilemma: (i) an increased ratio of CO$_2$ forcing relative to aerosol cooling, owing to both continued accumulation of CO$_2$ and declining aerosol emissions, and (ii) a warming world, whereby CO$_2$-induced warming becomes more pronounced relative to climate variability. Here, we develop a novel modeling approach to explore the rates of learning about equilibrium climate sensitivity and the transient climate response (TCR) and identify the physical drivers underpinning these learning rates. Our approach has the advantage over past work by accounting for the full spectrum of parameter uncertainties and covariances, while also taking into account serially correlated internal climate variability. Moreover, we provide a physical explanation of how quickly we may hope to learn about climate sensitivity. We find that, although we are able to constrain future TCR regardless of the true underlying value, constraining ECS is more difficult, with low values of ECS being more easily ascertained than high values. This asymmetry can be explained by most of the warming this century being attributable to the fast climate mode, which is more useful for constraining TCR than it is for ECS. We further show that our inability to constrain the deep ocean response is what limits our ability to learn high values of ECS.</description>

      <title>Reanalysis-based Global Radiative Response to Sea Surface Temperature Patterns: Evaluating the Ai2 Climate Emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity of the radiative flux at the top of the atmosphere to surface temperature perturbations cannot be directly observed. The relationship between sea surface temperature (SST) and top-of-atmosphere radiation can be estimated with Green's function simulations by locally perturbing the sea surface temperature boundary conditions in atmospheric climate models. We perform such simulations with the Ai2 Climate Emulator (ACE), a machine learning-based emulator trained on ERA5 reanalysis data (ACE2-ERA5). This produces a sensitivity map of the top-of-atmosphere radiative response to surface warming that aligns with our physical understanding of radiative feedbacks. However, ACE2-ERA5 likely underestimates the radiative response to historical warming. We compare to two additional versions of ACE and traditional climate models. We argue that Green's function experiments can be used to evaluate the performance and limitations of machine learning-based climate emulators by examining if causal physical relationships are correctly represented and testing their capability for out-of-distribution predictions.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-permitting machine learning reveals sources of dynamic sea level predictability across daily-to-seasonal timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable dynamic sea level forecasts are hindered by numerous sources of uncertainty on daily-to-seasonal timescales (1-180 days) due to atmospheric boundary conditions and internal ocean variability. Studies have demonstrated that certain initial states can extend predictability horizons; thus, identifying these initial conditions may help improve forecast skill. Here, we identify sources of dynamic sea level predictability on daily-to-seasonal timescales using neural networks trained on CESM2 large ensemble data to forecast dynamic sea level. The forecasts yield not only a point estimate for sea level but also a standard deviation to quantify forecast uncertainty based on the initial conditions. Forecasted uncertainties can be leveraged to identify state-dependent sources of predictability at most locations and forecast leads. Network forecasts, particularly in the low-latitude Indo-Pacific, exhibit skillful deterministic predictions and skillfully forecast exceedance probabilities relative to local linear baselines. For networks trained at Guam and in the western Indian Ocean, the transfer of sources of predictability from local sources to remote sources is presented by the deteriorating utility of initial condition information for predicting exceedance events. Propagating Rossby waves are identified as a potential source of predictability for dynamic sea level at Guam. In the Indian Ocean, persistence of thermosteric sea level anomalies from the Indian Ocean Dipole may be a source of predictability on subseasonal timescales, but El Ni\~no drives predictability on seasonal timescales. This work shows how uncertainty-quantifying machine learning can help identify changes in sources of state-dependent predictability over a range of forecast leads.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and challenges of quantum computing for climate modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptation to climate change requires robust climate projections, yet the uncertainty in these projections performed by ensembles of Earth system models (ESMs) remains large. This is mainly due to uncertainties in the representation of subgrid-scale processes such as turbulence or convection that are partly alleviated at higher resolution. New developments in machine learning-based hybrid ESMs demonstrate great potential for systematically reduced errors compared to traditional ESMs. Building on the work of hybrid (physics + AI) ESMs, we here discuss the additional potential of further improving and accelerating climate models with quantum computing. We discuss how quantum computers could accelerate climate models by solving the underlying differential equations faster, how quantum machine learning could better represent subgrid-scale phenomena in ESMs even with currently available noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, how quantum algorithms aimed at solving optimization problems could assist in tuning the many parameters in ESMs, a currently time-consuming and challenging process, and how quantum computers could aid in the analysis of climate models. We also discuss hurdles and obstacles facing current quantum computing paradigms. Strong interdisciplinary collaboration between climate scientists and quantum computing experts could help overcome these hurdles and harness the potential of quantum computing for this urgent topic.</description>
