      <title>Rings for Which f.g. Projective Modules Have the FI-extending Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A right $R$-module $M$ is said to be {\it FI-extending} if any fully invariant submodule of $M$ is essential in a direct summand of $M$. In this short note we prove that if $R$ has ACC on the right annihilators, then $R_R$ is FI-extending if, and only if, every f.g. projective module is too FI-extending. This is an affirmative answer to the question raised by Birkenmeier-Park-Rizvi in Commun. Algebra on 2002 (see \cite{2}).</description>

      <title>Inverse semialgebras and partial actions of Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a non-associative (i.e. non-necessarily associtive) inverse semialgebra over a field, the Lie version of which is inspired by the set of all partially defined derivations of a non-associative algebra, whereas the associative case is based on such examples as the set of all partially defined linear maps of a vector space, the set of all sections of the structural sheaf of a scheme, the set of all regular functions defined on open subsets of an algebraic variety and the set of all smooth real valued functions defined on open subsets of a smooth manifold. Given a Lie algebra $L$ we define the notion of a partial action of $L$ on a non-associative algebra $A$ as an appropriate premorphism and introduce a Lie inverse semialgebra $E(L),$ which is a Lie analogue of R. Exel's inverse semigroup $S(G)$ that governs the partial actions of a group $G.$ We discuss how $E(L)$ controls the premorphisms from $L$ to $A,$ obtaining results on its total control. We define the concept of an $F$-inverse Lie semialgebra and obtain Lie theoretic analogues of some classical results of the theory of inverse semigroups, namely, we show that the category of partial representations of $L$ in meet semilattices is equivalent to the category ${\mathcal F}$ of $F$-inverse Lie semialgebras with morphisms that preserve the greatest elements of $\sigma$-classes. In addition, we establish an adjunction between the category of Lie algebras and the category ${\mathcal F}.$</description>

      <title>Lie conformal superalgebras of rank (2 + 1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, Lie conformal superalgebras of rank (2 + 1) are completely classified (up to isomorphism) and their automorphism groups are determined. Furthermore, we give the classification of the finite irreducible conformal modules over them and the actions are explicitly described.</description>

      <title>Shifted twisted Yangians and finite $W$-algebras of classical type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce parabolic presentations of twisted Yangians of types AI and AII, interpolating between the R-matrix presentation and the Drinfeld presentation. Then we formulate and provide parabolic presentations for the shifted twisted Yangians. We define quotient algebras known as truncated shifted twisted Yangians and equip them with baby comultiplications, generalizing the work of Brundan and Kleshchev. PBW bases for all (truncated) shifted twisted Yangians of type AI and AII are established along the way. Applying the theory of universal equivariant quantizations of conic symplectic singularities we show that the truncated twisted shifted Yangian is isomorphic to the finite $W$-algebra which quantizes a suitable Slodowy slice. This provides a presentation of the finite $W$-algebra associated with every even nilpotent element in type {\sf B} and {\sf C}, as well as every nilpotent element with two Jordan blocks in type {\sf D}. Finally we make a conjecture which would supply presentations in the remaining even cases in type {\sf D}.</description>
