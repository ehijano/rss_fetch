      <title>Demonstration of weighted graph optimization on a Rydberg atom array using local light-shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have emerged as a versatile platform towards scalable quantum computation and optimization. In this paper we present first demonstrations of weighted graph optimization on a Rydberg atom array using annealing with local light-shifts. We verify the ability to prepare weighted graphs in 1D and 2D arrays, including embedding a five vertex non-unit disk graph using nine physical qubits. We find common annealing ramps leading to preparation of the target ground state robustly over a substantial range of different graph weightings. This work provides a route to exploring large-scale optimization of non-planar weighted graphs relevant for solving relevant real-world problems.</description>

      <title>Cross-calibration of atomic sensors for pressure metrology</title>

Abstract: Atomic sensors have shown great promise for density and pressure metrology in the high, ultra-high, and extremely-high vacuum regimes. Specifically, the density of background gas particles in vacuum can be determined by measuring the collision rate between the particles and an ensemble of sensor atoms. This requires preparing the sensor atoms in a particular quantum state, observing the rate of changes of that state, and using the cross section coefficient for state-changing collisions to convert the rate into a corresponding density. The cross section can be known by various methods including by quantum scattering calculations using an ansatz for the interaction potential between the collision pair, by measurements of the post-collision sensor-atom momentum recoil distribution, or by empirical calibration of the sensor atom at a known density. Identifying systematic errors in the results of these methods can be aided by direct comparisons between them. Alternatively, measurements of different sensor atoms exposed to the same background gas offers another point of comparison free of the systematic errors inherent in creating a background gas at a known density. Here, we present such measurements for two sensor atoms, $^{87}$Rb and $^6$Li, and a variety of atomic and molecular background gases including H$_2$, N$_2$, Ar, Ne, Kr, and Xe. We find results consistent with, yet statistically different at the level of 3.5(5)%, from recent theoretical and experiment measurements. This work demonstrates a model-free method for transferring the primacy of one atomic standard to another sensor atom and highlights the utility of sensor-atom cross-calibration experiments to check the validity of direct measurements and theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Indirect Cooling of Weakly Coupled Trapped-Ion Mechanical Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooling the motion of trapped ions to near the quantum ground state is crucial for many applications in quantum information processing and quantum metrology. However, certain motional modes of trapped-ion crystals can be difficult to cool due to weak or zero interaction between the modes and the cooling radiation, typically laser beams. We overcome this challenge by coupling a mode with weak cooling radiation interaction to one with strong cooling radiation interaction using parametric modulation of the trapping potential, thereby enabling indirect cooling of the former. In this way, we demonstrate near-ground-state cooling of motional modes with weak or zero cooling radiation interaction in multi-ion crystals of the same and mixed ion species, specifically $^9$Be$^+$-$^9$Be$^+$, $^9$Be$^+$-$^{25}$Mg$^+$, and $^9$Be$^+$-$^{25}$Mg$^+$-$^9$Be$^+$ crystals. This approach can be generally applied to any Coulomb crystal where certain motional modes cannot be directly cooled efficiently, including crystals containing molecular ions, highly-charged ions, charged fundamental particles, or charged macroscopic objects.</description>
