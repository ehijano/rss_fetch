      <title>Precise Antigen-Antibody Structure Predictions Enhance Antibody Development with HelixFold-Multimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of antigen-antibody structures is essential for advancing immunology and therapeutic development, as it helps elucidate molecular interactions that underlie immune responses. Despite recent progress with deep learning models like AlphaFold and RoseTTAFold, accurately modeling antigen-antibody complexes remains a challenge due to their unique evolutionary characteristics. HelixFold-Multimer, a specialized model developed for this purpose, builds on the framework of AlphaFold-Multimer and demonstrates improved precision for antigen-antibody structures. HelixFold-Multimer not only surpasses other models in accuracy but also provides essential insights into antibody development, enabling more precise identification of binding sites, improved interaction prediction, and enhanced design of therapeutic antibodies. These advances underscore HelixFold-Multimer's potential in supporting antibody research and therapeutic innovation.</description>

      <title>Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization and constraint programming approaches for lattice-based cyclic peptide docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The peptide-protein docking problem is an important problem in structural biology that facilitates rational and efficient drug design. In this work, we explore modeling and solving this problem with the quantum-amenable quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism. Our work extends recent efforts by incorporating the objectives and constraints associated with peptide cyclization and peptide-protein docking in the two-particle model on a tetrahedral lattice. We propose a ``resource efficient'' QUBO encoding for this problem, and baseline its performance with a novel constraint programming (CP) approach. We implement an end-to-end framework that enables the evaluation of our methods on instances from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Our results show that the QUBO approach, using a classical simulated annealing solver, is able to find feasible conformations for problems with up to 6 peptide residues and 34 target protein residues, but has trouble scaling beyond this problem size. In contrast, the CP approach can solve problems with up to 13 peptide residues and 34 target protein residues. We conclude that while QUBO can be used to successfully tackle this problem, its scaling limitations and the strong performance of the CP method suggest that it may not be the best choice.</description>

      <title>COMET: Benchmark for Comprehensive Biological Multi-omics Evaluation Tasks and Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As key elements within the central dogma, DNA, RNA, and proteins play crucial roles in maintaining life by guaranteeing accurate genetic expression and implementation. Although research on these molecules has profoundly impacted fields like medicine, agriculture, and industry, the diversity of machine learning approaches-from traditional statistical methods to deep learning models and large language models-poses challenges for researchers in choosing the most suitable models for specific tasks, especially for cross-omics and multi-omics tasks due to the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To address this, we introduce the first comprehensive multi-omics benchmark COMET (Benchmark for Biological COmprehensive Multi-omics Evaluation Tasks and Language Models), designed to evaluate models across single-omics, cross-omics, and multi-omics tasks. First, we curate and develop a diverse collection of downstream tasks and datasets covering key structural and functional aspects in DNA, RNA, and proteins, including tasks that span multiple omics levels. Then, we evaluate existing foundational language models for DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as the newly proposed multi-omics method, offering valuable insights into their performance in integrating and analyzing data from different biological modalities. This benchmark aims to define critical issues in multi-omics research and guide future directions, ultimately promoting advancements in understanding biological processes through integrated and different omics data analysis.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Statistics Applications to Batch Effects in Metabolomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Batch effects are inevitable in large-scale metabolomics. Prior to formal data analysis, batch effect correction (BEC) is applied to prevent from obscuring biological variations, and batch effect evaluation (BEE) is used for correction assessment. However, existing BEE algorithms neglect covariances between the variables, and existing BEC algorithms might fail to adequately correct the covariances. Therefore, we resort to recent advancements in high-dimensional statistics, and respectively propose "quality control-based simultaneous tests (QC-ST)" and "covariance correction (CoCo)". Validated by the simulation data, QC-ST can simultaneously detect the statistical significance of QC samples' mean vectors and covariance matrices across different batches, and has a satisfactory statistical performance in empirical sizes, empirical powers, and computational speed. Then, we apply four QC-based BEC algorithms to two large cohort datasets, and find that extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) performs best in relative standard deviation (RSD) and dispersion-ratio (D-ratio). After prepositive BEC, if QC-ST still suggests that batch effects between some two batches are significant, CoCo should be implemented. And after CoCo (if necessary), the four metrics (i.e., RSD, D-ratio, classification performance, and QC-ST) might be further improved. In summary, under the guidance of QC-ST, we can develop a matching strategy to integrate multiple BEC algorithms more rationally and flexibly, and minimize batch effects for reliable biological conclusions.</description>
