      <title>The Psychological Impacts of Algorithmic and AI-Driven Social Media on Teenagers: A Call to Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the meta-issues surrounding social media, which, while theoretically designed to enhance social interactions and improve our social lives by facilitating the sharing of personal experiences and life events, often results in adverse psychological impacts. Our investigation reveals a paradoxical outcome: rather than fostering closer relationships and improving social lives, the algorithms and structures that underlie social media platforms inadvertently contribute to a profound psychological impact on individuals, influencing them in unforeseen ways. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced among teenagers, who are disproportionately affected by curated online personas, peer pressure to present a perfect digital image, and the constant bombardment of notifications and updates that characterize their social media experience. As such, we issue a call to action for policymakers, platform developers, and educators to prioritize the well-being of teenagers in the digital age and work towards creating secure and safe social media platforms that protect the young from harm, online harassment, and exploitation.</description>

      <title>Improved Community Detection using Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection approaches resolve complex networks into smaller groups (communities) that are expected to be relatively edge-dense and well-connected. The stochastic block model (SBM) is one of several approaches used to uncover community structure in graphs. In this study, we demonstrate that SBM software applied to various real-world and synthetic networks produces poorly-connected to disconnected clusters. We present simple modifications to improve the connectivity of SBM clusters, and show that the modifications improve accuracy using simulated networks.</description>

      <title>Time Complexity of Broadcast and Consensus for Randomized Oblivious Message Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Broadcast and consensus are most fundamental tasks in distributed computing. These tasks are particularly challenging in dynamic networks where communication across the network links may be unreliable, e.g., due to mobility or failures. Indeed, over the last years, researchers have derived several impossibility results and high time complexity lower bounds (i.e., linear in the number of nodes $n$) for these tasks, even for oblivious message adversaries where communication networks are rooted trees. However, such deterministic adversarial models may be overly conservative, as many processes in real-world settings are stochastic in nature rather than worst case.
  This paper initiates the study of broadcast and consensus on stochastic dynamic networks, introducing a randomized oblivious message adversary. Our model is reminiscent of the SI model in epidemics, however, revolving around trees (which renders the analysis harder due to the apparent lack of independence). In particular, we show that if information dissemination occurs along random rooted trees, broadcast and consensus complete fast with high probability, namely in logarithmic time. Our analysis proves the independence of a key variable, which enables a formal understanding of the dissemination process.
  More formally, for a network with $n$ nodes, we first consider the completely random case where in each round the communication network is chosen uniformly at random among rooted trees. We then introduce the notion of randomized oblivious message adversary, where in each round, an adversary can choose $k$ edges to appear in the communication network, and then a rooted tree is chosen uniformly at random among the set of all rooted trees that include these edges. We show that broadcast completes in $O(k+\log n)$ rounds, and that this it is also the case for consensus as long as $k \le 0.1n$.</description>

      <title>Breaking Language Barriers with MMTweets: Advancing Cross-Lingual Debunked Narrative Retrieval for Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding previously debunked narratives involves identifying claims that have already undergone fact-checking. The issue intensifies when similar false claims persist in multiple languages, despite the availability of debunks for several months in another language. Hence, automatically finding debunks (or fact-checks) in multiple languages is crucial to make the best use of scarce fact-checkers' resources. Mainly due to the lack of readily available data, this is an understudied problem, particularly when considering the cross-lingual scenario, i.e. the retrieval of debunks in a language different from the language of the online post being checked. This study introduces cross-lingual debunked narrative retrieval and addresses this research gap by: (i) creating Multilingual Misinformation Tweets (MMTweets): a dataset that stands out, featuring cross-lingual pairs, images, human annotations, and fine-grained labels, making it a comprehensive resource compared to its counterparts; (ii) conducting an extensive experiment to benchmark state-of-the-art cross-lingual retrieval models and introducing multistage retrieval methods tailored for the task; and (iii) comprehensively evaluating retrieval models for their cross-lingual and cross-dataset transfer capabilities within MMTweets, and conducting a retrieval latency analysis. We find that MMTweets presents challenges for cross-lingual debunked narrative retrieval, highlighting areas for improvement in retrieval models. Nonetheless, the study provides valuable insights for creating MMTweets datasets and optimising debunked narrative retrieval models to empower fact-checking endeavours. The dataset and annotation codebook are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10637161.</description>

      <title>Preserving system activity while controlling epidemic spreading in adaptive temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human behaviour strongly influences the spread of infectious diseases: understanding the interplay between epidemic dynamics and adaptive behaviours is essential to improve response strategies to epidemics, with the goal of containing the epidemic while preserving a sufficient level of operativeness in the population. Through activity-driven temporal networks, we formulate a general framework which models a wide range of adaptive behaviours and mitigation strategies, observed in real populations. We analytically derive the conditions for a widespread diffusion of epidemics in the presence of arbitrary adaptive behaviours, highlighting the crucial role of correlations between agents behaviour in the infected and in the susceptible state. We focus on the effects of sick-leave, comparing the effectiveness of different strategies in reducing the impact of the epidemic and preserving the system operativeness. We show the critical relevance of heterogeneity in individual behavior: in homogeneous networks, all sick-leave strategies are equivalent and poorly effective, while in heterogeneous networks, strategies targeting the most vulnerable nodes are able to effectively mitigate the epidemic, also avoiding a deterioration in system activity and maintaining a low level of absenteeism. Interestingly, with targeted strategies both the minimum of population activity and the maximum of absenteeism anticipate the infection peak, which is effectively flattened and delayed, so that full operativeness is almost restored when the infection peak arrives. We also provide realistic estimates of the model parameters for influenza-like illness, thereby suggesting strategies for managing epidemics and absenteeism in realistic populations.</description>

      <title>Inferring Dynamic Networks from Marginals with Iterative Proportional Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common network inference problem, arising from real-world data constraints, is how to infer a dynamic network from its time-aggregated adjacency matrix and time-varying marginals (i.e., row and column sums). Prior approaches to this problem have repurposed the classic iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure, also known as Sinkhorn's algorithm, with promising empirical results. However, the statistical foundation for using IPF has not been well understood: under what settings does IPF provide principled estimation of a dynamic network from its marginals, and how well does it estimate the network? In this work, we establish such a setting, by identifying a generative network model whose maximum likelihood estimates are recovered by IPF. Our model both reveals implicit assumptions on the use of IPF in such settings and enables new analyses, such as structure-dependent error bounds on IPF's parameter estimates. When IPF fails to converge on sparse network data, we introduce a principled algorithm that guarantees IPF converges under minimal changes to the network structure. Finally, we conduct experiments with synthetic and real-world data, which demonstrate the practical value of our theoretical and algorithmic contributions.</description>
