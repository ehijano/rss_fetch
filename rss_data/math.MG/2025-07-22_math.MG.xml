      <title>Lipschitz regularity of definable sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for any $X\subset \R^n$ that is a $d$-dimensional definable set in an o-minimal structure and is Lipschitz regular at any $p\in X$, the following items are equivalent: (i) $C_3(X,p)$ is a $d$-dimensional linear subspace for any $p\in X$, and depends continuously on $p$;
  (ii) $C_4(X,p)=C_3(X,p)$ for any $p\in X$; (iii) $C_4(X,p)$ is a $d$-dimensional linear subspace for any $p\in X$;
  (iv) $C_5(X,p)$ is a $d-$dimensional linear subspace for any $p\in X$; (v) $X$ is $C^1$ smooth.</description>

      <title>The infinitesimal structure of manifolds with non-continuous Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the failure of certain metric measure spaces to be infinitesimally Hilbertian or quasi-Riemannian manifolds, by constructing examples arising from a manifold $M$ endowed with a Riemannian metric $g$ that is possibly discontinuous, with $g, g^{-1} \in L^\infty_{\mathrm{loc}} $ and $ g \in W^{1,p}_{\mathrm{loc}}$ for $ p &lt; \mathrm{dim} M - 1 $.</description>

      <title>Thin-shell bounds via parallel coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any log-concave random vector $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with mean zero and identity covariance, $$ \mathbb{E} (|X| - \sqrt{n})^2 \leq C $$ where $C &gt; 0$ is a universal constant. Thus, most of the mass of the random vector $X$ is concentrated in a thin spherical shell, whose width is only $C / \sqrt{n}$ times its radius. This confirms the thin-shell conjecture in high dimensional convex geometry. Our method relies on the construction of a certain coupling between log-affine perturbations of the law of $X$ related to Eldan's stochastic localization and to the theory of non-linear filtering. A crucial ingredient is a recent breakthrough technique by Guan that was previously used in our proof of Bourgain's slicing conjecture, which is known to be implied by the thin-shell conjecture.</description>

      <title>A note on Erd\H{o}s matrices and Marcus\unicode{x2013}Ree inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1959, Marcus and Ree proved that any bistochastic matrix $A$ satisfies $\Delta_n(A):= \max_{\sigma\in S_n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}A(i, \sigma(i))-\sum_{i, j=1}^n A(i, j)^2 \geq 0$. Erd\H{o}s asked to characterize the bistochastic matrices satisfying $\Delta_n(A)=0$. This problem remains largely open, and very recently, a complete list of such matrices was obtained in dimension $n=3$ by Bouthat, Mashreghi, and Morneau-Gu\'erin. Soon after, Tripathi proved that there were only finitely many such matrices in any dimension $n$. In this paper, we continue the investigation initiated in these two works. We characterize all $4\times 4$ bistochastic matrices satisfying $\Delta_4(A)=0$. Furthermore, we show that for $n\geq 3$, $\Delta_n(A)=\alpha$ has uncountably many solutions when $\alpha\in (0, (n-1)/4)$. This answers a question raised in [Tripathi, R., $\textit{Some observations on Erd\H{o}s matrices}$, Linear Algebra and Its Applications 708 (2025)]. We also extend the Marcus\unicode{x2013}Ree inequality to infinite bistochastic arrays and bistochastic kernels. Our investigation into $4\times 4$ Erd\H{o}s matrices also leads to several intriguing questions of independent interest. We propose several questions and conjectures and present numerical evidence for them.</description>

      <title>On the Figiel-Lindenstrauss-Milman inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13571v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Figiel-Lindenstrauss-Milman inequality is a fundamental inequality in the combinatorial theory of polytopes. It is classically obtained as a corollary of Milman's version of Dvoretzky's theorem. The goal of this paper is to provide a short and elementary proof of this inequality, derive more general versions of it, and discuss its tightness, where much is not known.</description>

      <title>Cocycle superrigidity for median spaces of finite rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate cocycle superrigidity in the setting of finite rank median spaces for product groups and Kazhdan groups. By employing a dynamical approach to superrigidity, we establish, for a median space X of finite rank, the superrigidity of Isom(X)-valued cocycles for a product of locally compact second countable groups. In the case of actions by irreducible lattices in such product groups, this approach yields a novel proof of the superrigidity of homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of proper almost-homogeneous domains in positive flag manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, inside the Shilov boundary of any given Hermitian symmetric space of tube type, there is, up to isomorphism, only one proper domain such that every point on its boundary belongs to the closure of an orbit under its automorphism group. This gives a classification of all closed proper manifolds locally modelled on such Shilov boundaries, and provides a positive answer, in the case of flag manifolds admitting a $\Theta$-positive structure, to a rigidity question of Limbeek and Zimmer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Aldous, Blanc and Curien asked which distributions can be expressed as the distance between two independent random variables on some separable measured metric space. We show that every nonnegative discrete distribution whose support contains $0$ arises in this way, as well as a class of finitely supported distributions with density.</description>

      <title>Energy inequalities for cutoff functions of $p$-energies on metric measures spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $p\in(1,+\infty)$, and for a $p$-energy on a metric measure space, we establish equivalent conditions for the conjunction of the Poincar\'e inequality and the cutoff Sobolev inequality. In particular, we employ a technique of Trudinger and Wang [Amer. J. Math. 124 (2002), no. 2, 369--410] to derive a Wolff potential estimate for superharmonic functions, and a method of Holopainen [Contemp. Math. 338 (2003), 219--239] to prove the elliptic Harnack inequality for harmonic functions. As applications, we make progress toward the capacity conjecture of Grigor'yan, Hu, and Lau [Springer Proc. Math. Stat. 88 (2014), 147--207], and we prove that the $p$-energy measure is singular with respect to the Hausdorff measure on the Sierpi\'nski carpet for all $p&gt;1$, resolving a problem posed by Murugan and Shimizu [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 78 (2025), no. 9, 1523--1608].</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of real algebraic functions into curves with prescribed Reeb graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss reconstructing smooth real algebraic maps onto curves whose Reeb graph is as prescribed. This can be contributed to real algebraic geometry, especially in explicit examples in real algebraic geometry in a new way. The Reeb graph of a smooth function is the space of all connected components of preimages of all single points and a natural quotient space of the manifold with the vertex set being all connected components containing some singular points of it. This gives a strong tool in geometry of manifolds and appeared already in 1950 with Morse functions.
  The Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere of dimension at least 2 is a graph with exactly two vertices and one edge. We reconstruct functions, from general finite graphs, conversely. In the differentiable situations, Sharko pioneered this in 2006, followed by Masumoto-Saeki and Michalak, mainly. Related real algebraic situations have been launched and studied by the author. The curve-valued case is first considered here.</description>
