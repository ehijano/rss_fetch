      <title>Delving Deeper Into Astromorphic Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10925v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preliminary attempts at incorporating the critical role of astrocytes - cells that constitute more than 50\% of human brain cells - in brain-inspired neuromorphic computing remain in infancy. This paper seeks to delve deeper into various key aspects of neuron-synapse-astrocyte interactions to mimic self-attention mechanisms in Transformers. The cross-layer perspective explored in this work involves bioplausible modeling of Hebbian and presynaptic plasticities in neuron-astrocyte networks, incorporating effects of non-linearities and feedback along with algorithmic formulations to map the neuron-astrocyte computations to self-attention mechanism and evaluating the impact of incorporating bio-realistic effects from the machine learning application side. Our analysis on sentiment and image classification tasks (IMDB and CIFAR10 datasets) highlights the advantages of Astromorphic Transformers, offering improved accuracy and learning speed. Furthermore, the model demonstrates strong natural language generation capabilities on the WikiText-2 dataset, achieving better perplexity compared to conventional models, thus showcasing enhanced generalization and stability across diverse machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>MI9 -- Agent Intelligence Protocol: Runtime Governance for Agentic AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agentic AI systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing actions present fundamentally distinct governance challenges compared to traditional AI models. Unlike conventional AI, these systems exhibit emergent and unexpected behaviors during runtime, introducing novel agent-related risks that cannot be fully anticipated through pre-deployment governance alone. To address this critical gap, we introduce MI9, the first fully integrated runtime governance framework designed specifically for safety and alignment of agentic AI systems. MI9 introduces real-time controls through six integrated components: agency-risk index, agent-semantic telemetry capture, continuous authorization monitoring, Finite-State-Machine (FSM)-based conformance engines, goal-conditioned drift detection, and graduated containment strategies. Operating transparently across heterogeneous agent architectures, MI9 enables the systematic, safe, and responsible deployment of agentic systems in production environments where conventional governance approaches fall short, providing the foundational infrastructure for safe agentic AI deployment at scale. Detailed analysis through a diverse set of scenarios demonstrates MI9's systematic coverage of governance challenges that existing approaches fail to address, establishing the technical foundation for comprehensive agentic AI oversight.</description>

      <title>Moveless: Minimizing Overhead on QCCDs via Versatile Execution and Low Excess Shuttling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most promising paths towards large scale fault tolerant quantum computation is the use of quantum error correcting stabilizer codes. Just like every other quantum circuit, these codes must be compiled to hardware in a way to minimize the total physical error introduced into the system, for example either due to high latency execution or excessive gates to meet connectivity limitations of the target hardware. However, unlike arbitrary quantum circuits, all syndrome extraction circuits have several common properties, for example they have a bipartite connectivity graph, consist only of commuting subcircuits, among other properties. For the most part, compilation methods have aimed at being generic, able to map any input circuit into executables on the hardware, and therefore cannot appropriately exploit these properties and result in executables which have higher physical error. In the case of modular trapped ion systems, specifically QCCDs, this corresponds to the insertion of excessive shuttling operations necessary to realize arbitrary qubit interactions. We propose a compilation scheme explicitly tailored for the structural regularity of QEC circuits based on several key observations: 1. only ancilla or data (but not both) should be shuttled, 2. stabilizers can be executed in any order meaning we can dynamically modify circuit execution on a per-cycle basis 3. ancilla are indistinguishable meaning any can be selected to begin a stabilizer measurement and retain a fixed-point mapping between cycles, and 4. QCCD hardware limits the number of parallel operations equal to the number traps in the system, meaning fewer ancilla are necessary and can be reused. Our resulting compiler, leads to QEC circuits which are on average 3.38x faster to execute, and lead to up to two orders of magnitude of improvement in logical error rates with realistic physical error rates.</description>

      <title>Learning Using Privileged Information for Litter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools capable of detecting litter effectively remains a significant challenge. This study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this, a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Advantages of Co-locating Quantum-HPC Platforms: A Survey for Near-Future Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a systematic survey of emerging quantum-HPC platforms, which integrate quantum computers and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems through co-location. Currently, it remains unclear whether such platforms provide tangible benefits for near-future industrial applications. To address this, we examined the impact of co-location on latency reduction, bandwidth enhancement, and advanced job scheduling. Additionally, we assessed how HPC-level capabilities could enhance hybrid algorithm performance, support large-scale error mitigation, and facilitate complex quantum circuit partitioning and optimization. Our findings demonstrate that co-locating quantum and HPC systems can yield measurable improvements in overall hybrid job throughput. We also observe that large-scale real-world problems can require HPC-level computational resources for executing hybrid algorithms.</description>

      <title>ECOLogic: Enabling Circular, Obfuscated, and Adaptive Logic via eFPGA-Augmented SoCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional hardware platforms - ASICs and FPGAs - offer competing trade-offs among performance, flexibility, and sustainability. ASICs provide high efficiency but are inflexible post-fabrication, require costly re-spins for updates, and expose IPs to piracy risks. FPGAs offer reconfigurability and reuse, yet suffer from substantial area, power, and performance overheads, resulting in higher carbon footprints. We present ECOLogic, a hybrid design paradigm that embeds lightweight eFPGA fabric within ASICs to enable secure, updatable, and resource-aware computation. Central to this architecture is ECOScore, a quantitative scoring framework that evaluates IPs based on adaptability, piracy threat, performance tolerance, and resource fit to guide RTL partitioning. Evaluated across six diverse SoC modules, ECOLogic retains an average of 90 percent ASIC-level performance (up to 2 GHz), achieves 9.8 ns timing slack (versus 5.1 ns in FPGA), and reduces power by 480 times on average. Moreover, sustainability analysis shows a 99.7 percent reduction in deployment carbon footprint and 300 to 500 times lower emissions relative to FPGA-only implementations. These results position ECOLogic as a high-performance, secure, and environmentally sustainable solution for next-generation reconfigurable systems.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Cybersecurity with Semi-supervised Lifelong Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the brain's hierarchical processing and energy efficiency, this paper presents a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) architecture for lifelong Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). The proposed system first employs an efficient static SNN to identify potential intrusions, which then activates an adaptive dynamic SNN responsible for classifying the specific attack type. Mimicking biological adaptation, the dynamic classifier utilizes Grow When Required (GWR)-inspired structural plasticity and a novel Adaptive Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (Ad-STDP) learning rule. These bio-plausible mechanisms enable the network to learn new threats incrementally while preserving existing knowledge. Tested on the UNSW-NB15 benchmark in a continual learning setting, the architecture demonstrates robust adaptation, reduced catastrophic forgetting, and achieves $85.3$\% overall accuracy. Furthermore, simulations using the Intel Lava framework confirm high operational sparsity, highlighting the potential for low-power deployment on neuromorphic hardware.</description>

      <title>Learning in a Multifield Coherent Ising Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a network of coupled oscillators that can learn to solve a classification task from a set of examples -- performing both training and inference through the nonlinear evolution of the system. We accomplish this by combining three key elements to achieve learning: A long-term memory that stores learned responses, analogous to the synapses in biological brains; a short-term memory that stores the neural activations, similar to the firing patterns of neurons; and an evolution law that updates the synapses in response to novel examples, inspired by synaptic plasticity. Achieving all three elements in wave-based information processors such as metamaterials is a significant challenge. Here, we solve it by leveraging the material multistability to implement long-term memory, and harnessing symmetries and thermal noise to realize the learning rule. Our analysis reveals that the learning mechanism, although inspired by synaptic plasticity, also shares parallelisms with bacterial evolution strategies, where mutation rates increase in the presence of noxious stimuli.</description>

      <title>Live Demonstration: Neuromorphic Radar for Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding. These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from seven users, our system achieves &gt; 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based HGR.</description>

      <title>Beyond risk: A proto-framework for assessing the societal impact of AI systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the discourse on AI regulation, 'responsible AI' is the dominant paradigm, with the focus on mitigating the risks related to AI systems. While this focus is important and necessary, it has limited use for a systematic consideration of AI's societal impact. This paper proposes a proto-framework for assessing the societal impact of AI systems by operationalising the concept of freedom. This proto-framework is intended as a step towards a fully operationalised framework to be used in policymaking contexts. By drawing on Kantian philosophy and related contemporary interpretations, freedom is developed as the counterpart to the concept of responsibility. Two dimensions of freedom are developed in further detail: freedom as capability and freedom as opportunity. These two dimensions of freedom are then applied in a proto-framework that systematically considers AI's impact on society using the Sustainable Development Goals. This proto-framework aims to complement current risk-based approaches and thereby offers a first step towards operationalising the concept of freedom in AI regulation.</description>
