      <title>Masked Graph Autoencoders with Contrastive Augmentation for Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Spatial Resolved Transcriptomics (SRT) technology, it is now possible to comprehensively measure gene transcription while preserving the spatial context of tissues. Spatial domain identification and gene denoising are key objectives in SRT data analysis. We propose a Contrastively Augmented Masked Graph Autoencoder (STMGAC) to learn low-dimensional latent representations for domain identification. In the latent space, persistent signals for representations are obtained through self-distillation to guide self-supervised matching. At the same time, positive and negative anchor pairs are constructed using triplet learning to augment the discriminative ability. We evaluated the performance of STMGAC on five datasets, achieving results superior to those of existing baseline methods. All code and public datasets used in this paper are available at https://github.com/wenwenmin/STMGAC and https://zenodo.org/records/13253801.</description>

      <title>Insights, opportunities and challenges provided by large cell atlases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of single-cell biology is growing rapidly and is generating large amounts of data from a variety of species, disease conditions, tissues, and organs. Coordinated efforts such as CZI CELLxGENE, HuBMAP, Broad Institute Single Cell Portal, and DISCO, allow researchers to access large volumes of curated datasets. Although the majority of the data is from scRNAseq experiments, a wide range of other modalities are represented as well. These resources have created an opportunity to build and expand the computational biology ecosystem to develop tools necessary for data reuse, and for extracting novel biological insights. Here, we highlight achievements made so far, areas where further development is needed, and specific challenges that need to be overcome.</description>

      <title>RawHash2: Mapping Raw Nanopore Signals Using Hash-Based Seeding and Adaptive Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05771v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Summary: Raw nanopore signals can be analyzed while they are being generated, a process known as real-time analysis. Real-time analysis of raw signals is essential to utilize the unique features that nanopore sequencing provides, enabling the early stopping of the sequencing of a read or the entire sequencing run based on the analysis. The state-of-the-art mechanism, RawHash, offers the first hash-based efficient and accurate similarity identification between raw signals and a reference genome by quickly matching their hash values. In this work, we introduce RawHash2, which provides major improvements over RawHash, including a more sensitive quantization and chaining implementation, weighted mapping decisions, frequency filters to reduce ambiguous seed hits, minimizers for hash-based sketching, and support for the R10.4 flow cell version and various data formats such as POD5 and SLOW5. Compared to RawHash, RawHash2 provides better F1 accuracy (on average by 10.57% and up to 20.25%) and better throughput (on average by 4.0x and up to 9.9x) than RawHash. Availability and Implementation: RawHash2 is available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/RawHash. We also provide the scripts to fully reproduce our results on our GitHub page.</description>
