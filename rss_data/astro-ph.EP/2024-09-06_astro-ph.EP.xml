      <title>Cavitating bubbles in condensing gas as a means of forming clumps, chondrites, and planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vaporized metal, silicates, and ices on the verge of re-condensing into solid or liquid particles appear in many contexts: behind shocks, in impact ejecta, and within the atmospheres and outflows of stars, disks, planets, and minor bodies. We speculate that a condensing gas might fragment, forming overdensities within relative voids, from a radiation-condensation instability. Seeded with small thermal fluctuations, a condensible gas will exhibit spatial variations in the density of particle condensates. Regions of higher particle density may radiate more, cooling faster. Faster cooling leads to still more condensation, lowering the local pressure. Regions undergoing runaway condensation may collapse under the pressure of their less condensed surroundings. Particle condensates will compactify with collapsing regions, into overdense clumps or macroscopic solids (planetesimals). As a first step toward realizing this hypothetical instability, we calculate the evolution of a small volume of condensing silicate vapor -- a spherical test "bubble" embedded in a background medium whose pressure and radiation field are assumed fixed for simplicity. Such a bubble condenses and collapses upon radiating its latent heat to the background, assuming its energy loss is not stopped by background irradiation. Collapse speeds can range up to sonic, similar to cavitation in terrestrial settings. Adding a non-condensible gas like hydrogen to the bubble stalls the collapse. We discuss whether cavitation can provide a way for mm-sized chondrules and refractory solids to assemble into meteorite parent bodies, focusing on CB/CH chondrites whose constituents likely condensed from silicate/metal vapor released from the most energetic asteroid collisions.</description>

      <title>The K2-24 planetary system revisited by CHEOPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K2-24 is a planetary system composed of two transiting low-density Neptunians locked in an almost perfect 2:1 resonance and showing large TTVs, i.e., an excellent laboratory to search for signatures of planetary migration. Previous studies performed with K2, Spitzer and RV data tentatively claimed a significant non-zero eccentricity for one or both planets, possibly high enough to challenge the scenario of pure disk migration through resonant capture. With 13 new CHEOPS light curves (seven of planet -b, six of planet -c), we carried out a global photometric and dynamical (RV+TTV) re-analysis by including all the available literature data as well. We got the most accurate set of planetary parameters to date for the K2-24 system, including radii and masses at 1% and 5% precision (now essentially limited by the uncertainty on stellar parameters) and non-zero eccentricities $e_b=0.0498_{-0.0018}^{+0.0011}$, $e_c=0.0282_{-0.0007}^{+0.0003}$ detected at very high significance for both planets. Such relatively large values imply the need for an additional physical mechanism of eccentricity excitation during or after the migration stage. Also, while the accuracy of the previous TTV model had drifted by up to 0.5 days at the current time, we constrained the orbital solution firmly enough to predict the forthcoming transits for the next ~15 years, thus enabling an efficient follow-up with top-level facilities such as JWST or ESPRESSO.</description>

      <title>Disruption of exo-asteroids around white dwarfs and the release of dust particles in debris rings in co-orbital motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close to the Roche radius of a white dwarf (WD), an asteroid on a circular orbit sheds material that then adopts a very similar orbit. Observations of the resulting debris show a periodic behavior and changes in flux on short timescales, implying ongoing dynamical activity. Additional encounters from other minor planets may then yield co-orbital rings of debris at different inclinations. The structure, dynamics, and lifetime of these debris discs remains highly uncertain, but is important for understanding WD planetary systems. We aim to identify and quantify the locations of co-orbitals in WD-asteroid-dust particle 3-body systems by exploring the influence of 1:1 resonant periodic orbits. We begin this exploration with co-planar and inclined orbits in the circular restricted 3-body problem (CRTBP) and model the dynamical evolution of these exosystems over observable timescales. The mass ratio parameter for this class of systems ($~2\times 10^{-11}$) is one of the lowest ever explored in this dynamical configuration. We computed the periodic orbits, deduced their linear stability, and suitably seeded the dynamical stability maps. We carried out a limited suite of N-body simulations to provide direct comparisons with the maps. We derive novel results for this extreme mass ratio in the CRTBP, including new unstable 3D families. We illustrate through the maps and N-body simulations where dust can exist in a stable configuration over observable timescales across a wide expanse of parameter space in the absence of strong external forces. Over a timescale of 10 yr, the maximum orbital period deviations of stable debris due to the co-orbital perturbations of the asteroid is about a few seconds. Unstable debris in a close encounter with the asteroid typically deviates from the co-orbital configuration by more than about 20 km and is on a near-circular orbit with an eccentricity lower than ~0.01.</description>

      <title>Up, Up, and Away: Winds and Dynamical Structure as a Function of Altitude in the Ultra-Hot Jupiter WASP-76b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the unprecedented signal strengths offered by the newest high-resolution spectrographs on 10-m class telescopes, exploring the 3D nature of exoplanets is possible with an unprecedented level of precision. In this paper, we present a new technique to probe the vertical structure of exoplanetary winds and dynamics using ensembles of planet absorption lines of varying opacity, and apply it to the well-studied ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b. We then compare these results to state-of-the-art global circulation models (GCMs) with varying magnetic drag prescriptions. We find that the known asymmetric velocity shift in Fe I absorption during transit persists at all altitudes, and observe tentative trends for stronger blueshifts and more narrow line profiles deeper in the atmosphere. By comparing three different model prescriptions (a hydrodynamical model with no drag, a magnetic drag model, and a uniform drag model) we are able to rule out the uniform drag model due to inconsistencies with observed trends in the data. We find that the magnetic model is slightly favored over the the hydrodynamic model, and note that this 3-Gauss kinematic magnetohydrodynamical GCM is also favored when compared to low-resolution data. Future generation high-resolution spectrographs on Extremely large telescopes (ELTs) will greatly increase signals and make methods like these possible with higher precision and for a wider range of objects.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Lyapunov-Based Eclipse-Feasible Low-Thrust Transfer Trajectories to NRHO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating low-thrust transfer trajectories between Earth and the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO), that is selected for NASA's Gateway, can be challenging due to the low control authority available from the propulsion system and the important operational constraint that the duration of all eclipses has to be less than a prescribed 90-minute threshold. We present a method for generating eclipse-feasible, minimum-time solutions to the aforementioned trajectory design problem using a Lyapunov control law. Coasting is enforced during solar eclipses due to both the Earth and Moon. We used particle swarm optimization to optimize the NRHO insertion date, time of flight, and control law parameters according to a cost function that prioritizes 1) convergence to the target orbit, 2) satisfaction of eclipse-duration constraints, and 3) minimization of time of flight. Trajectories can serve as initial guesses for NASA's high-fidelity trajectory design tools such as Copernicus and GMAT.</description>

      <title>Trajectory of the stellar flyby that shaped the outer solar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike the Solar System planets, thousands of smaller bodies beyond Neptune orbit the Sun on eccentric ($e &gt;$ 0.1) and ($i&gt;$ 3$^\circ$) orbits. While migration of the giant planets during the early stages of Solar System evolution can induce substantial scattering of trans-Neptunian objects (TNO), this process cannot account for the small number of distant TNOs ($r_p &gt;$ 60 au) outside the planets' reach. The alternative scenario of the close flyby of another star can instead produce all these TNO features simultaneously, but the possible parameter space for such an encounter is vast. Here, we compare observed TNO properties with thousands of flyby simulations to determine the specific properties of a flyby that reproduces all the different dynamical TNO populations, their location and their relative abundance and find that a 0.8$^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ $M_{\odot}$ star passing at a distance of $ r_p =$ 110 $\mathbf{\pm}$ 10 au, inclined by $i$ = 70$^\circ$ $^{+5}_{-10}$ gives a near-perfect match. This flyby also replicates the retrograde TNO population, which has proved difficult to explain. Such a flyby is reasonably frequent; at least 140 million solar-type stars in the Milky Way are likely to have experienced a similar one. In light of these results, we predict that the upcoming Vera Rubin telescope will reveal that distant and retrograde TNOs are relatively common.</description>

      <title>Spin states of X-complex asteroids in the inner main belt -- I. Investigating the Athor and Zita collisional families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of our study is to characterise the spin states of the members of the Athor and Zita collisional families and test whether these members have a spin distribution consistent with a common origin from the break up of their respective family parent asteroids. Our method is based on the asteroid family evolution, which indicates that there should be a statistical predominance of retrograde-rotating asteroids on the inward side of family's V-shape, and prograde-rotating asteroids on the outward side. We used photometric data from our campaign and the literature in order to reveal the spin states of the asteroids belonging to these families. We combined dense and sparse photometric data in order to construct lightcurves; we performed the lightcurve inversion method to estimate the sidereal period, spin axis and convex shape of several family members. We obtained 34 new asteroid models for Athor family members and 17 for Zita family members. Along with the literature and revised models, the Athor family contains 60% of retrograde asteroids on the inward side and, 76% of prograde asteroids on the outward side. We also found that the Zita family exhibits 80% of retrograde asteroids on the inward side and an equal amount of prograde and retrograde rotators on the outward side. However, when we applied Kernel density estimation, we also found a clear peak for prograde asteroids on the outward side, as expected from the theory. The spin states of these asteroids validate the existence of both families, with the Athor family exhibiting a stronger signature for the presence of retrograde-rotating and prograde-rotating asteroids on the inner and outer side of the family, respectively. Our work provides an independent confirmation and characterisation of these very old families, whose presence and characteristics offer constraints for theories and models of the Solar System's evolution.</description>

      <title>Light-curve analysis and shape models of NEAs 7335, 7822, 154244 and 159402</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an attempt to further characterise the near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population we present 38 new light-curves acquired between September 2020 and November 2023 for NEAs (7335) 1989 JA, (7822) 1991 CS, (154244) 2002 KL6 and (159402) 1999 AP10, obtained from observations taken at the Teide Observatory (Tenerife, Spain). With these new observations along with archival data, we computed their first shape models and spin solutions by applying the light curve inversion method. The obtained rotation periods are in good agreement with those reported in previous works, with improved uncertainties. Additionally, besides the constant period models for (7335) 1989 JA, (7822) 1991 CS and (159402) 1999 AP10, our results for (154244) 2002 KL6 suggest that it could be affected by a Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack acceleration with a value of $\upsilon \simeq -7 \times 10^{-9}$ rad d$^{-2}$. This would be one of the first detections of this effect slowing down an asteroid.</description>

      <title>Panopticon: a novel deep learning model to detect single transit events with no prior data filtering in PLATO light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To prepare for the analyses of the future PLATO light curves, we develop a deep learning model, Panopticon, to detect transits in high precision photometric light curves. Since PLATO's main objective is the detection of temperate Earth-size planets around solar-type stars, the code is designed to detect individual transit events. The filtering step, required by conventional detection methods, can affect the transit, which could be an issue for long and shallow transits. To protect transit shape and depth, the code is also designed to work on unfiltered light curves. We trained the model on a set of simulated PLATO light curves in which we injected, at pixel level, either planetary, eclipsing binary, or background eclipsing binary signals. We also include a variety of noises in our data, such as granulation, stellar spots or cosmic rays. The approach is able to recover 90% of our test population, including more than 25% of the Earth-analogs, even in the unfiltered light curves. The model also recovers the transits irrespective of the orbital period, and is able to retrieve transits on a unique event basis. These figures are obtained when accepting a false alarm rate of 1%. When keeping the false alarm rate low (&lt;0.01%), it is still able to recover more than 85% of the transit signals. Any transit deeper than 180ppm is essentially guaranteed to be recovered. This method is able to recover transits on a unique event basis, and does so with a low false alarm rate. Thanks to light curves being one-dimensional, model training is fast, on the order of a few hours per model. This speed in training and inference, coupled to the recovery effectiveness and precision of the model make it an ideal tool to complement, or be used ahead of, classical approaches.</description>

      <title>Irregular moons possibly injected from the outer solar system by a stellar flyby</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The irregular moons orbit the giant planets on distant, inclined, and eccentric trajectories, in sharp contrast with the coplanar and quasicircular orbits of the regular moons. The origin of these irregular moons is still an open question, but these moons have a lot in common with the objects beyond Neptune (trans-Neptunian objects -- TNOs), suggestive of a common origin. Here, we show that the close flyby of a star may be the connecting element. A stellar flyby can simultaneously reproduce the complex TNO dynamics quantitatively while explaining the origin of the irregular moons and the colour distributions of both populations. This flyby would have catapulted 7.2% of the original TNO population into the region of the planets, many on retrograde orbits. Most injected TNOs would have been subsequently ejected from the solar system (85%). However, a considerable fraction would have had the potential to be captured by the planets. The exclusively distant origin of the injected TNOs may also explain the lack of very red irregular moons.</description>

      <title>Polar Neptunes are Stable to Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an intriguing and growing population of Neptune-sized planets with stellar obliquities near $\sim90^{\circ}$. One previously proposed formation pathway is a disk-driven resonance, which can take place at the end stages of planet formation in a system containing an inner Neptune, outer cold Jupiter, and protoplanetary disk. This mechanism occurs within the first $\sim10$ Myr, but most of the polar Neptunes we see today are $\sim$Gyrs old. Up until now, there has not been an extensive analysis of whether the polar orbits are stable over $\sim$Gyr timescales. Tidal realignment mechanisms are known to operate in other systems, and if they are active here, this would cause theoretical tension with a primordial misalignment story. In this paper, we explore the effects of tidal evolution on the disk-driven resonance theory. We use both $N$-body and secular simulations to study tidal effects on both the initial resonant encounter and long-term evolution. We find that the polar orbits are remarkably stable on $\sim$Gyr timescales. Inclination damping does not occur for the polar cases, although we do identify sub-polar cases where it is important. We consider two case study polar Neptunes, WASP-107 b and HAT-P-11 b, and study them in the context of this theory, finding consistency with present-day properties if their tidal quality factors are $Q \gtrsim 10^4$ and $Q \gtrsim 10^5$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Towards a self-consistent evaluation of gas dwarf scenarios for temperate sub-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent JWST detections of carbon-bearing molecules in a habitable-zone sub-Neptune have opened a new era in the study of low-mass exoplanets. The sub-Neptune regime spans a wide diversity of planetary interiors and atmospheres not witnessed in the solar system, including mini-Neptunes, super-Earths, and water worlds. Recent works have investigated the possibility of gas dwarfs, with rocky interiors and thick H$_2$-rich atmospheres, to explain aspects of the sub-Neptune population, including the radius valley. Interactions between the H$_2$-rich envelope and a potential magma ocean may lead to observable atmospheric signatures. We report a coupled interior-atmosphere modelling framework for gas dwarfs to investigate the plausibility of magma oceans on such planets and their observable diagnostics. We find that the surface-atmosphere interactions and atmospheric composition are sensitive to a wide range of parameters, including the atmospheric and internal structure, mineral composition, volatile solubility and atmospheric chemistry. While magma oceans are typically associated with high-temperature rocky planets, we assess if such conditions may be admissible and observable for temperate sub-Neptunes. We find that a holistic modelling approach is required for this purpose and to avoid unphysical model solutions. We find using our model framework and considering the habitable-zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b as a case study that its observed atmospheric composition is incompatible with a magma ocean scenario. We identify key atmospheric molecular and elemental diagnostics, including the abundances of CO$_2$, CO, NH$_3$ and, potentially, S-bearing species. Our study also underscores the need for fundamental material properties for accurate modelling of such planets.</description>

      <title>TOI-3568 b: a super-Neptune in the sub-Jovian desert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sub-Jovian desert is a region in the mass-period and radius-period parameter space, typically encompassing short-period ranges between super-Earths and hot Jupiters, that exhibits an intrinsic dearth of planets. This scarcity is likely shaped by photoevaporation caused by the stellar irradiation received by giant planets that have migrated inward. We report the detection and characterization of TOI-3568 b, a transiting super-Neptune with a mass of $26.4\pm1.0$ M$_\oplus$, a radius of $5.30\pm0.27$ R$_\oplus$, a bulk density of $0.98\pm0.15$ g cm$^{-3}$, and an orbital period of 4.417965(5) d situated in the vicinity of the sub-Jovian desert. This planet orbiting a K dwarf star with solar metallicity, was identified photometrically by TESS. It was characterized as a planet by our high-precision radial velocity monitoring program using MAROON-X at Gemini North, supplemented by additional observations from the SPICE large program with SPIRou at CFHT. We performed a Bayesian MCMC joint analysis of the TESS and ground-based photometry, MAROON-X and SPIRou radial velocities, to measure the orbit, radius, and mass of the planet, as well as a detailed analysis of the high-resolution flux and polarimetric spectra to determine the physical parameters and elemental abundances of the host star. Our results reveal TOI-3568 b as a hot super-Neptune, rich in hydrogen and helium with a core of heavier elements with a mass between 10 and 25 M$_\oplus$. We analyzed the photoevaporation status of TOI-3568 b and found that it experiences one of the highest EUV luminosities among planets with a mass M$_{\rm p}$ $&lt;2$ M$_{\rm Nep}$, yet it has an evaporation lifetime exceeding 5 Gyr. Positioned in the transition between two significant populations of exoplanets on the mass-period and energy diagrams, this planet presents an opportunity to test theories concerning the origin of the sub-Jovian desert.</description>

      <title>Design and Performance of the Upgraded Mid-InfraRed Spectrometer and Imager (MIRSI) on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the new design and current performance of the Mid-InfraRed Spectrometer and Imager (MIRSI) on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). The system has been converted from a liquid nitrogen/liquid helium cryogen system to one that uses a closed-cycle cooler, which allows it to be kept on the telescope at operating temperature and available for observing on short notice, requiring less effort by the telescope operators and day crew to maintain operating temperature. Several other enhancements have been completed, including new detector readout electronics, an IRTF-style standard instrument user interface, new stepper motor driver electronics, and an optical camera that views the same field as the mid-IR instrument using a cold dichroic mirror, allowing for guiding and/or simultaneous optical imaging. The instrument performance is presented, both with an engineering-grade array used from 2021-2023, and a science-grade array installed in the fall of 2023. Some sample astronomical results are also shown. The upgraded MIRSI is a facility instrument at the IRTF available to all users.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter, we will cover how stars form from the stellar nurseries that are giant molecular clouds. We will first review the physical processes that compete to regulate star formation. We then review star formation in turbulent, magnetized molecular clouds and the associated statistics giving rise to the star formation rate and the initial mass function of stars. We then present the protostellar stages in detail from an observational perspective. We will primarily discuss low-mass ($&lt;1.5\msun$) stars. Finally, we examine how multiplicity complicates the single-star formation picture. This chapter will focus on star formation at redshift~0</description>

      <title>ESCAPE project: fundamental detection limits of JWST/NIRCam coronographic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explored the fundamental contrast limit of NIRCam coronagraphy observations, representing the achievable performance with post-processing techniques. This limit is influenced by photon noise and readout noise, with complex noise propagation through post-processing methods like principal component analysis. We employed two approaches: developing a formula based on simplified scenarios and using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, assuming Gaussian noise properties and uncorrelated pixel noise. Tested on datasets HIP\,65426, AF\,Lep, and HD\,114174, the MCMC method provided accurate but computationally intensive estimates. The analytical approach offered quick, reliable estimates closely matching MCMC results in simpler scenarios. Our findings showed the fundamental contrast curve is significantly deeper than the current achievable contrast limit obtained with post-processing techniques at shorter separations, being 10 times deeper at $0.5''$ and 4 times deeper at $1''$. At greater separations, increased exposure time improves sensitivity, with the transition between photon and readout noise dominance occurring between $2''$ and $3''$. We conclude the analytical approach is a reliable estimate of the fundamental contrast limit, offering a faster alternative to MCMC. These results emphasize the potential for greater sensitivity at shorter separations, highlighting the need for improved or new post-processing techniques to enhance JWST NIRCam sensitivity or contrast curve.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Dust Depletion in a Misaligned Protoplanetary Disk with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we report the detection of dust depletion in a misaligned inner disk around UX Tau A using JWST MIRI spectra. Mid-infrared (MIR) continuum "seesaw" variability was detected in this disk by Spitzer and attributed to variable shadows cast on the outer disk by the inner disk. The JWST MIRI spectrum of UX Tau A also shows seesaw variability, but with a significant decrease of emission shortwards of 10 micron to nearly photospheric levels. We argue that UX Tau A's MIR continuum variability is due to depletion of dust in a misaligned inner disk. We speculate that this dust depletion occurs because the inner disk is misaligned from the outer disk, which can disrupt the replenishment of the inner disk from the outer disk. Using contemporaneous measurements of the mass accretion rate of UX Tau A and estimating the amount of dust necessary to produce the MIR excess in the Spitzer observations, we estimate a minimum dust depletion timescale of ~0.1 yr. These observations show that we can indirectly detect the signatures of misaligned inner disks through MIR continuum variability and that in some cases the inner disk may be significantly depleted of dust and become optically thin.</description>

      <title>The Gaia Ultracool Dwarf Sample -- IV. GTC/OSIRIS optical spectra of Gaia late-M and L dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of our comprehensive, ongoing characterisation of the low-mass end of the main sequence in the Solar neighbourhood, we used the OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias to acquire low- and mid-resolution (R$\approx$300 and R$\approx$2500) optical spectroscopy of 53 late-M and L ultracool dwarfs. Most of these objects are known but poorly investigated and lacking complete kinematics. We measured spectral indices, determined spectral types (six of which are new) and inferred effective temperature and surface gravity from BT-Settl synthetic spectra fits for all objects. We were able to measure radial velocities via line centre fitting and cross correlation for 46 objects, 29 of which lacked previous radial velocity measurements. Using these radial velocities in combination with the latest Gaia DR3 data, we also calculated Galactocentric space velocities. From their kinematics, we identified two candidates outside of the thin disc and four in young stellar kinematic groups. Two further ultracool dwarfs are apparently young field objects: 2MASSW J1246467$+$402715 (L4$\beta$), which has a potential, weak lithium absorption line, and G 196$-$3B (L3$\beta$), which was already known as young due to its well-studied primary companion.</description>

      <title>Empirical stability criteria for 3D hierarchical triple systems I: Circumbinary planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the problem of the dynamical stability of hierarchical triple systems with applications to circumbinary planetary orbits. We carry out more than 3 10^8 numerical simulations of planets between the size of Mercury and the lower fusion boundary (13 Jupiter masses) which revolve around the center of mass of a stellar binary over long timescales. For the first time, three dimensional and eccentric planetary orbits are considered. We explore systems with a variety of binary and planetary mass ratios, binary and planetary eccentricities from 0 to 0.9 and orbital mutual inclinations ranging from 0 to 180 degrees. The simulation time is set to 10^6 planetary orbital periods. We classify the results of those long term numerical integrations into three categories: stable, unstable and mixed. We provide empirical expressions in the form of multidimensional, parameterized fits for the two borders that separate the three dynamical domains . In addition, we train a machine learning model on our data set in order to have an alternative tool of predicting the stability of circumbinary planets. Both the empirical fits and the machine learning model are tested against randomly generated circumbinary systems with very good results regarding the predictions of orbital stability. The empirical formulae are also applied to the Kepler and TESS circumbinary systems, confirming the stability of the planets in these systems. Finally, we present a REST API with a web based application for convenient access of our simulation data set.</description>
