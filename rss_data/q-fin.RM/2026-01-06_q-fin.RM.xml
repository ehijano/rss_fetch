      <title>Dynamic Risk in the U.S. Banking System: An Analysis of Sentiment, Policy Shocks, and Spillover Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2023 U.S. banking crisis propagated not through direct financial linkages but through a high-frequency, information-based contagion channel. This paper moves beyond exploration analysis to test the "too-similar-to-fail" hypothesis, arguing that risk spillovers were driven by perceived similarities in bank business models under acute interest rate pressure. Employing a Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregression (TVP-VAR) model with 30-day rolling windows, a method uniquely suited for capturing the rapid network shifts inherent in a panic, we analyze daily stock returns for the four failed institutions and a systematically selected peer group of surviving banks vulnerable to the same risks from March 18, 2022, to March 15, 2023. Our results provide strong evidence for this contagion channel: total system connectedness surged dramatically during the crisis peak, and we identify SIVB, FRC, and WAL as primary net transmitters of risk while their perceived peers became significant net receivers, a key dynamic indicator of systemic vulnerability that cannot be captured by asset-by-asset analysis. We further demonstrate that these spillovers were significantly amplified by market sentiment (as measured by the VIX) and economic policy uncertainty (EPU). By providing a clear conceptual framework and robust empirical validation, our findings confirm the persistence of systemic risks within the banking network and highlight the importance of real-time monitoring in strengthening financial stability.</description>

      <title>The Recalibration Conundrum: Hedging Valuation Adjustment for Callable Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamic hedging theory only makes sense in the setup of one given model, whereas the practice of dynamic hedging is just the opposite, with models fleeing after the data through daily recalibration. This is quite of a quantitative finance paradox. In this paper we revisit Burnett (2021) \&amp; Burnett and Williams (2021)'s notion of hedging valuation adjustment (HVA), originally intended to deal with dynamic hedging frictions, in the direction of recalibration and model risks. Specifically, we extend to callable assets the HVA model risk approach of B{\'e}n{\'e}zet and Cr{\'e}pey (2024). The classical way to deal with model risk is to reserve the differences between the valuations in reference models and in the local models used by traders. However, while traders' prices are thus corrected, their hedging strategies and their exercise decisions are still wrong, which necessitates a risk-adjusted reserve. We illustrate our approach on a stylized callable range accrual representative of huge amounts of structured products on the market. We show that a model risk reserve adjusted for the risk of wrong exercise decisions may largely exceed a basic reserve only accounting for valuation differences.</description>

      <title>Optimal design of reinsurance contracts with a continuum of risk assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we employ a principal-agent model to analyze optimal contract design in a monopolistic reinsurance market under adverse selection with a continuum of insurer types. Instead of using the classical expected utility framework, we model each insurer's risk preference through their VaR at their chosen risk tolerance level. Under informational asymmetry, the reinsurer (principal) seeks to maximize expected profit by offering an optimal menu of reinsurance contracts to a continuum of insurers (agents) with hidden characteristics. To avoid the complexity of the traditional duality approach, which yields indirect multivariate utility functions, we introduce a change of variables that reduces the problem to a univariate one. We show that the optimal indirect utility for both stop-loss and quota-share reinsurance is in stop-loss form, implying that the reinsurer will classify agents into two risk groups-high and low-even in the continuum setting. Utilizing this new class of indirect utility functions, we fully solve the problem for three common reinsurance structures: stop-loss, quota-share, and change-loss. Numerical examples are also provided for illustrating the main findings.</description>
