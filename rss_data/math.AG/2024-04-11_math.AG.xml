      <title>Motivic Lefschetz theorem for twisted Milnor hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Grothendieck-Chow motive of a smooth hyperplane section $Y$ of an inner twisted form $X$ of a Milnor hypersurface splits as a direct sum of shifted copies of the motive of the Severi-Brauer variety of the associated cyclic algebra $A$ and the motive of its maximal commutative subfield $L\subset A$. The proof is based on the non-triviality of the (monodromy) Galois action on the equivariant Chow group of $Y_L$.</description>

      <title>Abundance theorem for minimal projective varieties satisfying Miyaoka's equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve the abundance conjecture for minimal projective klt varieties $X$ satisfying Miyaoka's equality $3c_2(X) = c_{1}(X)^{2}$. Specifically, we prove that the canonical divisor $K_{X}$ is semi-ample and the Kodaira dimension $\kappa(K_{X})$ is either $0$, $1$, or $2$. Moreover, according to the Kodaira dimension, we reveal the structure of the Iitaka fibration of $X$ up to quasi-\'etale covers. Additionally, we show similar results for projective klt varieties with nef anti-canonical divisor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of length of triangulated categories, and we compute the length of the derived category ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(C)$ of a smooth projective curve $C$ and classify all finite length thick subcategories of ${\rm D}^{\rm b}(C)$. We also discuss the length of (1) derived categories of finite dimensional representations of ADE quivers, (2) derived categories of some singular varieties and (3) Krah's phantom subcategories.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Virtual Structure Constants and Generalizations of BCOV-Zinger Formula to Projective Fano Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a recipe for B-model computation of genus 1 Gromov-Witten invariants of Calabi-Yau and Fano Projective Hypersurfaces. Our formalism can be applied equally to both Calabi-Yau and Fano cases. In Calabi-Yau case, drastic cancellation of terms used in our formalism occurs and it results in another representation of BCOV-Zinger formula for projective Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Coherent sheaves on primitive multiple curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A primitive multiple scheme is a Cohen-Macaulay scheme $Y$ such that the associated reduced scheme $X=Y_{red}$ is smooth, irreducible, and that $Y$ can be locally embedded in a smooth variety of dimension $\dim(X)+1$. If $I_X$ is the ideal sheaf of $X$ in $Y$ and $Y\not=X$, then $L=I_X/I_X^2$ is a line bundle on $X$, called the associated line bundle of $Y$.
  Even if $X$ is projective, $Y$ needs not to be quasi projective. We define in every case the reduced Hilbert polynomial $P_{red,O_X(1)}(E)$ of a coherent sheaf $E$ on $Y$, depending on the choice of an ample line bundle $O_X(1)$ on $X$. We conjecture that if $F$ is a flat family of sheaves on $Y$ parameterized by a smooth curve $C$, then $P_{red,O_X(1)}(F_c)$ does not depend on $c\in C$. We prove that it is true in two important cases: the families of quasi locally free sheaves, and if $Y$ is of multiplicity 2, the families of balanced sheaves. Balanced sheaves are generalizations of vector bundles on $Y$, and could be used to expand already known moduli spaces of vector bundles on $Y$.
  When $X$ is a smooth projective surface, and $Y$ is of multiplicity 2 we study the simplest examples of balanced sheaves: the sheaves $E$ such that there is an exact sequence \[0\longrightarrow I_P\otimes L\longrightarrow E\longrightarrow I_P=E_{|X} \longrightarrow 0 \ , \] where $I_P\subset O_X$ is the ideal sheaf of a point $P\in X$. They can also be described as the ideal sheaves $E$ of subschemes of $Y$ concentrated on $P$, and such that $E_P$ is generated by two elements whose images in $O_{X,P}$ generate the maximal ideal. There is a moduli space for such sheaves, which is an affine bundle on $X$ with associated vector bundle $T_X\otimes L$ (where $T_X$ is the tangent bundle of $X$). The associated class in $H^1(X,T_X\otimes L)$ can be determined.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to semiorthogonal decompositions for singular projective varieties II: Representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that odd-dimensional projective varieties with tilting objects and only ADE-singularities are nodal, i.e. they only have $A_1$-singularities. This is a very special case of more general obstructions to the existence of semiorthogonal decompositions for projective Gorenstein varieties. More precisely, for many isolated hypersurface singularities, we show that Kuznetsov-Shinder's categorical absorptions of singularities cannot contain tilting objects. The key idea is to compare singularity categories of projective varieties to singularity categories of finite-dimensional associative Gorenstein algebras. The former often contain special generators, called cluster-tilting objects, which typically have loops and $2$-cycles in their quivers. In contrast, quivers of cluster-tilting objects in the latter categories, can never have loops or $2$-cycles.</description>

      <title>Matroidal polynomials, their singularities, and applications to Feynman diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a matroid or flag of matroids we introduce several broad classes of polynomials satisfying Deletion-Contraction identities, and study their singularities.
  There are three main families of polynomials captured by our approach: matroidal polynomials on a matroid (including matroid basis polynomials, configuration polynomials, Tutte polynomials); flag matroidal polynomials on a flag matroid; and Feynman integrands. The last class includes under general kinematics the inhomogeneous Feynman diagram polynomials which naturally arise in the Lee--Pomeransky form of the Feynman integral attached to a Feynman diagram.
  Assuming that the primary underlying matroid is connected and of positive rank (and in the flag case, has rank at least two), we show: a) in positive characteristic, homogeneous matroidal polynomials are strongly $F$-regular; b) over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, the associated jet schemes of (flag) matroidal polynomials as well as those of Feynman integrands are irreducible. Consequently, all these polynomials have rational singularities (or are smooth).</description>

      <title>Nearby cycles at infinity as a triangulated functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field and $g \colon Y \longrightarrow X$, $f \colon X \longrightarrow \mathbb{A}_k^1$ be morphisms of quasi-projective $k$-varieties. In his thesis, Ayoub developed the theory of motivic nearby cycles functors $\Psi_{f},\Psi_{f \circ g}$. They are equipped with several base change morphisms such as $\mu_g \colon g_{\sigma!}\Psi_{f \circ g} \longrightarrow \Psi_f g_{\eta !}$, $\nu_g\colon \Psi_{f \circ g}g_{\eta}^! \longrightarrow g_{\sigma}^!\Psi_f$, which are isomorphisms if $g$ is projective and smooth, respectively. In this article, we remove the quasi-projectiveness of varieties in these base change morphisms by following a classical formulation of Deligne. As an application, we prove that the cone of $\mu_g$ is a triangulated functor. It turns out that nearby cycles at infinity constructed by Raibaut is incarnation of this cone functor.</description>

      <title>Representability of Elliptic Moduli Problems in Derived $C^{\infty}$-Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study moduli spaces of solutions of nonlinear Partial Differential Equations on manifolds in the framework of derived $C^{\infty}$-geometry. For an arbitrary smooth stack $S$, we define $S$-families of nonlinear PDEs acting between $S$-families of submersions over an $S$-family of manifolds and show that in case the family of PDEs is elliptic and the base family of manifolds is proper over $S$, then the moduli stack of solutions is relatively representable by quasi-smooth derived $C^{\infty}$-schemes over $S$. Along the way, we develop tools to analyse the local structure of families of mapping stacks between manifolds and explain how to compare mapping stacks in smooth and in derived geometry. To access the notion of a family of PDEs over an arbitrary smooth base stack, we introduce a formalism of stacks of relative jets. Finally, we show how natural ideas from (higher) topos theory can be leveraged to facilitate the application of nonlinear Fredholm analysis to derived stacks of solutions of elliptic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Generic representations, open parameters and ABV-packets for $p$-adic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $\pi$ is a representation of a $p$-adic group $G(F)$, and $\phi$ is its Langlands parameter, can we use the moduli space of Langlands parameters to find a geometric property of $\phi$ that will detect when $\pi$ is generic? In this paper we show that if $G$ is classical or if we assume the Kazhdan-Lusztig hypothesis for $G$, then the answer is yes, and the property is that the orbit of $\phi$ is open. We also propose an adaptation of Shahidi's enhanced genericity conjecture to ABV-packets: for every Langlands parameter $\phi$ for a $p$-adic group $G(F)$, the ABV-packet $\Pi^{\mathrm{ABV}}_\phi(G(F))$ contains a generic representation if and only if the local adjoint L-function $L(s,\phi,\mathop{\text{Ad}})$ is regular at $s=1$, and show that this condition is equivalent to the "open parameter" condition above. We show that this genericity conjecture for ABV-packets follows from other standard conjectures and we verify its validity with the same conditions on $G$. We show that, in this case, the ABV-packet for $\phi$ coincides with its $L$-packet. Finally, we prove Vogan's conjecture on $A$-packets for tempered parameters.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by Murre's work on universal regular homomorphisms on Chow groups in codimension $2,$ we generalize the algebraic equivalence relation and regular homomorphisms to the context of Voevodsky motives over a field. In the Nisnevich topology, we prove the existence of \emph{universal} regular homomorphisms for a certain class of motivic cohomology groups, recovering Murre's theorem and the existence of Picard and Albanese varieties as special cases. This class also includes interesting cases such as higher Chow groups and Milnor $K$-groups. The appendix by Kahn proves that, for \'etale motives, universal regular homomorphisms exist for all geometric motives and compares them with those in the Nisnevich topology when both exist.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.16523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Witten $r$-spin class defines a non-semisimple cohomological field theory. Pandharipande, Pixton and Zvonkine studied two special shifts of the Witten class along two semisimple directions of the associated Dubrovin--Frobenius manifold using the Givental--Teleman reconstruction theorem. We show that the $R$-matrix and the translation of these two specific shifts can be constructed from the solutions of two differential equations that generalise the classical Airy differential equation. Using this, we prove that the descendant intersection theory of the shifted Witten classes satisfies topological recursion on two $1$-parameter families of spectral curves. By taking the limit as the parameter goes to zero for these families of spectral curves, we prove that the descendant intersection theory of the Witten $r$-spin class can be computed by topological recursion on the $r$-Airy spectral curve. We finally show that this proof suffices to deduce Witten's $r$-spin conjecture, already proved by Faber, Shadrin and Zvonkine, which claims that the generating series of $r$-spin intersection numbers is the tau function of the $r$-KdV hierarchy that satisfies the string equation.</description>

Abstract: Given a smooth, projective curve $Y$, a finite group $G$ and a positive integer $n$ we study smooth, proper families $X\to Y\times S\to S$ of Galois covers of $Y$ with Galois group isomorphic to $G$ branched in $n$ points, parameterized by algebraic varieties $S$. When $G$ is with trivial center we prove that the Hurwitz space $H^G_n(Y)$ is a fine moduli variety for this moduli problem and construct explicitly the universal family. For arbitrary $G$ we prove that $H^G_n(Y)$ is a coarse moduli variety. For families of pointed Galois covers of $(Y,y_0)$ we prove that the Hurwitz space $H^G_n(Y,y_0)$ is a fine moduli variety, and construct explicitly the universal family, for arbitrary group $G$. We use classical tools of algebraic topology and of complex algebraic geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.06985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and motivate the following question: Is every effective strictly nef Cartier divisor on a projective variety big? In the appendix, Andreas H\"oring produces a counterexample, thus providing a negative answer.</description>

      <title>Vojta's conjecture on weighted projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10300v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate Vojta's conjecture for smooth weighted projective varieties, weighted multiplier ideal sheaves, and weighted log pairs and prove that all three versions of the conjecture are equivalent. In the process, we introduce generalized weighted general common divisors and express them as heights of weighted projective spaces blown-up relative to an exceptional divisor. Furthermore, we prove that assuming Vojta's conjecture for weighted projective varieties one can bound the $\log {\rm h_{wgcd}}$ for any subvariety of codimension $\geq 2$ and a finite set of places $S$. An analogue result is proved for weighted homogeneous polynomials with integer coefficients.</description>

      <title>Constructions of derived equivalent hyper-K\"ahler fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study twisted derived equivalences of hyper-K\"ahler fourfolds. We describe when two hyper-K\"ahler fourfolds of $K3^{[2]}$-type of Picard rank $1$ with isomorphic transcendental lattices are derived equivalent. Then we present new constructions of pairs of twisted derived equivalent hyper-K\"ahler manifolds of Picard rank $\geq 2$.</description>

Abstract: We prove an optimal Kawamata-Miyaoka type inequality for terminal $\mathbb Q$-Fano threefolds with Fano index $\geq 3$. As an application, we obtain that any terminal $\mathbb Q$-Fano threefold $X$ satisfies the following Kawamata-Miyaoka type inequality \[ c_1(X)^3 &lt; 3c_2(X)c_1(X). \]</description>

      <title>On the integrality of \'etale extensions of polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a valuation theorem, recently obtained by Rangachev, we study the \'etale extensions $A\subset B$ of polynomial rings over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, such that the integral closure $\overline{A}$ is a primary $\overline{A}$-submodule of $B$. We prove that in this case $\overline{A}$ has infinite cyclic divisor class group, where the generator is a prime divisor equal to the complement of $\textrm{Spec}(B)$ in $\textrm{Spec}(\overline{A})$. Moreover, this prime divisor coincides with the ramification divisor of the finite extension $A\subset \overline{A}$. In this situation we carry out Wright's geometric approach for two-dimensional non-integral \'etale extensions. It follows from the work of Miyanishi that $\textrm{Spec}(\overline{A})$ is a smooth affine surface. We show that $\textrm{Spec}(\overline{A})$ is an $\mathbb{A}^{1}$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$, more precisely a Danilov-Gizatullin surface of index three. Based on Wright's analysis of which of these affine surfaces can factorize an \'etale morphism of the complex affine plane and his description of its affine coordinate rings, we prove that under the strong assumption that $\overline{A}$ is always a primary $\overline{A}$-submodule of $B$, any two-dimensional complex \'etale extension is integral.</description>

      <title>Uniform approximation of Betti numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that Lefschetz's principle of approximating the cohomology of a possibly singular affine scheme of finite type over a field by the cohomology of a suitable (thickening of a) hyperplane section can be made uniform: in the affine case, we can choose the hyperplane section independently of the cohomology. Using Jouanolou's trick, this gives a new way to bound the Betti numbers of quasi-projective schemes over a field, independently of the cohomology. This is achieved through a motivic version of Deligne's generic base change formula and an axiomatic presentation of the theory of perverse sheaves. These methods produce generating families of Voevodsky motivic sheaves that are realized in perverse sheaves over any base of equal characteristic.</description>

      <title>The general Arason-Pfister Hauptsatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present we develop a fragment of the theory of superfields, polynomials and Marshall's quotient in order to obtain for general special groups, a proof of the Arason-Pfister Hauptsatz (APH): "if $\phi \neq \emptyset$ is an anisotropic form and $\phi \in I^n(F)$ then $dim (\phi) \geq 2^n$". In the process, we also obtain an alternative proof of APH for reduced special groups that avoid the uses of the invariants developed in \cite{dickmann2000special}. The applications of the full Arason-Pfister Hauptsatz leads to interesting properties of graded rings associated to special groups/hyperfields.
  \textbf{Keywords:} Arason-Pfister Hauptsatz; hyperfields; special groups; Milnor K-theory; graded rings.</description>
