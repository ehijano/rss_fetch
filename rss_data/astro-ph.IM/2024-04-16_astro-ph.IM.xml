      <title>Can AI Understand Our Universe? Test of Fine-Tuning GPT by Astrophysical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ChatGPT has been the most talked-about concept in recent months, captivating both professionals and the general public alike, and has sparked discussions about the changes that artificial intelligence (AI) will bring to the world. As physicists and astrophysicists, we are curious about if scientific data can be correctly analyzed by large language models (LLMs) and yield accurate physics. In this article, we fine-tune the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) model by the astronomical data from the observations of galaxies, quasars, stars, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and the simulations of black holes (BHs), the fine-tuned model demonstrates its capability to classify astrophysical phenomena, distinguish between two types of GRBs, deduce the redshift of quasars, and estimate BH parameters. We regard this as a successful test, marking the LLM's proven efficacy in scientific research. With the ever-growing volume of multidisciplinary data and the advancement of AI technology, we look forward to the emergence of a more fundamental and comprehensive understanding of our universe. This article also shares some interesting thoughts on data collection and AI design. Using the approach of understanding the universe - looking outward at data and inward for fundamental building blocks - as a guideline, we propose a method of series expansion for AI, suggesting ways to train and control AI that is smarter than humans.</description>

      <title>Rotation and flipping invariant self-organizing maps with astronomical images: A cookbook and application to the VLA Sky Survey QuickLook images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern wide field radio surveys typically detect millions of objects. Techniques based on machine learning are proving to be useful for classifying large numbers of objects. The self-organizing map (SOM) is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that projects a many-dimensional dataset onto a two- or three-dimensional lattice of neurons. This dimensionality reduction allows the user to visualize common features of the data better and develop algorithms for classifying objects that are not otherwise possible with large datasets. To this aim, we use the PINK implementation of a SOM. PINK incorporates rotation and flipping invariance so that the SOM algorithm may be applied to astronomical images. In this cookbook we provide instructions for working with PINK, including preprocessing the input images, training the model, and offering lessons learned through experimentation. The problem of imbalanced classes can be improved by careful selection of the training sample and increasing the number of neurons in the SOM (chosen by the user). Because PINK is not scale-invariant, structure can be smeared in the neurons. This can also be improved by increasing the number of neurons in the SOM. We also introduce pyink, a Python package used to read and write PINK binary files, assist in common preprocessing operations, perform standard analyses, visualize the SOM and preprocessed images, and create image-based annotations using a graphical interface. A tutorial is also provided to guide the user through the entire process. We present an application of PINK to VLA Sky Survey (VLASS) images. We demonstrate that the PINK is generally able to group VLASS sources with similar morphology together. We use the results of PINK to estimate the probability that a given source in the VLASS QuickLook Catalogue is actually due to sidelobe contamination.</description>

      <title>A 25-micron single photon sensitive kinetic inductance detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements characterizing the performance of a kinetic inductance detector array designed for a wavelength of 25 microns and very low optical background level suitable for applications such as a far-infrared instrument on a cryogenically cooled space telescope. In a pulse counting mode of operation at low optical flux, the detectors can resolve individual 25-micron photons. In an integrating mode, the detectors remain photon noise limited over more than six orders of magnitude in absorbed power from 70 zW to 200 fW, with a limiting NEP of 4.6 x 10^-20 W/rtHz at 1 Hz. In addition, the detectors are highly stable with flat power spectra under optical load down to 1 mHz. Operational parameters of the detector are determined including the efficiency of conversion of the incident optical power into quasiparticles in the aluminum absorbing element and the quasiparticle self-recombination constant.</description>

      <title>Representations of Noisy $N$-Ports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much has been written about the representation of noisy linear 2-ports. Here we present a theory of noisy $N$-ports. We show how in the general case there are $(2N)!/(N!)^2$ equivalent representations and give the transformations relating them. We also discuss singular cases in which some of the transformations are not possible as well as how to measure the noise properties of an $N$-port. This work is motivated by the REACH experiment to observe the global 21 cm signal for which modelling noise with exquisite precision is essential for a reliable calibration.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning and LLM-based Methods Applied to Stellar Lightcurve Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light curves serve as a valuable source of information on stellar formation and evolution. With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, it can be effectively processed to extract astronomical patterns and information. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation of deep-learning and large language model (LLM) based models for the automatic classification of variable star light curves, based on large datasets from the Kepler and K2 missions. Special emphasis is placed on Cepheids, RR Lyrae, and eclipsing binaries, examining the influence of observational cadence and phase distribution on classification precision. Employing AutoDL optimization, we achieve striking performance with the 1D-Convolution+BiLSTM architecture and the Swin Transformer, hitting accuracies of 94\% and 99\% correspondingly, with the latter demonstrating a notable 83\% accuracy in discerning the elusive Type II Cepheids-comprising merely 0.02\% of the total dataset.We unveil StarWhisper LightCurve (LC), an innovative Series comprising three LLM-based models: LLM, multimodal large language model (MLLM), and Large Audio Language Model (LALM). Each model is fine-tuned with strategic prompt engineering and customized training methods to explore the emergent abilities of these models for astronomical data. Remarkably, StarWhisper LC Series exhibit high accuracies around 90\%, significantly reducing the need for explicit feature engineering, thereby paving the way for streamlined parallel data processing and the progression of multifaceted multimodal models in astronomical applications. The study furnishes two detailed catalogs illustrating the impacts of phase and sampling intervals on deep learning classification accuracy, showing that a substantial decrease of up to 14\% in observation duration and 21\% in sampling points can be realized without compromising accuracy by more than 10\%.</description>

      <title>Classifying binary black holes from Population III stars with the Einstein Telescope: a machine-learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors like the Einstein Telescope (ET) will observe binary black hole (BBH) mergers at redshifts up to $z\sim 100$. However, unequivocal determination of the origin of high-redshift sources will remain uncertain, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and poor estimate of their luminosity distance. This study proposes a machine learning approach to infer the origins of high-redshift BBHs, specifically differentiating those arising from Population III (Pop. III) stars - likely the first progenitors of stellar-born BBH mergers in the Universe - and those originated from Population I-II (Pop. I-II) stars. We have considered a wide range of state-of-the-art models encompassing current uncertainties on Pop. III BBH mergers. We then estimate parameter errors of detected sources with ET using the Fisher-information-matrix formalism, followed by classification using XGBoost, a machine learning algorithm based on decision trees. For a set of mock observed BBHs, we provide the probability that they belong to the Pop. III class while considering the parameter errors of each source. In our fiducial model, we accurately identify ~10% of detected BBHs originating from Pop. III stars with &gt; 90% precision. Our study demonstrates how machine learning enables to achieve some pivotal aspects of ET science case by exploring the origin of individual high-redshift GW observations. We set the basis for further studies, which will integrate additional simulated populations and account for population modeling uncertainties</description>

      <title>Pinpointing coalescing binary neutron star sources with the IGWN, including LIGO-Aundha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15695v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LIGO-Aundha (A1), the Indian gravitational wave detector, is expected to join the IGWN and begin operations in the early 2030s. We study the impact of A1 on the accuracy of determining the direction of incoming transient signals from coalescing BNS sources with moderately high SNRs. It is conceivable that A1's sensitivity, effective bandwidth, and duty cycle will improve incrementally through multiple detector commissioning rounds to achieve the desired `LIGO-A+' design sensitivity. For this purpose, we examine A1 under two distinct noise PSDs. One mirrors the conditions during the O4 run of the LIGO Hanford and Livingston detectors, simulating an early commissioning stage, while the other represents the A+ design sensitivity. We consider various duty cycles of A1 at the sensitivities mentioned above for a comprehensive analysis. We show that even at the O4 sensitivity with a modest $20\%$ duty cycle, A1's addition to the IGWN leads to a $15\%$ reduction in median sky-localization errors ($\Delta \Omega_{90\%}$) to $5.6$~sq.~deg. At its design sensitivity and $80\%$ duty cycle, this error shrinks further to $2.4$~sq.~deg, with 84\% sources localized within a nominal error box of $10$~sq.~deg! Even in the worst-case scenario, where signals are sub-threshold in A1, we demonstrate its critical role in reducing the localization uncertainties of the BNS source. Our results are obtained from a large Bayesian PE study using simulated signals injected in a heterogeneous network of detectors using the recently developed meshfree approximation aided rapid Bayesian inference pipeline. We consider a seismic cut-off frequency of 10 Hz for all the detectors. We also present hypothetical improvements in sky localization for a few GWTC-like events injected in real data and demonstrate A1's role in resolving the degeneracy between the luminosity distance and inclination angle parameters.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional atmospheric dynamics of Jupiter from ground-based Doppler imaging spectroscopy in the visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present three-dimensional (3D) maps of Jupiter's atmospheric circulation at cloud-top level from Doppler-imaging data obtained in the visible domain with JIVE, the second node of the JOVIAL network, which is mounted on the Dunn Solar Telescope at Sunspot, New Mexico. We report on 12 nights of observations between May 4 and May 30, 2018, representing a total of about 80 hours. Firstly, the average zonal wind profile derived from our data is compatible with that derived from cloud-tracking measurements performed on Hubble Space Telescope images obtained in April 2018 from the Outer Planet Atmospheres Legacy (OPAL) program. Secondly, we present the first ever two-dimensional maps of Jupiter's atmospheric circulation from Doppler measurements. The zonal velocity map highlights well-known atmospheric features, such as the equatorial hot spots and the Great Red Spot (GRS). In addition to zonal winds, we derive meridional and vertical velocity fields from the Doppler data. The motions attributed to vertical flows are mainly located at the boundary between the equatorial belts and tropical zones, which could indicate active motion in theses regions. Qualitatively, these results compare well to recent Juno data that have unveiled the three-dimensional structure of Jupiter's wind field. To the contrary, the motions attributed to meridional circulation are very different from what is obtained by cloud tracking, except at the GRS. Because of limitations with data resolution and processing techniques, we acknowledge that our measurement of vertical or meridional flows of Jupiter are still to be confirmed.</description>
