      <title>Active learning for energy-based antibody optimization and enhanced screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction and optimization of protein-protein binding affinity is crucial for therapeutic antibody development. Although machine learning-based prediction methods $\Delta\Delta G$ are suitable for large-scale mutant screening, they struggle to predict the effects of multiple mutations for targets without existing binders. Energy function-based methods, though more accurate, are time consuming and not ideal for large-scale screening. To address this, we propose an active learning workflow that efficiently trains a deep learning model to learn energy functions for specific targets, combining the advantages of both approaches. Our method integrates the RDE-Network deep learning model with Rosetta's energy function-based Flex ddG to efficiently explore mutants that bind to Flex ddG. In a case study targeting HER2-binding Trastuzumab mutants, our approach significantly improved the screening performance over random selection and demonstrated the ability to identify mutants with better binding properties without experimental $\Delta\Delta G$ data. This workflow advances computational antibody design by combining machine learning, physics-based computations, and active learning to achieve more efficient antibody development.</description>

      <title>Manifold-Constrained Nucleus-Level Denoising Diffusion Model for Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence models have shown great potential in structure-based drug design, generating ligands with high binding affinities. However, existing models have often overlooked a crucial physical constraint: atoms must maintain a minimum pairwise distance to avoid separation violation, a phenomenon governed by the balance of attractive and repulsive forces. To mitigate such separation violations, we propose NucleusDiff. It models the interactions between atomic nuclei and their surrounding electron clouds by enforcing the distance constraint between the nuclei and manifolds. We quantitatively evaluate NucleusDiff using the CrossDocked2020 dataset and a COVID-19 therapeutic target, demonstrating that NucleusDiff reduces violation rate by up to 100.00% and enhances binding affinity by up to 22.16%, surpassing state-of-the-art models for structure-based drug design. We also provide qualitative analysis through manifold sampling, visually confirming the effectiveness of NucleusDiff in reducing separation violations and improving binding affinities.</description>

      <title>How to explain the sensitivity of DNA double-strand breaks yield to 125I position?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Auger emitters exhibit interesting features due to their emission of a cascade of short-range Auger electrons. Maximum DNA breakage efficacy is achieved when decays occur near DNA. Studies of double-strand breaks (DSBs) yields in plasmids revealed cutoff distances from DNA axis of 10.5-12 {\AA}, beyond which the mechanism of DSBs moves from direct to indirect effects, and the yield decreases rapidly. Some authors suggested that the average energy deposited in a DNA cylinder could explain such cutoffs. We aimed to study this hypothesis in further detail.Materials and methods: Using the Monte Carlo code CELLDOSE, we investigated the influence of the 125I atom position on energy deposits and absorbed doses per decay not only in a DNA cylinder, but also in individual strands, each modeled as 10 spheres encompassing the fragility sites for phosphodiester bond cleavage.Results: The dose per decay decreased much more rapidly for a sphere in the proximal strand than for the DNA cylinder. For example, when moving the 125I source from 10.5 {\AA} to 11.5 {\AA}, the average dose to the sphere dropped by 43%, compared to only 13% in the case of the cylinder.Conclusions: Explaining variations in DSBs yields with 125I position should consider the probability of inducing damage in the proximal strand (nearest to the 125I atom). The energy received by fragility sites in this strand is highly influenced by the isotropic (4$\pi$) emission of 125I low-energy Auger electrons. The positioning of Auger emitters for targeted radionuclide therapy can be envisioned accordingly.</description>

      <title>Infer metabolic velocities from moment differences of molecular weight distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14887v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metabolic pathways are fundamental maps in biochemistry that detail how molecules are transformed through various reactions. The complexity of metabolic network, where a single compound can play a part in multiple pathways, poses a challenge in inferring metabolic balance changes over time or after different treatments. Isotopic labeling experiment is the standard method to infer metabolic flux, which is currently defined as the flow of a single metabolite through a given pathway over time. However, there is still no way to accurately infer the metabolic balance changes after different treatments in an experiment. This study introduces a different concept: molecular weight distribution, which is the empirical distribution of the molecular weights of all metabolites of interest. By estimating the differences of the location and scale estimates of these distributions, it becomes possible to quantitatively infer the metabolic balance changes even without requiring knowledge of the exact chemical structures of these compounds and their related pathways. This research article provides a mathematical framing for a classic biological concept.</description>
