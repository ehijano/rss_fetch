      <title>Generalized Parameter Lifting: Finer Abstractions for Parametric Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric Markov chains (pMCs) are Markov chains (MCs) with symbolic probabilities. A pMC encodes a family of MCs, where each member is obtained by replacing parameters with constants. The parameters allow encoding dependencies between transitions, which sets pMCs apart from interval MCs. The verification problem for pMCs asks whether each MC in the corresponding family satisfies a given temporal specification. The state-of-the-art approach for this problem is parameter lifting (PL) -- an abstraction-refinement loop that abstracts the pMC to a non-parametric model analyzed with standard probabilistic model checking techniques. This paper presents two key improvements to tackle the main limitations of PL. First, we introduce generalized parameter lifting (GPL) to lift various restrictive assumptions made by PL. Second, we present a big-step transformation algorithm that reduces parameter dependencies in pMCs and, therefore, results in tighter approximations. Experiments show that GPL is widely applicable and that the big-step transformation accelerates pMC verification by up to orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Canonical for Automated Theorem Proving in Lean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canonical is a solver for type inhabitation in dependent type theory, that is, the problem of producing a term of a given type. We present a Lean tactic which invokes Canonical to generate proof terms and synthesize programs. The tactic supports higher-order and dependently-typed goals, structural recursion over indexed inductive types, and definitional equality. Canonical finds proofs for 84% of Natural Number Game problems in 51 seconds total.</description>

      <title>Learning Verified Monitors for Hidden~Markov~Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Runtime monitors assess whether a system is in an unsafe state based on a stream of observations. We study the problem where the system is subject to probabilistic uncertainty and described by a hidden Markov model. A stream of observations is then unsafe if the probability of being in an unsafe state is above a threshold. A correct monitor recognizes the set of unsafe observations. The key contribution of this paper is the first correct-by-construction synthesis method for such monitors, represented as finite automata. The contribution combines four ingredients: First, we establish the coNP-hardness of checking whether an automaton is a correct monitor, i.e., a monitor without misclassifications. Second, we provide a reduction that reformulates the search for misclassifications into a standard probabilistic system synthesis problem. Third, we integrate the verification routine into an active automata learning routine to synthesize correct monitors. Fourth, we provide a prototypical implementation that shows the feasibility and limitations of the approach on a series of benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Relating Reversible Petri Nets and Reversible Event Structures, categorically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14195v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal nets (CNs) are Petri nets where causal dependencies are modelled via inhibitor arcs. They play the role of occurrence nets when representing the behaviour of a concurrent and distributed system, even when reversibility is considered. In this paper we extend CNs to account also for asymmetric conflicts and study (i) how this kind of nets, and their reversible versions, can be turned into a category; and (ii) their relation with the categories of reversible asymmetric event structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14036v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new encoding of the Battle of Hercules and Hydra as a rewrite system with AC symbols. Unlike earlier term rewriting encodings, it faithfully models any strategy of Hercules to beat Hydra. To prove the termination of our encoding, we employ type introduction in connection with many-sorted semantic labeling for AC rewriting and AC-MPO, a new AC compatible reduction order that can be seen as a much weakened version of AC-RPO.</description>

      <title>Input-based Three-valued Abstraction Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12668v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), Three-Valued Abstraction Refinement (TVAR) is able to verify all properties of the mu-calculus. We present a novel algorithmic framework for TVAR that -- unlike the previous ones -- does not depend on modal transitions in the state space formalism. This entirely bypasses complications introduced to ensure monotonicity in previous frameworks and allows for simpler reasoning. The key idea, inspired by (Generalized) Symbolic Trajectory Evaluation and Delayed Nondeterminism, is to refine using abstract inputs rather than abstract states. We prove that the framework is sound, monotone, and complete, and evaluate a free and open-source implementation of an instantiation of the framework, demonstrating its ability to mitigate exponential explosion.</description>

      <title>Formalising Inductive and Coinductive Containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02603v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Containers capture the concept of strictly positive data types in programming. The original development of containers is done in the internal language of locally cartesian closed categories (LCCCs) with disjoint coproducts and W-types, and uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP) is implicitly assumed throughout. Although it is claimed that these developments can also be interpreted in extensional Martin-L\"of type theory, this interpretation is not made explicit. In this paper, we present a formalisation of the results that 'containers preserve least and greatest fixed points' in Cubical Agda, thereby giving a formulation in intensional type theory. Our proofs do not make use of UIP and thereby generalise the original results from talking about container functors on Set to container functors on the wild category of types. Our main incentive for using Cubical Agda is that its path type restores the equivalence between bisimulation and coinductive equality. Thus, besides developing container theory in a more general setting, we also demonstrate the usefulness of Cubical Agda's path type to coinductive proofs.</description>

      <title>From Sound Workflow Nets to LTLf Declarative Specifications by Casting Three Spells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In process management, effective behavior modeling is essential for understanding execution dynamics and identifying potential issues. Two complementary paradigms have emerged in the pursuit of this objective: the imperative approach, representing all allowed runs of a system in a graph-based model, and the declarative one, specifying the rules that a run must not violate in a constraint-based specification. Extensive studies have been conducted on the synergy and comparisons of the two paradigms. To date, though, whether a declarative specification could be systematically derived from an imperative model such that the original behavior was fully preserved (and if so, how) remained an unanswered question. In this paper, we propose a three-fold contribution. (1) We introduce a systematic approach to synthesize declarative process specifications from safe and sound Workflow nets. (2) We prove behavioral equivalence of the input net with the output specification, alongside related guarantees. (3) We experimentally demonstrate the scalability and compactness of our encoding through tests conducted with synthetic and real-world testbeds.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Fractal Numbers and the Classical Continuum Hypothesis (CH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a reinterpretation of the continuum grounded in the stratified structure of definability rather than classical cardinality. In this framework, a real number is not an abstract point on the number line, but an object expressible at some level Fn of a formal hierarchy. We introduce the notion of "fractal numbers" -- entities defined not within a fixed set-theoretic universe, but through layered expressibility across constructive systems. This reconceptualizes irrationality as a relative property, depending on definability depth, and replaces the binary dichotomy between countable and uncountable sets with a gradated spectrum of definability classes. We show that the classical Continuum Hypothesis loses its force in this context: between aleph_0 and c lies not a single cardinal jump, but a stratified sequence of definitional stages, each forming a countable yet irreducible approximation to the continuum. We argue that the real line should not be seen as a completed totality but as an evolving architecture of formal expressibility. We conclude with a discussion of rational invariants, the relativity of irrationality, and the emergence of a fractal metric for definitional density.</description>

      <title>HypRL: Reinforcement Learning of Control Policies for Hyperproperties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning control policies for complex tasks whose requirements are given by a hyperproperty. The use of hyperproperties is motivated by their significant power to formally specify requirements of multi-agent systems as well as those that need expressiveness in terms of multiple execution traces (e.g., privacy and fairness). Given a Markov decision process M with unknown transitions (representing the environment) and a HyperLTL formula $\varphi$, our approach first employs Skolemization to handle quantifier alternations in $\varphi$. We introduce quantitative robustness functions for HyperLTL to define rewards of finite traces of M with respect to $\varphi$. Finally, we utilize a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm to learn (1) a policy per trace quantifier in $\varphi$, and (2) the probability distribution of transitions of M that together maximize the expected reward and, hence, probability of satisfaction of $\varphi$ in M. We present a set of case studies on (1) safety-preserving multi-agent path planning, (2) fairness in resource allocation, and (3) the post-correspondence problem (PCP).</description>
