      <title>First determination of the angular dependence of rise and decay times of solar radio bursts using multi-spacecraft observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio photons interact with anisotropic density fluctuations in the heliosphere, which can alter their trajectory and influence properties deduced from observations. This is particularly evident in solar radio observations, where anisotropic scattering leads to highly-directional radio emissions. Consequently, observers at varying locations will measure different properties, including different source sizes, source positions, and intensities. However, it is not known if measurements of the decay time of solar radio bursts are also affected by the observer's position. Decay times are dominated by scattering effects, and so are frequently used as proxies of the level of density fluctuations in the heliosphere, making the identification of any location-related dependence crucial. We combine multi-vantage observations of interplanetary Type III bursts from four non-collinear, angularly-separated spacecraft with simulations, to investigate the dependence of both the decay- and rise-time measurements on the separation of the observer from the source. We propose a function to characterise the entire time profile of radio signals, allowing for the simultaneous estimation of the peak flux, decay time, and rise time, while demonstrating that the rise phase of radio bursts has a non-constant, non-exponential growth rate. We determine that the decay and rise times are independent of the observer's position, identifying them as the only properties to remain unaffected, thus not requiring corrections for the observer's location. Moreover, we examine the ratio between the rise and decay times, finding that it does not depend on the frequency. Therefore, we provide the first evidence that the rise phase is also significantly impacted by scattering effects, adding to our understanding of the plasma emission process.</description>

      <title>CME Deflection and East-West Asymmetry of ESP Intensity in Solar Cycles 23 and 24</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the East-West asymmetry in energetic storm particle (ESP) heavy ion intensities at interplanetary shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs) during solar cycles (SCs) 23 and 24. We use observations from NASA's ACE and STEREO missions of helium (He), oxygen (O), and iron (Fe) intensities from ~0.13 to 3 MeV/nucleon. We examine the longitudinal distribution of ESP intensities and the correlation of ESP intensities with the near-Sun CME speed and the average transit CME speed for eastern and western events. We observed an East-West asymmetry reversal of ESP heavy ion intensities from SC 23 to 24. We have determined that this change in asymmetry is caused by a shift in the heliolongitude distribution of the CME speed ratio (the ratio of CME near-Sun speed to CME average transit speed) from west to east.</description>

      <title>A New Mechanism For Generating Type-III Radiation From The Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because the conventional method of creating type-III radiation by coalescence of counter-propagating Langmuir waves has not been verified with in-situ data, Parker Solar Probe data was examined in search of such in-situ evidence, which was not found. Instead, a new mechanism for creating type-III radiation has been found as a result of observing slow Langmuir waves (~2200 km/sec) with electric fields as large as 300 mV/m and associated density fluctuations during a developing type-III burst on March 21, 2023. Because of their slow phase velocities, these Langmuir waves had short wavelengths, several times the Debye length of 2.65 meters, and, as a result, k{\lambda}d~0.93. Such waves may be strongly damped to be replaced by new growing bursts of waves that create the characteristic Langmuir waveform that is composed of peaks and valleys of a few milliseconds duration. The average electron current associated with these Langmuir waves is estimated from the strahl as 8 microamps/m2. Peak currents were at least twice these averages. These Langmuir waves produced electrostatic harmonics having slow phase velocities (~2000 km/sec) at frequencies of n{\omega}p, where {\omega}p = 2pi*125 kHz is the Langmuir wave frequency and n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. They also produced density fluctuations at the lowest harmonics. Such waves are not the type-III emission. As at least the first harmonic wave evolved through density irregularities, its wave number decreased and it became the electromagnetic wave that was the type-III radiation.</description>
