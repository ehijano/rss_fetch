      <title>Linear Recurrence Sequence Automata and the Addition of Abstract Numeration Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abstract numeration systems encode natural numbers using radix ordered words of an infinite regular language and linear recurrence sequences play a key role in their valuation. Sequence automata, which are deterministic finite automata with an additional linear recurrence sequence on each transition, are introduced to compute various $\ZZ$-rational non commutating formal series in abstract numeration systems. Under certain Pisot conditions on the recurrence sequences, the support of these series is regular. This property can be leveraged to derive various synchronized relations including a deterministic finite automaton that computes the addition relation of various Dumont-Thomas numeration systems and regular finite automata converting between various numeration systems. A practical implementation for Walnut is provided.</description>

      <title>More on Maximally Permissive Similarity Control of Discrete Event Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Takai proposed a method for constructing a maximally permissive supervisor for the similarity control problem (IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 66(7):3197-3204, 2021). This paper points out that this construction does not(necessarily) work when the specification is not image-finite. Inspired by Takai's construction, the notion of a (saturated) (G, R)-automaton is introduced and metatheorems concerning (maximally permissive) supervisors for the similarity control problem are provided in terms of this notion. As an application of these metatheorems, the flaws in Takai's work are corrected.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Rebeca Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid Rebeca is a modeling framework for asynchronous event-based cyber-physical systems (CPSs). In this work, we extend Hybrid Rebeca to allow the modeling of non-deterministic time behavior. Besides the syntactical extension, we formalize the semantics of the extended language in terms of Timed Transition Systems, and adapt a reachability analysis algorithm originally designed for hybrid automata to be applicable to Hybrid Rebeca models. We prove the soundness of our approach and illustrate its applicability on a case study. The case study demonstrates that our dedicated algorithm is clearly superior to the alternative approach of transforming Hybrid Rebeca models to hybrid automata as an intermediate model and then applying the original reachability analysis method to this intermediate transformed models.</description>

      <title>Learning real-time one-counter automata using polynomially many queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel method for active learning of deterministic real-time one-counter automata (DROCA). The existing techniques for learning DROCA rely on observing the behaviour of the DROCA up to exponentially large counter-values. Our algorithm eliminates this need and requires only a polynomial number of queries. Additionally, our method differs from existing techniques as we learn a minimal counter-synchronous DROCA, resulting in much smaller counter-examples on equivalence queries. Learning a minimal counter-synchronous DROCA cannot be done in polynomial time unless P = NP, even in the case of visibly one-counter automata. We use a SAT solver to overcome this difficulty. The solver is used to compute a minimal separating DFA from a given set of positive and negative samples.
  We prove that the equivalence of two counter-synchronous DROCAs can be checked significantly faster than that of general DROCAs. For visibly one-counter automata, we have discovered an even faster algorithm for equivalence checking. We implemented the proposed learning algorithm and tested it on randomly generated DROCAs. Our evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms the existing techniques on the test set.</description>

      <title>Complete Test Suites for Automata in Monoidal Closed Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformance testing of automata is about checking the equivalence of a known specification and a black-box implementation. An important notion in conformance testing is that of a complete test suite, which guarantees that if an implementation satisfying certain conditions passes all tests, then it is equivalent to the specification.
  We introduce a framework for proving completeness of test suites at the general level of automata in monoidal closed categories. Moreover, we provide a generalization of a classical conformance testing technique, the W-method. We demonstrate the applicability of our results by recovering the W-method for deterministic finite automata, Moore machines, and Mealy machines, and by deriving new instances of complete test suites for weighted automata and deterministic nominal automata.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hofstadter functions $G$, $H$ and beyond: numeration systems and discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12615v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's $G$ function is recursively defined via $G(0)=0$ and then $G(n)=n-G(G(n-1))$. Following Hofstadter, a family $(F_k)$ of similar functions is obtained by varying the number $k$ of nested recursive calls in this equation. We study here some Fibonacci-like sequences that are deeply connected with these functions $F_k$. In particular, the Zeckendorf theorem can be adapted to provide digital expansions via sums of terms of these sequences. On these digital expansions, the functions $F_k$ are acting as right shifts of the digits. These Fibonacci-like sequences can be expressed in terms of zeros of the polynomial $X^k{-}X^{k-1}{-}1$. Considering now the discrepancy of each function $F_k$, i.e., the maximal distance between $F_k$ and its linear equivalent, we retrieve the fact that this discrepancy is finite exactly when $k \le 4$. Thanks to that, we solve two twenty-year-old OEIS conjectures stating how close the functions $F_3$ and $F_4$ are from the integer parts of their linear equivalents. Moreover we establish that $F_k$ can coincide exactly with such an integer part only when $k\le 2$, while $F_k$ is almost additive exactly when $k \le 4$. Finally, a nice fractal shape a la Rauzy has been encountered when investigating the discrepancy of $F_3$. Almost all this article has been formalized and verified in the Coq/Rocq proof assistant.</description>

Abstract: The Narayana morphism $\nu$ maps $0 \rightarrow 01$, $1 \rightarrow 2$, $2 \rightarrow 0$ and has a fixed point $\mathbf{n} = n_0 n_1 n_2 \cdots = {\tt 0120010120120}\cdots$. In this paper we study the properties of this word and related words using automata theory.</description>

      <title>Positionality of Dumont--Thomas numeration systems for integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introduced in 2001 by Lecomte and Rigo, abstract numeration systems provide a way of expressing natural numbers with words from a language $L$ accepted by a finite automaton. As it turns out, these numeration systems are not necessarily positional, i.e., we cannot always find a sequence $U=(U_i)_{i\ge 0}$ of integers such that the value of every word in the language $L$ is determined by the position of its letters and the first few values of $U$. Finding the conditions under which an abstract numeration system is positional seems difficult in general. In this paper, we thus consider this question for a particular sub-family of abstract numeration systems called Dumont--Thomas numeration systems. They are derived from substitutions and were introduced in 1989 by Dumont and Thomas. We exhibit conditions on the underlying substitution so that the corresponding Dumont--Thomas numeration is positional. We first work in the most general setting, then particularize our results to some practical cases. Finally, we link our numeration systems to existing literature, notably properties studied by R\'{e}nyi in 1957, Parry in 1960, Bertrand-Mathis in 1989, and Fabre in 1995.</description>
