      <title>LLM-Generated Counterfactual Stress Scenarios for Portfolio Risk Simulation via Hybrid Prompt-RAG Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a transparent and fully auditable LLM-based pipeline for macro-financial stress testing, combining structured prompting with optional retrieval of country fundamentals and news. The system generates machine-readable macroeconomic scenarios for the G7, which cover GDP growth, inflation, and policy rates, and are translated into portfolio losses through a factor-based mapping that enables Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall assessment relative to classical econometric baselines. Across models, countries, and retrieval settings, the LLMs produce coherent and country-specific stress narratives, yielding stable tail-risk amplification with limited sensitivity to retrieval choices. Comprehensive plausibility checks, scenario diagnostics, and ANOVA-based variance decomposition show that risk variation is driven primarily by portfolio composition and prompt design rather than by the retrieval mechanism. The pipeline incorporates snapshotting, deterministic modes, and hash-verified artifacts to ensure reproducibility and auditability. Overall, the results demonstrate that LLM-generated macro scenarios, when paired with transparent structure and rigorous validation, can provide a scalable and interpretable complement to traditional stress-testing frameworks.</description>

      <title>A New Application of Hoeffding's Inequality Can Give Traders Early Warning of Financial Regime Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hoeffding's Inequality provides the maximum probability that a series of n draws from a bounded random variable differ from the variable's true expectation u by more than given tolerance t. The random variable is typically the error rate of a classifier in machine learning applications. Here, a trading strategy is premised on the assumption of an underlying distribution of causal factors, in other words, a market regime, and the random variable is the performance of that trading strategy. A larger deviation of observed performance from the trader's expectation u can be characterized as a lower probability that the financial regime supporting that strategy remains in force, and a higher probability of financial regime change. The changing Hoeffding probabilities can be used as an early warning indicator of this change.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Contagion in China's Stock Market: A Hawkes Process Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores contagion in the Chinese stock market using Hawkes processes to analyze autocorrelation and cross-correlation in multivariate time series data. We examine whether market indices exhibit trending behavior and whether sector indices influence one another. By fitting self-exciting and inhibitory Hawkes processes to daily returns of indices like the Shanghai Composite, Shenzhen Component, and ChiNext, as well as sector indices (CSI Consumer, Healthcare, and Financial), we identify long- term dependencies and trending patterns, including upward, downward, and over- sold rebound trends. Results show that during high trading activity, sector indices tend to sustain their trends, while low activity periods exhibit strong sector rotation. This research models stock price movements using spatiotemporal Hawkes processes, leveraging conditional intensity functions to explain sector rotation, advancing the understanding of financial contagion.</description>

      <title>Generative Learning of Heterogeneous Tail Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.13132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a multivariate generative model to capture the complex dependence structure often encountered in business and financial data. Our model features heterogeneous and asymmetric tail dependence between all pairs of individual dimensions while also allowing heterogeneity and asymmetry in the tails of the marginals. A significant merit of our model structure is that it is not prone to error propagation in the parameter estimation process, hence very scalable, as the dimensions of datasets grow large. However, the likelihood methods are infeasible for parameter estimation in our case due to the lack of a closed-form density function. Instead, we devise a novel moment learning algorithm to learn the parameters. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and its estimator, we test them on simulated as well as real-world datasets. Results show that this framework gives better finite-sample performance compared to the copula-based benchmarks as well as recent similar models.</description>
