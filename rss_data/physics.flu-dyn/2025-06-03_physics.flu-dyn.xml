      <title>A thermodynamical suspension model for blood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete thermodynamical analysis for a blood model, based on mixture theory, is performed. The model is developed considering the blood as a suspension of red blood cells (solid component) in the plasma (fluid component), and taking into account the temperature effects. Furthermore, two independent scalar internal variables are introduced accounting for additional dissipative effects. Using Clausius-Duhem inequality, the general thermodynamic restrictions and residual dissipation inequality are derived. The thermodynamic admissibility with the second law of thermodynamics is assessed by means of the extended Coleman-Noll procedure; in one space dimension we exhibit a solution of all the thermodynamical constraints.</description>

      <title>Diff-SPORT: Diffusion-based Sensor Placement Optimization and Reconstruction of Turbulent flows in urban environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid urbanization demands accurate and efficient monitoring of turbulent wind patterns to support air quality, climate resilience and infrastructure design. Traditional sparse reconstruction and sensor placement strategies face major accuracy degradations under practical constraints. Here, we introduce Diff-SPORT, a diffusion-based framework for high-fidelity flow reconstruction and optimal sensor placement in urban environments. Diff-SPORT combines a generative diffusion model with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference scheme and a Shapley-value attribution framework to propose a scalable and interpretable solution. Compared to traditional numerical methods, Diff-SPORT achieves significant speedups while maintaining both statistical and instantaneous flow fidelity. Our approach offers a modular, zero-shot alternative to retraining-intensive strategies, supporting fast and reliable urban flow monitoring under extreme sparsity. Diff-SPORT paves the way for integrating generative modeling and explainability in sustainable urban intelligence.</description>

      <title>Phase-based analysis and control of low Reynolds number aeroelastic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flutter in lightweight airfoils under unsteady flows presents a critical challenge in aeroelastic stability and control. This study uncovers phase-localized mechanisms that drive the onset and suppression of flutter in a freely pitching airfoil at low Reynolds number. By introducing targeted impulsive stiffness perturbations, we identify critical phases that trigger instability. Using phase-sensitivity functions, energy-transfer metrics, and dynamic mode decomposition, we show that flutter arises from phase lock-on between structural and fluid modes. Leveraging this insight, we design an energy-optimal, phase-based control strategy that applies transient heaving motions to disrupt synchronization and arrest unstable growth. This minimal, time-localized control suppresses subharmonic amplification and restores stable periodic motion.</description>

      <title>Evolution of wind-generated shallow water waves in a Benney-Luke equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent papers, denoted by MG24, MG25 in this text, we used the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and its two-dimensional extension, the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation to describe the evolution of wind-driven water wave packets in shallow water. Both equations were modified to include the effect of wind forcing, modelled using the Miles critical level instability theory. In this paper that is extended to a Benney-Luke (BL) equation, similarly modified for wind forcing. The motivation is that the BL equation is isotropic in the horizontal space variables, unlike the KP model, and noting that the KdV model is one-dimensional. The modified BL equation is studied using wave modulation theory as in MG24, MG25, and with comprehensive numerical simulations. Despite the very different spatial structure the results show that under the right initial conditions and parameter settings, solitary wave trains emerge as in MG24, MG25.</description>

      <title>Jet breakup dynamics of viscoelastic carboxymethyl cellulose solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the breakup dynamics of viscoelastic jets composed of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) solutions, focusing on the dripping and Rayleigh regimes at low flow rates. By varying the CMC concentration, needle diameter ($D_n$), and flow rate ($Q$), we analyze the effects of elasticity, viscosity, and flow conditions on jet stability and droplet formation. Our results show that increasing CMC concentration enhances viscoelastic effects, leading to prolonged jet lifetimes, extended liquid threads, and modified pinch-off behavior. At higher concentrations, elasticity suppresses capillary-driven instabilities, slowing thinning and facilitating the formation of beaded structures. We observe that the interplay between inertial, capillary, and elastic forces, influenced by CMC concentration, governs the jet length, droplet volume, and breakup time, with needle diameter and flow rate playing a crucial role in jet breakup phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Modelling laminar flow in V-shaped filters integrated with catalyst technologies for atmospheric pollutant removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric pollution from particulate matter, volatile organic compounds and greenhouse gases is a critical environmental and public health issue, leading to respiratory diseases and climate change. A potential mitigation strategy involves utilising ventilation systems, which process large volumes of indoor and outdoor air and remove particulate pollutants through filtration. However, the integration of catalytic technologies with filters in ventilation systems remains underexplored, despite their potential to simultaneously remove particulate matter and gases, as seen in flue gas treatment and automotive exhaust systems. In this study, we develop a predictive, long-wave model for V-shaped filters, with and without separators. The model, validated against experimental and numerical data, provides a framework for enhancing flow rates by increasing fibre diameter and porosity while reducing aspect ratio and filter thickness. These changes lead to increased permeability, which lowers energy requirements. However, they also reduce the pollutant removal efficiency, highlighting the trade-off between flow, filtration performance and operational costs. Leveraging the long-wave model alongside experimental results, we estimate the maximum potential removal rate ($2\times10^{-4}$ GtPM$_{2.5}$, $2\times10^{-3}$ GtNO$_{\text{x}}$, $9\times10^{-3}$ GtCH$_{4}$ per year) and minimum cost (\$$7\times10^{4}$ per tNO$_{\text{x}}$, \$$2\times10^{4}$ per tCH$_{4}$) if a billion V-shaped filters integrated with catalytic enhancements were deployed in operation. These findings highlight the feasibility of catalytic filters as a scalable, high-efficiency solution for improving air quality and mitigating atmospheric pollution.</description>

Abstract: Turbulent Taylor-Couette flow displays traces of axisymmetric Taylor vortices even at high Reynolds numbers. With this motivation, Feldmann &amp; Avila (2025) carry out long-time numerical simulations of axisymmetric high-Reynolds-number Taylor-Couette flow. They find that the Taylor vortices, using the only degree of freedom that remains available to them, carry out Brownian motion in the axial direction, with a diffusion constant that diverges as the number of rolls is reduced below a critical value.</description>

      <title>On the oscillatory dynamics of a Saffman--Taylor finger with a bubble at its tip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex behaviour of air-liquid interfaces driven into Hele-Shaw channels at high speeds could arise from oscillatory dynamics; yet, both the physical and dynamical mechanisms that lead to interfacial oscillations remain unclear.
  We extend the experiments by Couder \textit{et. al.} (\textit{Phys. Rev. A}, vol. 34, 1986, p. 5175) to present a systematic investigation of the dynamics that result when a small air bubble is placed at the tip of a steadily propagating air finger in a Hele-Shaw channel. The system can exhibit steady and oscillatory behaviour, and we show that these different behaviours each occur in well-defined regions of the phase space defined by flow rate and bubble size. For sufficiently large flow rates, periodic finger oscillations give way to disordered dynamics characterised by an irregular meandering of the finger's tip.
  We demonstrate that at a fixed flow rate, the oscillations commence when the bubble size is increased sufficiently so that the decreased in-plane curvature of the bubble tip matches the in-plane curvature of the finger tip. The equality between the two in-plane curvatures causes the axial pressure gradient across the bubble, which drives the finger, to vanish, thus rendering the finger susceptible to lateral perturbations. Differing timescales for finger and bubble restoral under perturbation allow sustained oscillations to develop in the finger-bubble system. The oscillations cease when the bubble is sufficiently large that it can act as the tip of a compound finger. The disordered dynamics at high flow rates are consistent with the transient exploration of unstable periodic states, which suggests that similar dynamics may underlie the observed disordered dynamics in viscous fingering.</description>

      <title>Effects of high-frequency and balanced motions on Lagrangian pair dispersion at the ocean surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of relative dispersion of Lagrangian particles in a global-ocean simulation resolving both inertia-gravity waves (IGW) and meso and submesoscale (M/SM) turbulence. More specifically, we test if the dispersion laws depend on the shape of the Eulerian kinetic energy spectrum, as predicted from quasi-geostrophic turbulence theory. To this end, we focus on two areas, in the Kuroshio Extension and in the Gulf Stream, for which the relative importance of IGW compared to M/SM vary in summer and winter. In winter, Lagrangian statistical indicators return a picture in overall agreement with the shape of the kinetic energy spectrum. Conversely, in summer, when submesoscales are less energetic and higher-frequency internal waves gain importance, the expected relations between dispersion properties and spectra do not seem to hold. This apparent discrepancy is explained by decomposing the flow into nearly-balanced motions and internal gravity waves, and showing that the latter dominate the kinetic energy spectrum at small scales. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that high-frequency IGWs do not impact relative dispersion, which is then controlled by the nearly-balanced, mainly rotational, flow component at larger scales. These results highlight that geostrophic velocities derived from wide-swath altimeters, such as SWOT, may present limits when estimating surface dispersion, and that current measuring satellite missions may provide the complementary information to do so.</description>

      <title>Fast synthesis of turbulence with multi-scale coherent vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence synthesis methods often struggle to reproduce coherent vortices while capturing key statistical features. We introduce a fast synthetic turbulence method to generate instantaneous turbulent fields (termed `woven turbulence') with multi-scale vortices, combining the advantages of fractal models and coherent structures. The method generates multi-scale Burgers vortex tubes based on stochastic centerlines constructed by the fractional Brownian bridge. The largest and smallest vortices govern the integral and dissipation scales, respectively, enabling precise control over the energy spectrum across the energy-containing, inertial, and dissipation ranges. The adjustable vortex density allows tailored intermittency in velocity statistics. Remarkably, the woven turbulence achieves an extremely low computational cost, proportional to the total number of grid points. For the Taylor-Reynolds number larger than 200, its computational cost is over five orders of magnitude lower than that of direct numerical simulation (DNS). Validation against DNS data demonstrates excellent agreement in energy spectra, velocity probability distributions, and intermittency scaling. Unlike prior methods, woven turbulence simultaneously reproduces Gaussian velocity fields, Kolmogorov's five-thirds scaling for the energy spectrum, and intertwined coherent vortices akin to real turbulence. This approach not only bridges the gap between structural and statistical turbulence modelling, but also offers an efficient tool for applications requiring realistic turbulent fields.</description>

      <title>New insights into the cavitation erosion by bubble collapse at moderate stand-off distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-spherical bubble collapses near solid boundaries, generating water hammer pressures and shock waves, were recognized as key mechanisms for cavitation erosion. However, there is no agreement on local erosion patterns, and cavitation erosion damage lacks quantitative analysis. In our experiments, five distinct local erosion patterns were identified on aluminum sample surfaces, resulting from the collapse of laser-induced cavitation bubbles at moderate stand-off distances of $0.4\le\gamma\le2.2$, namely Bipolar, Monopolar, Annular, Solar-Halo, and Central. Among them, the Bipolar and Monopolar patterns exhibit the most severe cavitation erosion when the toroidal bubbles undergo asymmetrical collapse along the circumferential direction during the second cycle. Shadowgraphy visualization revealed that asymmetrical collapse caused shockwave focusing through head-on collision and oblique superposition of wavefronts. This led to the variations in toroidal bubble radii and the positions of maximum erosion depth not matching at certain stand-off distances. Both initial plasma asymmetry and bubble-wall stand-off distance were critical in determining circumferential asymmetrical collapse behaviors. At large initial aspect ratios, the elliptical jet tips form during the contraction process, resulting in the toroidal bubble collapsing from regions with smaller curvature radii, ultimately converging to the colliding point along the circumferential direction. Our three-dimensional simulations using OpenFOAM successfully reproduce the key features of circumferentially asymmetrical bubble collapse. This study provides new insights into the non-spherical near-wall bubble collapse dynamics and provides a foundation for developing predictive models for cavitation erosion.</description>

      <title>Turbulent puffs in transitional pulsatile pipe flow at moderate pulsation amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, in the transitional regime of pulsatile pipe flow, at moderate-to-high amplitudes 0.5 &lt; A &lt; 1, the first long-lived turbulent structures are localized and take the form of the puffs and slugs observed in statistically steady pipe flow. We perform direct numerical simulations at many pulsation frequencies, amplitudes and Re, and observe different dynamics of puffs and slugs. At certain flow parameters we find, using a causal analysis, that puffs actively make use of linear instabilities in the laminar Sexl-Womersley profile to survive the pulsation. Using all these lessons learned, we extend a low order model by Barkley et al., Nature (2015), to reproduce these dynamics. We find a good agreement between the extended model and our numerical results in a broad parametric space of pulsation amplitudes 0.5 &lt; A &lt; 1, frequencies Wo &gt; 5 and 2100 &lt; Re &lt; 3000. With the help of our numerical results, causal analysis and model, we determine that turbulence production has two sources at these flow parameters: the mean shear as in statistically steady pipe flow, and the instabilities of the instantaneous pulsatile mean profile.</description>

      <title>Discrete vortex-based broadcast mode analysis for modification of dynamic stall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We integrate a discrete vortex method with complex network analysis to strategize dynamic stall mitigation over a pitching airfoil with active flow control. The objective is to inform actuator placement and timing to introduce control inputs during the transient evolution of dynamic stall. To this end, we represent the massively separated flow as a network of discrete vortical elements and quantify the interactions among these vortical nodes by tracking the spread of displacement perturbations between each pair of elements using the discrete vortex method. This enables a network broadcast mode analysis to identify an optimal set of vortices, critical timing, and direction to seed perturbations as control inputs. Motivated by the goal of mitigating dynamic stall, the optimality is defined as minimizing the total circulation of free vortices generated from the leading edge over a prescribed time horizon. We demonstrate the framework on two cases: two-dimensional flow over a flat plate airfoil and three-dimensional turbulent flow over a SD7003 airfoil. The analysis reveals that optimal timing for introducing disturbances occurs just after separation onset, when the shear layer pinches up to form the core of the dynamic stall vortex. Broadcast modes indicate that vortical nodes along the shear layer are optimal for control, guiding actuator placement. Flow simulations validate these insights: placing actuators near the leading edge and triggering them shortly after separation yields a 12% and 30% reduction in peak lift for the flat plate and SD7003 cases, respectively. A corresponding decrease in vorticity injection under control confirms the analysis objective. This study highlights the potential of combining discrete vortex methods with network analysis to guide active flow control in unsteady aerodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motile microorganisms develop effective swimming gaits to adapt to complex biological environments. Translating this adaptability to smart microrobots presents significant challenges in motion planning and stroke design. In this work, we explore the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to develop stroke patterns for targeted navigation in a three-link swimmer model at low Reynolds numbers. Specifically, we design two RL-based strategies: one focusing on maximizing velocity (Velocity-Focused Strategy) and another balancing velocity with energy consumption (Energy-Aware Strategy). Our results demonstrate how the use of different reward functions influences the resulting stroke patterns developed via RL, which are compared with those obtained from traditional optimization methods. Furthermore, we showcase the capability of the RL-powered swimmer in adapting its stroke patterns in performing different navigation tasks, including tracing complex trajectories and pursuing moving targets.

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann Boundary Conditions for Flow, Convection-Diffusion and MHD Simulations</title>

Abstract: A general derivation is proposed for several boundary conditions arisen in the lattice Boltzmann simulations of various physical problems. Pair-wise moment-conservations are proposed to enforce the boundary conditions with given macroscopic quantities, including the velocity and pressure boundary conditions in flow simulations, a given concentration in convection-diffusion (CD) simulations, as well as specified magnetic field components in magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations. Additionally, the CD and MHD simulations might involve the Robin boundary condition for surface reactions and a Robin-like boundary condition for thin walls with finite electrical conductivities, respectively, both of which can be written in a form with a variable flux term. In this case, the proposed boundary scheme takes the flux term as an increment to the bounced distribution function and a reference frame transformation is used to obtain a correction term for moving boundaries. Spatial interpolation and extrapolation are used for arbitrary boundary locations between computational grid points. Due to using the same approach in derivations, the derived boundary conditions for different physical processes in a coupled simulation are compatible for arbitrary boundary-to-grid distances (not limited to the popular half-grid boundary layout) and arbitrary moving speeds (not limited to the tangential or normal speed). Simulations using half-grid and full-grid boundary layouts are conducted for demonstrations and validations. Moving boundaries are simulated in hydrodynamic and MHD flows, while static boundaries are used in the CD simulations with surface reactions. The numerical and analytical solutions are in excellent agreement in the studied cases.</description>

      <title>Near-inertial echoes of ageostrophic instability in submesoscale filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16059v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ocean submesoscales, flows with characteristic size around 10 m - 10 km, are transitional between the larger, rotationally-constrained mesoscale and three-dimensional turbulence. In this paper we present simulations of a submesoscale ocean filament. In our case, the filament is strongly sheared in both vertical and cross-filament directions and is unstable. Instability indeed dominates the early behaviour with a fast extraction of kinetic energy from the vertically sheared thermal wind. However, the instability that emerges does not exhibit characteristics that match the perhaps expected symmetric or Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, and appears to be non-normal in nature. The prominence of the transient response depends on the initial noise and, for large initial noise amplitudes, saturates before SI normal modes are able to develop. The action of the instability is sufficiently rapid - with energy extraction from the mean flow emerging and peaking within the first inertial period (~ 18 hr) - that the filament does not respond in a geostrophically balanced sense. Instead, at all initial noise levels, it later exhibits vertically sheared near-inertial oscillations with higher amplitude as the initial minimum Richardson number decreases. Horizontal gradients strengthen only briefly as the fronts restratify. These unstable filaments can be generated by strong mixing events at pre-existing stable structures; we also caution against inadvertently triggering this response in idealised studies that start in a very unstable state.</description>

      <title>Attenuation mechanism of wall-bounded turbulence by heavy finite-size particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To elucidate the attenuation mechanism of wall-bounded turbulence due to heavy small particles, we conduct direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulent channel flow laden with finite-size solid particles. When particles cannot follow the swirling motions of wall-attached vortices, vortex rings are created around the particles. These particle-induced vortices lead to additional energy dissipation, reducing the turbulent energy production from the mean flow. This mechanism results in the attenuation of turbulent kinetic energy, which is more significant when the Stokes number of particles is larger or particle size is smaller under the condition that the volume fraction of particles is fixed. Moreover, we propose the method to quantitatively predict the degree of turbulence attenuation without using DNS data by estimating the additional energy dissipation rate in terms of particle properties.</description>

      <title>Shear-induced force and dispersion due to buoyancy in a horizontal Hele-Shaw cell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates shear flow in a Hele-Shaw cell, driven by varying horizontal buoyancy forces resulting from a horizontal density gradient induced by a scalar field. By employing asymptotic methods and taking the dependence of density and transport coefficients on the scalar field into account, effective two-dimensional hydrodynamic equations coupled with the scalar conservation equation are derived. These equations determine an effective diffusion coefficient for the scalar field accounting for shear-induced diffusion, and an effective shear-induced buoyancy force that modifies the classical Darcy's law. The derived equations provide a foundation for future research into various problems involving scalar transport in horizontal Hele-Shaw cells.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced proliferation of vortices around marine invertebrate larvae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ocean is teeming with a myriad of mm-sized invertebrate planktonic larvae, which thrive in a viscous fluid environment. Many of them rely on ciliary beating to generate fluid flows for locomotion and feeding. Their larval forms, local morphologies, and ciliation patterns exhibit remarkable diversity, producing intricate and dynamic 3D flows that are notoriously difficult to characterize in laboratory settings. Traditional microscopic imaging techniques typically involve gently squeeze-confining the soft larvae between a glass slide and cover slip to study their flows in quasi-2D. However, a comprehensive hydrodynamic framework for the low-to-intermediate Reynolds number (&lt;1) flows in quasi-2D confinement, particularly in light of their complex forms, has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that vortices around larvae proliferate with increasing confinement and illuminate the underlying physical mechanism. We experimentally quantify confinement-induced flows in larvae of sea stars and sea urchins. The flows exhibited strikingly universal patterns: under weak confinement, all larvae generated two vortices, whereas under strong confinement, the number of generated vortices significantly increased. The experimental observations were well captured by a low Reynolds number theoretical model based on the superposition of confined Stokeslets. Building on experiments and theory, we developed a comprehensive framework for confinement-induced flows, which suggests that vorticity dynamics are primarily determined by local morphological features, rather than solely the body plan. Our work provides fundamental insights into form-functional relationships between larval morphology and flow generation. Our findings are broadly applicable to understanding flows generated by a wide range of ciliated organisms with complex forms and morphologies, from micro- to milli-length-scales.</description>

      <title>On the characteristic structure of the adjoint Euler equations and the analytic adjoint solution of supersonic inviscid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The characteristic structure of the two-dimensional adjoint Euler equations is examined. The behavior is similar to that of the original Euler equations, but with the information travelling in the opposite direction. The compatibility conditions obeyed by the adjoint variables along characteristic lines are derived. It is also shown that adjoint variables can have discontinuities across characteristics and the corresponding jump conditions are obtained. It is shown how this information can be used to obtain exact predictions for the adjoint variables, particularly for supersonic flows. The approach is illustrated by the analysis of supersonic flow past a double wedge airfoil, for which an analytic adjoint solution is obtained in the near-wall region. The solution is zero downstream of the airfoil and piecewise constant around it except across the expansion fan, where the adjoint variables change smoothly while remaining constant along each Mach wave within the fan.</description>

      <title>A unified quaternion-complex framework for Navier-Stokes equations: new insights and implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel, unified quaternion-complex framework for formulating the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations that reveals the geometric structure underlying viscous fluid motion and resolves the Clay Institute's Millennium Prize problem. By introducing complex coordinates $z = x + iy$ and expressing the velocity field as $F = u + iv$, we demonstrate that the nonlinear convection terms decompose as $(u \cdot \nabla)F = F \cdot \frac{\partial F}{\partial z} + F^* \cdot \frac{\partial F}{\partial \bar{z}}$, separating inviscid convection from viscous coupling effects. We extend this framework to three dimensions using quaternions and prove global regularity through geometric constraints inherent in quaternion algebra. The incompressibility constraint naturally emerges as a requirement that $\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}$ be purely imaginary, linking fluid mechanics to complex analysis fundamentally. Our main result establishes that quaternion orthogonality relations prevent finite-time singularities by ensuring turbulent energy cascade remains naturally bounded. The quaternion-complex formulation demonstrates that turbulence represents breakdown of quaternion-analyticity while maintaining geometric stability, providing rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding why real fluids exhibit finite turbulent behavior rather than mathematical singularities. We prove that for any smooth initial data, there exists a unique global smooth solution to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, directly resolving the Clay Institute challenge. Applications to atmospheric boundary layer physics demonstrate immediate practical relevance for environmental modeling, weather prediction, and climate modeling.</description>

      <title>Addressing the checkerboard problem in an Eulerian meshless method for incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we look at the pressure checkerboard problem that arises in an Eulerian meshless method that solves the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations using the generalized finite difference method (GFDM). Although, the checkerboard problem has been dealt with extensively in mesh-based methods, the literature in connection with meshless methods is comparatively scarce. In this paper, we explore the occurrence of the checkerboard problem in a meshless method. A few unsuccessful attempts to resolve the checkerboard problem are reported. The successful fix for the problem entails an algorithm that adapts the point cloud by adding points in the regions of pressure oscillations. The algorithm uses an error indicator that detects the presence of the checkerboard oscillations in the solution. The algorithm minimizes the computational effort since it ensures the use of additional points only in regions of concern, as directed by the error indicator, in contrast to an approach of using a highly refined set of points throughout the domain. It also requires no a priori estimates of the regions where the oscillations occur and integrates conveniently in the framework of the meshless method since no re-meshing strategies are involved. The results are compared with literature and a good match is observed.</description>

Abstract: We review applications of factorization methods to the problem of finding stationary point vortex patterns in two-dimensional fluid mechanics. Then we present a new class of patterns related to periodic analogs of Schrodinger operators from the ``even" bi-spectral family. We also show that patterns related to soliton solutions of the KdV hierarchy constitute complete solution of the problem for certain classes of vortex systems.
