      <title>Morphology-Preserving Holotomography: Quantitative Analysis of 3D Organoid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organoids are three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models for studying tissue development, disease progression, and physiological responses. Holotomography (HT) enables long-term, label-free imaging of live organoids by reconstructing volumetric refractive-index (RI) maps, but quantitative analysis is limited by the missing-cone artifact, which introduces anisotropic resolution and axial distortion. Here, we present a quantitative analysis framework that addresses the missing-cone problem at the level of image representation rather than reconstruction. We introduce morphology-preserving holotomography (MP-HT), a torus-shaped spatial filtering strategy that emphasizes high-spatial-frequency RI texture while suppressing low-frequency components most susceptible to missing-cone-induced distortion. Based on MP-HT, we develop a 3D segmentation pipeline for robust separation of epithelial and luminal structures, together with a model-based RI quantification approach that incorporates the system point spread function to enable morphology-independent estimation of dry-mass density and total dry mass. We apply the framework to long-term imaging of live hepatic organoids undergoing expansion, collapse, and fusion. The results demonstrate consistent segmentation across diverse geometries and reveal coordinated epithelial-lumen remodeling, breakdown of morphometric homeostasis during collapse, and transient biophysical fluctuations during fusion. Overall, this work establishes a physically transparent and reproducible approach for quantitative, label-free analysis of organoid dynamics in three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Modular Metamaterials for Adaptable MRI Signal Control: Combining Dipole Arrays with Hexagon-based Artificial Dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging concepts of metamaterials for MRI offer improved image quality through enhanced RF field control. However, current designs are often limited by bulky configurations, dielectric losses, and limited adaptability. Patient-specific optimization - essential for improving field homogeneity, boosting local SNR, and addressing anatomical variability - requires redesigning each setup. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hexagonally-packed artificial dielectric, free of any lumped-elements, capable of achieving a wide range of high relative permittivities (30-1400) suitable for clinical and ultra-high-field MRI. We identify multilayered and in-plane-shifted hexagonal configurations that support compact, modular layouts. Furthermore, we combine these artificial dielectrics with dipole arrays to create a modular system for adaptable signal enhancement, tuned via electric and magnetic dipole modes by adjusting the length of conductive strips. In-vivo 7T MRI results demonstrate enhanced field control and high-resolution imaging. This lightweight, flexible, and modular platform enables patient-specific RF field shaping, thus opening up new avenues for personalized and adaptable MRI technology.</description>

      <title>Two-stage Respiratory Motion-resolved Radial MR Image Reconstruction Using an Interpretable Deep Unrolled Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the prolonged MRI encoding process, respiratory motion can cause undesired artifacts and image blurring, degrading image quality and limiting clinical applications in abdominal and pulmonary imaging. In this work, we develop a two-stage respiratory motion-resolved radial MR image reconstruction pipeline using an interpretable deep unrolled network (MoraNet), enabling high-quality imaging under free-breathing conditions. Firstly, low-resolution images are reconstructed from the central region of successive golden-angle radial k-space to extract respiratory motion signals. The binned k-space data based on the respiratory signal are then used to reconstruct the motion-resolved high-resolution image for each motion state. The MoraNet applies nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) to operate radial encoding and convolutional neural network (CNN) modules to conduct image regularizations. The MoraNet was trained on retrospectively acquired lung MRI images for both fully sampled and undersampled acquisitions. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated on digital CT/MRI breathing XCAT (CoMBAT) phantom data, QUASAR motion phantom data acquired from a 1.0T MRI scanner and volunteer chest data acquired from a 1.5T MRI scanner. The MoraNet pipeline was compared with motion-averaged reconstruction and a conventional compressed sensing (CS)-based method in terms of SSIM, RMSE and computation time. Simulation and experimental results demonstrated that the proposed network could provide accurate respiratory signal estimation and enable effective motion correction. Compared with the CS method, the MoraNet preserved better structural details with lower RMSE and higher SSIM values at acceleration factor of 4, and meanwhile took ten-fold faster inference time.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Tissue Composition Information in Total-Body PET Metabolic Quantification of Bone Marrow through Dual-Energy CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bone marrow (BM) metabolic quantification with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is of broad clinical significance for accurate assessment of BM at staging and follow-up, especially when immunotherapy is involved. However, current methods of quantifying BM may be inaccurate because the volume defined to measure bone marrow may also consist of a fraction of trabecular bone in which 18F-FDG activity is negligible, resulting in a potential underestimation of true BM uptake. In this study, we demonstrate this bone-led tissue composition effect and propose a bone fraction correction (BFC) method using X-ray dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) material decomposition. This study included ten scans from five cancer patients who underwent baseline and follow-up dynamic 18F-FDG PET and DECT scans using the uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT system. The voxel-wise bone volume fraction was estimated from DECT and then incorporated into the PET measurement formulas for BFC. The standardized uptake value (SUV), 18F-FDG delivery rate K1, and net influx rate Ki values in BM regions were estimated with and without BFC and compared using the statistical analysis. The results first demonstrated the feasibility of performing voxel-wise material decomposition using DECT for metabolic BM imaging. With BFC, the SUV, K1, and Ki values significantly increased by an average of 13.28% in BM regions compared to those without BFC (all P&lt;0.0001), indicating the impact of BFC for BM quantification. Parametric imaging with BFC further confirmed regional analysis. Our study using DECT suggests current SUV and kinetic quantification of BM are likely underestimated in PET due to the presence of a significant bone volume fraction. Incorporating tissue composition information through BFC may improve BM metabolic quantification.</description>

      <title>Physical Limits of Proximal Tumor Detection via MAGE-A Extracellular Vesicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early cancer detection relies on invasive tissue biopsies or liquid biopsies limited by biomarker dilution. In contrast, tumour-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) carrying biomarkers like melanoma-associated antigen-A (MAGE-A) are highly concentrated in the peri-tumoral interstitial space, offering a promising near-field target. However, at micrometre scales, EV transport is governed by stochastic diffusion in a low copy number regime, increasing the risk of false negatives. We theoretically assess the feasibility of a smart-needle sensor detecting MAGE-A-positive microvesicles near a tumour. We use a hybrid framework combining particle-based Brownian dynamics (Smoldyn) to quantify stochastic arrival and false negative probabilities, and a reaction-diffusion PDE for mean concentration profiles. Formulating detection as a threshold-based binary hypothesis test, we find a maximum feasible detection radius of approximately 275 micrometers for a 6000 s sensing window. These results outline the physical limits of proximal EV-based detection and inform the design of minimally invasive peri-tumoral sensors.</description>

      <title>Field strength-dependent performance variability in deep learning-based analysis of magnetic resonance imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study quantitatively evaluates the impact of MRI scanner magnetic field strength on the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation algorithms. Three publicly available MRI datasets (breast tumor, pancreas, and cervical spine) were stratified by scanner field strength (1.5T vs. 3.0T). For each segmentation task, three nnU-Net-based models were developed: A model trained on 1.5T data only (m-1.5T), a model trained on 3.0T data only (m-3.0T), and a model trained on pooled 1.5T and 3.0T data (m-combined). Each model was evaluated on both 1.5T and 3.0T validation sets. Field-strength-dependent performance differences were investigated via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)-based clustering and radiomic analysis, including 23 first-order and texture features. For breast tumor segmentation, m-3.0T (DSC: 0.494 [1.5T] and 0.433 [3.0T]) significantly outperformed m-1.5T (DSC: 0.411 [1.5T] and 0.289 [3.0T]) and m-combined (DSC: 0.373 [1.5T] and 0.268[3.0T]) on both validation sets (p&lt;0.0001). Pancreas segmentation showed similar trends: m-3.0T achieved the highest DSC (0.774 [1.5T], 0.840 [3.0T]), while m-1.5T underperformed significantly (p&lt;0.0001). For cervical spine, models performed optimally on same-field validation sets with minimal cross-field performance degradation (DSC&gt;0.92 for all comparisons). Radiomic analysis revealed moderate field-strength-dependent clustering in soft tissues (silhouette scores 0.23-0.29) but minimal separation in osseous structures (0.12). These results indicate that magnetic field strength in the training data substantially influences the performance of deep learning-based segmentation models, particularly for soft-tissue structures (e.g., small lesions). This warrants consideration of magnetic field strength as a confounding factor in studies evaluating AI performance on MRI.</description>

      <title>Measuring the time-scale-dependent information flow between maternal and fetal heartbeats during the third trimester</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prenatal maternal stress alters maternal-fetal heart rate coupling, as demonstrated by the Fetal Stress Index derived from bivariate phase-rectified signal averaging. Here, we extend this framework using information-theoretical measures to elucidate underlying mechanisms. In 120 third-trimester pregnancies (58 stressed, 62 control), we computed transfer entropy (TE), entropy rate (ER), and sample entropy (SE) under multiple conditioning paradigms, employing mixed linear models for repeated measures. We identify dual coupling mechanisms at the short-term (0.5 - 2.5 s), but not long-term (2.5 - 5 s) time scales: (1) stress-invariant state-dependent synchronization, with maternal decelerations exerting approximately 60% coupling strength on fetal heart rate complexity - a fundamental coordination conserved across demographics; and (2) stress-sensitive temporal information transfer (TE), showing exploratory associations with maternal cortisol that require replication. A robust sex-by-stress interaction emerged in TE from mixed models, with exploratory female-specific coupling patterns absent in males. Universal acceleration predominance was observed in both maternal and fetal heart rates, stronger in fetuses and independent of sex or stress. We provide insight into the dependence of these findings on the sampling rate of the underlying data, identifying 4 Hz, commonly used for ultrasound-derived fetal heart rate recordings, as the necessary and sufficient sampling rate regime to capture the information flow. Information-theoretical analysis reveals that maternal-fetal coupling operates through complementary pathways with differential stress sensitivity, extending the Fetal Stress Index by elucidating causal foundations. Future studies should explore additional information-theoretical conditional approaches to resolve stress-specific and time-scale-specific differences in information flow.</description>

      <title>Quantitative acoustic monitoring of ensembles of weakly nonlinear microbubble oscillations in optically inaccessible environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A growing class of ultrasound-mediated diagnostic and therapeutic technologies, including sonoporation and blood-brain barrier modulation, relies on microbubble contrast agents, where precise control of microbubble dynamics governs biological responses, efficiency, and safety. However, quantitative monitoring of microbubble oscillations in the stable, weakly nonlinear regime remains challenging, particularly in optically opaque and deep-tissue environments. Here, we introduce a linear acoustic wave propagation and superposition (LAWPS) framework that reconstructs microbubble radius-time dynamics directly from passively recorded acoustic emissions. By coupling Fourier-series representations of weakly nonlinear oscillations with linear monopole radiation theory, LAWPS extends classical monopole models to establish a reversible relationship between multi-frequency acoustic emissions and underlying radial bubble dynamics. Extending this framework to monodisperse microbubble ensembles, we derive optimal excitation and receive configurations and population-level correction factors that enable quantitative reconstruction of the ensemble-averaged microbubble dynamics. Using simultaneous optical and acoustic measurements, we demonstrate recovery of microbubble oscillations with ~5% relative error for oscillation amplitudes up to ~15% of equilibrium radius. Finally, we show that oscillations within the framework's operating regime (20% oscillation) generate sonoporation-relevant mechanical stress in vesicles as small as 10 micrometers (capillary number &gt; 0.01), under physiologically relevant conditions. Together, this work establishes a quantitative framework for acoustic emission-based monitoring of weakly nonlinear microbubble oscillations in clinically relevant, optically inaccessible environments to enable improved control of emerging ultrasound diagnostic and therapeutic technologies.</description>

      <title>Semantic contrastive learning for orthogonal X-ray computed tomography reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is widely used in medical imaging, with sparse-view reconstruction offering an effective way to reduce radiation dose. However, ill-posed conditions often result in severe streak artifacts. Recent advances in deep learning-based methods have improved reconstruction quality, but challenges still remain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel semantic feature contrastive learning loss function that evaluates semantic similarity in high-level latent spaces and anatomical similarity in shallow latent spaces. Our approach utilizes a three-stage U-Net-based architecture: one for coarse reconstruction, one for detail refinement, and one for semantic similarity measurement. Tests on a chest dataset with orthogonal projections demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality and faster processing compared to other algorithms. The results show significant improvements in image quality while maintaining low computational complexity, making it a practical solution for orthogonal CT reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Dual-Input Dynamic Convolution for Positron Range Correction in PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00587v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positron range (PR) blurring degrades positron emission tomography (PET) image resolution, particularly for high-energy emitters like gallium-68 (68 Ga). We introduce Dual-Input Dynamic Convolution (DDConv), a novel computationally efficient approach trained with voxel-specific PR point spread functions (PSFs) from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and designed to be utilized within an iterative reconstruction algorithm to perform PR correction (PRC). By dynamically inferring local blurring kernels through a trained convolutional neural network (CNN), DDConv captures complex tissue interfaces more accurately than prior methods. Additionally, it also computes the transpose operator, ensuring consistency within iterative PET reconstruction. Comparisons with a state-of-the-art, tissue-dependent correction confirm the advantages of DDConv in recovering higher-resolution details in heterogeneous regions, including bone-soft tissue and lung-soft tissue boundaries. Experiments across digital phantoms and MC-simulated data show that DDConv offers near-MC accuracy and outperforms the state-of-the-art technique, namely spatially-variant and tissue-dependent (SVTD), especially in areas with complex material interfaces. Results from real phantom experiments further confirm DD-Conv's robustness and practical applicability: while both DD-Conv and SVTD performed similarly in homogeneous soft-tissue regions, DDConv provided more accurate activity recovery and sharper delineation at heterogeneous lung-soft tissue interfaces.

      <title>The role of friction forces in arterial mechanical thrombectomy: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03632v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple clinical trials have demonstrated the superiority of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in treating acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Stent retriever (SR) and aspiration techniques are the standard methods for removing occluded emboli, with evolving technologies improving MT efficiency. However, procedural success remains uncertain. Frictional forces, specifically clot-vessel, clot-SR, and SR-vessel interactions, play a critical role in MT outcomes. This review examines frictional forces during MT and their impact on success, analyzing publications from 2015 to 2025. We focus on studies that calculated friction or retrieval forces using in vitro models. We have also included current trends, limitations, and future perspectives on studying and understanding frictional forces and their implementation into in silico models. Findings indicate that fibrin-rich clots are more difficult to retrieve than red blood cell (RBC)-rich clots due to their higher friction coefficient, three to four times greater, an observation supported by multiple studies. SR-vessel and SR-clot friction also influence MT effectiveness. SR-vessel interaction plays a crucial role in acutely curved vessels, as SR compression reduces its efficiency. In SR-clot interaction, RBC-rich clot fragmentation is linked to relative interaction forces. In summary, obtaining in vivo frictional values remains challenging, and inconsistencies persist in past in vitro studies. Further, a deeper understanding of frictional forces is essential for optimizing MT, improving current SRs, and developing next-generation thrombectomy technologies.</description>
