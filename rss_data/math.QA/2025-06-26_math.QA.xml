      <title>The homological spectrum for monoidal triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The authors develop a notion of homological prime spectrum for an arbitrary monoidal triangulated category, ${\mathbf C}$. Unlike the symmetric case due to Balmer, the homological primes of ${\mathbf C}$ are not defined as the maximal Serre ideals of the small module category ${\sf mod}\text{-}{{\mathbf C}}$, or via a noncommutative ring theory inspired version of this construction. Instead, the authors work with an extended comparison map from the Serre prime spectrum $\operatorname{Spc} ({\sf mod}\text{-}{{\mathbf C}})$ to the Balmer spectrum $\operatorname{Spc}{\mathbf C}$, and select the maximal elements of each fiber to define the homological spectrum $\operatorname{Spc}^{\text{h}}{\mathbf C}$.
  A surjective continuous homological comparison map $\operatorname{Spc}^{\text{h}}{\mathbf C} \to \operatorname{Spc}{\mathbf C}$ is constructed and used to formulate an extended Nerves of Steel Conjecture stating that this map is a homeomorphism. The conjecture is proved to hold under stratification and uniformity conditions on ${\mathbf C}$. The proof is based on a general theorem giving an explicit description of the Balmer--Favi support of the pure-injectives associated to all Serre primes of ${\sf mod}\text{-}{{\mathbf C}}$. It is shown that the validity of the conjecture carries over from ${\mathbf C}$ to a semidirect product ${\mathbf C} \rtimes G$ with an arbitrary group $G$, and when $G$ is infinite, this provides examples of monoidal triangulated categories satisfying the conjecture and whose thick ideals are not centrally generated. Important cases in which the conjecture is verified include the stable module categories of the coordinate rings of all finite group schemes and the Benson--Witherspoon Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>Holography for bulk-boundary local topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous article [arXiv:2307.12552], we introduced local topological order (LTO) axioms for quantum spin systems which allowed us to define a physical boundary manifested by a net of boundary algebras in one dimension lower. This gives a formal setting for topological holography, where the braided tensor category of DHR bimodules of the physical boundary algebra captures the bulk topological order.
  In this article, we extend the LTO axioms to quantum spin systems equipped with a topological boundary, again producing a physical boundary algebra for the bulk-boundary system, whose category of (topological) boundary DHR bimodules recovers the topological boundary order. We perform this analysis in explicit detail for Levin-Wen and Walker-Wang bulk-boundary systems.
  Along the way, we introduce a 2D braided categorical net of algebras built from a unitary braided fusion category (UBFC). Such nets arise as boundary algebras of Walker-Wang models. We consider the canonical state on this braided categorical net corresponding to the standard topological boundary for the Walker-Wang model. Interestingly, in this state, the cone von Neumann algebras are type I with finite dimensional centers, in contrast with the type II and III cone von Neumann algebras from the Levin-Wen models studied in [arXiv:2307.12552]. Their superselection sectors recover the underlying unitary category of our UBFC, and we conjecture the superselection category also captures the fusion and braiding.</description>

      <title>Endocabling of involutive solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation, with an application to solutions whose diagonal is a cyclic permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce endocabling as a technique to deform involutive, non-degenerate set-theoretic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation (``solutions'', for short) by means of $\lambda$-endomorphisms of their associated permutation brace, thus generalizing the cabling method by Lebed, Vendramin and Ram\'{i}rez. In the first part of the article, we define endocabling and investigate the behaviour of solutions and their invariants under endocabling. In the second part, we apply our findings to solutions of size $n$ whose diagonal map is an $n$-cycle: we will prove that solutions with this property whose size is an odd prime power, are of finite multipermutation level. Furthermore, solutions with this property whose size is a power of $2$, will be proven either to be of finite multipermutation level or to admit an iterated retraction onto a unique solution of size $4$.
  We formulate our results in the language of cycle sets.</description>

      <title>Analysis for idempotent states on quantum permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Woronowicz proved the existence of the Haar state for compact quantum groups under a separability assumption later removed by Van Daele in a new existence proof. A minor adaptation of Van Daele's proof yields an idempotent state in any non-empty weak*-compact convolution-closed convex subset of the state space. Such subsets, and their associated idempotent states, are studied in the case of quantum permutation groups.</description>
