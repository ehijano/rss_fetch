      <title>Non-Ioffe-Larkin composition rule and spinon-dictated electric transport in doped Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric resistivity is examined in the constrained Hilbert space of a doped Mott insulator, which is dictated by a non-Ioffe-Larkin composition rule due to the underlying mutual Chern-Simons topological gauge structure. In the low-temperature pseudogap phase, where holons remain condensed while spinons proliferate, the charge transport is governed by a chiral spinon excitation, comprising a bosonic spin-$1/2$ at the core of a supercurrent vortex. It leads to a vanishing resistivity with the "confinement" of the spinons in the superconducting phase but a low-$T$ divergence of the resistivity once the spinon confinement is disrupted by external magnetic fields. In the latter, the chiral spinons will generate a Hall number $n_H =$ doping concentration $\delta$ and a Nernst effect to signal an underlying long-range entanglement between the charge and spin degrees of freedom. Their presence is further reflected in thermodynamic quantities such as specific heat and spin susceptibility. Finally, in the high-temperature spin-disordered phase, it is shown that the holons exhibit a linear-$T$ resistivity by scattering with the spinons acting as free local moments, which generate randomized gauge fluxes as perceived by the charge degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Computational Demonstrations of Density Wave of Cooper Pairs and Paired-Electron Liquid in the Quarter-Filled Band -- a Brief Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been strong interest recently in the so-called Cooper pair density wave, subsequent to the proposition that such a state occurs in the hole-doped cuprate superconductors. As of now there is no convincing demonstration of such a state in the cuprate theoretical literature. We present here a brief but complete review of our theoretical and computational work on the paired-electron crystal (PEC), which has been also experimentally seen in the insulating phase proximate to superconductivity (SC) in organic charge-transfer solid (CTS) superconductors. Within our theory, SC in the CTS does indeed evolve from the PEC. A crucial requirement for the finding of the PEC is that the proper carrier density of one charge carrier per two sites is taken into consideration at the outset. Following the discussion of CTS superconductors, we briefly discuss how the theory can be extended to understand the phase diagram of the cuprate superconductors that has remained mysterious after nearly four decades of the discovery of SC in this family.</description>

      <title>Embedded multi-boson exchange: A step beyond quantum cluster theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a diagrammatic multi-scale approach to the Hubbard model based on the interaction-irreducible (multi-boson) vertex of a small cluster embedded in a self-consistent medium. The vertex captures short-ranged correlations up to the length scale of the cluster, while long-ranged correlations are recovered from a set of diagrammatic equations for the Hedin three-leg vertex. By virtue of the crossing symmetry, the Fierz decoupling ambiguity of the Hubbard interaction is resolved exactly. Our benchmarks for the half-filled Hubbard model on the square lattice are in very good agreement with numerically exact diagrammatic Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Surface phonons and possible structural phase transition in a topological semimetal PbTaSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators are a novel class of quantum materials characterized by protected gapless surface or edge states but insulating bulk states which is due to presence of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. Such an intriguing surface and bulk topology manifests itself in coupling with lattice dynamics due to electron-phonon scattering. Here we report an in-depth investigation of a topological nodal line semimetal PbTaSe2 via temperature, polarization dependent Raman spectroscopy and temperature dependent single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) measurements. Our analysis shows signature of electron-phonon coupling as reflected in the Fano asymmetry in line shape of M1-M4 modes and anomalous temperature variation of line-width of P3-P4 modes. Further polarization dependent phonon symmetry changes at different temperature (6K and 300K), discontinuities in bulk phonon dynamics for P2-P5 modes and disappearance of phonon modes i.e., M1-M5, on decreasing temperatures indicates towards a thermally induced structural phase transition which is also supported by the SC-XRD results. Hence based on our findings we propose that M1-M4 modes are surface phonon modes, the material undergoes a thermally induced structural phase transition from alpha to beta phase at T ~ 150 K or is in close proximity to the beta phase and another transition below T(CDW+beta) ~ 100K which is possibly due to the interplay of remanent completely commensurate charge density wave (CCDW) of 1H-TaSe2 and beta phase.</description>

      <title>Tuning electronic pairing by uniaxial strain in kagome lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay of attractive electron interactions and topological states in strained kagome lattices with spin-orbit coupling via a Hubbard Hamiltonian in the mean-field approximation. In the unstrained lattice, there is a topological phase transition from a quantum spin Hall state to a charge density wave (CDW) with increasing interaction strength. Upon applying a uniform uniaxial strain to the lattice, we find a new phase with coexisting CDWs and topological states. For increasing interaction strength or strain, the system is driven into a pure CDW, signaling topological phase transitions. The directionality (nematicity) of the CDW is controlled by the direction of the applied strain. When $s$ wave electronic pairing is allowed, the system develops a superconducting order beyond a threshold attraction, which is totally suppressed by the onset of a CDW with increasing interaction. Most interestingly, moderate strain allows the coexistence of superconductivity and CDWs for a range of interaction values. This illustrates how electronic interactions and single-particle topological structures compete to create unusual correlated phases in kagome systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Properties of YbBe13 Probed by Neutron Scattering and Thermodynamic Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examined the magnetic properties of YbBe13, which exhibits an antiferromagnetic order below TN = 1.2 K. Unlike other MBe13 compounds (M = rare earth/actinide elements), based on elastic neutron scattering, we observed an incommensurate magnetic propagation vector {\tau} = (0,0,{\tau}z), where {\tau}z = 0.5385 is in the reciprocal lattice unit. Additionally, we constructed a precise magnetic phase diagram for YbBe13. We observed non-trivial magnetic anomalies in YbBe13, which cannot be understood based on a simple helical order. Our results for YbBe13 provide an opportunity to reconsider the electron state of UBe13 and present an important step toward a comprehensive understanding of magnetic correlations in MBe13 series.</description>

      <title>Probing critical spin fluctuations with a composite magnetoelectric method: A case study on a Kitaev spin liquid candidate Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In correlated quantum materials, divergent critical fluctuations near the quantum critical point are often closely associated with exotic quantum phases of matter, such as unconventional superconductivity and quantum spin liquids. Here we present a simple yet highly sensitive composite magnetoelectric (ME) method for detecting the critical spin fluctuations in quantum magnets. The ME signal is proportional the magnetostriction coefficient, which directly probes the product of magnetization and spin-spin correlation. As a demonstration, the composite ME method is applied to a Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$, which shows signs of magnetic field-induced quantum criticality. Notably, the ME signal prominently diverges at the magnetic field-induced tricritical points, particularly at a tricritical point that lies in close proximity to a zero-temperature quantum critical point. A crucial aspect of these tricritical points is their tunability through the modification of the in-plane magnetic field's direction. The direction of magnetic field can thus serve as a handful yet important tuning parameter, alongside pressure and chemical doping, for searching quantum critical points in quantum magnets with pronounced magnetic anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Spinon pairing induced by chiral in-plane exchange and the stabilization of odd-spin Chern number spin liquid in twisted ${\rm MoTe}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unusual structure and symmetry of low-energy states in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides leads to large in-plane spin-exchange interactions between spin-valley locked holes. We demonstrate that this exchange interaction can stabilize a gapped spin-liquid phase with a quantized spin-Chern number of three when the twist angle is sufficiently small and the system lies in a Mott insulating phase. The gapped spin liquid may be understood as arising from spinon pairing in the DIII Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry class. Applying an out of plane electric field or increasing the twist angle is shown to drive a transition respectively to an anomalous Hall insulator or an in-plane antiferromagnet. Recent experiments indicate that a spin-Chern number three phase occurs in twisted MoTe$_2$ at small twist angles with a transition to a quantum anomalous Hall phase as the twist angle is increased above a critical value of about $2.5^\circ$ in absence of applied electric field.</description>

      <title>Programmable Kondo Effect Formed by Landau Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanobubbles wield significant influence over the electronic properties of 2D materials, showing diverse applications ranging from flexible devices to strain sensors. Here, we reveal that a strongly-correlated phenomenon, i.e., Kondo resonance, naturally takes place as an intrinsic property of graphene nanobubbles. The localized strain within the nanobubbles engenders pseudo magnetic fields, driving Landau quantization with degenerate Landau orbits. Under the Coulomb repulsion, the Landau orbits form an effective $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pseudospin intricately coupled to the bath via exchange interaction. This leads to novel Kondo behaviors with a new flavor screening mechanism. The resonance here exhibits an unparalleled tunability via strain engineering, establishing a versatile platform for exploring novel correlated phenomena beyond the scope of conventional Kondo systems.</description>

      <title>Spin order and dynamics in the topological rare-earth germanide semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $RE$Al(Si,Ge) ($RE$ = rare earth) family, known to break both the inversion- and time-reversal symmetries, represents one of the most suitable platforms for investigating the interplay between correlated-electron phenomena and topologically nontrivial bands. Here, we report on systematic magnetic, transport, and muon-spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements on (Nd,Sm)AlGe single crystals, which exhibit antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions at $T_\mathrm{N} = 6.1$ and 5.9 K, respectively. In addition, NdAlGe undergoes also an incommensurate-to-commensurate ferrimagnetic transition at 4.5 K. Weak transverse-field $\mu$SR measurements confirm the AFM transitions, featuring a $\sim$90 % magnetic volume fraction. In both cases, zero-field (ZF) $\mu$SR measurements reveal a more disordered internal field distribution in NdAlGe than in SmAlGe, reflected in a larger transverse muon-spin relaxation rate $\lambda^\mathrm{T}$ at $T \ll T_\mathrm{N}$. This may be due to the complex magnetic structure of NdAlGe, which undergoes a series of metamagnetic transitions in an external magnetic field, while SmAlGe shows only a robust AFM order. In NdAlGe, the topological Hall effect (THE) appears between the first and the second metamagnetic transitions for $H \parallel c$, while it is absent in SmAlGe. Such THE in NdAlGe is most likely attributed to the field-induced topological spin textures. The longitudinal muon-spin relaxation rate $\lambda^\mathrm{L}(T)$, diverges near the AFM order, followed by a clear drop at $T &lt; T_\mathrm{N}$. In the magnetically ordered state, spin fluctuations are significantly stronger in NdAlGe than in SmAlGe. In general, our longitudinal-field $\mu$SR data indicate vigorous spin fluctuations in NdAlGe, thus providing valuable insights into the origin of THE and of the possible topological spin textures in $RE$Al(Si,Ge) Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Gigantic-oxidative atomically layered epitaxy for designed complex oxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In designing material functionality within the intricate realm of transition metal oxides, lattice structure and d-orbital occupancy are two principal determinants of the correlated physical properties, such as superconductivity. However, the modulation of these two factors is inherently limited by the need to balance thermodynamic stability, kinetic mobility, and synthesis precision, particularly for oxidation-demanding phases. We introduce a methodology, namely the gigantic-oxidative atomically layered epitaxy (GOAL-Epitaxy), enhancing oxidation power 3-4 orders of magnitude beyond oxide molecular beam epitaxy (OMBE) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), while ensuring atomic-layer-by-layer growth of designed complex structures. Consequently, thermodynamic stability is markedly augmented at elevated temperatures, improving growth kinetics. We demonstrate the accurate synthesis of complex nickelates and cuprates, especially an artificially designed structure as a parent of high-temperature superconductivity, in which alternating single and double NiO2 layers possess distinct nominal d-orbital occupancy. The GOAL-Epitaxy enables material discovery within the vastly broadened growth parameter space.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of local magnetism and superconductivity in the heavy-fermion CeRh$_2$As$_2$ revealed by $\mu$SR studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting (SC) state ($T_\mathrm{c}$ = 0.3 K) of the heavy-fermion compound CeRh$_2$As$_2$, which undergoes an unusual field-induced transition to another high-field SC state, emerges from an unknown ordered state below $T_\mathrm{o}$ = 0.55 K. While an electronic multipolar order of itinerant Ce-4$f$ states was proposed to account for the $T_\mathrm{o}$ phase, the exact order parameter has not been known to date. Here, we report on muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) studies of the magnetic and SC properties in CeRh$_2$As$_2$ single crystals at low temperatures. We reveal a magnetic origin of the $T_\mathrm{o}$ order by identifying a spontaneous internal field below $T_\mathrm{o}$ = 0.55 K. Furthermore, we find evidence of a microscopic coexistence of local magnetism with bulk superconductivity. Our findings open the possibility that the $T_\mathrm{o}$ phase involves both dipole and higher order Ce-4$f$ moment degrees of freedom and accounts for the unusual non-Fermi liquid behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the universal signatures of quantum phase transitions that can be extracted with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm applied to quantum chains with a gradient. We present high-quality data collapses for the order parameter and for the entanglement entropy for three minimal models: transverse-field Ising, 3-state Potts and Ashkin-Teller. Furthermore, we show that scan-DMRG successfully captures the universal critical scaling when applied across the magnetic Wess-Zumino-Witten and non-magnetic Ising transitions in the frustrated Haldane chain. In addition, we report a universal scaling of the lowest excitation energy as a function of a gradient rate. Finally, we argue that the scan-DMRG approach has significantly lower computational cost compare to the conventional DMRG protocols to study quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Anomalies in mirror symmetry enriched topological orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional mirror symmetry-enriched topological orders can be studied using the folding approach: it can be folded along the mirror axis and turned into a bilayer system on which the mirror symmetry acts as a $\mathbb Z_2$ layer-exchange symmetry. How mirror-symmetry enriches the topological order is then encoded at the mirror axis, which is a gapped boundary of the folded bilayer system. Based on anyon-condensation theory, we classify possible $\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric gapped boundaries of the folded system. In particular, we derive an $H^2$ obstruction function, which corresponds to an $H^3$ obstruction for topological orders enriched by the time-reversal symmetry instead of mirror symmetry. We demonstrate that states with a nontrivial $H^2$ obstruction function can be constructed on the surface of a three-dimensional mirror SET order.</description>

      <title>High-temperature quantum coherence of spinons in a rare-earth spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although magnetism is a quantum phenomenon, its energy scale can be strong enough to sustain technological usage at room temperature and above. Temperature, however, leads to the decoherence which hampers quantum information applications. Common wisdom dictates that when magnets are heated to temperatures where thermal energy is higher than the interactions among atomic magnetic moments, the latter become uncorrelated and classical paramagnetic behavior is recovered. Surprisingly, our neutron scattering experiments on Yb chains in an insulating perovskite crystal overturn this conventional picture. We find a sharply defined spectrum of spinon excitations, which are the fractional elementary excitations in spin-1/2 chains, that persists to temperatures where thermal energy is more than 20 times higher than the energy of interactions between Yb magnetic moments, $J$. The observed sharpness of the spinon continuum boundary indicates that spinon mean free path exceeds $\approx 35$ inter-atomic spacings at temperatures markedly above the magnetic energy scale. Our observations reveal an interesting and highly unusual quantum behavior in a rare earth magnet, which challenges quantum metrology and has profound implications for spin qubit systems in quantum information applications operating at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>An antiferromagnetic diode effect in even-layered MnBi2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a PN junction, the separation between positive and negative charges leads to diode transport. In the past few years, the intrinsic diode transport in noncentrosymmetric polar conductors has attracted great interest, because it suggests novel nonlinear applications and provides a symmetry-sensitive probe of Fermi surface. Recently, such studies have been extended to noncentrosymmetric superconductors, realizing the superconducting diode effect. Here, we show that, even in a centrosymmetric crystal without directional charge separation, the spins of an antiferromagnet (AFM) can generate a spatial directionality, leading to an AFM diode effect. We observe large second-harmonic transport in a nonlinear electronic device enabled by the compensated AFM state of even-layered MnBi2Te4. We also report a novel electrical sum-frequency generation (SFG), which has been rarely explored in contrast to the well-known optical SFG in wide-gap insulators. We demonstrate that the AFM enables an in-plane field-effect transistor and harvesting of wireless electromagnetic energy. The electrical SFG establishes a powerful method to study nonlinear electronics built by quantum materials. The AFM diode effect paves the way for potential device concepts including AFM logic circuits, self-powered AFM spintronics, and other applications that potentially bridge nonlinear electronics with AFM spintronics.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Hubbard-Mott excitons and their ro-vibrational excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hubbard excitons are bound states of doublons and holes that can be experimentally probed both in real materials, such as cuprates, and in cold atom quantum simulators. Here we compare properties of a Hubbard exciton to those of a pair of distinguishable dopants in the $t-J$ model and show how insights into pair properties can be obtained through excitonic spectra. In particular, we perform large-scale numerical simulations of spectral functions and optical conductivities and obtain remarkable agreement between Hubbard excitons and pairs of distinguishable dopants. The latter can be decomposed into symmetric (bosonic) and anti-symmetric (fermionic) sectors of indistinguishable dopants, thus enabling a detailed understanding of different features observed in the excitonic spectra through comparison with a semi-analytical geometric string theory approach. We further compare theoretically computed exciton spectra in a single band Fermi-Hubbard model to resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) studies of the parent insulating cuprate materials. We find remarkable agreement between the two spectra in both energy and momentum dependence. Our analysis suggests that multiple long-lived ro-vibrational exciton resonances have been observed in RIXS spectra. Experimentally, these features are known to persist up to optimal doping. The comparison we provide between semi-analytical theory, large-scale numerics, and experimental data thus provides an explanation of the RIXS measurements and provides new insight into the nature of pairing in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Variational Monte Carlo Study of the Doped $t$-$J$ Model on Honeycomb Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground state of the bipartite $t$-$J$ model must satisfy a specific sign structure, based on which the single-hole and two-hole ground state $Ans\ddot{a}tze$ on honeycomb lattice are constructed and studied by a variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method. The VMC results are in good agreement with the exact diagonalization (ED) calculation. For the single-hole case, the degenerate ground states are characterized by quantum numbers of a spin-1/2 and an orbital angular momentum $L_z=\pm 2$. The latter is associated with the emergent chiral spin/hole currents mutually surrounding the hole/spin-1/2 as a composite object or ``twisted hole''. A vanishing quasiparticle spectral weight is shown in the large-sample limit. In the two-hole ground state, the holes form a spin-singlet pairing with $d$+$id$ symmetry in the Cooper channel, but are of $s$-wave symmetry as a tightly bound pair of the ``twisted holes''. Such a pairing mechanism of dichotomy can be attributed to eliminating the local spin currents which has nothing to do with the long-range antiferromagnetic correlation. Superconducting ground state at finite doping is briefly discussed in terms of the tightly bound hole pairs as the building blocks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers have long been anticipated to excel in simulating quantum many-body physics. While most previous work has focused on Hermitian physics, we demonstrate the power of variational quantum circuits for resource-efficient simulations of dynamical and equilibrium physics in non-Hermitian systems, revealing new phenomena beyond standard Hermitian quantum machines. Using a variational quantum compilation scheme for fermionic systems, we reduce gate count, save qubits, and eliminate the need for postselection, a major challenge in simulating non-Hermitian dynamics via standard Trotterization. Experimentally, we observed a supersonic mode in the connected density-density correlation function on an $ n = 18 $ fermionic chain after a non-Hermitian, locally interacting quench, which would otherwise be forbidden by the Lieb-Robinson bound in a Hermitian system. Additionally, we investigate sequential quantum circuits generated by tensor networks for ground state preparation, here defined as the eigenstate with the lowest real part eigenvalue, using a variance minimization scheme. Through a trapped-ion implementation on the Quantinuum H1 quantum processor, we accurately capture correlation functions and energies across an exceptional point on a dissipative spin chain up to length $ n = 20 $ using only 3 qubits. Motivated by these advancements, we provide an analytical example demonstrating that simulating single-qubit non-Hermitian dynamics for $\Theta(\log(n))$ time from certain initial states is exponentially hard on a quantum computer, offering insights into the opportunities and limitations of using quantum computation for simulating non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Depinning, Melting and Sliding of Generalized Wigner Crystals in Moire Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically examine the depinning, sliding, and melting of commensurate and incommensurate Wigner crystals on two-dimensional hexagonal periodic substrates near fillings of 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3 to model the dynamics of generalized Wigner crystals in moire heterostructures. At low temperatures where thermal fluctuations are irrelevant, for commensurate fillings we find a strongly pinned state that depins into a sliding crystal, while at incommensurate fillings, the depinning threshold is strongly reduced. For fillings below 1/2, the depinning occurs in a two-step process. Above the first depinning threshold, there is an extended range of drives where the conduction occurs via the sliding of anti-kinks along the charge stripes, followed by a second threshold where all of the charges begin to slide. At finite temperatures, the external driving reduces the effective melting temperature at commensurate fillings and enhances creep at incommensurate fillings. We show that depinning into different sliding states, such as moving fluids or moving crystals, produces nonlinear features in the transport curves. We also show that transport is asymmetric on either side of a commensurate filling due to the different dynamics for interstitials versus holes in the commensurate structure. A variety of sliding states should be accessible for generalized Wigner crystals at finite temperatures even for low drives. If experiments can realize sliding dynamics in moire systems, it would open a new class of commensurate and incommensurate phases for study. Additionally, the sliding dynamics and anti-kink flow could provide new functionalities for charge transport in moire heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of matrix product state (MPS) representations of the influence functionals (IF) for the calculation of real-time equilibrium correlation functions in open quantum systems. Focusing specifically on the unbiased spin-boson model, we explore the use of IF-MPSs for complex time propagation, as well as IF-MPSs for constructing correlation functions in the steady state. We examine three different IF approaches: one based on the Kadanoff-Baym contour targeting correlation functions at all times, one based on a complex contour targeting the correlation function at a single time, and a steady state formulation which avoids imaginary or complex times, while providing access to correlation functions at all times. We show that within the IF language, the steady state formulation provides a powerful approach to evaluate equilibrium correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Quantum origin of Ohm's reciprocity relation and its violation: conductivity as inverse resistivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom teaches us that the electrical conductivity in a material is the inverse of its resistivity. In this work, we show that when both of these transport coefficients are defined in linear response through the Kubo formulae as two-point correlators of quantum fields, this Ohm's reciprocity relation is generically violated in theories with dynamical electromagnetism. We also elucidate how in special limits (e.g., in the DC limit in the presence of thermal effects, in certain 2+1$d$ conformal theories, and in holographic supersymmetric theories) the reciprocity is again reinstated, and show that if the response of a material is measured with respect to the total electric field that includes quantum corrections, then the reciprocity relation is satisfied by definition. However, in that case, the transport coefficients are given by the photon vacuum polarisation and not the correlators of conserved currents that dominate macroscopic late-time transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been pointed out in [1] that the familiar reciprocity relation between the conductivity $\sigma$ and resistivity $\rho$ should not be expected to hold in all possible settings, but, as argued in [2], is rather a property that may (or may not) emerge as a consequence of specific features, or in certain limits of interest, of a given theory. In this work, I prove the conventional statement: $\rho= \sigma^{-1}$, which I refer to as $\textit{Ohm's reciprocity relation}$, for a large class of holographic models with $d=3+1$ boundary dimensions. The proof involves a generalisation of the electric-magnetic duality in the $D=4+1$ bulk, the validity of which is discussed in detail. I then confirm these findings by considering one specific model and run numerical simulations in different settings.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of non-Hermitian BCS superfluids in a dissipative asymmetric Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model with asymmetric hopping and complex-valued interactions, which should be realized by collective one-body loss and two-body loss. By means of the NH BCS theory, we find that the weak asymmetry of the hopping does not affect the BCS superfluidity since it only affects the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the BdG Hamiltonian. Systematic analysis in the $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattices clarifies that the singularity in the density of states affects the phase boundary between the normal and dissipation-induced superfluid states. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by using the photoassociation techniques and a nonlocal Rabi coupling with local losses and postselecting null measurement outcomes utilized by quantum-gas microscopes.</description>

      <title>Topological Phases for Extended Objects: Semiclassical Phase-Space Approach with Tensorial Coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been established that certain higher-dimensional topological phases of matter support extended objects like quasi-strings and quasi-membranes in their bulk states. In this study, we investigate the physics of these topological systems using a phase-space approach in the semiclassical regime, incorporating tensorial coordinates related to the extended objects. Specifically, we explore the semiclassical currents associated to open quasi-strings in topological phases in three spatial dimensions, considering the presence of both coordinate-space Kalb-Ramond fields and momentum-space tensor Berry connections. Our results show that the currents associated to the endpoints of open quasi-strings on the system's boundary exhibit a quantized Hall response. This formalism accurately reproduces the boundary response as predicted by an Abelian BF theory proving a novel way to study extended objects in topological matter.</description>

      <title>Can the noble metals (Au, Ag and Cu) be superconductors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is common knowledge that noble metals are excellent conductors but do not exhibit superconductivity. On the other hand, quantum confinement in thin films has been consistently shown to induce a significant enhancement of the superconducting critical temperature in several superconductors. It is therefore an important fundamental question whether ultra-thin film confinement may induce observable superconductivity in non-superconducting metals. We present a generalization, in the Eliashberg framework, of a BCS theory of superconductivity in good metals under thin-film confinement. By numerically solving these new Eliashberg-type equations, we find the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature on the film thickness $L$. This parameter-free theory predicts a maximum increase in the critical temperature for a specific value of the film thickness, which is a function of the number of free carriers in the material. Exploiting this fact, we predict that ultra-thin films of gold, silver and copper of suitable thickness could be superconductors at low but experimentally accessible temperatures. We demonstrate that this is a fine-tuning problem where the thickness must assume a very precise value, close to half a nanometer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.07459v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the thermoelectric and thermal transport in the weakly disordered non-Fermi liquid phase of the Luttinger semimetals at zero doping, where the decay rate associated with the (strong) Coulomb interactions is much larger than the electron-impurity scattering rate. To this end, we implement the Mori-Zwanzig memory matrix method, that does not rely on the existence of long-lived quasiparticles in the system. We find that the thermal conductivity at zero electric field scales as $\bar{\kappa}\sim T^{-n}$ (with $0\lesssim n\lesssim 1)$ at low temperatures, whereas the thermoelectric coefficient has the temperature dependence given by $\alpha\sim T^{p}$ (with $1/2\lesssim p\lesssim 3/2)$. These unconventional properties turn out to be key signatures of this long sought-after non-Fermi liquid state in the Luttinger semimetals, which is expected to emerge in strongly correlated spin-orbit coupled materials like the pyrochlore iridates. Finally, our results indicate that these materials might be good candidates for achieving high figure of merit for thermoelectric applications.</description>

Abstract: The two-channel Kondo lattice likely hosts a rich array of phases, including hastatic order, a channel symmetry breaking heavy Fermi liquid. We revisit its one-dimensional phase diagram using density matrix renormalization group and, in contrast to previous work find algebraic hastatic orders generically for stronger couplings. These are heavy Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids with nonanalyticities at Fermi vectors captured by hastatic density waves. We also find a predicted additional non-local order parameter due to interference between hastatic spinors, not present at large-N; and residual repulsive interactions at strong coupling suggesting non-Fermi-liquid physics in higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The recently introduced topological heavy fermion model (THFM) provides a means for interpreting the low-energy electronic degrees of freedom of the magic angle twisted bilayer graphene as hybridization amidst highly dispersing topological conduction and weakly dispersing localized heavy fermions. In order to understand the Landau quantization of the ensuing electronic spectrum, a generalization of THFM to include the magnetic field B is desired, but currently missing. Here we provide a systematic derivation of the THFM in B and solve the resulting model to obtain the interacting Hofstadter spectra for single particle charged excitations. While naive minimal substitution within THFM fails to correctly account for the total number of magnetic subbands within the narrow band i.e. its total Chern number, our method -- based on projecting the light and heavy fermions onto the irreducible representations of the magnetic translation group -- reproduces the correct total Chern number. Analytical results presented here offer an intuitive understanding of the nature of the (strongly interacting) Hofstadter bands.</description>

Abstract: Chiral topological orders formed in correlated fermion systems have been widely explored. However, the mechanism on how they emerge from interacting fermions is still unclear. Here, we propose a susceptibility condition. Under this condition, we show that chiral topological orders can spontaneously take place in correlated fermion systems. The condition leads to a low-energy effective theory of bosons with strong frustration, mimicking the flat band systems. The frustration then melts the long-range orders and results in topological orders with time-reversal symmetry breaking. We apply the theory to strongly-correlated semiconductors doped to the metallic phase. A novel excitonic topological order with semionic excitations and chiral excitonic edge state is revealed. We also discuss the application to frustrated magnets. The theory predicts a chiral spin liquid state, which is numerically confirmed by our tensor network calculations. These results demonstrate an unprecedented indicator for chiral topological orders, which bridges the existing gap between interacting fermions and correlated topological matter.</description>

Abstract: The identification, description, and classification of topological features is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of pseudo-Hermitian many-body quantum systems. For that purpose, we study two different systems, the dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain. For the two different many-body models, we find the same topological features for a wide range of parameters suggesting that they are universal. In the SYK model, we identify four universality classes, related to pseudo-Hermiticity, characterized by a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization, we identify a topological index $\nu$ that only depends on symmetry. Another distinct consequence of the rectangularization is the observation, for any coupling to the bath, of purely real topological modes in the Liouvillian. The level statistics of these real modes agree with that of the corresponding random matrix ensemble and therefore can be employed to characterize the four topological symmetry classes. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the stability of the antiferromagnetic all-in--all-out state observed in dipolar-octupolar pyrochlores that have neodymium as the magnetic species. Different types of disorder are considered, either affecting the immediate environment of the Nd$^{3+}$ ion, or substituting it with a non-magnetic ion. Starting from the well studied Nd$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ compound, Ti substitution on the Zr site and dilution on the Nd magnetic site with La substitution are investigated. The recently discovered entropy stabilized compound NdMox, which exhibits a high degree of disorder on the non magnetic site is also studied. Using a range of experimental techniques, especially very low-temperature magnetization and neutron scattering, we show that the all-in--all-out state is very robust and withstands substitutional disorder up to large rates. From these measurements, we estimate the Hamiltonian parameters and discuss their evolution in the framework of the phase diagram of dipolar-octupolar pyrochlore magnets.</description>

      <title>A tale of two pairs: on the origin of the pseudogap end point in the high-T$_{c}$ cuprate superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02785v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are two seemingly unrelated puzzles about the cuprate superconductors. The first puzzle concerns the strong non-BCS behavior around $x_{c}$, the end point of the superconducting dome on the overdoped side, where the cuparte is believed to be well described by the fermi liquid theory. This is the most evident in the observed $\rho_{s}(0)-T_{c}$ scaling and the large amount of uncondensed optical spectral weight at low energy. The second puzzle concerns the remarkable robustness of the d-wave pairing against the inevitable disorder effect in such a doped system, which is also totally unexpected from the conventional BCS picture. Here we show that these two puzzles are deeply connected to the origin of a third puzzle about the cuprate superconductors, namely, the mysterious quantum critical behavior observed around $x^{*}$, the so-called pseudogap end point. Through a systematic variational optimization of the disordered 2D $t-J$ model from the resonating valence bond(RVB) perspective, we find that the d-wave pairing in this model is remarkably more robust against the disorder effect than that in a conventional d-wave BCS superconductor. We find that such remarkable robustness can be attributed to the spin-charge separation mechanism in the RVB picture, through which the d-wave RVB pairing of the charge neutral spinons becomes essentially immune to the impurity potential except for the secondary effect related to the modulation of the local doping level by the disorder. We propose that there exists a Mott transition at $x^{*}$, where the RVB pairing in the underdoped regime is transmuted into the increasingly more BCS-like pairing for $x&gt;x^{*}$, whose increasing fragility against the disorder effect leads to the non-BCS behavior and the ultimate suppression of superconductivity around $x_{c}$.</description>

      <title>Emergent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless and Kugel-Khomskii physics in the triangular lattice bilayer colbaltate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the experiments on the triangular lattice bilayer colbaltate K$_2$Co$_2$(SeO$_3$)$_3$, we formulate a theory to explore the underlying physics from a couple observation. The model is composed of interacting Co$^{2+}$ dimers on the triangular lattice, where the Co$^{2+}$ ion provides an effective spin-1/2 local moment via the spin-orbit coupling and the crystal field effect. The intra-dimer interaction is dominant and would simply favor the local spin singlet, and the inter-dimer interactions compete with the inter-dimer interaction, leading to rich behaviors. With the easy-axis anisotropy, it is shown that, in the ground state manifold of the intra-dimer Ising interaction, the system realizes an effective transverse field Ising model, where the ground state is either a three-sublattice order or Ising disordered. The finite temperature regime naturally realizes the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics. To explore the full excitations, we incorporate the excited state manifold of the intra-dimer Ising interaction and establish the emergent Kugel-Khomskii physics. Thus, the triangular lattice bilayer colbaltate is an excellent platform to explore the interplay between geometrical frustration and anisotropic interactions as well as the emergent effective models and the resulting physics.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic anomalous Hall effects in altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the anomalous Hall effect arising from the altermagnetic order and spin-orbit interaction in doped FeSb$_2$. To investigate the anomalous transport, we have constructed a tight-binding model of FeSb$_2$. We separately considered the constraints imposed on the model parameters by the spin symmetry group and magnetic symmetry group at zero and finite spin-orbit interaction, respectively. The resulting model includes the effect of exchange splitting and is applicable at both zero and finite spin-orbit interaction. In the case of spin symmetry, the analysis covers the spin-only subgroup arising from collinear magnetism, as well as non-trivial symmetry elements. This allows us to explore changes in the hopping amplitudes as symmetry is reduced by spin-orbit interaction from the spin group to the magnetic group. While the anomalous Hall effect is forbidden by spin symmetry, it is allowed by the symmetries of the magnetic group. The intrinsic Hall conductivity is shown to vanish linearly with spin-orbit interaction. This non-analytic behavior is universal to altermagnets. It originates from the singularity of the Berry curvature localized along lines on a Fermi surface confined to symmetry planes. These planes host spin degeneracy protected by spin symmetry, which is lifted by spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Spin-Orbit Exciton-Magnon Excitations in FePS3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FePS3 is a layered van der Waals (vdW) Ising antiferromagnet that has recently been studied in the context of true 2D magnetism, and emerged as an ideal material platform for investigating strong spin-phonon coupling, and non-linear magneto-optical phenomena. In this work, we demonstrate an important unresolved role of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the ground state and excitations of this compound. Combining first principles calculations with Linear Flavor Wave Theory (LFWT), we find strong mixing and spectral overlap of different spin-orbital single-ion states. As such, the low-lying excitations form complex mixtures of local degrees of freedom most accurately viewed as hybrid spin-orbit exciton-magnon modes. Complete parameterization of the resulting low-energy model including all such degrees of freedom requires nearly half a million coupling constants. Despite this complexity, we show that such a model can be inexpensively derived using local many-body-based approaches, which yield quantitative agreement with recent experiments. The results highlight the importance of SOC even in first row transition metals, and provide essential insight into the properties of 2D magnets with unquenched orbital moments.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of the quantum spin-1/2 Heisenberg-$\Gamma$ model on a frustrated zigzag chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum spin-1/2 zigzag chain with frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg interactions, incorporating additional off-diagonal exchange interactions known as the $\Gamma$ term, both with and without an applied magnetic field. Based on the density-matrix renormalization group calculation, we map out the ground state phase diagram that shows a variety of magnetic and nonmagnetic phases including multicritical points and several exactly solvable points. Upon introducing a finite $\Gamma$ term, we observe the persistent dimer singlet state of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model, sustaining a nonzero spin gap, while also giving rise to a gapless nonmagnetic excitation, manifesting in the substantial zero-energy peak in the nematic dynamical structure factor. This gapless peak-mode remaining almost as a fluctuation to the ground state, induces dilute but robust concentration of nematicity on top of singlets on dimers, which we call the nematic singlet-dimer phase. When the whole nematic excited mode condenses and replaces the singlet, the nematic-dimer phase transforms to the Ising-type ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic long-range orders that arise from the $\Gamma$ term spontaneously selecting magnetic easy axes. Its orientations dictate the type of magnetic order under geometric frustration effects as predicted by Landau's mean-field theory. These theoretical findings provide insights into the exotic low-temperature phase observed in YbCuS$_2$, characterized by gapless excitations and seemingly nonmagnetic behavior accompanied by incommensurate correlations.</description>

      <title>Absence of a bulk charge density wave signature in x-ray measurements of UTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-sought pair density wave (PDW) is an exotic phase of matter in which charge density wave (CDW) order is intertwined with the amplitude or phase of coexisting, superconducting order \cite{Berg2009,Berg2009b}. Originally predicted to exist in copper-oxides, circumstantial evidence for PDW order now exists in a variety of materials. Recently, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies have reported evidence for a three-component charge density wave (CDW) at the surface of the heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe$_2$, persisting below its superconducting transition temperature. Here, we use hard x-ray diffraction measurements on crystals of UTe$_2$ at $T = 1.9$ K and $12$ K to search for a bulk signature of this CDW. Using STM measurements as a constraint, we calculate the expected locations of CDW superlattice peaks, and sweep a large volume of reciprocal space in search of a signature. We failed to find any evidence for a CDW near any of the expected superlattice positions in many Brillouin zones. We estimate an upper bound on the CDW lattice distortion of $u_{max} \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{\AA}$. Our results suggest that the CDW observed in STM is either purely electronic, somehow lacking a signature in the structural lattice, or is restricted to the material surface.</description>

      <title>Absence of bulk charge density wave order in the normal state of UTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spatially modulated superconducting state at zero magnetic field, known as pair density wave (PDW), is a tantalizing state of matter with unique properties. PDWs have been observed in diverse spin-singlet superconductors ranging from high-temperature cuprate and Fe-based superconductors to kagome and two-dimensional chalcogenide compounds. Recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies reveal that spin-triplet superconductor UTe$_2$ hosts an unprecedented spin-triplet PDW whose wavevectors are indistinguishable from a preceding charge-density wave (CDW) order that survives to temperatures well above the superconducting critical temperature, $T_{c}$. Whether the PDW is the mother or a subordinate order remains unsettled. Here, based on a systematic search for bulk charge order above $T_{c}$ using resonant elastic X-ray scattering (REXS), we show that the structure factor of charge order previously identified by STM is absent in the bulk within the sensitivity of REXS, which implies that the reported CDW order in the normal state of UTe$_2$ is a surface phenomenon. Our results invite two scenarios: either the density-wave orders condense simultaneously at $T_{c}$ in the bulk, in which case PDW order is likely the mother phase, or these modulations are restricted to the surface.</description>

      <title>Monopole Superconductivity in Magnetically Doped Cd$_3$As$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.04249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When superconducting pairing occurs between Fermi surfaces with different Chern numbers, the Cooper pairs possess nontrivial pair Berry phase, which enforces pairing gap nodes. The resulting pairing order is further distinguished from the familiar $s$-, $p$-, and $d$-wave pairing orders by a nonzero pair monopole charge and is described by monopole harmonics. To date, this exotic monopole pairing order is yet to be achieved experimentally. We therefore study the magnetically doped Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$ as a candidate material for realizing monopole superconductivity with pair monopole charges $q_p=1$ or $2$, depending on the chemical potential. For each case of pair monopole charge, we explore representatives of uniform pairing orders in all allowed irreducible representations of the $C_{4h}$ symmetry of magnetically doped Cd$_3$As$_2$. We demonstrate the distinctions in the monopole analogs of different higher partial wave superconducting orders that result from the combination of topological Fermi surfaces of higher Chern number and crystalline symmetry. In all cases, the patterns of the superconducting phase winding around a Fermi surface are constrained by the topologically invariant total winding number, which depends only on the pair monopole charge and requires nodes in the $q_p\neq 0$ superconducting order. Our work can guide further experimental investigation of monopole orders in the topological semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$ and can be generalized to other materials with Fermi surfaces of higher Chern number, which enforce monopole pairing order in higher partial waves, such as the monopole analog of $f$-wave pairing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11197v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics induced by a local perturbation in fracton field theory. For the ${\mathbb Z}_4$ and ${\mathbb Z}_8$-symmetric free fractonic theories, we compute the time dynamics of several observables such as the two-point Green function, $\langle \phi^2 \rangle$ condensate, energy density, and the dipole momentum. The time-dependent considerations highlight that the free fractonic theory breaks causality and exhibits instantaneous signal propagation, even if an additional relativistic term is included to enforce a speed limit in the system. We show that it is related to the fact that the Lieb-Robinson bound does not hold in the continuum limit of the fracton field theory, and the effective bounded speed of light does not emerge. For the theory in finite volume, we show that the fracton wave front acquires fractal shape with non-trivial Hausdorff dimension, and argue that this phenomenon cannot be explained by a simple self-interference effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators of lattice gauge theories involve dynamics of typically short-ranged interacting particles and dynamical fields. Elimination of the latter via Gauss law leads to infinite range interactions as exemplified by the Schwinger model in a staggered formalism. This motivates the study of long-range interactions, not necessarily diminishing with the distance. Here we consider localization properties of a spin chain with interaction strength growing linearly along the chain as for the Schwinger model. We generalize the problem to models with different interaction ranges. Using exact diagonalization we find the participation ratio of all eigenstates, which allows us to quantify the localization volume in Hilbert space. Surprisingly, the localization volume changes nonmonotonically with the interaction range. Our study is relevant for quantum simulators of lattice gauge theories implemented in state-of-the-art cold atom/ion devices, and it could help to reveal hidden features in disorder-free confinement phenomena in long-range interacting systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Hall effect induced by chiral fluctuations in ErMn6Sn6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological Hall effect (THE) is a hallmark of scalar spin chirality, which is found in static skyrmion lattices. Recent theoretical works have shown that scalar spin chirality could also emerge dynamically from thermal spin fluctuations. Evidence of such a mechanism was found in the kagome magnet YMn6Sn6 where fluctuations arise from frustrated exchange interactions between Mn kagome layers. In YMn6Sn6, the rare-earth ion Y3+ is non-magnetic. When it is replaced by a magnetic ion (Gd3+-Ho3+), the intrinsically antiferromagnetic Mn-Mn interlayer coupling is overwhelmed by the indirect ferromagnetic Mn-R-Mn one, relieving frustration. This generates interesting anomalous Hall conductivity, but not THE. Here we show that Er lies in an intermediate regime where direct and indirect interactions closely compete, so that ErMn6Sn6 can switch from one regime to the other by temperature, i.e., from a collinear ferrimagnetic ground state to a spiral antiferromagnet at 78 K. The AFM phase forms a dome in the temperature-field phase diagram. Close to the boundary of this dome, we find a sizable fluctuations-driven THE, thus underscoring the universality of this chiral fluctuation mechanism for generating non-zero scalar spin chirality.</description>

      <title>Entangled multiplets, asymmetry, and quantum Mpemba effect in dissipative systems</title>

Abstract: Recently, the entanglement asymmetry emerged as an informative tool to understand dynamical symmetry restoration in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems after a quantum quench. For integrable systems the asymmetry can be understood in the space-time scaling limit via the quasiparticle picture, as it was pointed out in Ref. [1]. However, a quasiparticle picture for quantum quenches from generic initial states was still lacking. Here we conjecture a full-fledged quasiparticle picture for the charged moments of the reduced density matrix, which are the main ingredients to construct the asymmetry. Our formula works for quenches producing entangled multiplets of an arbitrary number of excitations. We benchmark our results in the $XX$ spin chain. First, by using an elementary approach based on the multidimensional stationary phase approximation we provide an $\textit{ab initio}$ rigorous derivation of the dynamics of the charged moments for the quench treated in [2]. Then, we show that the same results can be straightforwardly obtained within our quasiparticle picture. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain a general criterion ensuring a vanishing entanglement asymmetry at long times. Next, by using the Lindblad master equation, we study the effect of gain and loss dissipation on the entanglement asymmetry. Specifically, we investigate the fate of the so-called quantum Mpemba effect (QME) in the presence of dissipation. We show that dissipation can induce QME even if unitary dynamics does not show it, and we provide a quasiparticle-based interpretation of the condition for the QME.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism in NiSi and antiferromagnetic candidate materials with non-collinear spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17451</link>

Abstract: Recently, a new class of magnetic phenomenon, called altermagnetism, was proposed where the underlying spin configuration resembles antiferromagnetic structure, but the system violates \textbf{PT} (PT: Parity times Time reversal) symmetry due to the alternation of crystalline symmetry across magnetic ions. Although the original idea was proposed for the collinear spin structure, a recent report by Cheong et al. has suggested that antiferromagnetic materials with non-collinear spin structure and local alternation of crystalline arrangement can also manifest altermagnetism. Besides breaking the \textbf{PT} symmetry, altermagnetic compounds are also expected to exhibit anomalous Hall effects of odd orders. Here, we discuss possible candidates in this regard. One example is nickel monosilicide, which was recently shown to exhibit high temperature antiferromagnetism with non-collinear spin structure. It fulfills both criteria of breaking the \textbf{PT} symmetry and manifesting nonlinear anomalous Hall effect. In addition to NiSi, we also discuss other potential antiferromagnetic materials with non-collinear spin configuration for the exploration of altermagnetic states.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics study of electron-correlation-induced charge density wave in antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00297</link>

Abstract: Electron-correlation-driven phonon soft modes have been recently reported in the antiferromagnetic kagome FeGe compound and associated with the observed charge density wave (CDW). In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of the CDW origin in the context of the ab initio lattice dynamics study. Performing the group theory analysis of the mentioned soft mode, we found that the stable structure has the Immm symmetry and can be achieved by shifts of Ge atoms. Additionally, we show that the final structure realizes a distorted honeycomb Ge lattice as well as a non-flat kagome-like Fe net. For completeness, we present the electronic properties calculations. From the theoretical STM topography simulation, we indicate that the observed CDW occurs in the deformed honeycomb Ge sublattice.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional Fermi polaron after a kick: two-sided singularity of the momentum distribution, Bragg reflection and other exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02099</link>

Abstract: A mobile impurity particle immersed in a quantum fluid forms a polaron - a quasiparticle consisting of the impurity and a local disturbance of the fluid around it. We ask what happens to a one-dimensional polaron after a kick, i.e. an abrupt application of a force that instantly delivers a finite impulse to the impurity. In the framework of an integrable model describing an impurity in a one-dimensional gas of fermions or hard-core bosons, we calculate the distribution of the polaron momentum established when the post-kick relaxation is over. A remarkable feature of this distribution is a two-sided power-law singularity. It emerges due to one of two processes. In the first process, the whole impulse is transferred to the polaron, without creating phonon-like excitations of the fluid. In the second process, the impulse is shared between the polaron and the center-of-mass motion of the fluid, again without creating any fluid excitations. The latter process is, in fact, a Bragg reflection at the edge of the emergent Brillouin zone. We carefully analyze the conditions for each of the two processes. The asymptotic form of the distribution in the vicinity of the singularity is derived.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Representations of Topological Orders with Loop- and Membrane-like Excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In spacetime dimensions of 4D (i.e., 3+1D) and higher, topological orders exhibit spatially extended excitations like loops and membranes, which support diverse topological data characterizing braiding, fusion, and shrinking processes, despite the absence of anyons. Our understanding of these topological data remains less mature compared to 3D, where anyons have been extensively studied and can be fully described through diagrammatic representations. Inspired by recent advancements in field theory descriptions of higher-dimensional topological orders, this paper systematically constructs diagrammatic representations for 4D and 5D topological orders, generalizable to higher dimensions. We introduce elementary diagrams for fusion and shrinking processes, treating them as vectors in fusion and shrinking spaces, respectively, and build complex diagrams by combining these elementary diagrams. Within these vector spaces, we design unitary operations represented by \(F\)-, \(\Delta\)-, and \(\Delta^2\)-symbols to transform between different bases. We uncover \textit{pentagon equations} and \textit{(hierarchical) shrinking-fusion hexagon equations} that impose constraints on the legitimate forms of these unitary operations. We conjecture that all anomaly-free higher-dimensional topological orders must satisfy these conditions, with any violations indicating a quantum anomaly. This work opens promising avenues for future research, including the exploration of diagrammatic representations involving braiding and implications for noninvertible symmetries and Symmetry Topological Field Theory.</description>

      <title>Sublattice polarization from destructive interference on common lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that sublattice-polarized states (SLPSs) appear ubiquitously on the common lattices. We first establish the destructive-interference (DI) scenario for the SLPSs, which is systematized by a point-group-symmetry interpretation. The examples on common one-, two-, and three-dimensional lattices are then demonstrated. We also deduce the symmetry-protected robustness of SLPSs against further-neighbor hoppings. Moreover, the DI scenario can be generalized to the multi-SLP. The important effects on interaction-driven phases are studied by Hartree-Fock analysis.</description>

      <title>Observation of Electronic Viscous Dissipation in Graphene Magneto-thermal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic transport effectively describes the collective dynamics of fluids with well-defined thermodynamic quantities. With enhanced electron-electron interactions at elevated temperatures, the collective behavior of electrons in graphene with minimal impurities can be depicted as a hydrodynamic flow of charges. In this new regime, the well-known rules of Ohmic transport based on a single electron picture no longer apply, necessitating the consideration of collective electron dynamics. In particular, the hydrodynamic analogues of Joule heating and thermal transport require consideration of the viscous motion of the electron fluid, which has a direct impact on energy dissipation and heat generation by the fluidic motion of charge. In this work, we probe graphene hydrodynamics with thermal transport and find two distinct, qualitative signatures: thermal conductivity suppression below the Wiedemann-Franz value and viscous heating leading to magnetically-induced redistribution of temperature. We find these two effects are coincident in temperature and density, providing robust qualitative signatures of hydrodynamics, despite arising from two distinct aspects of this new regime: microscopic momentum conservation due to electron-electron scattering, and geometry-dependent viscous dissipation. Our results mark the first observation of viscous electronic heating in an electron fluid, providing insight for thermal management in electronic hydrodynamic devices and offering a new methodology for identifying hydrodynamic states in other systems.</description>
