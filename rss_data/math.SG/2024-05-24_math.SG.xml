      <title>The restricted Siegel disc as coadjoint orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The restricted Siegel disc is a homogeneous space related to the connected component $T_0(1)$ of the Universal Teichm\"uller space via the period mapping. In this paper we show that it is a coadjoint orbit of the universal central extension of the restricted symplectic group or, equivalently, an affine coadjoint orbit of the restricted symplectic group with cocycle given by the Schwinger term.</description>

      <title>Integration of Hochschild cohomology, derived Picard groups and uniqueness of lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper introduces a partial integration map from the first Hochschild cohomology of any cohomologically unital A-infinity category over a field of characteristic zero to its derived Picard group. We discuss useful properties such as injectivity, naturality and the relation with the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. Based on the image of the integration map we propose a candidate for the identity component of the derived Picard group in the case of finite-dimensional graded algebras. As a first application of the integration map it is shown that the vanishing of its domain is a necessary condition for the uniqueness of lifts of equivalences from the homotopy category to the A-infinity-level. The final part contains applications to derived Picard groups of wrapped and compact Fukaya categories of cotangent bundles and their plumbings and an outlook on applications to derived Picard groups of partially wrapped Fukaya categories after Haiden-Katzarkov-Kontsevich.</description>

      <title>Norm-squared of the momentum map in infinite dimensions with applications to K\"ahler geometry and symplectic connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the norm-squared of the momentum map as a rigorous tool in infinite dimensions. In particular, we calculate the Hessian at a critical point, show that it is positive semi-definite along the complexified orbit, and determine a decomposition of the stabilizer under the complexified action. We apply these results to the action of the group of symplectomorphisms on the spaces of compatible almost complex structures and of symplectic connections. In the former case, we extend results of Calabi to not necessarily integrable almost complex structures that are extremal in a relative sense. In both cases, the momentum map is not equivariant, which gives rise to new phenomena and opens up new avenues for interesting applications. For example, using the prequantization construction, we obtain new central extensions of the group of symplectomorphisms that are encoding geometric information of the underlying finite-dimensional manifold.</description>

      <title>Floer-theoretic filtration on Painlev\'e Hitchin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify equivariant $\mathbb{C}^*$-actions on moduli spaces of Higgs bundles corresponding to the Painlev\'e equations. We deduce the Floer-theoretic filtrations on the cohomology of these spaces, introduced by Ritter and the second author in arXiv:2304.13026. Filtration is then compared with the $``P=W"$ and the filtration obtained by multiplicities of the irreducible components of the nilpotent cone, for all the 2-dimensional Higgs moduli.</description>

      <title>Equivariant formality in complex-oriented theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a product of unitary groups and let $(M,\omega)$ be a compact symplectic manifold with Hamiltonian $G$-action. We prove an equivariant formality result for any complex-oriented cohomology theory $\mathbb{E}^*$ (in particular, integral cohomology). This generalizes the celebrated result of Atiyah-Bott-Kirwan for rational cohomology from the 1980s. The proof does not use classical ideas but instead relies on a recent cohomological splitting result of Abouzaid-McLean-Smith for Hamiltonian fibrations over $\mathbb{CP}^1.$ Moreover, we establish analogues of the "localization" and "injectivity to fixed points" theorems for certain cohomology theories studied by Hopkins-Kuhn-Ravenel. As an application of these results, we establish a Goresky-Kottwitz-MacPherson theorem with Morava $K$-theory coefficients for Hamiltonian $T$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>The inverse spectral problem for quantum semitoric systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.06704v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a quantum semitoric system composed of pseudodifferential  operators, Berezin-Toeplitz operators, or a combination of both, we  obtain explicit formulas for recovering, from the semiclassical  asymptotics of the joint spectrum, all symplectic invariants of the  underlying classical semitoric system.  Our formulas are based on the possibility to obtain good quantum  numbers for joint eigenvalues from the bare data of the joint  spectrum. In the spectral region corresponding to regular values of  the momentum map, the algorithms developed by Dauge, Hall and the  second author [27] produce such  labellings. In our proof, it was crucial to extend these algorithms  to the boundary of the spectrum, which led to the new notion of  asymptotic half-lattices, and to globalize the resulting labellings.  Using the construction given by Pelayo and the second author  in [79], our results prove that semitoric systems  are completely spectrally determined in an algorithmic way~: from  the joint spectrum of a quantum semitoric system one can construct a  representative of the isomorphism class of the underlying classical  semitoric system. In particular, this recovers the uniqueness result  obtained by Pelayo and the authors  in [62,61], and completes  it with the explicit computation of all invariants, including the  twisting index.  In the cases of the spin-oscillator and the coupled angular momenta,  we implement the algorithms and illustrate numerically the  computation of the invariants from the joint spectrum.</description>
