      <title>Two-dimensional nonlinear optical response of a spiral magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical response function relevant for two-dimensional coherent nonlinear optical spectroscopy of the antiferromagnetic frustrated $J_{1}$-$J_{3}$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice within its long-range ordered, incommensurate diagonal spiral phase. We argue that in this phase effective dipole coupling to the electric field is important, with the spin-current coupling potentially being the dominant mechanism for spin-1/2. For this setting, we use linear spin wave theory to evaluate the leading nonlinear polarization response which is of second order in the driving field. We show that the response function features a strong antidiagonal, galvanoelectric feature. The width of this feature is set by relaxation rates beyond the noninteracting magnon picture, thereby providing access to single-magnon lifetimes within the multi-magnon continuum of the response function. Moreover, the response function is shown to display various structures in the two-dimensional frequency plane related to exceptional regions of the magnon dispersion.</description>

      <title>Fixed Point Stability Switches from Attractive to Repulsive at 2d Pomeranchuk/Stoner Instabilities via Field-Theoretical RG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an interacting two-flavor fermionic system via field-theoretical functional renormalization group (RG). Each flavor, labeled by $\pm$, has a dispersion of $E^{\pm}=c k^{2\alpha}-\mu^\pm$ with tunable real exponent $\alpha&gt;0$. The effective theory is parametrized by intra-flavor and inter-flavor interactions, preserving global U(1) $\times$ U(1) symmetry, which can be enhanced to U(2). The U(2) symmetric system has a Fermi liquid phase and two possible instabilities, leading to spontaneous spatial rotational or flavor symmetry breaking, known as the Pomeranchuk and Stoner instabilities, respectively. The key discovery of this work is the following. The Stoner instability possesses an RG fixed point that preserves the U(2) symmetry. For $\alpha&lt;1$, this fixed point is attractive, indicating a continuous transition. Conversely, for $\alpha&gt;1$, the fixed point becomes repulsive, and without fine-tuning, there is runaway RG flow, resulting in a discontinuous transition. The U(1) $\times$ U(1) symmetric system, with $\mu^+\neq \mu^-$, exhibits richer physics. This system have two Pomeranchuk instabilities. At one of them, a non-trivial RG fixed point switches its nature from attractive to repulsive as $\alpha$ increases across $1$. Notably, the runaway flow at $\alpha&gt;1$ results in the depletion of a Fermi surface at the transition. Collective modes in these Fermi liquids are also investigated. A universal Fermi surface deformation ratio $\delta\mu^+/\delta\mu^-$ is predicted for $\alpha&lt;1$ at the instability as a continuous transition, which can be observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Magnetic ground state of a Jeff = 1/2 based frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom, crystal electric fields, and spin correlations can lead to exotic quantum states in 4f ion-based frustrated magnets. We present the crystal structure, thermodynamic, and muon spin relaxation studies of the 4f ion-based frustrated magnet Ba4YbReWO12, wherein Yb3+ ions constitute a triangular lattice. The magnetic susceptibility does not show any signature of spin freezing down to 1.9 K or long-range magnetic ordering down to 0.4 K. The low-temperature Curie-Weiss fit to the inverse magnetic susceptibility data reveals a weak antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between the Jeff=1/2 state of the Yb3+ moments in the lowest Kramers doublet. The lowest Kramers ground state doublet is well separated from the first excited state with a gap of 278 K, as evidenced by our muon spin relaxation experiments that support the realization of the Jeff 1/2 state at low temperatures. The specific heat indicates a phase transition at 0.09 K, and the associated entropy release at low temperatures is consistent with that expected for the Jeff = 1/2 state. The zero-field muSR measurements show neither the signature of spin freezing nor a phase transition, at least down to 43 mK. Our results suggest the coexistence of static and slowly fluctuating moments in the ground state of this Jeff = 1/2 frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet. Ba4RReWO12 (R=rare earth) offers a viable platform to realize intriguing quantum states borne out of spin-orbit coupling and frustration.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitations in Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_{n}$O$_{3n+1}$ Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates observed via resonant inelastic x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic interactions are thought to play a key role in the properties of many unconventional superconductors, including cuprates, iron pnictides, and square-planar nickelates. Superconductivity was also recently observed in the bilayer and trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, whose electronic structure is expected to differ from that of cuprates and square-planar nickelates. Here we study how electronic structure and magnetic interactions evolve with the number of layers, $n$, in thin film Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates Nd$_{n+1}$Ni$_{n}$O$_{3n+1}$ with $n=1,\:3$, and 5 using resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). The RIXS spectra are consistent with a high-spin $|3d^8 \underline{L} \rangle$ electronic configuration, resembling that of La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_4$ and the parent perovskite, NdNiO$_3$. The magnetic excitations soften to lower energy in the structurally self-doped, higher-$n$ films. Our observations confirm that structural tuning is an effective route for altering electronic properties, such as magnetic superexchange, in this prominent family of materials.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh room-temperature hole conductivity in a perovskite cuprate with vanishing electron-correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-correlated two-dimensional (2D) cuprates have been extensively studied since the discovery of high-Tc superconductivity, in contrast, the three-dimensional (3D) counterpart perovskite cuprates remain largely unexplored due to their chemical instability and synthesis challenges. Herein, we develop an efficient two-step approach that combines symmetry-selective growth and topotactic oxidization to synthesize high-quality perovskite LaCuO3 films, and furthermore reveal its exotic electronic states. The compressively strained LaCuO3 films exhibit an unexpected ultrahigh p-type conductivity of ~1.5*10^5 S/cm with a hole mobility of ~30 cm2 V-1 s-1 at room-temperature. X-ray absorption spectra and first-principles calculations unveil a ligand-hole state of p-d hybridization with degenerate eg orbitals and light effective mass, indicating nearly-vanishing electron-correlation. These features contrast sharply with 2D cuprates and offer physical insights into the design of high-performance electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Phase Diagram and Hamiltonian of $S=1/2$ Kagome Antiferromagnets: Bridging Theory and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-$1/2$ kagome antiferromagnets are leading candidates for realizing quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground states. While QSL ground states are predicted for the pure Heisenberg model, understanding the robustness of the QSL to additional interactions that may be present in real materials is a forefront question in the field. Here we employ large-scale density-matrix renormalization group simulations to investigate the effects of next-nearest neighbor exchange couplings $J_2$ and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions $D$, which are relevant to understanding the prototypical kagome materials herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite. By utilizing clusters as large as XC12 and extrapolating the results to the thermodynamic limit, we precisely delineate the scope of the QSL phase, which remains robust across an expanded parameter range of $J_2$ and $D$. Direct comparison of the simulated static and dynamic spin structure factors with inelastic neutron scattering reveals the parameter space of the Hamiltonians for herbertsmithite and Zn-barlowite, and, importantly, provides compelling evidence that both materials exist within the QSL phase. These results establish a powerful convergence of theory and experiment in this most elusive state of matter.</description>

      <title>Tuning chirality amplitude at ultrafast timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality is a fundamental symmetry concept describing discrete states, i.e., left-handed, right-handed, or achiral, and existing at disparate scales and in many categories of scientific fields. Even though symmetry breaking is indispensable for describing qualitatively distinct phenomena, symmetry cannot quantitatively predict measurable quantities. One can continuously distort an object, introducing the concept of chirality amplitude, similar to representing magnetization as the amplitude of time-reversal symmetry breaking. Considering the role of magnetization in emergent phenomena with time-reversal symmetry breaking, chirality amplitude is intuitively a key quantity for controlling chirality-related emergent phenomena. Here, we propose two types of chiral lattice distortions and demonstrate the tunability of their amplitude in ultrafast timescales. Resonant X-ray diffraction with circular polarization is an established technique to measure crystal chirality directly. We quantify the ultrafast change in chirality amplitude in real time after an optical excitation. Using instead a THz excitation, we observe oscillations in the resonant diffraction intensities corresponding to specific phonon frequencies. This indicates the creation of additional asymmetry, which could also be described as an enhancement in chirality amplitude. Our proposed concept of chirality amplitude and its ultrafast control may lead to a unique approach to control chirality-induced emergent phenomena in ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Magnetic polarons at finite temperature: One-hole spectroscopy study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated fermions described by Hubbard or $t$-$J$ models in the underdoped regime -- relevant for high-temperature superconductivity in cuprate compounds -- remains a subject of ongoing debate. In particular, the nature of charge carriers in this regime is poorly understood, in part due to the unusual properties of their spectral function. In this Letter, we present unbiased numerical results for the one-hole spectral function in a $t$-$J$ model at finite temperatures. Our study provides valuable insights into the underlying physics of magnetic (or spin-) polaron formation in a doped antiferromagnet (AFM). For example, we find how the suppression of spectral weight outside the magnetic Brillouin zone -- a precursor of Fermi arc formation -- disappears with increasing temperature, revealing nearly-deconfined spinon excitations of the undoped AFM. The pristine setting we consider can be directly explored using quantum simulators. Our calculations demonstrate that coherent quasiparticle peaks associated with magnetic polarons can be observed up to temperatures $T&gt;J$ above the spin-exchange $J$, routinely obtained in such experiments. This paves the way for future studies of the fate of magnetic polarons in the pseudogap phase.</description>

      <title>Interference-caged quantum many-body scars: the Fock space topological localization and interference zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general mechanism for realizing athermal finite-energy-density eigenstates -- termed interference-caged quantum many-body scars (ICQMBS) -- which originate from exact many-body destructive interference on the Fock space graph. These eigenstates are strictly localized to specific subsets of vertices, analogous to compact localized states in flat-band systems. Central to our framework is a connection between interference zeros and graph automorphisms, which classify vertices according to the graph's local topology. This connection enables the construction of a new class of topological ICQMBS, whose robustness arises from the local topology of the Fock space graph rather than from conventional conservation laws or dynamical constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by developing a graph-theory-based search algorithm, which identifies ICQMBS in both a one-dimensional spin-1 XY model and two-dimensional quantum link models across distinct gauge sectors. In particular, we discover the proposed topological ICQMBS in the two-dimensional quantum link model and provide an intuitive explanation for previously observed order-by-disorder phenomena in Hilbert space. Our results reveal an unexpected synergy between graph theory, flat-band physics, and quantum many-body dynamics, offering new insights into the structure and stability of nonthermal eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Short-range magnetic order and planar anisotropy in the topological ferrimagnet Mn3Si2Te6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mn3Si2Te6 is a ferrimagnetic topological nodal-line semiconductor that exhibits unconventional colossal magnetoresitance (CMR) behavior, with short-range spin fluctuations being potentially intimately linked to the emergent properties. In this work, we determine the short range magnetic order and quantify the local magnetic anisotropy through total neutron scattering and polarized neutron powder diffraction (pNPD) measurements on polycrystalline Mn3Si2Te6. The real space local and long range spin structure was determined through the application of magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) analysis, with measurements from the low temperature ordered phase to the high temperature paramagnetic state. Short-range order over a frustrated trimer of three nearest neighbors was found to exist well above the long range ferrimagnetic transition. pNPD measurements in the spin polarized paramagnetic state were used to extract the local site susceptibility tensor of the Mn ions to quantify the magnetic anisotropy. Our combined mPDF and pNPD results provide quantitative information on the short-range order intrinsic to Mn3Si2Te6, showing strong in-plane anisotropy with the spins largely confined to the ab-plane in zero field and remain stable with increasing temperature through the long-range to short-range ordered transition.</description>

      <title>Phonon fluctuation diagnostics: Origin of charge order in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ kagome metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microsopic origin of the charge-density wave (CDW) in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs) kagome metals remains a longstanding question, often revolving around electron-phonon coupling and purely electronic mechanisms involving Van Hove scenarios, nesting, and sublattice interference. To reveal the processes driving the CDW transition, we combine ab-initio calculations analysis of the phonon self-energy and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Our momentum-resolved study, supported by ARPES data, reveals that lattice instabilities in the V-135 family of kagome metals appear to also be driven by electronic states far from high-symmetry points, where these states exhibit the strongest coupling with the phonon modes responsible for the CDW distortion. Footing on an interpretation scheme based on phonon fluctuation diagnostics, our work challenges and revises theories that so far have exclusively attributed CDW formation to nesting effects close to the Fermi level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the second-order correction to the electronic dispersion relation of a free electron gas interacting with an effective electron-dislocation potential, derived from a modern quantized theory of dislocations. Our results demonstrate that dislocation patterning induces anisotropic flat bands in the electronic dispersion under specific strain fields and directions, referred to as ``magic'' parameters. These flat bands acquire non-zero curvature as the strain or direction deviates from these magic parameters.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern Insulator and Quantum Anomalous Hall Crystal in Twisted MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental advances have uncovered fractional Chern insulators in twisted MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) systems, posing significant theoretical challenges in understanding the interaction effects and correlated topological phases. Here, we construct a realistic moir\'e lattice model tailored for tMoTe$_2$ and conduct investigations using state-of-the-art tensor-network methods. Our ground-state calculations reveal a rich array of interaction- and filling-dependent phases, including the FCI, Chern insulator, and generalized Wigner crystal, etc., explaining recent experimental observations. Moreover, we reveal quantum anomalous Hall crystals exhibiting integer Hall conductivity at fractional moir\'e unit cell fillings, which opens new avenues for experimental exploration in tMoTe$_2$. In the FCI phase, dynamical simulations reveal a single-particle continuum with a finite charge gap, indicating the presence of fractional charge excitations. Moreover, our finite-temperature calculations determine the characteristic temperatures for charge activation and ferromagnetic (FM) transitions, consistent with experiments. We find that the charge gap is significantly larger than the energy scales of both thermal activation and FM transitions, explaining recent experimental observations. Overall, by integrating ground-state, finite-temperature, and dynamical tensor-network calculations on the real-space model, we establish a theoretical framework for understanding and exploring correlated topological phases in tMoTe$_2$ and related systems.</description>

Abstract: Electronic properties of solids are often well understood via the low energy dispersion of Bloch bands, motivating single band approximations in many metals and semiconductors. However, a closer look reveals new length and time scales introduced by quantum dipole fluctuations due to interband mixing, which are reflected in the momentum space textures of the electronic wavefunctions. This structure is usually referred to as quantum geometry. The scales introduced by geometry not only qualitatively modify the linear and nonlinear responses of a material but can also have a vital role in determining the many-body ground state. This review explores how quantum geometry impacts properties of materials and outlines recent experimental advances that have begun to explore quantum geometric effects in various condensed matter platforms. We discuss the separation of scales that can allow us to estimate the significance of quantum geometry in various response functions.</description>

      <title>Efficient mutual magic and magic capacity with matrix product states</title>

Abstract: Stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs) probe the non-stabilizerness (or magic) of many-body systems and quantum computers. Here, we introduce the mutual von-Neumann SRE and magic capacity, which can be efficiently computed in time $O(N\chi^3)$ for matrix product states (MPSs) of bond dimension $\chi$. We find that mutual SRE characterizes the critical point of ground states of the transverse-field Ising model, independently of the chosen local basis. Then, we relate the magic capacity to the anti-flatness of the Pauli spectrum, which quantifies the complexity of computing SREs. The magic capacity characterizes transitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness of Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally, we make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo algorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation methods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory, which we demonstrate for $24$ qubits. Our work uncovers improved approaches to study the complexity of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced selectivity of angular momentum by orbital Edelstein effect in carbon nanotubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising materials exhibiting exceptional strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal properties, making them promising for various technologies. Besides achiral configurations with a zigzag or armchair edge, there exist chiral CNTs with a broken inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that chiral CNTs exhibit chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS), which is caused by the orbital Edelstein effect and could be detected as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that the orbital Edelstein susceptibility is an odd function of the chirality angle of the nanotube and is proportional to its radius. For metallic CNTs close to the Fermi level, the orbital Edelstein susceptibility increases quadratically with energy. This makes the CISS and CIOS of metallic chiral nanotubes conveniently tunable by doping or applying a gate voltage, which allows for the generation of spin- and orbital-polarized currents. The possibility of generating large torques makes chiral CNTs interesting candidates for technological applications in spin-orbitronics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature real-time properties of magnetic polarons in two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to significant progress in quantum gas microscopy in recent years, there is a rapidly growing interest in real-space properties of single mobile dopands created in correlated antiferromagnetic (AFM) Mott insulators. However, a detailed numerical description remains challenging, even for simple toy models. As a consequence, previous numerical simulations for large systems were largely limited to $T=0$. To provide guidance for cold-atom experiments, numerical calculations at finite temperature are required. Here, we numerically study the real-time properties of a single mobile hole in the 2D $t$-$J$ model at finite temperature and draw a comparison to features observed at $T=0$. We find that a three-stage process of hole motion, which was reported at $T=0$, is valid even at finite temperature. However, already at low temperatures, the average hole velocity at long times is not simply proportional to the spin coupling, contrary to the $T=0$ behavior. Comparing our finite-temperature numerical results with the experimental data from quantum gas microscopy we find a qualitative disagreement: in experiment, hole spreading speeds up with increasing $J/t$, while in our numerics it slows down. The latter is consistent with the numerical findings previously reported at $T=0$.</description>

      <title>Transformer Wave Function for two dimensional frustrated magnets: emergence of a Spin-Liquid Phase in the Shastry-Sutherland Model</title>

Abstract: Understanding quantum magnetism in two-dimensional systems represents a lively branch in modern condensed-matter physics. In the presence of competing super-exchange couplings, magnetic order is frustrated and can be suppressed down to zero temperature. Still, capturing the correct nature of the exact ground state is a highly complicated task, since energy gaps in the spectrum may be very small and states with different physical properties may have competing energies. Here, we introduce a variational Ansatz for two-dimensional frustrated magnets by leveraging the power of representation learning. The key idea is to use a particular deep neural network with real-valued parameters, a so-called Transformer, to map physical spin configurations into a high-dimensional feature space. Within this abstract space, the determination of the ground-state properties is simplified and requires only a shallow output layer with complex-valued parameters. We illustrate the efficacy of this variational Ansatz by studying the ground-state phase diagram of the Shastry-Sutherland model, which captures the low-temperature behavior of SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ with its intriguing properties. With highly accurate numerical simulations, we provide strong evidence for the stabilization of a spin-liquid between the plaquette and antiferromagnetic phases. In addition, a direct calculation of the triplet excitation at the $\Gamma$ point provides compelling evidence for a gapless spin liquid. Our findings underscore the potential of Neural-Network Quantum States as a valuable tool for probing uncharted phases of matter, and open up new possibilities for establishing the properties of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-orbital two-particle self-consistent approach -- strengths and limitations</title>

Abstract: Extending many-body numerical techniques which are powerful in the context of simple model calculations to the realm of realistic material simulations can be a challenging task. Realistic systems often involve multiple active orbitals, which increases the complexity and numerical cost because of the large local Hilbert space and the large number of interaction terms or sign-changing off-diagonal Green's functions. The two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC) is one such many-body numerical technique, for which multi-orbital extensions have proven to be involved due to the substantially more complex structure of the local interaction tensor. In this paper we extend earlier multi-orbital generalizations of TPSC by setting up two different variants of a fully self-consistent theory for TPSC in multi-orbital systems. We first investigate the strengths and limitations of the approach analytically and then benchmark both variants against dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and D-TRILEX results. We find that the exact behavior of the system can be faithfully reproduced in the weak-coupling regime, while at stronger couplings the performance of the two TPSC variants strongly depends on details of the system.</description>

      <title>Contrasting dynamical properties of single-Q and triple-Q magnetic orderings in a triangular lattice antiferromagnet</title>

Abstract: Multi-Q magnetic structures on triangular lattices, with their two-dimensional topological spin texture, have attracted significant interest. However, unambiguously confirming their formation by excluding the presence of three equally-populated single-Q domains remains challenging. In the metallic triangular lattice antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2, two magnetic ground states have been suggested at different temperature ranges, with the low-temperature phase being a triple-Q structure corresponding to the highest-density Skyrmion lattice. Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and advanced spin dynamics simulations, we demonstrate a clear distinction in the excitation spectra between the single-Q and triple-Q phases of Co1/3TaS2 and, more generally, a triangular lattice. First, we refined the spin Hamiltonian by fitting the excitation spectra measured in its paramagnetic phase, allowing us to develop an unbiased model independent of magnetic ordering. Second, we observed that the two magnetically ordered phases in Co1/3TaS2 exhibit markedly different behaviors in their long-wavelength Goldstone modes. Our spin model, derived from the paramagnetic phase, confirms that these behaviors originate from the single-Q and triple-Q nature of the respective ordered phases, providing unequivocal evidence of the single-Q to triple-Q phase transition in Co1/3TaS2. Importantly, we propose that the observed contrast in the long-wavelength spin dynamics between the single-Q and triple-Q orderings is universal, offering a potentially unique way to distinguish a generic triple-Q ordering on a triangular lattice from its multi-domain single-Q counterparts. We describe its applicability with examples of similar hexagonal systems forming potential triple-Q orderings. (For the full abstract, please refer to the manuscript)</description>

      <title>Two-particle calculations with quantics tensor trains: Solving the parquet equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first application of quantics tensor trains (QTTs) and tensor cross interpolation (TCI) to the solution of a full set of self-consistent equations for multivariate functions, the so-called parquet equations. We show that the steps needed to evaluate the equations (Bethe--Salpeter equations, parquet equation and Schwinger--Dyson equation) can be decomposed into basic operations on the QTT-TCI (QTCI) compressed objects. The repeated application of these operations does not lead to a loss of accuracy beyond a specified tolerance and the iterative scheme converges even for numerically demanding parameters. As examples we take the Hubbard model in the atomic limit and the single impurity Anderson model, where the basic objects in parquet equations, the two-particle vertices, depend on three frequencies, but not on momenta. The results show that this approach is able to overcome major computational bottlenecks of standard numerical methods. The applied methods allow for an exponential increase of the number of grid points included in the calculations leading to an exponentially improving computational error for a linear increase in computational cost.</description>

      <title>Local structural distortions drive magnetic molecular field in compositionally complex spinel oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01156v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how local distortions determine the functional properties of high entropy materials, containing five or more elements at a crystallographic site, is an open challenge. We address this for a compositionally complex spinel oxide (Mn$_{0.2}$Co$_{0.2}$Ni$_{0.2}$Cu$_{0.2}$Zn$_{0.2}$)Cr$_2$O$_4$ ($A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$). By comparatively examining extended X-ray absorption fine structure on $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$ and its parent counterparts $A$Cr$_2$O$_4$ along with density functional theory calculations for multiple configurations, we find that the element-specific distortions go beyond the first neighbor. Specifically, the strong Jahn-Teller distortion present in CuCr$_2$O$_4$ is found to be completely suppressed in $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$. Instead, there is a broad distribution of Cu-O and Cu-Cr bond distances while other $A$-O distances acquire certain specific values. This study demonstrates the additional flexibility of a cationic sublattice in maintaining a uniform long-range structure, in contrast to previous reports showing only the accommodative anionic sublattice. Remarkably, despite the presence of multiple magnetic ions and variable bond lengths, the mean field magnetic interactions of $A^5$Cr$_2$O$_4$ exhibit a striking resemblance to those of NiCr$_2$O$_4$. This compelling observation originates from the comparability of bond lengths around Cr in both materials. Our study paves the way for a deeper understanding of the impact of local structural distortions in compositionally complex quantum materials, enabling the targeted design with tailored properties.</description>
