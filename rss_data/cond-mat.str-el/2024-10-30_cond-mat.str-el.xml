      <title>Tuning magnetic interactions with nonequilibrium optical phonon populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how light-driven optical phonons can be used to drive magnetic exchange interactions into interesting physical regimes by developing a general theory of spin-phonon pumping in magnetic insulators with non-equilibrium optical phonon distributions, focusing on the diabatic regime where phonon frequencies are much larger than the magnetic interactions. We present several applications of spin-phonon pumping two-dimensional nearest-neighbor Heisenberg, XYZ and Kitaev models to examine what kind of further neighbor interactions and chiral fields can be generated, and how anisotropic couplings can be enhanced, showing that experimentally accessible non-equilibrium phonon distributions can generically drive significant frustration and realize a variety of spin liquid regimes. This effect is described for both direct and superexchange mechanisms, and we derive simple geometric rules for which phonon modes are "spin-phonon'' active and for which magnetic interactions. Spin-phonon pumping provides an intriguing possibility for preferentially pumping specific magnetic interaction terms. In addition to generating further neighbor interactions, such pumping can lead to increased magnetic anisotropy for initially weakly anisotropic models, and selectively pumping the Kitaev-Heisenberg model can suppress undesirable Heisenberg terms while enhancing Kitaev interactions.</description>

      <title>Inverse Faraday effect in disordered two-dimensional electronic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I formulate a theory of the inverse Faraday effect in impure two-dimensional metallic system with lifted spin degeneracy induced by Rashba spin-orbit coupling. Using the formalism of non-equilibrium quantum field theory, the static contributions to the current density up to the second order in powers of external electromagnetic field are evaluated. For circularly polarized light one of the contributions describes the emergence of static magnetization. It is shown that the direction of induced magnetization may change depending on the frequency of the external radiation and disorder scattering rate. I also find that at large frequencies the leading contribution to the induced magnetization is proportional to the square of spin-orbit interaction and is inversely proportional to the fifth power of the frequency of an external electromagnetic wave.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry dynamics on Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacetime supersymmetry (SUSY) that interchanges fermions and bosons is of great theoretical importance but has not yet been revealed experimentally in particle physics. It has also been desired to explore quantum-mechanical SUSY in microscopic lattice models. Inspired by the recent experiments of Floquet engineering of Rydberg atom arrays, we find that quantum mechanical SUSY can be realized in Floquet Rydberg atom arrays. Moreover, we utilize the supercharge dynamics to demonstrate the SUSY property of the model under investigation: the expectation value of supercharge freezes under time evolution for supersymmetric lattice models in contrast to the trivial oscillation for generic nonsupersymmetric lattice models. The proposal is validated on direct simulation of Rydberg atom arrays' dynamics and ready for experiments. This work sheds light on the future experimental exploration of SUSY with the help of Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Low-energy edge signatures of the Kitaev spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental work indicates that the Kitaev spin liquid may be realizable close to zero magnetic field in exfoliated $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ flakes, thus providing a more versatile setting for studying non-Abelian anyons. Here, we propose a robust nanoscale signature of the Kitaev spin liquid that results from its edge states and manifests in the low-energy spin dynamics. In particular, we highlight a singular peak in the dynamical spin structure factor of a zigzag edge whose energy scales linearly with only one component of the magnetic field. This sharp feature in the local spin dynamics directly reflects the bond-directional Kitaev spin interactions and, more generally, the projective symmetries of the Kitaev spin liquid. We demonstrate that our proposed signature survives in the presence of edge disorder as well as non-Kitaev interactions, and provide detailed guidelines for experimentally observing it using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy and color-center relaxometry.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Roadmap to a Yao-Lee Spin-Orbital Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exactly solvable spin-1/2 Kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice has drawn significant interest, as it offers a pathway to realizing the long-sought after quantum spin liquid. Building upon the Kitaev model, Yao and Lee introduced another exactly solvable model on an unusual star lattice featuring non-abelian spinons. The additional pseudospin degrees of freedom in this model could provide greater stability against perturbations, making this model appealing. However, a mechanism to realize such an interaction in a standard honeycomb lattice remains unknown. Here we provide a microscopic theory to obtain the Yao-Lee model on a honeycomb lattice by utilizing strong spin-orbit coupling of anions edge-shared between two $e_g$ ions in the exchange processes. This mechanism leads to the desired bond-dependent interaction among spins rather than orbitals, unique to our model, implying that the orbitals fractionalize into gapless Majorana fermions and fermionic octupolar excitations emerge. Since the conventional Kugel-Khomskii interaction also appears, we examine the phase diagram including these interactions using classical Monte Carlo simulations and exact diagonalization techniques. Our findings reveal a broad region of disordered states that break rotational symmetry in the bond energy, suggesting intriguing behavior reminiscent of a spin-orbital liquid.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear photoconductivity in pump-probe spectroscopy. I. Optical coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the optical pump-probe reflection and transmission coefficients when the photoinduced response depends nonlinearly on the incident pump intensity. Under these conditions, we expect the photoconductivity depth profile to change shape as a function of the incident fluence, unlike the case when the photoinduced response is linear in the incident intensity. We consider common optical nonlinearities, including photoconductivity saturation and two-photon absorption, and we derive analytic expressions for the photoconductivity depth profile when one or more is present. We review the theory of the electromagnetic transmission and reflection coefficients in a stratified medium, and we derive general expressions for these coefficients for a medium with an arbitrary photoconductivity depth profile. For several photoconductivity profiles of importance in pump-probe spectroscopy, we show that the wave equation can be transformed into one of three standard differential equations$\unicode{x2014}$the Bessel equation, the hypergeometric equation, and the Heun equation$\unicode{x2014}$with analytic solutions in terms of their associated special functions. From these solutions, we derive exact analytic expressions for the optical coefficients in terms of the photoconductivity at the optical interface, and we discuss their limiting forms in various physical limits. Our results provide a systematic guide for analyzing pump-probe measurements over a wide range of pump intensities, and establishes a framework for constraining the systematic uncertainty associated with nonlinear photoconductivity profile distortion.</description>

      <title>Cavity Spectroscopy for Strongly Correlated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding materials in optical cavities has emerged as an intriguing perspective for controlling quantum materials, but a key challenge lies in measuring properties of the embedded matter. Here, we propose a framework for probing strongly correlated cavity-embedded materials through direct measurements of cavity photons. We derive general relations between photon and matter observables inside the cavity, and show how these can be measured via the emitted photons. As an example, we demonstrate how the entanglement phase transition of an embedded H$_2$ molecule can be accessed by measuring the cavity photon occupation, and showcase how dynamical spin correlation functions can be accessed by measuring dynamical photon correlation functions. Our framework provides an all-optical method to measure static and dynamic properties of cavity-embedded materials.</description>

      <title>Unusual spin dynamics in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FeGa2S4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin dynamics in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FeGa$_2$S$_4$ with triangular lattices are investigated using magnetometry, neutron scattering, and muon spin relaxation measurements. The characteristic spin relaxation time is thoroughly clarified over thirteen orders of magnitude. Although the temperature dependence of DC and AC susceptibilities recalls a conventional spin-glass transition, nonlinear susceptibilities showing no divergences at the anomalous temperature, $T^{\ast}=16.87(7)$~K, deny that and instead hint at other mechanisms. Elastic neutron scattering together with previously measured muon results depict a slowly fluctuated ($\sim 10^{-5}$~sec) spin state above $T^{\ast}$. In juxtaposing the underlying simplest structure among frustrated magnets with an intricate hierarchy of time scales, FeGa$_2$S$_4$ can be a playground for studying temporal spin correlations in the two-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>High Field Superconducting Phases of Ultra Clean Single Crystal UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the magnetoresistance of high-quality single crystals of UTe2 with Tc=2.1K in high magnetic fields up to 36T, with the field direction between the b and c-axes. From the angular dependence of the upper critical field Hc2, we found that the field-reentrant superconducting phase near H // b-axis extends up to a field angle (24 deg) from the b to c-axis, where another field-reentrant superconducting phase begins to appear above the metamagnetic transition field, Hm. Our results suggest that the field-reentrant superconductivity below Hm near the b-axis is closely related to the superconductivity above Hm when the field is tilted toward the c-axis. Superconductivity appears to be robust when the field direction is maintained perpendicular to the magnetization easy axis, implying that fluctuations boosting superconductivity may persist. At first glance, these findings resemble the field-reentrant (reinforced) superconductivity observed in ferromagnetic superconductors URhGe and UCoGe, where Ising-type ferromagnetic fluctuations play a crucial role. However, in UTe2, the fluctuations are more complex. The angular dependence of the upper critical field Hc2 contrasts with that of the initial slope of Hc2 near Tc, revealing the anisotropic field response of fluctuations. Thanks to the high-quality samples, quantum oscillations were detected for field directions close to the c-axis using magnetoresistance (Shubnikov-de Haas effect) and torque (de Haas-van Alphen effect) measurements. The angular dependence of frequencies is in good agreement with those observed previously using the field-modulation technique, confirming quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <title>Emergent cross-product-type spin-orbit coupling under ferroaxial ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A ferroic alignment of a time-reversal-even axial vector, which is called the ferroaxial ordered state, is identified by the spontaneous rotational distortion of the lattice structure to break the vertical mirror symmetry. We theoretically investigate what happens in the electronic structure once the ferroaxial ordering occurs by analyzing a tetragonal d-p cluster model with transition metal oxide in mind. By adopting the symmetry-adapted multipole representation, we elucidate the emergent cross-product form of the spin-orbit coupling by the interplay between the atomic spin-orbit coupling and the d-p hybridization according to the vertical mirror symmetry breaking, which corresponds to the electronic order parameter of the ferroaxial ordering.</description>

      <title>Valence Bond Crystal Ground State of the 1/9 Magnetization Plateau in the Spin-1/2 Kagome Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground state of a spin-1/2 kagome antiferromagnet at the 1/9 magnetization plateau, focusing primarily on six types of valence bond crystal (VBC) distortions. Among six types of VBC distortions, type 1 consistently exhibits the lowest ground-state energy. Analysis of the second derivative of the energy with respect to the distortion strength $J_{\rm d}$ using exact diagonalization reveals that, as the system size approaches the thermodynamic limit, the type 1 VBC state remains stable down to $J_{\rm d} = 1$, corresponding to the undistorted kagome lattice. Perturbation theory further supports the stability of the type 1 VBC state, providing energy values that agree with exact diagonalization results within 3%. We also explore the possibility that other types of VBC distortions could become the ground state, but type 1 VBC still exhibited the lowest energy. These findings suggest that the ground state of the 1/9 plateau in the kagome lattice is the type 1 VBC state.</description>

      <title>Probing chiral symmetry with a topological domain wall sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry is a fundamental property with profound implications for the properties of elementary particles, that implies a spectral symmetry (i.e. E =&gt; -E ) in their dispersion relation. In condensed matter physics, chiral symmetry is frequently associated with superconductors or materials hosting Dirac fermions such as graphene or topological insulators. There, chiral symmetry is an emergent low-energy property, accompanied by an emergent spectral symmetry. While the chiral symmetry can be broken by crystal distortion or external perturbations, the spectral symmetry frequently survives. As the presence of spectral symmetry does not necessarily imply chiral symmetry, the question arises how these two properties can be experimentally differentiated. Here, we demonstrate how a system with preserved spectral symmetry can reveal underlying broken chiral symmetry using topological defects. Our study shows that these defects induce a spectral imbalance in the Landau level spectrum, providing direct evidence of symmetry alteration at topological domain walls. Using high-resolution STM/STS we demonstrate the intricate interplay between chiral and translational symmetry which is broken at step edges in topological crystalline insulator Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Se. The chiral symmetry breaking leads to a shift in the guiding center coordinates of the Landau orbitals near the step edge, thus resulting in a distinct chiral flow of the spectral density of Landau levels. This study underscores the pivotal role of topological defects as sensitive probes for detecting hidden symmetries, offering profound insights into emergent phenomena with implications for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Optical signatures of dynamical excitonic condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study dynamical excitonic condensates occurring in bilayers with an imposed chemical potential difference and in photodoped semiconductors. We show that optical spectroscopy can experimentally identify phase-trapped and phase-delocalized dynamical regimes of condensation. In the weak-bias regime, the trapped dynamics of the order parameter's phase lead to an in-gap absorption line at a frequency almost independent of the bias voltage, while for larger biases, the frequency of the spectral feature increases approximately linearly with bias. In both cases there is a pronounced second harmonic response. Close to the transition between the trapped and freely oscillating states, we find a strong response upon application of a weak electric probe field and compare the results to those found in a minimal model description for the dynamics of the order parameter's phase and analyze the limitations of the latter.</description>

      <title>The Weyl-Mott point: an isolated topological Green's function zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze a model in which a Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction is added to a system of fermions with a Weyl point in their non-interacting dispersion relation. We show that the interacting model exhibits a Weyl-Mott point, at which a single isolated Green's function zero is found for a wide range of interaction strengths. We show that such Weyl-Mott points imply an emergent non-Fermi-liquid state for the metallic regime and a gapped topological state for the insulating one. Furthermore, their presence is linked to a topological charge inherited from the original Green's function pole at the Weyl point. A Weyl-Mott point is therefore naturally associated with a strongly-correlated chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Boosting Universal Magnetocaloric Effect with Quantum Supercritical Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across finite temperatures and fields, a quantum critical point (QCP) can extend to a quantum critical regime (QCR), characterized by prominent quantum fluctuations and universal scalings. The QCR is essential for comprehending many-body systems and correlated quantum materials, attracting intensive research interest over the past decades. Amongst other intriguing phenomena in QCR, the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) exhibits a universally diverging magnetic Gr\"uneisen ratio, providing a highly sensitive indicator of the QCP. In this study, we identify a distinct quantum supercritical regime (QSR) that also originates from the QCP but is driven by a symmetry-breaking field $h$, which couples to the order parameter. The QSR has crossover lines following $T \propto h^{\frac{z\nu}{\beta+\gamma}}$, distinct from the renowned QCR crossovers $T \propto (g-g_c)^{z\nu} $, where $\beta, \gamma, z, \nu$ are the critical exponents. The field $g$ controls quantum fluctuations and $g_c$ is the critical value. Remarkably, in QSR we find the Gr\"uneisen ratio follows $\Gamma_h \equiv \frac{1}{T} (\frac{\partial T}{\partial h})_{S} \propto T^{-\frac{\beta+\gamma}{z\nu}}$, which is a universal boost in MCE as compared to $\Gamma_g \equiv \frac{1}{T} (\frac{\partial T}{\partial g})_{S} \propto T^{-\frac{1}{z\nu}}$ in QCR. For typical $\beta + \gamma &gt; 1$, $\Gamma_h \propto (\Gamma_g)^{\beta + \gamma}$ can lead to an increase by order of magnitude. Experimental realization involving quantum Ising and Heisenberg magnets is discussed. These systems offer an ideal platform for investigating quantum supercriticality and also hold significant potential as advanced magnetic refrigerants.</description>

      <title>Effective tight-binding models in optical moir\'e potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A twist between two systems offers the possibility to drastically change the underlying physical properties. To that end, we study the bandstructure of twisted moir\'e potentials in detail. At sets of commensurate twisting angles, the low energy single-particle spectrum of a twisted moir\'e potential will form into distinct bands and gaps. To a first approximation, energy bands can be qualitatively modelled by harmonic states, localised in different potential minima. The bands are intrinsically linked to the number of distinct minima and size of the moir\'e unit cell, with smaller cells producing larger gaps and vice versa. For shallower potential depths, degeneracies between harmonic states are lifted by virtue of anharmonic confinement and coupling between states. Depending on the exact geometry of potential minima, bands can then be classified by $4$ unique forms of tight-binding models. We find excellent agreement between the continuous spectrum and fitting to our tight-binding models, allowing for accurate tunnelling rates and onsite energies to be extracted. Our results are directly relevant to the bosonic, many-body problem, and thus provide further understanding on the relative stability of quantum phases both in theory and experiments. In particular, the prominence of gaps can be mapped to strongly correlated insulating phases. Furthermore, tunnelling rates of different bands serve as thresholds on temperature in which a phase can be either a normal fluid or superfluid.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Non-Abelian Topological Order against Heralded Noise via Local Lindbladian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important open question for the current generation of highly controllable quantum devices is understanding which phases can be realized as stable steady-states under local quantum dynamics. In this work, we show how robust steady-state phases with both Abelian and non-Abelian mixed-state topological order can be stabilized against generic ``heralded" noise using active dynamics that incorporate measurement and feedback, modeled as a $\textit{fully local}$ Lindblad master equation. These topologically ordered steady states are two-way connected to pure topologically ordered ground states using local quantum channels, and preserve quantum information for a time that is exponentially large in the system size. Specifically, we present explicit constructions of families of local Lindbladians for both Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_2$) and non-Abelian ($D_4$) topological order whose steady-states host mixed-state topological order when the noise is below a threshold strength. As the noise strength is increased, these models exhibit first-order transitions to intermediate mixed state phases where they encode robust classical memories, followed by (first-order) transitions to a trivial steady state at high noise rates. When the noise is imperfectly heralded, steady-state order disappears but our active dynamics significantly enhances the lifetime of the encoded logical information. To carry out the numerical simulations for the non-Abelian $D_4$ case, we introduce a generalized stabilizer tableau formalism that permits efficient simulation of the non-Abelian Lindbladian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Harnessing spin-qubit decoherence to probe strongly-interacting quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting information from quantum many-body systems remains a key challenge in quantum technologies due to experimental limitations. In this work, we employ a single spin qubit to probe a strongly interacting system, creating an environment conducive to qubit decoherence. By focusing on the XXZ spin chain, we observe diverse dynamics in the qubit evolution, reflecting different parameters of the chain. This demonstrates that a spin qubit can probe both quantitative properties of the spin chain and qualitative characteristics, such as the bipartite entanglement entropy, phase transitions, and perturbation propagation velocity within the system. This approach reveals the power of small quantum systems to probe the properties of large, strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Sub-Moir\'e Potential Landscape using an Atomic Single Electron Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons in solids owe their properties to the periodic potential landscapes they experience. The advent of moir\'e lattices has revolutionized our ability to engineer such landscapes on nanometer scales, leading to numerous groundbreaking discoveries. Despite this progress, direct imaging of these electrostatic potential landscapes remains elusive. In this work, we introduce the Atomic Single Electron Transistor (SET), a novel scanning probe utilizing a single atomic defect in a van der Waals (vdW) material, which serves as an ultrasensitive, high-resolution potential imaging sensor. Built upon the quantum twisting microscope (QTM) platform, this probe leverages the QTM's distinctive capability to form a pristine, scannable 2D interface between vdW heterostructures. Using the Atomic SET, we present the first direct images of the electrostatic potential in one of the most canonical moir\'e interfaces: graphene aligned to hexagonal boron nitride. Our results reveal that this potential exhibits an approximate C6 symmetry, has minimal dependence on the carrier density, and has a substantial magnitude of ~60 mV even in the absence of carriers. Theoretically, the observed symmetry can only be explained by a delicate interplay of physical mechanisms with competing symmetries. Intriguingly, the magnitude of the measured potential significantly exceeds theoretical predictions, suggesting that current understanding may be incomplete. With a spatial resolution of 1 nm and a sensitivity to detect the potential of even a few millionths of an electron charge, the Atomic SET opens the door for ultrasensitive imaging of charge order and thermodynamic properties for a range of quantum phenomena, including various symmetry-broken phases, quantum crystals, vortex charges, and fractionalized quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations, layer distinction, and electron doping in the alternating single-layer trilayer La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ polymorph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory framework to investigate the correlated electronic structure of the alternating single-layer trilayer (1313) polymorph of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure. At ambient pressure, the single-layer is in a Mott insulating regime and the low-energy physics is dominated by the trilayer block. Under pressure, the gap in the single-layer block closes due to orbital-selective physics, enabling charge transfer into the trilayer block. This change in effective doping of the trilayer block is likely linked to the higher T$_c$ obtained in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-1313 ($\sim$ 80 K) when compared to the nominal trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ ($\sim$ 30 K). We conclude that correlation-driven layer differentiation is crucial in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-1313 polymorph and that its low-energy physics aligns closely with the trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ compound (in spite of the apparent differences in nominal filling) rather than with the conventional bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Strong enhancement of magnetic coercivity induced by uniaxial stress</title>

Abstract: The performance of permanent magnets is intricately tied to their magnetic hysteresis loop. In this study, we investigate the heavy-fermion ferromagnet CeAgSb$_2$ through magnetization measurements under uniaxial stress. We observe a 2400 % increase in magnetic coercivity with just a modest stress of approximately 1 kbar. This effect persists even after pressure release, attributable to stress-induced defects that efficiently pin domain walls. Other magnetic properties such as ordering temperature and saturation moment exhibit only weak pressure dependencies and display full reversibility. Our findings offer a promising route for increasing coercive field strength and enhancing the energy product in ferromagnetic materials and are potentially applicable to a broad spectrum of commercial or emerging magnetic applications.</description>

      <title>An antiferromagnetic diode effect in even-layered MnBi2Te4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a PN junction, the separation between positive and negative charges leads to diode transport. In the past few years, the intrinsic diode transport in noncentrosymmetric polar conductors has attracted great interest, because it suggests novel nonlinear applications and provides a symmetry-sensitive probe of Fermi surface. Recently, such studies have been extended to noncentrosymmetric superconductors, realizing the superconducting diode effect. Here, we show that, even in a centrosymmetric crystal without directional charge separation, the spins of an antiferromagnet (AFM) can generate a spatial directionality, leading to an AFM diode effect. We observe large second-harmonic transport in a nonlinear electronic device enabled by the compensated AFM state of even-layered MnBi2Te4. We also report a novel electrical sum-frequency generation (SFG), which has been rarely explored in contrast to the well-known optical SFG in wide-gap insulators. We demonstrate that the AFM enables an in-plane field-effect transistor and harvesting of wireless electromagnetic energy. The electrical SFG establishes a powerful method to study nonlinear electronics built by quantum materials. The AFM diode effect paves the way for potential device concepts including AFM logic circuits, self-powered AFM spintronics, and other applications that potentially bridge nonlinear electronics with AFM spintronics.</description>

      <title>Commensurate Antiferromagnetic Fluctuations with Small Electron Doping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the presence of antiferromagnetic fluctuations in the longitudinal and transversal spin susceptibilities of a square lattice. The inclusion of both first and second neighbour hopping terms, along with exchange coupling, induces anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations over a finite range of fillings in both longitudinal and transversal static spin susceptibilities. In the absence of on-site Hubbard interaction, we observe incommensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations between the two Van Hove fillings. Beyond the second Van Hove singularity at $ n=1.03 $, commensurate antiferromagnetic fluctuations dominate in both longitudinal and transversal spin susceptibilities. When incorporating a finite Hubbard interaction strength, $ U $, we find that the commensurate anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations are preserved in both longitudinal and transversal dressed spin susceptibilities. However anti-ferromagnetic fluctuations vanish beyond a critical value of the Hubbard coupling strength, $ U_{c} $. Despite the exchange field can be induced by a ferromagnetic substrate, we do not observe any ferromagnetic fluctuations in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze quantum-geometric bounds on optical weights in topological phases with pairs of bands hosting non-trivial Euler class, a multi-gap invariant characterizing non-Abelian band topology. We show how the bounds constrain the combined optical weights of the Euler bands at different dopings and further restrict the size of the adjacent band gaps. In this process, we also consider the associated interband contributions to DC conductivities in the flat-band limit. We physically validate these results by recasting the bound in terms of transition rates associated with the optical absorption of light, and demonstrate how the Euler connections and curvatures can be determined through the use of momentum and frequency-resolved optical measurements, allowing for a direct measurement of this multi-band invariant. Additionally, we prove that the bound holds beyond the degenerate limit of Euler bands, resulting in nodal topology captured by the patch Euler class. In this context, we deduce optical manifestations of Euler topology within $\vec{k} \cdot \vec{p}$ models, which include quantized optical conductivity, and third-order jerk photoconductivities. We showcase our findings with numerical validation in lattice-regularized models that benchmark effective theories for real materials and are realizable in metamaterials and optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Landscape Transitions and Coding Barren Plateaus in Hybrid Variational Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement-induced barren plateau is an exponential vanishing of the parameter gradients with system size that limits the practical application of variational quantum algorithms(VQA). A landscape transition from barren plateau to no-barren plateau was recently observed in monitored quantum circuits, hypothesized to coincide with the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) that separates the area-law states from the volume-law states. We argue from an information theory perspective that these are different transitions. This hypothesis is supported by a numerical study that includes cost-gradient variances, visualizations of the optimization runs and cost-landscape, and a quantum-classical channel mutual information measure. The results are evidence for a universal measurement-induced landscape transition (MILT) at $p_c^{\text{MILT}} \approx 0.2 &lt; p_c^{\text{MIPT}}$ and that throughout $0&lt;p&lt;p_c^{\text{MILT}}$, there is a finite quantum-classical channel mutual information in the limit of a large number of qubits. Unlike the barren plateau without measurements, a non-zero rate of measurements induces a coding barren plateau where, typically, information about the parameters is available to a local cost function despite a vanishing gradient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04831v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A strong coupling between electric polarization and elastic deformation in solids is an important factor in creating useful electromechanical nanodevices. Such coupling is typically allowed in insulating materials with inversion symmetry breaking as exemplified by the piezoelectric effect in ferroelectric materials. Therefore, materials with metallicity and centrosymmetry have tended to be out of scope in this perspective. Here, we report the observation of giant elastic deformation by the application of an alternating electric current in topological semimetals (V,Mo)Te2, regardless of the centrosymmetry. Considering the crystal and band structures and the asymmetric measurement configurations in addition to the absence of the electromechanical effect in a trivial semimetal TiTe2, the observed effect is discussed in terms of a Berry-phase-derived converse flexoelectric effect in metals. The observation of the flexoelectric effect in topological semimetals paves a way for a new type of nanoscale electromechanical sensors and energy harvesting.</description>

Abstract: $n$-circuits are series-parallel networks composed of exactly $n$ unit resistors. This paper is focused on evaluating the mean resistance of all $n$-circuits, $M_n$, establishing that it lies between $1$ and $4.3954$ for all $n$. We ultimately conjecture that $M_n$ converges to $1.25$ as $n$ grows, based on computational analysis and other intuitive arguments. Although the number of $n$-circuits has been explored quite thoroughly, this paper also provides complete proofs of some important results.</description>
