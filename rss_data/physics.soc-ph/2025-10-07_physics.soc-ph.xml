      <title>From Earthbound to Stars: Analyzing Humanity's Path to a Type II Civilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanity is at a critical juncture, marked by rapid technological advances and the pursuit of higher civilization stages on the Kardashev scale. This study explores humanity's potential progression toward Type I and Type II civilizations, defined by planetary and stellar-scale energy utilization. Building on Kardashev's framework, we propose refinements that integrate energy consumption, information processing, construction mass, and population dynamics. Using machine learning, we analyze global energy data to project humanity's energy future, emphasizing exponential growth in renewable and nuclear sources, and incorporate stellar classifications and insolation flux data from the Planetary Habitability Laboratory to establish benchmarks for habitable exoplanets orbiting G, K, and M stars. Our simulations suggest humanity could plausibly reach Type I status by 2271 CE through planetary-scale energy harnessing, advanced computation, and sustainable population management. Under optimistic assumptions of technological progress and resource use, Type II status may emerge between 3200-3500 CE, contingent on breakthroughs in stellar-scale infrastructures such as Dyson swarms or Matrioshka Brains and sustained interplanetary integration. To better track these trajectories, we introduce the Civilization Development Index (CDI), a modified Kardashev metric balancing contributions from energy, information, construction, and population, and demonstrate its robustness under varying assumptions. This study presents an interdisciplinary framework for understanding humanity's long-term trajectory as a multiplanetary civilization, while highlighting both promise and uncertainty. Recognizable existential risks, the so-called "Great Filters", may delay or prevent this pathway, underscoring the urgency of global sustainability and resilience today.</description>

      <title>Cooperation in public goods game on regular lattices with agents changing interaction groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of cooperation in the groups of interacting agents is one of the most fascinating phenomena observed in many complex systems studied in social science and ecology, even in the situations where one would expect the agent to use a free-rider policy. This is especially surprising in the situation where no external mechanisms based on reputation or punishment are present. One of the possible explanations of this effect is the inhomogeneity of the various aspects of interactions, which can be used to clarify the seemingly paradoxical behavior. In this report we demonstrate that the diversity of interaction networks helps to some degree to explain the emergence of cooperation. We extend the model of spatial interaction diversity introduced in [L. Shang et al., Physica A, 593:126999 (2022)] by enabling the evaluation of the interaction groups. We show that the process of the reevaluation of the interaction group facilitates the emergence of cooperation. Furthermore, we also observe that a significant participation of agents switching their interaction neighborhoods has a negative impact on the formation of cooperation. The introduced scenario can help to understand the formation of cooperation in the systems where no additional mechanisms for controlling agents are included.</description>

      <title>Strategic Communication Protocols for Interstellar Objects Using a Threat-Communication Viability Index and the Information-Communication Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategic Communication Protocols provide a structured approach for first contact with interstellar objects that demonstrate technological characteristics and high levels of threat. The protocols find their starting point in an ISO Information-Communication Paradox, namely, as our knowledge of an ISO's threatening capabilities increases, the probability of successful communication decreases while the urgency of communication attempts simultaneously intensifies. From this paradox, a Threat-Communication Viability Index is created to describe when the value of communication attempts outweighs strategic silence. The index scores the situation and operates as a decision-making tool for stakeholders tracking an ISO. The communication protocols subsequently outline several diplomatic strategies in cases where the index recommends communication.</description>

      <title>The influence of Political trust on the acceptance of Violence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The choice of protest tactics in a social movement has often been analyzed based on the demands, participants, and internal characteristics of the movement. However, recent evidence highlights the context or setting in which the demonstration takes place as another key element in the process; Using structural equation modeling, studies have shown a link between high perceptions of injustice in the treatment received by authorities and a greater acceptance of non-normative and/or violent methods of protest. In line with this approach, this article aims to examine the extent to which another form of authority legitimacy -- such as political trust -- affects the overall justification for the use of violence by both protesters and the police. Using longitudinal data from Chile (2016 -- 2019), which captures the collective protests of the ``Social Outbreak'', three analytical approaches -- fixed effects, cross-lagged, and multilevel models -- demonstrate that declining political trust not only weakened public acceptance of police violence but also increased tolerance toward protesters' use of violent tactics. This relationship adds a new dimension to the analysis of violent protests, suggesting that low political trust in many modern states may be a contributing factor to the increasing radicalization of demonstrations in recent years.</description>

      <title>Investigating mixed traffic dynamics of pedestrians and non-motorized vehicles at urban intersections: Observation experiments and modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban intersections with mixed pedestrian and non-motorized vehicle traffic present complex safety challenges, yet traditional models fail to account for dynamic interactions arising from speed heterogeneity and collision anticipation. This study introduces the Time and Angle Based Social Force Model (TASFM), an enhanced framework extending the classical Social Force Model by integrating Time-to-Collision (TTC) metrics and velocity-angle-dependent tangential forces to simulate collision avoidance behaviors more realistically. Using aerial trajectory data from a high-density intersection in Shenzhen, China, we validated TASFM against real-world scenarios, achieving a Mean Trajectory Error (MTE) of 0.154 m (0.77% of the experimental area width). Key findings reveal distinct behavioral patterns: pedestrians self-organize into lanes along designated routes (e.g., zebra crossings), while non-motorized vehicles exhibit flexible path deviations that heighten collision risks. Simulations of three conflict types (overtaking, frontal/lateral crossing) demonstrate TASFM's capacity to replicate adaptive strategies like bidirectional path adjustments and speed modulation. The model provides actionable insights for urban planners, including conflict hotspot prediction and infrastructure redesign (e.g., segregated lanes), while offering a scalable framework for future research integrating motorized traffic and environmental variables. This work advances the understanding of mixed traffic dynamics and bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and data-driven urban safety solutions.</description>

      <title>Towards Hydrogen Autarky? Evaluating Import Costs and Domestic Competitiveness in European Energy Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of the future European energy system depends heavily on how Europe balances its domestic hydrogen production against its reliance on imports. This study reveals that neither-extreme full self-sufficiency nor complete reliance on imports-is economically optimal through 2050. Using a high-resolution energy system model accounting for interannual weather variability, we find import cost thresholds favoring domestic production decrease from 3.0 EUR/kg (2030) to 2.5 EUR/kg (2050). However, the impact of weather is significant and can shift the optimal import share by up to 60 percentage points at constant prices. Strategies with a high import share minimize the need for domestic renewable energy and electrolyzers but require significant investment in long-distance transportation, backup electricity capacity, and storage. Conversely, achieving full self-sufficiency demands massive domestic infrastructure, including up to 1,315 GW of electrolysis by 2050. These findings highlight the critical need for diversified hydrogen strategies that balance cost, resilience, and energy sovereignty. Policy must prioritize flexible infrastructure accommodating both imports and scalable domestic production to navigate evolving market and climatic conditions.</description>

      <title>A behavioral reinvestigation of the effect of long ties on social contagions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Faced with uncertainty in decision making, individuals often turn to their social networks to inform their decisions. In consequence, these networks become central to how new products and behaviors spread. A key structural feature of networks is the presence of long ties, which connect individuals who share few mutual contacts. Under what conditions do long ties facilitate or hinder diffusion? The literature provides conflicting results, largely due to differing assumptions about individual decision-making. We reinvestigate the role of long ties by experimentally measuring adoption decisions under social influence for products with uncertain payoffs and embedding these decisions in network simulations. At the individual level, we find that higher payoff uncertainty increases the average reliance on social influence. However, personal traits such as risk preferences and attitudes toward uncertainty lead to substantial heterogeneity in how individuals respond to social influence. At the collective level, the observed individual heterogeneity ensures that long ties consistently promote diffusion, but their positive effect weakens as uncertainty increases. Our results reveal that the effect of long ties is not determined by whether the aggregate process is a simple or complex contagion, but by the extent of heterogeneity in how individuals respond to social influence.</description>

      <title>Panel regression for the GDP of the Central and Eastern European countries using time-varying coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries into the European Economic Area serves as a valuable experiment for the regional economic development theory. The long-lasting convergence of these economies with more advanced Western Europe exhibits a few standard features and varying policies implemented. Even the Baltic countries, which started from very similar starting positions, demonstrate their unique trajectories of development. We employ a panel data regression model that allows coefficients to vary over time to compare the contributions of a few macroeconomic factors to the GDP growth of CEE countries. In particular, we regress the annual change of GDP per capita in PPP terms as a function of achieved GDP, price, trade, investment, and debt levels. Time-varying common slope coefficients in this approach describe the external economic environment in which countries implement their own policies. The panel consists of 11 Central and Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Czechia, Estonia, Croatia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, and Slovakia), which have been observed annually from 1995 to 2024. While the main selected factors of this investigation contribute to economic growth, in agreement with previous findings, the role of private debt appears vital in determining the pace of economic growth.</description>

      <title>Deep learning framework for predicting stochastic take-off and die-out of early spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale outbreaks of epidemics, misinformation, or other harmful contagions pose significant threats to human society, yet the fundamental question of whether an emerging outbreak will escalate into a major epidemic or naturally die out remains largely unaddressed. This problem is challenging, partially due to inadequate data during the early stages of outbreaks and also because established models focus on average behaviors of large epidemics rather than the stochastic nature of small transmission chains. Here, we introduce the first systematic framework for forecasting whether initial transmission events will amplify into major outbreaks or fade into extinction during early stages, when intervention strategies can still be effectively implemented. Using extensive data from stochastic spreading models, we developed a deep learning framework that predicts early-stage spreading outcomes in real-time. Validation across Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and Barab\'asi-Albert networks with varying infectivity levels shows our method accurately forecasts stochastic spreading events well before potential outbreaks, demonstrating robust performance across different network structures and infectivity scenarios.To address the challenge of sparse data during early outbreak stages, we further propose a pretrain-finetune framework that leverages diverse simulation data for pretraining and adapts to specific scenarios through targeted fine-tuning. The pretrain-finetune framework consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving superior performance even when trained on limited scenario-specific data. To our knowledge, this work presents the first framework for predicting stochastic take-off versus die-out. This framework provides valuable insights for epidemic preparedness and public health decision-making, enabling more informed early intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Exact cluster dynamics of indirect reciprocity in complete graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heider's balance theory emphasizes cognitive consistency in assessing others, as is expressed by ``The enemy of my enemy is my friend.'' At the same time, the theory of indirect reciprocity provides us with a dynamical framework to study how to assess others based on their actions as well as how to act toward them based on the assessments. Well known are the ``leading eight'' from L1 to L8, the eight norms for assessment and action to foster cooperation in social dilemmas while resisting the invasion of mutant norms prescribing alternative actions. In this work, we begin by showing that balance is equivalent to stationarity of dynamics only for L4 and L6 (stern judging) among the leading eight. Stern judging reflects an intuitive idea that good merits reward whereas evil warrants punishment. By analyzing the dynamics of Stern Judging in complete graphs, we prove that this norm almost always segregates the graph into two mutually hostile groups as the graph size grows. We then compare L4 with stern judging: The only difference of L4 is that a good player's cooperative action toward a bad one is regarded as good. This subtle difference transforms large populations governed by L4 to a ``paradise'' where cooperation prevails and positive assessments abound. Our study thus helps us understand the relationship between individual norms and their emergent consequences at a population level, shedding light on the nuanced interplay between cognitive consistency and segregation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Prosecution of complex criminal networks: a multilevel ERGMs approach to CICIG's judicial cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prosecutors are essential in combating organized crime, making key decisions about prosecution, target selection, and structuring imputation strategies. Despite their importance, the configuration of these strategies remains empirically underexplored. This study engages with that premise by considering the cases investigated by the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) and focusing specifically on the role of prosecutors, aiming to uncover how their discretionary decisions translated the CICIG mandate into operational practices intended to achieve systemic deterrence, and to what extent, can we talk about deterrence effectiveness. The research employs a multilevel Exponential Random Graph Model (ERGM) analysis, integrating three networks: the criminal network of actors involved in illegal activities, the legal framework network that represents offenses, and the prosecution network that connects actors to offenses. The model assesses whether the observed network aligns with deterrence-based theoretical assumptions and examines how punishment severity can be effective when it disrupts functional ties that sustain criminal activity -both through long-term sanctions and by increasing the perceived threat of punishment among co-offenders. This approach underscores the need for prosecutorial strategies to evolve beyond a case-by-case model toward a multi-case, multi-offender imputation framework that fully integrates intelligence and data-driven analysis to dismantle criminal networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10500v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In business, politics and life, folk wisdom encourages people to aim for above-average results, but to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Here, we mathematically formalize and extend this folk wisdom. We model a time-limited search for strategies having uncertain rewards. At each time step, the searcher either is satisfied with their current reward or continues searching. We prove that the optimal satisfaction threshold is both finite and strictly larger than the mean of available rewards -- matching the folk wisdom. This result is robust to search costs, unless they are high enough to prohibit all search. We show that being too ambitious has a higher expected cost than being too cautious. We show that the optimal satisfaction threshold increases if the search time is longer, or if the reward distribution is rugged (i.e., has low autocorrelation) or left-skewed. The skewness result reveals counterintuitive contrasts between optimal ambition and optimal risk taking. We show that using upward social comparison to assess the reward landscape substantially harms expected performance. We show how these insights can be applied qualitatively to real-world settings, using examples from entrepreneurship, economic policy, political campaigns, online dating and college admissions. We discuss implications of several possible extensions of our model, including intelligent search, reward landscape uncertainty and risk aversion.</description>

      <title>Assessing provincial carbon budgets for residential buildings to advance net-zero ambitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assessing provincial carbon budgets for residential building operations is a crucial strategy for advancing China's net-zero ambitions. This study develops an advanced assessment framework that integrates static and dynamic modeling to evaluate emission pathways and carbon budgets for residential buildings at the provincial level. The framework provides a practical tool for generating robust carbon budget estimates with limited data, thereby enhancing its applicability for policy-oriented planning. Findings show that (1) in the business-as-usual scenario, the emissions for urban and rural residential buildings are projected to peak at 990 (+-0.7) and 450 (+-0.2) mega-tons of carbon dioxide (MtCO2), respectively, with peak years occurring in 2031 (+-4.7) and 2026 (+-2.6). (2) In the decarbonization scenario, peak emissions decrease to 900 MtCO2 and 430 MtCO2 for urban and rural buildings, respectively. (3) The provinces with the highest emission reduction requirements are Henan (16.74 MtCO2), Xinjiang (12.59 MtCO2), Gansu (9.87 MtCO2), Hebei (8.46 MtCO2), and Guangdong (3.37 MtCO2), with Northwest China shouldering the greatest reduction responsibility, totaling 38.14 MtCO2. In conclusion, this study provides a dynamically optimized carbon budget assessment tool for residential buildings, offering valuable insights for government policy-making and playing a key role in facilitating the low-carbon transition of China's building sector during the pre-2030 planning period, ultimately contributing to the goal of achieving net-zero emissions in the building sector by mid-century.</description>

Abstract: The escalating cost, extended timelines, and low success rates in pharmaceutical research demand a fundamental rethinking of biotechnology R&amp;D infrastructure. This chapter introduces the concept of the AI-Integrated Biotechnology Hub, a purpose-built research ecosystem uniting residential, commercial, clinical, and research facilities under a central, AI-driven operating system. Designed as a multi-sided platform, the hub leverages continuous, multi-modal health data collection, advanced smart living environments, and federated learning models to enable secure, privacy-preserving biomedical research. By integrating real estate, biotechnology facilities, research hospitals, and community services, the model maximizes data utility, accelerates drug discovery, and enhances resident well-being. Transparency, accountability, and ethical stewardship are critical pillars of governance, enacted through dynamic consent, data trusts, and multi-stakeholder oversight. Scalable across urban and vertical architectures, this paradigm offers a viable, sustainable pathway toward improving healthspan, fostering innovation, and reshaping the economics of global drug development.</description>

      <title>SGRDN-Data learned sparsification of graph reaction-diffusion networks</title>

Abstract: Graph sparsification is an area of interest in computer science and applied mathematics. Sparsification of a graph, in general, aims to reduce the number of edges in the network while preserving specific properties of the graph, like cuts and subgraph counts. Computing the sparsest cuts of a graph is known to be NP-hard, and sparsification routines exist for generating linear-sized sparsifiers in almost quadratic running time $O(n^{2 + \epsilon})$. Consequently, obtaining a sparsifier can be a computationally demanding task, and the complexity varies based on the level of sparsity required. We propose SGRDN to extend sparsification to complex reaction-diffusion systems. This approach seeks to sparsify the graph such that the inherent reaction-diffusion dynamics are strictly preserved on the resulting structure. By selectively considering a subset of trajectories, we frame the network sparsification issue as a data assimilation problem within a Reduced Order Model (ROM) space, imposing constraints to conserve the eigenmodes of the Laplacian matrix ($L = D - A$), the difference between the degree matrix ($D$) and the adjacency matrix ($A$) despite perturbations. We derive computationally efficient eigenvalue and eigenvector approximations for perturbed Laplacian matrices and integrate these as spectral preservation constraints in the optimization problem. To further validate the method's broad applicability, we conducted an additional experiment on Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (neural ODEs), where SGRDN successfully achieved parameter sparsity.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal random networks and their percolation properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of nonreciprocity and network structure on percolation. To this end, we investigate nonreciprocal random networks - directed networks for which the probability of a link occurring from node i to node j differs from the probability of the reverse link occurring from node j to node i. We analytically determine the degree and percolation properties of such networks with exactly two types of link probability, demonstrating that whether the networks are structured such that the nodes are not statistically indistinguishable has profound effects on these measures, both quantitively and in how such networks need to be approached. In particular, we develop a technique for solving the percolation problem which can be applied to both structured and unstructured networks. The method entails writing self-consistent integral and differential equations for the probability that each node will belong to the network's giant component. Exact solutions to these equations are obtained and simulations which confirm our analytic predictions are presented.</description>
