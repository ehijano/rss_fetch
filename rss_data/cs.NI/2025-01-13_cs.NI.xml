      <title>Network Diffuser for Placing-Scheduling Service Function Chains with Inverse Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network services are increasingly managed by considering chained-up virtual network functions and relevant traffic flows, known as the Service Function Chains (SFCs). To deal with sequential arrivals of SFCs in an online fashion, we must consider two closely-coupled problems - an SFC placement problem that maps SFCs to servers/links in the network and an SFC scheduling problem that determines when each SFC is executed. Solving the whole SFC problem targeting these two optimizations jointly is extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel network diffuser using conditional generative modeling for this SFC placing-scheduling optimization. Recent advances in generative AI and diffusion models have made it possible to generate high-quality images/videos and decision trajectories from language description. We formulate the SFC optimization as a problem of generating a state sequence for planning and perform graph diffusion on the state trajectories to enable extraction of SFC decisions, with SFC optimization constraints and objectives as conditions. To address the lack of demonstration data due to NP-hardness and exponential problem space of the SFC optimization, we also propose a novel and somewhat maverick approach -- Rather than solving instances of this difficult optimization, we start with randomly-generated solutions as input, and then determine appropriate SFC optimization problems that render these solutions feasible. This inverse demonstration enables us to obtain sufficient expert demonstrations, i.e., problem-solution pairs, through further optimization. In our numerical evaluations, the proposed network diffuser outperforms learning and heuristic baselines, by $\sim$20\% improvement in SFC reward and $\sim$50\% reduction in SFC waiting time and blocking rate.</description>

      <title>UAV Swarm-enabled Collaborative Post-disaster Communications in Low Altitude Economy via a Two-stage Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) plays an indispensable role in cargo transportation, healthcare, infrastructure inspection, and especially post-disaster communication. Specifically, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as one of the core technologies of the LAE, can be deployed to provide communication coverage, facilitate data collection, and relay data for trapped users, thereby significantly enhancing the efficiency of post-disaster response efforts. In this paper, we design an efficient and robust UAV-swarm enabled collaborative self-organizing network to facilitate post-disaster communications. Specifically, a ground device transmits data to UAV swarms, which then use collaborative beamforming (CB) technique to form virtual antenna arrays and relay the data to a remote access point (AP) efficiently. Then, we formulate a rescue-oriented post-disaster transmission rate maximization optimization problem (RPTRMOP). Then, we propose a two-stage optimization approach to address it. In the first stage, the optimal traffic routing and the theoretical upper bound on the transmission rate of the network are derived. In the second stage, we transform the formulated RPTRMOP into a variant named V-RPTRMOP, and a diffusion model-enabled particle swarm optimization (DM-PSO) algorithm is proposed to deal with the V-RPTRMOP. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed two-stage optimization approach in improving the transmission rate of the constructed network, which demonstrates the great potential for post-disaster communications. Moreover, the robustness of the constructed network is also validated via evaluating the impact of two unexpected situations on the system transmission rate.</description>

      <title>GR-WiFi: A GNU Radio based WiFi Platform with Single-User and Multi-User MIMO Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its first release, WiFi has been highly successful in providing wireless local area networks. The ever-evolving IEEE 802.11 standards continue to add new features to keep up with the trend of increasing numbers of mobile devices and the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Unfortunately, the lack of open-source IEEE 802.11 testbeds in the community limits the development and performance evaluation of those new features. Motivated by an existing popular open-source software-defined radio (SDR) package for single-user single-stream transmission based on the IEEE 802.11/a/g/p standard, in this paper we present GR-WiFi, an open-source package for single-user and multi-user multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmissions based on 802.11n and 802.11ac standards. The distinct features of GR-WiFi include the support of parallel data streams to single or multiple users, and the compatible preamble processing to allow the co-existence of conventional, high-throughput (HT) and very-high-throughput (VHT) traffics. The performance of GR-WiFi is evaluated through both extensive simulation and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Content Moderation in the Fediverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fediverse, a group of interconnected servers providing a variety of interoperable services (e.g. micro-blogging in Mastodon) has gained rapid popularity. This sudden growth, partly driven by Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter, has created challenges for administrators though. This paper focuses on one particular challenge: content moderation, e.g. the need to remove spam or hate speech. While centralized platforms like Facebook and Twitter rely on automated tools for moderation, their dependence on massive labeled datasets and specialized infrastructure renders them impractical for decentralized, low-resource settings like the Fediverse. In this work, we design and evaluate FedMod, a collaborative content moderation system based on federated learning. Our system enables servers to exchange parameters of partially trained local content moderation models with similar servers, creating a federated model shared among collaborating servers. FedMod demonstrates robust performance on three different content moderation tasks: harmful content detection, bot content detection, and content warning assignment, achieving average per-server macro-F1 scores of 0.71, 0.73, and 0.58, respectively.</description>

      <title>RPKI-Based Location-Unaware Tor Guard Relay Selection Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tor is a well-known anonymous communication tool, used by people with various privacy and security needs. Prior works have exploited routing attacks to observe Tor traffic and deanonymize Tor users. Subsequently, location-aware relay selection algorithms have been proposed to defend against such attacks on Tor. However, location-aware relay selection algorithms are known to be vulnerable to information leakage on client locations and guard placement attacks. Can we design a new location-unaware approach to relay selection while achieving the similar goal of defending against routing attacks? Towards this end, we leverage the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) in designing new guard relay selection algorithms. We develop a lightweight Discount Selection algorithm by only incorporating Route Origin Authorization (ROA) information, and a more secure Matching Selection algorithm by incorporating both ROA and Route Origin Validation (ROV) information. Our evaluation results show an increase in the number of ROA-ROV matched client-relay pairs using our Matching Selection algorithm, reaching 48.47% with minimal performance overhead through custom Shadow simulations and benchmarking.</description>

      <title>QACM: QoS-Aware xApp Conflict Mitigation in Open RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of Open Radio Access Network (RAN) has revolutionized the field of RAN by introducing elements of native support of intelligence and openness into the next generation of mobile network infrastructure. Open RAN paves the way for standardized interfaces and enables the integration of network applications from diverse vendors, thereby enhancing network management flexibility. However, control decision conflicts occur when components from different vendors are deployed together. This article provides an overview of various types of conflicts that may occur in Open RAN, with a particular focus on intra-component conflict mitigation among Extended Applications (xApps) in the Near Real Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT-RIC). A QoS-Aware Conflict Mitigation (QACM) method is proposed that finds the optimal configuration of conflicting parameters while maximizing the number of xApps that have their Quality of Service (QoS) requirements met. We compare the performance of the proposed QACM method with two benchmark methods for priority and non-priority cases. The results indicate that our proposed method is the most effective in maintaining QoS requirements for conflicting xApps.</description>

      <title>KTWIN: A Serverless Kubernetes-based Digital Twin Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01635v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) systems are virtual representations of physical assets allowing organizations to gain insights and improve existing processes. In practice, DTs require proper modeling, coherent development and seamless deployment along cloud and edge landscapes relying on established patterns to reduce operational costs. In this work, we propose KTWIN a Kubernetes-based Serverless Platform for Digital Twins. KTWIN was developed using the state-of-the-art open-source Cloud Native tools, allowing DT operators to easily define models through open standards and configure details of the underlying services and infrastructure. The experiments carried out with the developed prototype show that KTWIN can provide a higher level of abstraction to model and deploy a Digital Twin use case without compromising the solution scalability. The tests performed also show cost savings ranging between 60% and 80% compared to overprovisioned scenarios.</description>

      <title>Towards the Internet of Robotic Things: Analysis, Architecture, Components and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03817</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.03817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics cannot be considered two separate domains these days. Internet of Robotics Things (IoRT) is a concept that has been recently introduced to describe the integration of robotics technologies in IoT scenarios. As a consequence, these two research fields have started interacting, and thus linking research communities. In this paper we intend to make further steps in joining the two communities and broaden the discussion on the development of this interdisciplinary field. The paper provides an overview, analysis and challenges of possible solutions for the Internet of Robotic Things, discussing the issues of the IoRT architecture, the integration of smart spaces and robotic applications.</description>
