      <title>Violation of non-Abelian Bianchi identity and QCD topology -- Numerical analyses on lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When Abelian monopoles due to violation of the non-Abelian Bianchi identity J{\mu}(x) condense in the vacuum, color confinement of QCD is realized by the Abelian dual Meissner effect. Recently VNABI affects also topological features of QCD drastically. Firstly, self-dual instantons can not be a classical solution of QCD. Secondly, the topological charge density is not expressed by a total derivative of the Chern-Simons density K{\mu}(x), but has an additional term L(x)=2Tr(J{\mu}(x)A{\mu}(x)). Thirdly, the axial U(1) anomaly is similarly modified, while keeping the Atiyah-Singer index theorem unchanged. These suggest that the Abelian mechanism based on the Abelian monopoles from VNABI play an important role in these topological quantities instead of instantons. The additional term L(x) is evaluated in the framework of Monte-Carlo simulations on SU(2) lattices in details with partial gauge fixings such as the Maximal Center gauge (MCG) and the Maximal Abelian +U(1) gauge (MAU1) in addition to the gradient flow. The additional term tends to vanish after small gradient flow time ({\tau}) when infrared monopoles responsible for color confinement are also suppressed. The topological charge Qt and its Abelian counterpart Qa are discussed also on lattice. Theoretically Qa(A)=3Qt(A) is expected, but a simple lattice definition of Qa(A) is fluctuating between -2 and -3 in MCG and around -2 in MAU1 in a typical configuration where Qt(A) is stabilized around -1 after the flow time {\tau} is larger than 2.</description>

      <title>Numerical evidence for a CP broken deconfined phase at $\theta =\pi$ in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory through simulations at imaginary $\theta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of the spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills at $\theta=\pi$, which has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we provide a numerical evidence that the CP symmetry is indeed spontaneously broken at low temperature and it gets restored above the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, which is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the situation predicted in the large-$N$ limit. We avoid the severe sign problem by performing simulations at imaginary $\theta$. We obtain the critical temperature of the CP restoration and that of deconfinement at $\theta=\pi$ by analytic continuation, which leads to the above conclusion.</description>

      <title>Acceleration as a circular motion along an imaginary circle: Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition for accelerating field theories in imaginary-time formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the imaginary-time formalism for field theories in thermal equilibrium in uniformly accelerating frames. We show that under a Wick rotation of Minkowski spacetime, the Rindler event horizon shrinks to a point in a two-dimensional subspace tangential to the acceleration direction and the imaginary time. We demonstrate that the accelerated version of the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition implies an identification of all spacetime points related by integer-multiple rotations in the tangential subspace about this Euclidean Rindler event-horizon point, with the rotational quanta defined by the thermal acceleration, $\alpha = a/T$. In the Wick-rotated Rindler hyperbolic coordinates, the KMS relations reduce to standard (anti-)periodic boundary conditions in terms of the imaginary proper time (rapidity) coordinate. Our findings pave the way to study, using first-principle lattice simulations, the Hawking-Unruh radiation in geometries with event horizons, phase transitions in accelerating Early Universe and early stages of quark-gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Bratteli networks and the Spectral Action on quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of noncommutative geometry, we consider quiver representations -- not on vector spaces, as traditional, but on finite-dimensional prespectral triples (`discrete topological noncommutative spaces'). A similar idea appeared in the original work of Marcolli-van Suijlekom on quiver representations in spectral triples (`discrete noncommutative geometries'), which paved the way for some of our results in independent directions. We introduce Bratteli networks, a structure that yields a neat combinatorial characterisation of the space $\mathrm{Rep}~Q$ of prespectral-triple-representations of a quiver $\mathrm{Rep}~Q$, as well as of the gauge group and of their quotient. Not only these claims that make it possible to `integrate over $\mathrm{Rep}~Q$' are, as we now argue, in line with the spirit of random noncommutative geometry -- formulating path integrals over Dirac operators -- but they also contain a physically relevant case. Namely, the equivalence between quiver representations and path algebra modules, established here for the new category, inspired the following construction: Only from representation theory data, we build a spectral triple for the quiver and evaluate the spectral action functional from a general formula over closed paths. When we apply this construction to lattice-quivers, we obtain not only Wilsonian Yang-Mills lattice gauge theory, but also the Weisz-Wohlert-cells in the context of Symanzik's improved gauge theory. We show that a hermitian (`Higgs') matrix field emerges from the self-loops of the quiver and derive the Yang-Mills--Higgs theory on flat space as a smooth limit.</description>

      <title>QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ from $\tau$-decay: Summary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this talk, I summarize the recent determinations in Ref.[1] of the QCD condensates and $\alpha_s$ within the SVZ expansion using the ratio of Laplace sum rule (LSR) ${\cal R}_{10}^A(\tau)$ and $\tau$-like moments ${\cal R}_{n,A},\, {\cal R}_{n,V-A}$within stability criteria in the axial-vector (A) and V-A channels of the $\tau$- semi-hadronic decays. The factorization of the four-quark condensate is violated by a factor 6 like in the case of the $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons data. There is no exponential growth of the size of higher dimension condensates which does not favour (by duality) a significant effect of the so-called Duality Violation (DV). The extracted value of $\alpha_s$ is in good agreement with the one from $e^+e^-$ and indicates that the determination at the observed $\tau$-mass is not the optimal one and leads to an overestimate of its actual value.</description>
