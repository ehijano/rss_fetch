      <title>3D correlation imaging for localized phase disturbance mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation plenoptic imaging is a procedure to perform light-field imaging without spatial resolution loss, by measuring second-order spatio-temporal correlations of light. We investigate the possibility to use correlation plenoptic imaging to mitigate the effect of a phase disturbance in the propagation from the object to the main lens. We assume that this detrimental effect, that can be due to a turbulent medium, is localized at a specific distance from the lens, and is slowly varying in time. The mitigation of turbulence effects has already fostered the development of both light-field imaging and correlation imaging procedures. Here, we aim at merging these aspects, proposing a correlation light-field imaging method to overcome the effects of slowly varying turbulence, without the loss of lateral resolution, typical of traditional plenoptic imaging devices.</description>

      <title>Attosecond pulse synthesis from high-order harmonic generation in intense squeezed light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) provides a broad spectral bandwidth for synthesizing attosecond pulses. However, in the current HHG schemes, only part of the harmonics can be phase-locked, which limits the ability to achieve shorter attosecond pulses. Here, we study attosecond pulse synthesis from HHG of an atom driven by an intense quantum light, i.e., squeezed light. It is interestingly found that the harmonics in the whole spectrum can be phase-locked and, by using these harmonics, the width of the synthesized attosecond pulse is greatly reduced. By developing strong-field approximation theory in squeezed light, the physics of the phase-locked harmonic generation throughout the HHG spectrum is revealed and is found to be independent of the target system. Furthermore, we uncover the dependence of the synthesized attosecond pulse width on the squeezing parameter of the squeezed light. Our findings provide a robust tool for obtaining phase-locked harmonics throughout the HHG spectrum for synthesizing short attosecond pulses.</description>

      <title>Tandem Photovoltaics from 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides on Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for high-efficiency photovoltaic systems necessitates innovations that transcend the efficiency limitations of single-junction solar cells. This study investigates a tandem photovoltaic architecture comprising a top-cell with a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) superlattice absorber and a bottom-cell of crystalline silicon (c-Si), focusing on optimizing the light absorption and electrical performance of the combined structure. Through the transfer matrix method and electrical simulations, we optimized the geometry of the superlattice, determining that a siz-layer MoSe2 configuration with a 40 nm SiO2 antireflective layer maximizes photon absorption while mitigating additional weight and preserving the cell's structural integrity. The results show that the optimized TMDC superlattice significantly improves the PCE of the tandem design to 28.96%, and increase of 5.68% over the original single-junction c-Si solar cell's efficiency. This advancement illustrates the potential of TMDC material in next-generation solar cells and presents a promising avenue for the development of highly efficient, tandem photovoltaic systems via van der Waals integration of the top cell on c-Si</description>

      <title>Transient Measurement of Near-field Thermal Radiation between Macroscopic Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The involvement of evanescent waves in the near-field regime could greatly enhance the spontaneous thermal radiation, offering a unique opportunity to study nanoscale photon-phonon interaction. However, accurately characterizing this subtle phenomenon is very challenging. This paper proposes a transient all-optical method for rapidly characterizing near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) between macroscopic objects, using the first law of thermodynamics. Significantly, a full measurement at a fixed gap distance is completed within tens of seconds. By simplifying the configuration, the transient all-optical method achieves high measurement accuracy and reliable reproducibility. The proposed method can effectively analyze the NFRHT in various material systems, including SiO2, SiC, and Si, which involve different phonon or plasmon polaritons. Experimental observations demonstrate significant super-Planckian radiation, which arises from the near-field coupling of bounded surface modes. Furthermore, the method achieves excellent agreement with theory, with a minimal discrepancy of less than 2.7% across a wide temperature range. This wireless method could accurately characterize the NFRHT for objects with different sizes or optical properties, enabling the exploration of both fundamental interests and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Integration of Programmable Diffraction with Digital Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical imaging and sensing systems based on diffractive elements have seen massive advances over the last several decades. Earlier generations of diffractive optical processors were, in general, designed to deliver information to an independent system that was separately optimized, primarily driven by human vision or perception. With the recent advances in deep learning and digital neural networks, there have been efforts to establish diffractive processors that are jointly optimized with digital neural networks serving as their back-end. These jointly optimized hybrid (optical+digital) processors establish a new "diffractive language" between input electromagnetic waves that carry analog information and neural networks that process the digitized information at the back-end, providing the best of both worlds. Such hybrid designs can process spatially and temporally coherent, partially coherent, or incoherent input waves, providing universal coverage for any spatially varying set of point spread functions that can be optimized for a given task, executed in collaboration with digital neural networks. In this article, we highlight the utility of this exciting collaboration between engineered and programmed diffraction and digital neural networks for a diverse range of applications. We survey some of the major innovations enabled by the push-pull relationship between analog wave processing and digital neural networks, also covering the significant benefits that could be reaped through the synergy between these two complementary paradigms.</description>

      <title>Propagation of circular Airy derivative beams in complex media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling light propagation through complex media plays a significant role in a wide range of applications ranging from astronomical observations to microscopy. Although, several advances have been made based on adaptive optics, optical phase conjugation and wavefront shaping, but many of these involve challenges. Recently, controlling light propagation in complex media by simply structuring light has shown promising capabilities. We present experimental and numerical investigations of abruptly autofocusing of circular Airy derivative beams (CADBs) in complex media. We find that up to a relatively high turbulence strength, CADB possesses relatively good abrupt autofocusing, however, efficiency and autofocusing position vary with the strength of turbulence. Further, the spatial distortions in CADB caused by turbulence are quantified by an overlap integral, which shows that CADB possesses reasonably good resilience against the turbulence. The diffraction efficiency of CADB changes by a factor of ~ 1.7 with increasing strength of turbulence from zero to high, indicating good confinement of intensity at autofocusing. The focused beam spot size grows gradually with increasing the strength of turbulence, specifically, it grows by a factor of ~ 2 for a strong turbulence, indicating reasonably good focusing abilities. The results of CADB are compared with a Gaussian beam, and find that CADB possesses superior focusing abilities in turbulent media. We have carried out a detailed analysis of these observations based on Zernike polynomials, which reveals that different kinds of aberrations present in turbulent media leads to distortions in the spatial structure as well as other properties of CADBs. Our results can be used for various applications, such as in biomedical treatment, seismology, optical tweezers and material processing.</description>

      <title>Chip-scale generation of 60-mode continuous-variable cluster states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing the number of entangled entities is crucial for achieving exponential computational speedups and secure quantum networks. Despite recent progress in generating large-scale entanglement through continuous-variable (CV) cluster states, translating these technologies to photonic chips has been hindered by decoherence, limiting the number of entangled entities to 8. Here, we demonstrate 60-mode CVcluster states in a chip-based optical microresonator pumped by chromatic lasers. Resonantly-enhanced four-wave mixing processes establish entanglement between equidistant spectral quantum modes (qumodes), forming a quantum analogue of optical frequency combs. Decoherence is minimized to achieve unprecedented two-mode raw squeezing (&gt;3 dB) from a chip. Using bichromatic and trichromatic pump lasers, we realize one- and two-dimensional cluster states with up to 60 qumodes. Our work provides a compact and scalable platform for constructing large-scale entangled quantum resources, which are appealing for performing computational and communicational tasks with quantum advantages.</description>

      <title>Selection rules of linear and nonlinear polarization-selective absorption in optically dressed matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical symmetries of laser-dressed matter determine selection rules that determine its absorption spectrum. We explore selection rules for polarization-sensitive absorption in Floquet matter, using Floquet group theory in synthetic dimensions. We present comprehensive tables of selection rules that polarization-structured light impose on Floquet dark states and Floquet dark bands. Notably, our tables encompass nonlinear absorption, to all nonlinear orders, revealing that different nonlinear orders follow distinct polarization selection rules, potentially leading to polarization-tunable optical filters.</description>

      <title>Color-switching in an optical parametric oscillator using a phase-conjugate mirror</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a phase-conjugate resonator which passively produces stable pulses that alternate between the probe and the conjugate colors. The requisite phase-conjugate mirror inside the resonator is constructed using non-degenerate four-wave mixing (4WM) in rubidium vapor. The glancing-angle phase-conjugate mirror is a 100\% output coupler, and therefore this resonator is unusual in that no light circulates the cavity more than once. Without the gain of the phase-conjugate mirror, the cavity boundary conditions, and thus resonant modes, are not defined and therefore can be tuned by the pump. The output of the optical parametric oscillator that is formed above threshold can passively mode-lock. The phase-conjugate mirror removes thermal or acoustic instabilities that are on a MHz or slower timescale. This work provides a new method for stable pulsing using phase-conjugate optics, and suggests a platform for producing mode-locked pulses with squeezed light, as the 4WM process has already demonstrated quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>Large and layer dependent nonlinear optical absorption of MXene 2D thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a rapidly expanding family of two dimensional (2D) materials, MXenes have recently gained considerable attention due to their appealing properties. Here, by developing a solution based coating method that enables transfer free and layer by layer film coating, we investigate the layer dependent nonlinear optical absorption of Ti3C2Tx films, an important member of the MXene family. By using the Zscan technique, we characterize the nonlinear absorption of the prepared MXene films consisting of different numbers of monolayers. The results show that there is a strong and layer dependent nonlinear absorption behavior, transitioning from revisable saturable absorption (RSA) to saturable absorption (SA) as the layer number increases from 5 to 30. Notably, the nonlinear absorption coefficient beta varies significantly within this range, changing from 7.13 x 100 cm/GW to -2.69 100 cm/GW. We also characterize the power dependent nonlinear absorption of the MXene films at various incident laser intensities, and a decreasing trend in beta is observed for increasing laser intensity. These results reveal the intriguing layer dependent nonlinear optical properties of 2D MXene films, highlighting their versatility and potential for implementing high-performance nonlinear photonic devices.</description>

      <title>General Scintillation for Gaussian Beam Propagating through Oceanic Turbulence and UWOC System Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a general and exact closed-form expression of scintillation index (SI) for a Gaussian beam propagating through weak oceanic turbulence, based on the general oceanic turbulence optical power spectrum (OTOPS) and the Rytov theory. Our universal expression not only includes existing Rytov variances but also accounts for actual cases where the Kolmogorov microscale is non-zero. The correctness and accuracy of our derivation are verified through comparison with the published work under identical conditions. By utilizing our derived expressions, we analyze the impact of various beam, propagation and oceanic turbulence parameters on both SI and bit error rate (BER) performance of underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) systems. Numerical results demonstrate that the relationship between the Kolmogorov microscale and SI is nonlinear. Additionally, considering that certain oceanic turbulence parameters are related to depth, we use temperature and salinity data from Argo buoy deployed in real oceans to investigate the dependence of SI on depth. Our findings will contribute to the design and optimization of UWOC systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic modulation of bound states in the continuum with arbitrary polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex beams with tunable polarization play an essential role in information processing, optical trapping, and biomedical imaging. Conventionally, symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (BICs) at the {\Gamma} point are enclosed by linear far-field polarization. In this work, arbitrarily polarized BICs are realized by tuning the external magnetic fields applied to a magneto-optical (MO) photonic crystal slab (PhCS), enabling coverage of the entire Poincar\'e sphere. Notably, under a proper external magnetic field, excellent chiral emission around the {\Gamma} point with significantly distinct reflection responses can be obtained when illuminated by incident waves with opposite chirality. Furthermore, by breaking the C2 symmetry of the structure, the intrinsic chiral BIC with near-unit circular dichroism at the {\Gamma} point can be observed due to the appearance and movement of circular polarization points (C points). The tunable BICs with arbitrary polarization and the intrinsic chiral BICs, taking advantage of magnetic modulation, can greatly simplify the configuration of optical systems and possess promising potential applications in chiral-optical effects, polarization control, and tunable optical devices.</description>

      <title>Anti-aliased metasurfaces beyond the Nyquist limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling is a pivotal element in the design of metasurfaces, enabling a broad spectrum of applications. Despite its flexibility, sampling can result in reduced efficiency and unintended diffractions, which are more pronounced at high numerical aperture or shorter wavelengths, e.g. ultraviolet spectrum. Prevailing metasurface research has often relied on the conventional Nyquist sampling theorem to assess sampling appropriateness, however, our findings reveal that the Nyquist criterion is insufficient for preventing the diffractive distortion. Specifically, we find that the performance of a metasurface is significantly correlated to the geometric relationship between the spectrum morphology and sampling lattice. Based on lattice-based diffraction analysis, we demonstrate several anti-aliasing strategies from visible to ultraviolet regimes. These approaches significantly reduce aliasing phenomena occurring in high numerical aperture metasurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reveal that chiral response can be achieved in resonant metasurfaces with a monoclinic lattice symmetry (the so-called Bravais oblique lattices) where the mirror symmetry is broken by the lattice asymmetry and by a substrate, while each individual meta-atom remains fully achiral. We describe the underlying mechanism by introducing the mode chirality parameter as a quantitative measure of the lattice chiral eigenmodes. We confirm experimentally selective linear and nonlinear chiral interaction of resonant silicon metasurfaces with circularly polarized light.</description>

      <title>Quantized orbital angular momentums of dipolar magnons and magnetoelectric cavity polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnons are viewed as local deviations from the ordered state. Usually, the spin magnetic moment of magnons is considered. In a 3D-confined structure of a magnetic insulator with magnetodipolar mode (MDM) oscillations, an orbital angular momentum (OAM) as well as a spin angular momentum (SAM) can be observed along a static magnetic field. In such a confined structure as quasi-2D ferrite disk, energy levels of MDM oscillations are quantized. Quantum confinement is characterized by a half-integer internal OAM, which is also associated with a circulating energy flow. The observation of MDM resonances in the 3D-confined structure of a magnetic insulator is due to the interaction of two subsystems: ferromagnetic and electric polarization orders. The coupling states of these two concurrent orders, caused by OAMs, are considered as magnetoelectric (ME) states. The fields in the vicinity of MDM resonators are characterized by simultaneous violation of time reversal and inversion symmetry. This plays a significant role in the problems of strong light-matter interaction regime and quantum atmosphere. The analysis of SAM and OAM in 3D-confined magnetic insulators becomes very important for the realization of ME meta-atomic structures. Current interest lies in considering such artificial systems as subwavelength ME quantum emitters of electromagnetic radiation.</description>

      <title>Topological solitons in coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of multipole topological solitons at the edges of two and three coupled parallel Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) waveguide arrays. We show that independent variations of waveguide spacing in the unit cells (dimers) in coupled waveguide arrays result in the emergence at their edges of several topological edge states with different internal symmetry. The number of emerging edge states is determined by how many arrays are in topologically nontrivial phase. In the presence of nonlinearity, such edge states give rise to families of multipole topological edge solitons with distinct stability properties. Our results illustrate that coupling between quasi-one-dimensional topological structures substantially enriches the variety of stable topological edge solitons existing in them.</description>

      <title>Transverse optical gradient force in untethered rotating metaspinners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce optical metasurfaces as components of ultracompact untethered microscopic metaspinners capable of efficient light-induced rotation in a liquid environment. Illuminated by weakly focused light, a metaspinner generates torque via photon recoil through the metasurfaces' ability to bend light towards high angles despite their sub-wavelength thickness, thereby creating orbital angular momentum. We find that a metaspinner is subject to an anomalous transverse optical gradient force that acts in concert with the classical gradient force. Consequently, when two or more metaspinners are trapped together in a laser beam, they collectively orbit the optical axis in the opposite direction to their spinning motion, in stark contrast to rotors coupled through hydrodynamic or mechanical interactions. The metaspinners delineated herein not only serve to illustrate the vast possibilities of utilizing optical metasurfaces for fundamental exploration of optical torques, but they also represent potential building-blocks of artificial active matter systems, light-driven micromachinery, and general-purpose optomechanical devices.</description>

      <title>Simulation of bright and dark diffuse multiple scattering lines in high-flux synchrotron X-ray experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for understanding diffuse multiple scattering (DMS) in single crystals, focusing on diffuse scattering-Bragg (DS-Bragg) channels. These channels, when probed with high-flux, low-divergent monochromatic synchrotron X-rays, provide well-defined visualizations of Kossel lines. Our main contribution lies in modeling the intensity distribution along these lines by considering DS around individual reciprocal lattice nodes. The model incorporates contributions from both general DS and mosaicity, elucidating their connection to second-order scattering events. This comprehensive approach advances our understanding of DMS phenomena, enabling their use as probes for complex material behavior, particularly under extreme conditions.</description>

Abstract: We present an approach for in situ dynamic four-dimensional (4D=3D space + 1D time) laser induced strong field ionization tomography, particularly suited for measuring far-from-equilibrium systems, such as supersonic and hypersonic pulsed gas jets. The inherent physical nature of strong-field interaction leads to significantly enhanced spatial resolution, with unique intensity-resolution coupling and localization of measurement depth. By employing femtosecond laser, temporal resolution is primarily limited by electronic jitter, typically to a few tens of picoseconds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tellegen medium has long been a topic of debate, with its existence being contested over several decades. It was first proposed by Tellegen in 1948 and is characterized by a real-valued cross coupling between electric and magnetic responses, distinguishing it from the well-known chiral medium that has imaginary coupling coefficients. Significantly, Tellegen responses are closely linked to axion dynamics, an extensively studied subject in condensed matter physics. Here, we report the realization of Tellegen metamaterials in the microwave region through a judicious combination of subwavelength metallic resonators, gyromagnetic materials, and permanent magnet discs. We observe the key signature of the Tellegen response, i.e. a Kerr rotation for reflected wave, while the polarization remains the same in the transmission direction. The retrieved effective Tellegen parameter is several orders of magnitude greater than that of natural materials. Our work opens door to a variety of nonreciprocal photonic devices and may provide a platform for studying axion physics.</description>

      <title>Gain assistant control of photonic spin Hall effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the photonic spin Hall effect (SHE), also known as transverse shift, incident light photons with opposite spins are spatially separated in the transverse direction due to the spin-orbit interaction of light. Here, we propose a gain-assisted model to control the SHE in the reflected probe light. In this model, a probe light is incident on a cavity containing a three-level dilute gaseous atomic medium, where the interaction between the atom and the control field follows two-photon Raman transitions. We show that the direction of photonic spin accumulations can be switched between positive and negative values across the Brewster angle in both the anomalous and normal dispersion regimes. For the same magnitude of control fields, the peak value of the photonic SHE is higher in the anomalous dispersion region compared to the normal dispersion regime. Additionally, the angular range around the Brewster angle is wider in the normal dispersion regime than in the anomalous dispersion region. Furthermore, the peak value of the photonic SHE and the angular range is controllable by changing the Rabi frequencies of the control fields and the probe field detuning. The measurement of photonic SHE based on gain assistance may enable spin-related applications such as optical sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating nanoplasmonics using time-dependent approaches permits shedding light on the dynamic optical properties of plasmonic structures, which are intrinsically connected with their potential applications in photochemistry and photoreactivity. This work proposes a real-time extension of our recently developed fully atomistic approaches $\omega$FQ and $\omega$FQF$\mu$. These methods successfully reproduce quantum size effects in metal nanoparticles, including plasmon shifts for both simple and $d$-metals, even below the quantum size limit. Also, thanks to their atomistic nature and the phenomenological inclusion of quantum tunneling effects, they can effectively describe the optical response of subnanometer junctions. By incorporating real-time dynamics, the approach provides an efficient framework for studying the time-dependent optical behavior of metal nanostructures, including the decoherence of plasmon excitations.</description>

Abstract: Composite pulses, which produce ultrabroadband, ultranarrowband and ultrapassband $x$-, $y$-) rotations by $\theta = \pi$ on the Bloch-Poincar\'e sphere, are presented. The first class plays a role for design of achromatic polarisation retarders, when the second class corresponds to chromatic polarisation filters. The third class is an assortment of the above two classes. Besides, composite pulses, which produce ultrabroadband $z$-) rotations by $\zeta = \pi$ on the same sphere, are presented. These phasal pulses coincide with achromatic polarisation $\pi$ rotators. On the quantum-classical analogy, we obtain ultrarobust, ultrasensitive and ultrasquare quantum control of a $X$ gate and ultrarobust quantum control of a $Z$ gate.</description>

      <title>Gateway to all-optical spin switching in Heusler ferrimagnets: Pancharatnam-Berry tensor and magnetic moment ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All-optical spin switching (AOS) is a new phenomenon found in a small group of magnetic media, where a single laser pulse can switch spins from one direction to another, without assistance of a magnetic field, on a time scale much shorter than existing magnetic technology. However, despite intensive efforts over a decade, its underlying working principle remains elusive. Here through manganese-based Heusler ferrimagnets, we show that a group of flat bands around the Fermi level act as gateway states to form efficient channels or spin switching, where their noncentrosymmetry allows us to correlate the spin dynamics to the second-order optical response. To quantify their efficacy, we introduce the third-rank Pancharatnam-Berry tensor (PB tensor), $\boldsymbol{\eta}^{(3)}=\langle i |{\bf p} |m\rangle \langle m|{\bf p} |f\rangle \langle f|{\bf p} |i\rangle,$ where $|i\rangle$, $|m\rangle$ and $|f\rangle$ are initial, intermediate and final band states, respectively, and ${\bf p}$ is the momentum operator. A picture emerges: Those which show AOS, such as the recently discovered Mn$_2$RuGa, always have a large PB tensor element} but have a small sublattice spin moment ratio, consistent with the prior experimental small remanence criterion. This does not only reveal that the delicate balance between the large PB tensor element and the small sublattice spin ratio plays a decisive role in AOS, but also, conceptually, connects the $n$th-order nonlinear optics to $(n+1)$th-rank PB tensors in general.</description>

      <title>Mask-coding-assisted continuous-variable quantum direct communication with orbital angular momentum multiplexing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) is a approach of communication to transmit secret messages base on quantum mechanics. Different from the quantum key distribution, secret messages can be transmitted directly on quantum channel with QSDC. Higher channel capacity and noise suppression capabilities are key to achieving long-distance quantum communication. Here we report a continuous-variable QSDC scheme based on mask-coding and orbital angular momentum, in which the mask-coding is employed to protect the security of the transmitting messages and to suppression the influence of excess noise. And the combination of orbital angular momentum and the information block transmission can effectively improve the secrecy capacity. In the 800 information blocks * 1310 bits length 10-km experiment, the results show that the statistical average of bit error rate has decreased by 36% and reached 0.38% comparing to existing solutions, and the system excess noise is 0.0184 SNU, and the final secrecy capacity is 6.319 * 106 bps. Therefore, this scheme reduces error bits while increasing secrecy capacity, providing a solution for long-distance large-scale quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Video Frame Interpolation for Polarization via Swin-Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) has been extensively explored and demonstrated, yet its application to polarization remains largely unexplored. Due to the selective transmission of light by polarized filters, longer exposure times are typically required to ensure sufficient light intensity, which consequently lower the temporal sample rates. Furthermore, because polarization reflected by objects varies with shooting perspective, focusing solely on estimating pixel displacement is insufficient to accurately reconstruct the intermediate polarization. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes a multi-stage and multi-scale network called Swin-VFI based on the Swin-Transformer and introduces a tailored loss function to facilitate the network's understanding of polarization changes. To ensure the practicality of our proposed method, this study evaluates its interpolated frames in Shape from Polarization (SfP) and Human Shape Reconstruction tasks, comparing them with other state-of-the-art methods such as CAIN, FLAVR, and VFIT. Experimental results demonstrate our approach's superior reconstruction accuracy across all tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz signals hold significant potential for ultra-wideband communication and high-resolution radar, necessitating miniaturized detectors capable of multi-parameter detection of intensity, frequency, polarization, and phase. Conventional detectors cannot meet these requirements. Here, we propose plasmon polariton atomic cavities (PPAC) made from single-atom-thick graphene, demonstrating the monolithic multifunctional miniaturized detector. With a footprint one-tenth the incident wavelength, the detector offers benchmarking intensity-, frequency-, and polarization-sensitive detection, rapid response, and sub-diffraction spatial resolution, all operating at room temperature across 0.22 to 4.24 THz. We present the monolithic detection applications for free-space THz polarization-coded communication and stealth imaging of physical properties. These results showcase the PPAC's unique ability to achieve strong absorption and weak signal detection with a thickness of only 10^-5 of the excitation wavelength, which is inaccessible with other approaches.</description>

Abstract: Astronomical precision spectroscopy underpins searches for life beyond Earth, direct observation of the expanding Universe and constraining the potential variability of physical constants across cosmological scales. Laser frequency combs can provide the critically required accurate and precise calibration to the astronomical spectrographs. For cosmological studies, extending the calibration with such astrocombs to the ultraviolet spectral range is highly desirable, however, strong material dispersion and large spectral separation from the established infrared laser oscillators have made this exceedingly challenging. Here, we demonstrate for the first time astronomical spectrograph calibrations with an astrocomb in the ultraviolet spectral range below 400 nm. This is accomplished via chip-integrated highly nonlinear photonics in periodically-poled, nano-fabricated lithium niobate waveguides in conjunction with a robust infrared electro-optic comb generator, as well as a chip-integrated microresonator comb. These results demonstrate a viable route towards astronomical precision spectroscopy in the ultraviolet and may contribute to unlocking the full potential of next generation ground- and future space-based astronomical instruments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acousto-optics consists of launching acoustic waves in a medium (usually a crystal) in order to modulate its refractive index and create a tunable optical grating. In this article, we present the theoretical basis of a new scheme to generate acousto-optics in a gas, where the acoustic waves are initiated by the localized absorption (and thus gas heating) of spatially-modulated UV light, as was demonstrated in Y. Michine and H. Yoneda, Commun. Phys. 3, 24 (2020). We identify the chemical reactions initiated by the absorption of UV light via the photodissociation of ozone molecules present in the gas, and calculate the resulting temperature increase in the gas as a function of space and time. Solving the Euler fluid equations shows that the modulated, isochoric heating initiates a mixed acoustic/entropy wave in the gas, whose high-amplitude density (and thus refractive index) modulation can be used to manipulate a high-power laser. We calculate that diffraction efficiencies near 100% can be obtained using only a few millimeters of gas containing a few percent ozone fraction at room temperature, with UV fluences of less than 100 mJ/cm2, consistent with the experimental measurements. Our analysis suggests possible ways to optimize the diffraction efficiency by changing the buffer gas composition. Gases have optics damage thresholds two to three orders of magnitude beyond those of solids; these optical elements should therefore be able to manipulate kJ-class lasers.</description>

Abstract: We developed a reconstruction method for the density matrix and Wigner function of electron beams through analysis of the Airy pattern intensity profile. The density matrix in a transmission electron microscope object plane was calculated using the coherence function and the electron wave amplitude and phase distributions. The Wigner function was then reconstructed using the matrix elements. Based on the Wigner function at the origin of the phase space, we derived a formula to calculate the axial brightness, and then determined the axial brightness of a Schottky field emission gun, which reflects the emitter performance more accurately and precisely than the conventional mean brightness measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.05127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the notion of quantum state designs to infinite-dimensional spaces. We first prove that, under the definition of continuous-variable (CV) state $t$-designs from Comm. Math. Phys. 326, 755 (2014), no state designs exist for $t\geq2$. Similarly, we prove that no CV unitary $t$-designs exist for $t\geq 2$. We propose an alternative definition for CV state designs, which we call rigged $t$-designs, and provide explicit constructions for $t=2$. As an application of rigged designs, we develop a design-based shadow-tomography protocol for CV states. Using energy-constrained versions of rigged designs, we define an average fidelity for CV quantum channels and relate this fidelity to the CV entanglement fidelity. As an additional result of independent interest, we establish a connection between torus $2$-designs and complete sets of mutually unbiased bases.</description>

      <title>On-chip multi-degree-of-freedom control of two-dimensional quantum and nonlinear materials</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional materials (2DM) and their derived heterostructures have electrical and optical properties that are widely tunable via several approaches, most notably electrostatic gating and interfacial engineering such as twisting. While electrostatic gating is simple and has been ubiquitously employed on 2DM, being able to tailor the interfacial properties in a similar real-time manner represents the next leap in our ability to modulate the underlying physics and build exotic devices with 2DM. However, all existing approaches rely on external machinery such as scanning microscopes, which often limit their scope of applications, and there is currently no means of tuning a 2D interface that has the same accessibility and scalability as electrostatic gating. Here, we demonstrate the first on-chip platform designed for 2D materials with in situ tunable interfacial properties, utilizing a microelectromechanical system (MEMS). Each compact, cost-effective, and versatile device is a standalone micromachine that allows voltage-controlled approaching, twisting, and pressurizing of 2DM with high accuracy. As a demonstration, we engineer synthetic topological singularities, known as merons, in the nonlinear optical susceptibility of twisted hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), via simultaneous control of twist angle and interlayer separation. The chirality of the resulting moire pattern further induces a strong circular dichroism in the second-harmonic generation. A potential application of this topological nonlinear susceptibility is to create integrated classical and quantum light sources that have widely and real-time tunable polarization. Our invention pushes the boundary of available technologies for manipulating low-dimensional quantum materials, which in turn opens up the gateway for designing future hybrid 2D-3D devices for condensed-matter physics, quantum optics, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Tunable non-Hermitian skin effect via gain and loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05039v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically tunable non-Hermitian skin effect in systems with gain and loss, and find that bipolar (quadripolar) non-Hermitian skin effect characterized by topological invariants in one (two)-dimensional system. We also find the partial non-Hermitian skin effect with the coexistence of localized states and extended states. Both types of the non-Hermitian skin effect have not yet been predicted together in a single system. A feasible experimental scheme of our model is proposed to realize in electric circuits. Our investigation unveils a new type of non-Hermitian skin effect and enhance the tunability of the non-Hermitian systems by gain and loss other than the conventional non-reciprocal hopping.</description>

      <title>Towards General Neural Surrogate Solvers with Specialized Neural Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surrogate neural network-based partial differential equation (PDE) solvers have the potential to solve PDEs in an accelerated manner, but they are largely limited to systems featuring fixed domain sizes, geometric layouts, and boundary conditions. We propose Specialized Neural Accelerator-Powered Domain Decomposition Methods (SNAP-DDM), a DDM-based approach to PDE solving in which subdomain problems containing arbitrary boundary conditions and geometric parameters are accurately solved using an ensemble of specialized neural operators. We tailor SNAP-DDM to 2D electromagnetics and fluidic flow problems and show how innovations in network architecture and loss function engineering can produce specialized surrogate subdomain solvers with near unity accuracy. We utilize these solvers with standard DDM algorithms to accurately solve freeform electromagnetics and fluids problems featuring a wide range of domain sizes.</description>
