      <title>DTN-COMET: A Comprehensive Operational Metrics Evaluation Toolkit for DTN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Delay- and Disruption-tolerant Networking (DTN) is essential for communication in challenging environments with intermittent connectivity, long delays, and disruptions. Ensuring high performance in these types of networks is crucial because windows for data transmission are sparse and often short. However, research on evaluating DTN implementations is limited. Moreover, existing research relies on manual testing methods that lack reproducibility and scalability. We propose a novel generic framework for reproducible performance evaluation of DTN implementations to address this issue. We validate the framework's accuracy using a physical testbed and compare the uD3TN and ION DTN implementations. This comparison reveals that uD3TN exhibits higher goodput and shorter bundle retention times. On the other hand, ION exhibited superior memory management and fault tolerance, albeit at the cost of sending and receiving performance. Through this comparison, our framework demonstrates the feasibility of developing a generic toolkit for evaluating DTN.</description>

      <title>An Energy-Aware RIoT System: Analysis, Modeling and Prediction in the SUPERIOT Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the energy consumption characteristics of a Silicon (Si)-based Reconfigurable IoT (RIoT) node developed in the initial phase of the SUPERIOT project, focusing on key operating states, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication, Narrow-Band Visible Light Communication (NBVLC), sensing, and E-ink display. Extensive measurements were conducted to establish a detailed energy profile, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of subsequent optimizations and future node iterations. To minimize the energy consumption, multiple optimizations were implemented at both the software and hardware levels, achieving a reduction of over 60% in total energy usage through software modifications alone. Further improvements were realized by optimizing the E-ink display driving waveform and implementing a very low-power mode for non-communication activities. Based on the measured data, three measurement-based energy consumption models were developed to characterize the energy behavior of the node under: (i) normal, unoptimized operation, (ii) low-power, software-optimized operation, and (iii) very low-power, hardware-optimized operation. These models, validated with new measurement data, achieved an accuracy exceeding 97%, confirming their reliability for predicting energy consumption in diverse configurations.</description>

      <title>Analytical Performance Estimations for Quantum Repeater Network Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum repeater chains will form the backbone of future quantum networks that distribute entanglement between network nodes. Therefore, it is important to understand the entanglement distribution performance of quantum repeater chains, especially their throughput and latency. By using Markov chains to model the stochastic dynamics in quantum repeater chains, we offer analytical estimations for long-run throughput and on-demand latency of continuous entanglement distribution. We first study single-link entanglement generation using general multiheralded protocols. We then model entanglement distribution with entanglement swapping over two links, using either a single- or a double-heralded entanglement generation protocol. We also demonstrate how the two-link results offer insights into the performance of general $2^k$-link nested repeater chains. Our results enrich the quantitative understanding of quantum repeater network performance, especially the dependence on system parameters. The analytical formulae themselves are valuable reference resources for the quantum networking community. They can serve as benchmarks for quantum network simulation validation or as examples of quantum network dynamics modeling using the Markov chain formalism.</description>

      <title>TakuNet: an Energy-Efficient CNN for Real-Time Inference on Embedded UAV systems in Emergency Response Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient neural networks for embedded devices is a critical challenge, particularly in applications requiring real-time performance, such as aerial imaging with drones and UAVs for emergency responses. In this work, we introduce TakuNet, a novel light-weight architecture which employs techniques such as depth-wise convolutions and an early downsampling stem to reduce computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy. It leverages dense connections for fast convergence during training and uses 16-bit floating-point precision for optimization on embedded hardware accelerators. Experimental evaluation on two public datasets shows that TakuNet achieves near-state-of-the-art accuracy in classifying aerial images of emergency situations, despite its minimal parameter count. Real-world tests on embedded devices, namely Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi, confirm TakuNet's efficiency, achieving more than 650 fps on the 15W Jetson board, making it suitable for real-time AI processing on resource-constrained platforms and advancing the applicability of drones in emergency scenarios. The code and implementation details are publicly released.</description>
