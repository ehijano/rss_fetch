      <title>In situ axion generation and detection in laser-driven wakefields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a laser-plasma wakefield based schemes for in situ axion generation and detection through the Primakoff process.
  Strong electromagnetic fields ($\gtrsim 10^{9}\,$V/cm) in the wakefield enhance axion production rates by orders of magnitude compared to conventional light-shining-through-wall (LSW) experiments. By replacing the axion generation stage with laser-wakefield interaction, one can achieve the axion-photon coupling constraints to the level of $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\sim 10^{-12}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$.
  Besides, the generated axions can convert back into photons in the background field, leading to axion-regenerated electromagnetic fields (AREM) with unique polarization, frequency, and transverse distribution properties.
  This allows for effective filtering of the AREM from the background field, enhancing signal-to-noise ratios.
  This approach establishes plasma wakefields as a promising platform for laboratory axion searches.</description>

      <title>Particle-based Simulation of an Air-Breathing Electric Propulsion System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel concept called Air-Breathing Electric Propulsion proposes to fly satellites at altitudes in the range 180-250 km, since this would have some advantages for the performance of radio communication and Earth observation equipment. The ABEP satellites compensate the atmospheric drag through a continuous thrust provided by collecting, ionizing and accelerating the residual atmospheric particles. It is clear that the feasibility of this concept will require a significant design and testing effort, performed first on ground and later in orbit. Plasma simulation tools play a fundamental role in the development of this technology, for two main reasons: (i) they can potentially increase dramatically the optimization and testing process of ABEP systems, since on-ground testing and in-orbit demonstrators are costly and time consuming, and (ii) the fidelity of on-ground testing is limited by the finite size and pumping speed of high-vacuum facilities, as well as the means through which the orbital flow is produced. In this paper, we demonstrate a one-way coupled, particle-based simulation strategy for a CubeSat sized ABEP system. The neutral flow in the full geometry of the ABEP system comprising the intake and the thruster is simulated first through Direct Simulation Monte Carlo. Then, the resulting neutral density is used as the input for a Particle-in-Cell simulation of the detailed thruster geometry. The simulations are performed in 3D and within the VKI in-house code Pantera, taking advantage of the fully-implicit energy-conserving scheme.</description>

      <title>Properties and applications of $\rm{Ar-H_2}$ atmospheric pressure plasma jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether for materials processing or medical applications, the use of atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJs) has emerged as a relevant alternative to conventional methods. Within the APPJs research field, the search for innovation aims not only to solve existing problems, but also to explore novel options for generating plasma jets and find new possible applications. In this work, the properties of $\rm{Ar-H_2}$ APPJs generated using two plasma sources, which differ basically in the generated voltage frequency, amplitude and waveform, were studied through electrical, thermal and optical characterization. Discharge and plasma parameters were analyzed as a function of the $\rm{H_2}$ content in the gas mixture, with this parameter varying from $0\%$ to $3.5\%$. In all cases, the discharge power, electron density as well as the rotational, vibrational and gas temperatures presented a trend of growing when the proportion of $\rm{H_2}$ in the gas composition was increased. Optical emission spectroscopy revealed that the same reactive species were produced for both plasma sources, except for nitric oxide (NO), which was observed only for the one operated at higher frequency (PS #1). Applications on polymer (polypropylene, PP) and water treatment were performed using PS #1 without $\rm{H_2}$ and with $3.5\%$ of $\rm{H_2}$ in the gas mixture. NH functional groups were detected on the PP surface in the presence of $\rm{H_2}$ in the gas composition. This indicates a possible way to increase the nitrogen content on polymer surfaces. The results of water treatment revealed that ammonia ($\rm{NH_3}$) is also produced when there is $\rm{H_2}$ in the working gas. This opens an alternative for the use of plasma treated water in agriculture.</description>

      <title>Relative magnetic helicity under turbulent relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic helicity is a quantity that underpins many theories of magnetic relaxation in electrically conducting fluids, both laminar and turbulent. Although much theoretical effort has been expended on magnetic fields that are everywhere tangent to their domain boundaries, many applications, both in astrophysics and laboratories, actually involve magnetic fields that are line-tied to the boundary, i.e. with a non-trivial normal component on the boundary. This modification of the boundary condition requires a modification of magnetic helicity, whose suitable replacement is called relative magnetic helicity. In this work, we investigate rigorously the behaviour of relative magnetic helicity under turbulent relaxation. In particular, we specify the normal component of the magnetic field on the boundary and consider the \emph{ideal limit} of resistivity tending to zero in order to model the turbulent evolution in the sense of Onsager's theory of turbulence. We show that relative magnetic helicity is conserved in this distinguished limit and that, for constant viscosity, the magnetic field can relax asymptotically to a magnetohydrostatic equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Extending the Mott-Gurney law to one-dimensional nonplanar diodes using point transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have applied variational calculus, conformal mapping, and point transformations to generalize the one-dimensional (1D) space-charge limited current density (SCLCD) and electron emission mechanisms to nonplanar geometries; however, these assessments have focused on extending the Child-Langmuir law (CLL) for SCLCD in vacuum. Since the charge in the diode is independent of coordinate system (i.e., covariant), we apply bijective point transformations to extend the Mott-Gurney law (MGL) for the SCLCD in a collisional or semiconductor gap to nonplanar 1D geometries. This yields a modified MGL that replaces the Cartesian gap distance with a canonical gap distance that may be written generally in terms of geometric scale factors that are known for multiple geometries. We tabulate results for common geometries. Such an approach may be applied to any current density, including non-space-charge limited gaps and SCLCD that may fall between the CLL and MGL.</description>

      <title>Exploring nonlinearities in a positive ion-negative ion (PINI) plasma: can other processes mimic debris-induced effects?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11216v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, an analysis of nonlinear waves and structures induced by an external charged debris in a positive ion-negative ion (PINI) plasma is presented. The results obtained are compared with findings from available experiments involving PINI plasma. The process of formation of different nonlinear structures is examined theoretically through a forced Koretweg-de Vries (fKdV) equation, which is also verified with a multi-fluid flux-corrected transport simulation code (mFCT). Various processes which are responsible for different nonlinear waves and structures excited by differently charged external debris are pointed out. This work also points out the similarities in different nonlinear structures excited by an external charged debris and the underlying processes (this work) and those observed experimentally through processes that do not involve any external debris.</description>

      <title>Pair Production in time-dependent Electric field at Finite times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12079v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field. By examining the temporal behavior of the single-particle distribution function, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the various dynamical processes/channels leading to the creation of the (quasi-)particle of a given momentum. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, allowing us to explain these oscillations' origin and behavior. The role of the vacuum polarization function and its counterterm are also discussed in this regard. The transverse momentum spectrum peaked at the nonzero value of the transverse momentum at finite times, which indicates the role of multiphoton transitions in the creation of quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Charged particle motion in a strong magnetic field: Applications to plasma confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the zero order approximation of a charged particle under the influence of a strong magnetic field in a mathematically rigorous manner and clarify in which sense this approximation is valid. We use this to further rigorously derive a displacement formula for the pressure of plasma equilibria and compare our findings to results in the physics literature. The main novelty of our results is a qualitative estimate of the confinement time for optimised plasma equilibria with respect to the gyro frequency. These results are of interest in the context of plasma fusion confinement.</description>
