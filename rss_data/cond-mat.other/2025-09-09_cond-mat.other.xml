      <title>Interacting many-body non-Hermitian systems as Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rich phenomenology emerges at the intersection of non-Hermiticity and many-body dynamics, yet physically realizable implementations remain challenging. In this work, we propose a general formalism that maps non-Hermitian many-body Hamiltonians to the Laplacians of Markov chains, such that wavefunction amplitudes are re-interpreted as stochastic many-body configuration probabilities. Despite explicitly preserving all state transition processes and inheriting analogous non-Hermitian localization and state-space fragmentation, our Markov chain processes exhibit distinct steady-state behavior independently of energetic considerations that govern quantum evolution. We demonstrate our framework with two contrasting representative scenarios, one involving asymmetric (biased) propagation with exclusion interactions, and the other involving flipping pairs of adjacent spins (agents). These results reveal robust and distinctive signatures of non-Hermitian phenomena in classical stochastic settings such as ecological and social networks, and provide a versatile framework for studying non-reciprocal many-body dynamics across and beyond physics.</description>

      <title>Financial Interactions and Collective States Part I. Investors and Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of papers, we applied a field formalism to analyze capital allocation and accumulation within a microeconomic framework of investors and firms. Financial agents could invest in both firms and other investors, while banks, introduced as investors with a credit multiplier, played a stabilizing or destabilizing role. Two types of interactions were considered within the financial sector: financial agents could either lend capital to or buy shares of other investors. We examined the collective states emerging from these interactions. At the macro level, we identified multiple collective states, each characterized by distinct levels of average capital and investor distribution across sectors. These states reflect the inherent instability of financial markets, with some configurations leading to default. At the micro level, we analyzed how returns and defaults propagate within a given collective state, highlighting the critical role of banks in stabilizing or amplifying financial fluctuations. However, these results were derived under the assumption that financial connections were exogenous. The present paper removes this assumption by modeling financial connections as dynamic endogenous variables. Specifically, we extend the framework by introducing a field representation of the network of financial relationships. The collective states previously identified are now embedded in a broader class of states, characterized by the structure of investment shares among investors. We show that these collective states consist of interconnected groups of agents, along with their returns and disposable capital. Depending on the strength and form of connections between agents within each group, collective states may be stable or unstable, allowing for transitions between configurations. In each collective state, some sectors may experience defaults. When the collective state exhibits specific structural conditions, defaults may spread across a significant share of the group.</description>

      <title>Flux Switching Floquet Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of a square-lattice Harper-Hofstadter model with a periodically varying magnetic flux with time. By switching the dimensionless flux per plaquette between a set of values $\{p_j/q_j\}$ the Floquet quasienergy spectrum is folded into Q = lcm$\{q_j\}$ bands. We determine closed form analytical solutions for the quasienergy spectrum and Chern numbers for the -1/2 $\to$ 1/2 flux switching case, as well as the Rudner-Lindner-Berg-Levin (RLBL) winding invariants W numerically, and construct the corresponding topological phase diagram for arbitrary driving period. We find that generic flux-switching drives feature interlaced Hofstadter butterfly quasienergy spectra, and the gaps in the spectrum may be labeled according to a Diophantine equation which relates the quasienergy gap index to the fluxes attained in the drive and their associated per-step windings.</description>

      <title>A microwave-activated high-fidelity three-qubit gate scheme for fixed-frequency superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalable superconducting quantum processors require balancing critical constraints in coherence, control complexity, and spectral crowding. Fixed-frequency architectures suppress flux noise and simplify control via all-microwave operations but remain limited by residual ZZ crosstalk. Here we propose a microwave-activated three-qubit gate protocol for fixed-frequency transmon qubits in the large-detuning regime ($|\Delta| \gg g$), leveraging the third-order nonlinear interaction to coherently exchange $|001\rangle \leftrightarrow |110\rangle$ states. By incorporating a phase-compensated optimization protocol, numerical simulations demonstrate a high average gate fidelity exceeding $99.9\%$. Systematic error analysis identifies static long-range ZZ coupling as the dominant error source in multi-qubit systems, which can be suppressed via operations in the large-detuning regime ($\sim 1$ GHz). This approach simultaneously enhances gate fidelity while preserving spectral isolation, ensuring compatibility with existing all-microwave controlled-Z gate frameworks. The protocol exhibits intrinsic robustness to fabrication-induced qubit parameter variations. This hardware-efficient strategy advances scalable quantum computing systems by improving coherence properties, reducing spectral congestion, and expanding the experimental toolkit for error-resilient quantum operations in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <title>Quantization of spin circular photogalvanic effect in altermagnetic Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically predict a spin-current analog of the quantized circular photogalvanic effect in Weyl semimetals. This phenomenon is forbidden in antiferromagnets by symmetry but uniquely allowed in altermagnets, highlighting a novel and intrinsic characteristic of altermagnetism. To systematically explore second-order spin current responses, we classify all symmetry-allowed responses based on spin point groups. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive classification of altermagnetic Weyl semimetals by identifying spin space groups that host symmetry-enforced Weyl points. Utilizing this classification, we construct a symmetry-guided tight-binding model and confirm our predictions. Finally, we identify Weyl crossings in a material candidate via first-principle calculations. Our work unveils a distinctive optical response of altermagnets, paving the way for a new frontier in altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Emergent collective heat engines from neighborhood-dependent thermal reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05715v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a class of heat engines composed of interacting units, in which the thermal reservoir is associated with the neighborhood surrounding each unit. These systems can be mapped onto stochastic opinion models and are characterized by collective behavior at low temperatures, as well as different types of phase transitions, marked by spontaneous symmetry breaking and classifications that depend on topology and neighborhood. For the case of contact with two thermal baths, equivalent to each unit having $k = 4$ nearest neighbors, the system can be tuned to operate at maximum power without sacrificing efficiency or increasing dissipation. These quantities are related by the general expression $ \beta_2 {\cal P} \eta_c =-J_4 \eta \sigma$ when the worksource stems from different interaction energies. The heat engine placed in contact with more than three reservoirs is more revealing, showing that the intermediate thermal reservoir can be conveniently adjusted to achieve the desired compromise between power, efficiency, and dissipation. The influence of lattice topology (regular and random-regular networks), its relationship with collective operation as well as the distinct ratios between the temperatures of the thermal baths, has also been investigated.</description>

      <title>Decay of two-dimensional superfluid turbulence over pinning surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the free decay of quasi-two-dimensional turbulence in superfluid $^4$He confined within nanofluidic channels. Using a pump-probe technique, we observe a complex decay of the vortex density $L(t)$ that deviates from a simple power law. The decay exhibits a universal fast transient, scaling as $L\propto t^{-2}$, followed by a slower non-universal regime that depends on the geometry and flow conditions. We demonstrate that this behavior is governed by the interplay between vortex pinning on the disordered topography of the channel walls and the mobilizing effect of the weak probe flow. A numerical model that treats pinning as a velocity-dependent effective mutual friction successfully reproduces the essential features of our experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Kinetic equation from Landau level basis: Beyond relaxation-time approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to formulate a kinetic theory describing transport properties of electrons in a uniform magnetic field of arbitrary magnitude. Exposing an electronic system to a constant magnetic field quenches its energy bands into a series of discrete energy levels, known as Landau levels. The Landau-level states, exact solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation in a constant background magnetic field, are natural and suitable basis to use, especially, for the investigation of strong-magnetic-field phenomena. Starting from the Keldysh formalism, we derive the quantum kinetic equation from the Landau-level basis. As an illustration, we apply the kinetic equation to calculate the electrical conductivity of a two-dimensional electron gas exposed to a perpendicular magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Exchange spin-wave propagation in Ga:YIG nanowaveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-wave-based computing has emerged as a promising approach to overcome the fundamental limitations of CMOS technologies. However, the increasing demand for device miniaturization down to a 100 nm scale presents significant challenges for long-distance spin-wave transport. Gallium-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Ga:YIG) offers a potential solution to these challenges due to its unique magnetic properties. The reduced saturation magnetization in Ga:YIG enables efficient excitation of exchange-dominated spin waves, which exhibit enhanced transport characteristics compared to dipolar-dominated modes in conventional materials. Here, we present the first comprehensive study combining experimental, analytical, and numerical investigations of spin-wave propagation in Ga:YIG waveguides down to 145 nm width and 73 nm thickness. Using micro-focused Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy, TetraX simulations, and analytical dispersion calculations, we demonstrate that Ga:YIG waveguides support spin waves with significantly higher group velocities up to 600 m/s. This value remains constant for structures with different widths, leading to longer spin-wave propagation lengths in nanowaveguides compared to non-substituted YIG. These results reveal that gallium substitution provides access to faster and longer-lived spin waves, opening new possibilities for implementing this material in nanoscale magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo description of correlated electrons in two-dimensional FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An interesting question in physics is how the correlation energy of atoms evolves upon forming a solid. Here, we address this problem for a specific case of double-layer FeSe. We used many-body wavefunction-based quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques to compute the correlation energies of double-layer FeSe with different geometrical configurations and compared them with those of isolated Fe and Se atoms. Variational and diffusion QMC calculations were carried out with Slater Jastrow trial wavefunctions employing two alternative forms for the homogeneous two-body pair correlation term. The ground-state energy was obtained in the thermodynamic limit using two types of trial wave functions of JDFT, in which only the Jastrow factor is optimized while the Slater determinant is derived from the local density approximation, and JSD, where both the Jastrow factor and the Slater determinant are optimized simultaneously. Our results indicate that the correlation energy of double layer FeSe at the thermodynamic limit is mainly determined by the atomic contributions, with the bonding between atoms playing a comparatively minor role in it. After optimizing the interlayer separation of double-layer FeSe under tensile strain, we analyze the correlation energy as a function of strain and separation. We found that with increasing tensile stretch and interlayer spacing, the correlation energy of double-layer FeSe stochastically approaches that of its constituent atomic fragments.</description>

      <title>Bloch oscillation with a diatomic tight-binding model on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We aim to explore a more efficient way to simulate few-body dynamics on quantum computers. Instead of mapping the second quantization of the system Hamiltonian to qubit Pauli gates representation via the Jordan-Wigner transform, we propose to use the few-body Hamiltonian matrix under the statevector basis representation which is more economical on the required number of quantum registers. For a single-particle excitation state on a one-dimensional chain, $\Gamma$ qubits can simulate $N=2^\Gamma$ number of sites, in comparison to $N$ qubits for $N$ sites via the Jordan-Wigner approach. A two-band diatomic tight-binding model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the statevector basis representation. Both one-particle and two-particle quantum circuits are constructed and some numerical tests on IBM hardware are presented.</description>
