      <title>Poisson Network SIR Epidemic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to a network-based framework where the degree distribution of nodes follows a Poisson distribution. This extension incorporates an additional parameter representing the mean node degree, allowing for the inclusion of heterogeneity in contact patterns. Using this enhanced model, we analyze epidemic data from the 2018-20 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, employing a survival approach combined with the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method. Our results suggest that network-based models can more effectively capture the heterogeneity of epidemic dynamics compared to traditional compartmental models, without introducing unduly overcomplicated compartmental framework.</description>

      <title>Evolution of mutating pathogens in networked populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epidemic spreading over populations networks has been an important subject of research for several decades, and especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Most epidemic outbreaks are likely to create multiple mutations during their spreading over the population. In this paper, we study the evolution of a pathogen which can mutate continuously during the epidemic spreading. We consider pathogens whose mutating parameter is the mortality mean-time, and study the evolution of this parameter over the spreading process. We use analytical methods to compute the dynamic equation of the epidemic and the conditions for it to spread. We also use numerical simulations to study the pathogen flow in this case, and to understand the mutation phenomena. We show that the natural selection leads to less violent pathogens becoming predominant in the population. We discuss a wide range of network structures and show how different effects are manifested in each case.</description>

      <title>Infectious diseases, imposing density-dependent mortality on MHC/HLA variation, can account for balancing selection and MHC/HLA polymorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human MHC transplantation loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DPB1, -DQB1, -DRB1) are the most polymorphic in the human genome. It is generally accepted this polymorphism reflects a role in presenting pathogen-derived peptide to the adaptive immune system. Proposed mechanisms for the polymorphism such as negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS) and heterozygote advantage (HA) focus on HLA alleles, not haplotypes. Here, we propose a model for the polymorphism in which infectious diseases impose independent density-dependent regulation on HLA haplotypes. More specifically, a complex pathogen environment drives extensive host polymorphism through a guild of HLA haplotypes that are specialised and show incomplete peptide recognition. Separation of haplotype guilds is maintained by limiting similarity. The outcome is a wide and stable range of haplotype densities at steady-state in which effective Fisher fitnesses are zero. Densities, and therefore frequencies, emerge theoretically as alternative measures of fitness. A catalogue of ranked frequencies is therefore one of ranked fitnesses. The model is supported by data from a range of sources including a Caucasian HLA dataset compiled by the US National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). These provide evidence of positive selection on the top 350-2000 5-locus HLA haplotypes taken from an overall NMDP sample set of 10E5. High-fitness haplotypes drive the selection of 137 high-frequency alleles spread across the 5 HLA loci under consideration. These alleles demonstrate positive epistasis and pleiotropy in the formation of haplotypes. Allelic pleiotropy creates a network of highly inter-related HLA haplotypes that account for 97% of the census sample. We suggest this network has properties of a quasi-species and is itself under selection. We also suggest this is the origin of balancing selection in the HLA system.</description>

      <title>Electrical networks and data analysis in phylogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A classic problem in data analysis is studying the systems of subsets defined by either a similarity or a dissimilarity function on $X$ which is either observed directly or derived from a data set. For an electrical network there are two functions on the set of the nodes defined by the resistance matrix and the response matrix either of which defines the network completely. We argue that these functions should be viewed as a similarity and a dissimilarity function on the set of the nodes moreover they are related via the covariance mapping also known as the Farris transform or the Gromov product. We will explore the properties of electrical networks from this point of view. It has been known for a while that the resistance matrix defines a metric on the nodes of the electrical networks. Moreover for a circular electrical network this metric obeys the Kalmanson property as it was shown recently. We will call such a metric an electrical Kalmanson metric. The main results of this paper is a complete description of the electrical Kalmanson metrics in the set of all Kalmanson metrics in terms of the geometry of the positive Isotropic Grassmannian whose connection to the theory of electrical networks was discovered earlier. One important area of applications where Kalmanson metrics are actively used is the theory of phylogenetic networks which are a generalization of phylogenetic trees. Our results allow us to use in phylogenetics the powerful methods of reconstruction of the minimal graphs of electrical networks and possibly open the door into data analysis for the methods of the theory of cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Impact of inter-city interactions on disease scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inter-city interactions are critical for the transmission of infectious diseases, yet their effects on the scaling of disease cases remain largely underexplored. Here, we use the commuting network as a proxy for inter-city interactions, integrating it with a general scaling framework to describe the incidence of seven infectious diseases across Brazilian cities as a function of population size and the number of commuters. Our models significantly outperform traditional urban scaling approaches, revealing that the relationship between disease cases and a combination of population and commuters varies across diseases and is influenced by both factors. Although most cities exhibit a less-than-proportional increase in disease cases with changes in population and commuters, more-than-proportional responses are also observed across all diseases. Notably, in some small and isolated cities, proportional rises in population and commuters correlate with a reduction in disease cases. These findings suggest that such towns may experience improved health outcomes and socioeconomic conditions as they grow and become more connected. However, as growth and connectivity continue, these gains diminish, eventually giving way to challenges typical of larger urban areas - such as socioeconomic inequality and overcrowding - that facilitate the spread of infectious diseases. Our study underscores the interconnected roles of population size and commuter dynamics in disease incidence while highlighting that changes in population size exert a greater influence on disease cases than variations in the number of commuters.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Control of Evolutionary and Ecological Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As Evolutionary Dynamics moves from the realm of theory into application, algorithms are needed to move beyond simple models. Yet few such methods exist in the literature. Ecological and physiological factors are known to be central to evolution in realistic contexts, but accounting for them generally renders problems intractable to existing methods. We introduce a formulation of evolutionary games which accounts for ecology and physiology by modeling both as computations and use this to analyze the problem of directed evolution via methods from Reinforcement Learning. This combination enables us to develop first-of-their-kind results on the algorithmic problem of learning to control an evolving population of cells. We prove a complexity bound on eco-evolutionary control in situations with limited prior knowledge of cellular physiology or ecology, give the first results on the most general version of the mathematical problem of directed evolution, and establish a new link between AI and biology.</description>

      <title>Frequency-dependent returns in nonlinear public goods games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When individuals interact in groups, the evolution of cooperation is traditionally modeled using the framework of public goods games. These models often assume that the return of the public good depends linearly on the fraction of contributors. In contrast, in real life public goods interactions, the return can depend on the size of the investor pool as well. Here, we consider a model in which the multiplication factor (marginal per capita return) for the public good depends linearly on how many contribute, which results in a nonlinear model of public goods. This simple model breaks the curse of dominant defection found in linear public goods interactions and gives rise to richer dynamical outcomes in evolutionary settings. We provide an in-depth analysis of the more varied decisions by the classical rational player in nonlinear public goods interactions as well as a mechanistic, microscopic derivation of the evolutionary outcomes for the stochastic dynamics in finite populations and in the deterministic limit of infinite populations. This kind of nonlinearity provides a natural way to model public goods with diminishing returns as well as economies of scale.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a mathematical model for malaria using data-driven approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Malaria is one of the deadliest diseases in the world, every year millions of people become victims of this disease and many even lose their lives. Medical professionals and the government could take accurate measures to protect the people only when the disease dynamics are understood clearly. In this work, we propose a compartmental model to study the dynamics of malaria. We consider the transmission rate dependent on temperature and altitude. We performed the steady state analysis on the proposed model and checked the stability of the disease-free and endemic steady state. An artificial neural network (ANN) is applied to the formulated model to predict the trajectory of all five compartments following the mathematical analysis. Three different neural network architectures namely Artificial neural network (ANN), convolution neural network (CNN), and Recurrent neural network (RNN) are used to estimate these parameters from the trajectory of the data. To understand the severity of a disease, it is essential to calculate the risk associated with the disease. In this work, the risk is calculated using dynamic mode decomposition(DMD) from the trajectory of the infected people.</description>

      <title>An evolutionary game theory approach to modeling behavioral interaction in disclosing infection begins with an outbreak: COVID-19 as an example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the livelihoods of people worldwide prompted the implementation of a range of preventive measures at local, national, and international levels. Early in the outbreak, before the vaccine became accessible, voluntary quarantine and social isolation emerged as crucial strategies to curb the spread of infection. In this research, we present a game-theoretic model to elucidate the voluntary disclosure of exposure to infected individuals within communities. By employing a fractional derivative approach to illustrate disease propagation within the compartmental model, we determine the minimum level of voluntary disclosure required to disrupt the chain of transmission and allow the epidemic to fade. Our findings suggest that higher transmission rates and increased perceived severity of infection change the externality of disclosing infected exposure, thereby contributing to a rise in the proportion of individuals opting for quarantine and reducing disease incidence. We estimate behavioral parameters and transmission rates by fitting the model to hospitalized cases in Chile, South America. Results from our paper underscore the potential for public health authorities to influence and regulate voluntary disclosure of infection during emerging outbreaks through effective risk communication, emphasizing the severity of the disease, and providing accurate information about hospital capacity to the public.</description>
