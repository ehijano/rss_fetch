      <title>Reducing COVID-19 Misinformation Spread by Introducing Information Diffusion Delay Using Agent-based Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the explosive growth of the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19), misinformation on social media has developed into a global phenomenon with widespread and detrimental societal effects. Despite recent progress and efforts in detecting COVID-19 misinformation on social media networks, this task remains challenging due to the complexity, diversity, multi-modality, and high costs of fact-checking or annotation. In this research, we introduce a systematic and multidisciplinary agent-based modeling approach to limit the spread of COVID-19 misinformation and interpret the dynamic actions of users and communities in evolutionary online (or offline) social media networks. Our model was applied to a Twitter network associated with an armed protest demonstration against the COVID-19 lockdown in Michigan state in May, 2020. We implemented a one-median problem to categorize the Twitter network into six key communities (nodes) and identified information exchange (links) within the network. We measured the response time to COVID-19 misinformation spread in the network and employed a cybernetic organizational method to monitor the Twitter network. The overall misinformation mitigation strategy was evaluated, and agents were allocated to interact with the network based on the measured response time and feedback. The proposed model prioritized the communities based on the agents response times at the operational level. It then optimized agent allocation to limit the spread of COVID19 related misinformation from different communities, improved the information diffusion delay threshold to up to 3 minutes, and ultimately enhanced the mitigation process to reduce misinformation spread across the entire network.</description>

      <title>Quantifying gendered citation imbalance in computer science conferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of citations received by papers often exhibits imbalances in terms of author attributes such as country of affiliation and gender. While recent studies have quantified citation imbalance in terms of the authors' gender in journal papers, the computer science discipline, where researchers frequently present their work at conferences, may exhibit unique patterns in gendered citation imbalance. Additionally, understanding how network properties in citations influence citation imbalances remains challenging due to a lack of suitable reference models. In this paper, we develop a family of reference models for citation networks and investigate gender imbalance in citations between papers published in computer science conferences. By deploying these reference models, we found that homophily in citations is strongly associated with gendered citation imbalance in computer science, whereas heterogeneity in the number of citations received per paper has a relatively minor association with it. Furthermore, we found that the gendered citation imbalance is most pronounced in papers published in the highest-ranked conferences, is present across different subfields, and extends to citation-based rankings of papers. Our study provides a framework for investigating associations between network properties and citation imbalances, aiming to enhance our understanding of the structure and dynamics of citations between research publications.</description>

      <title>Why distinctiveness centrality is distinctive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper responds to a commentary by Neal (2024) regarding the Distinctiveness centrality metrics introduced by Fronzetti Colladon and Naldi (2020). Distinctiveness centrality offers a novel reinterpretation of degree centrality, particularly emphasizing the significance of direct connections to loosely connected peers within (social) networks. This response paper presents a more comprehensive analysis of the correlation between Distinctiveness and the Beta and Gamma measures. All five distinctiveness measures are considered, as well as a more meaningful range of the {\alpha} parameter and different network topologies, distinguishing between weighted and unweighted networks. Findings indicate significant variability in correlations, supporting the viability of Distinctiveness as alternative or complementary metrics within social network analysis. Moreover, the paper presents computational complexity analysis and simplified R code for practical implementation. Encouraging initial findings suggest potential applications in diverse domains, inviting further exploration and comparative analyses.</description>

      <title>SEAtech: Deception Techniques in Social Engineering Attacks: An Analysis of Emerging Trends and Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social Engineering is the act of manipulating individuals to perform actions or reveal information. Social engineering tactics are widely recognized as a significant risk to information security. The increasing digital environment has increased the prevalence of social engineering attacks, bringing huge threats to both people and organizations. This paper explores current deception techniques used during social engineering attacks to understand emerging trends and discuss effective countermeasures. It is always a good idea to have knowledge of counter measures and risks from these increasing cyber threats. We have also explored the types of deception attacks and role of social engineering in Advanced Persistent Threats. Today major concern for cybersecurity and other web related attacks is due to social engineering attacks that is also the driving force of increasing cybercrimes worldwide. By uncovering emerging trends and analyzing the psychological underpinnings of these attacks this paper highlights the known deception techniques, emerging trends and counter measures of social engineering attacks.</description>

      <title>Fast Estimation of Percolation Centrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a new algorithm to approximate the percolation centrality of every node in a graph. Such a centrality measure quantifies the importance of the vertices in a network during a contagious process. In this paper, we present a randomized approximation algorithm that can compute probabilistically guaranteed high-quality percolation centrality estimates, generalizing techniques used by Pellegrina and Vandin (TKDD 2024) for the betweenness centrality. The estimation obtained by our algorithm is within $\varepsilon$ of the value with probability at least $1-\delta$, for fixed constants $\varepsilon,\delta \in (0,1)$. We our theoretical results with an extensive experimental analysis on several real-world networks and provide empirical evidence that our algorithm improves the current state of the art in speed, and sample size while maintaining high accuracy of the percolation centrality estimates.</description>

      <title>"I don't see myself represented here at all": User Experiences of Stable Diffusion Outputs Containing Representational Harms across Gender Identities and Nationalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though research into text-to-image generators (T2Is) such as Stable Diffusion has demonstrated their amplification of societal biases and potentials to cause harm, such research has primarily relied on computational methods instead of seeking information from real users who experience harm, which is a significant knowledge gap. In this paper, we conduct the largest human subjects study of Stable Diffusion, with a combination of crowdsourced data from 133 crowdworkers and 14 semi-structured interviews across diverse countries and genders. Through a mixed-methods approach of intra-set cosine similarity hierarchies (i.e., comparing multiple Stable Diffusion outputs for the same prompt with each other to examine which result is 'closest' to the prompt) and qualitative thematic analysis, we first demonstrate a large disconnect between user expectations for Stable Diffusion outputs with those generated, evidenced by a set of Stable Diffusion renditions of `a Person' providing images far away from such expectations. We then extend this finding of general dissatisfaction into highlighting representational harms caused by Stable Diffusion upon our subjects, especially those with traditionally marginalized identities, subjecting them to incorrect and often dehumanizing stereotypes about their identities. We provide recommendations for a harm-aware approach to (re)design future versions of Stable Diffusion and other T2Is.</description>

      <title>Brief state of the art in social information mining: Practical application in analysis of trends in French legislative 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of social media information has undergone significant evolution in the last decade due to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art techniques in social media mining, with a practical application in analyzing trends in the 2024 French legislative elections. We leverage natural language processing (NLP) tools to gauge public opinion by extracting and analyzing comments and reactions from the AgoraVox platform. The study reveals that the National Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen, maintains a high level of engagement on social media, outperforming traditional parties. This trend is corroborated by user interactions, indicating a strong digital presence. The results highlight the utility of advanced AI models, such as transformers and large language models (LLMs), in capturing nuanced public sentiments and predicting political leanings, demonstrating their potential in real-time reputation management and crisis response.</description>

      <title>Gender differences in collaboration and career progression in physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine gender differences in collaboration networks and academic career progression in physics. We use the likelihood and time to become a principal investigator (PI) and the length of an author's career to measure career progression. Utilising logistic regression and accelerated failure time models, we examine whether the effect of collaboration behaviour varies by gender. We find that, controlling for the number of publications, the relationship between collaborative behaviour and career progression is almost the same for men and women. Specifically, we find that those who eventually reach principal investigator (PI) status, tend to have published with more unique collaborators. In contrast, publishing repeatedly with the same highly interconnected collaborators and/or larger number of coauthors per publication is characteristic of shorter career lengths and those that do not attain PI status. We observe that the tie strength is stronger for women than men, and women tend to collaborate in more tightly connected and larger groups than men. Finally, we observe that women are less likely to attain the status of PI throughout their careers and have a lower survival probability compared to men, which calls for policies to close this crucial gap.</description>

      <title>Operationalizing content moderation "accuracy" in the Digital Services Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09601v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Digital Services Act, recently adopted by the EU, requires social media platforms to report the "accuracy" of their automated content moderation systems. The colloquial term is vague, or open-textured -- the literal accuracy (number of correct predictions divided by the total) is not suitable for problems with large class imbalance, and the ground truth and dataset to measure accuracy against is unspecified. Without further specification, the regulatory requirement allows for deficient reporting. In this interdisciplinary work, we operationalize "accuracy" reporting by refining legal concepts and relating them to technical implementation. We start by elucidating the legislative purpose of the Act to legally justify an interpretation of "accuracy" as precision and recall. These metrics remain informative in class imbalanced settings, and reflect the proportional balancing of Fundamental Rights of the EU Charter. We then focus on the estimation of recall, as its naive estimation can incur extremely high annotation costs and disproportionately interfere with the platform's right to conduct business. Through a simulation study, we show that recall can be efficiently estimated using stratified sampling with trained classifiers, and provide concrete recommendations for its application. Finally, we present a case study of recall reporting for a subset of Reddit under the Act. Based on the language in the Act, we identify a number of ways recall could be reported due to underspecification. We report on one possibility using our improved estimator, and discuss the implications and areas for further legal clarification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a nation-wide network analysis of non-fatal opioid-involved overdose journeys in the United States. Leveraging a unique proprietary dataset of Emergency Medical Services incidents, we construct a journey-to-overdose geospatial network capturing nearly half a million opioid-involved overdose events spanning 2018-2023. We analyze the structure and sociological profiles of the nodes, which are counties or their equivalents, characterize the distribution of overdose journey lengths, and investigate changes in the journey network between 2018 and 2023. Our findings include that authority and hub nodes identified by the HITS algorithm tend to be located in urban areas and involved in overdose journeys with particularly long geographical distances.</description>

      <title>SIGMA: Similarity-based Efficient Global Aggregation for Heterophilous Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) realize great success in graph learning but suffer from performance loss when meeting heterophily, i.e. neighboring nodes are dissimilar, due to their local and uniform aggregation. Existing attempts of heterophilous GNNs incorporate long-range or global aggregations to distinguish nodes in the graph. However, these aggregations usually require iteratively maintaining and updating full-graph information, which limits their efficiency when applying to large-scale graphs. In this paper, we propose \aggname{}, an efficient global heterophilous GNN aggregation integrating the structural similarity measurement SimRank. Our theoretical analysis illustrates that \aggname{} inherently captures distant global similarity even under heterophily, that conventional approaches can only achieve after iterative aggregations. Furthermore, it enjoys efficient one-time computation with a complexity only linear to the node set size $\mathcal{O}(n)$. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that \aggname{} achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior aggregation and overall efficiency. Notably, it obtains 5$\times$ acceleration on the large-scale heterophily dataset \emph{pokec} with over 30 million edges compared to the best baseline aggregation.</description>

      <title>A Review on Knowledge Graphs for Healthcare: Resources, Applications, and Promises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04802v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Healthcare knowledge graphs (HKGs) are valuable tools for organizing biomedical concepts and their relationships with interpretable structures. The recent advent of large language models (LLMs) has paved the way for building more comprehensive and accurate HKGs. This, in turn, can improve the reliability of generated content and enable better evaluation of LLMs. However, the challenges of HKGs such as regarding data heterogeneity and limited coverage are not fully understood, highlighting the need for detailed reviews. This work provides the first comprehensive review of HKGs. It summarizes the pipeline and key techniques for HKG construction, as well as the common utilization approaches, i.e., model-free and model-based. The existing HKG resources are also organized based on the data types they capture and application domains they cover, along with relevant statistical information (Resource available at https://github.com/lujiaying/Awesome-HealthCare-KnowledgeBase). At the application level, we delve into the successful integration of HKGs across various health domains, ranging from fine-grained basic science research to high-level clinical decision support and public health. Lastly, the paper highlights the opportunities for HKGs in the era of LLMs. This work aims to serve as a valuable resource for understanding the potential and opportunities of HKG in health research.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Graph Embedding based on Local Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph embedding has become a powerful tool for learning latent representations of nodes in a graph. Despite its superior performance in various graph-based machine learning tasks, serious privacy concerns arise when the graph data contains personal or sensitive information. To address this issue, we investigate and develop graph embedding algorithms that satisfy local differential privacy (LDP). We introduce a novel privacy-preserving graph embedding framework, named PrivGE, to protect node data privacy. Specifically, we propose an LDP mechanism to obfuscate node data and utilize personalized PageRank as the proximity measure to learn node representations. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the privacy guarantees and utility offered by the PrivGE framework. Extensive experiments on several real-world graph datasets demonstrate that PrivGE achieves an optimal balance between privacy and utility, and significantly outperforms existing methods in node classification and link prediction tasks.</description>
