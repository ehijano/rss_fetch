      <title>A note on the tetrahedral index and the Hahn-Exton q-Bessel function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this short note is twofold: First to elucidate some connections between the ``building block'' of Dimofte--Gaiotto--Gukov's $3$D index, known as the tetrahedral index $I_\Delta (m,e)$, and Hahn--Exton's $q$-analogue of the Bessel function $J_\nu (z;q)$. The correspondence between $I_\Delta$ and $J_\nu$ will allow us to translate useful relations from one setting to the other. Second, we want to introduce to the $q$-hypergeometric community some possibly new techniques, theory and conjectures arising from applications of physical mathematics to geometric topology.</description>

      <title>Cusp cross-section phenomena for arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although every flat manifold occurs as a cusp cross-section in at least one commensurability class of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds, it turns out that some flat manifolds have the property that they occur as cusp cross-sections in precisely one commensurability class of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds -- a phenomena which we will refer to as the UCC property. We construct flat manifolds with the UCC property in all dimensions $ n \geq 32 $. We also show that the number of distinct commensurability classes containing cusp cross-sections with the UCC property is unbounded. We also exhibit pairs of manifolds in all dimensions $ n \geq 24 $ that cannot arise as cusp cross-sections in the same commensurability class of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds.
  The main tool is previous work of the authors algebraically characterizing when a given flat manifold arises as the cusp cross-section of a manifold in a given commensurability class of arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds.</description>

      <title>Spherical Knot Mosaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of a spherical knot mosaic where a knot is represented by tiling the surface of an n by n by n topological 2-sphere with 11 canonical knot mosaic tiles and show this gives rise to several novel knot (and link) invariants: the spherical mosaic number, spherical tiling number, minimal spherical mosaic tile number, spherical face number, spherical n-mosaic face number, and minimal spherical mosaic face number. We show examples where this framework is an improvement over classical knot mosaics. Furthermore, we explore several bounds involving other classical knot invariants that these spherical mosaic invariants gives rise to.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing Power of 4-Legendrian Permutation Racks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore 4-Legendrian rack structures and the effectiveness of 4-Legendrian racks to distinguish Legendrian knots. We prove that permutation racks with a 4-Legendrain rack structure cannot distinguish sets of Legendrian knots with the same knot type, Thurston-Bennequin number, and rotation number.</description>

      <title>More Automorphism Groups of Quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the displacement group of the dihedral quandle with n elements is isomorphic to the group generated by rotations of the n/2-gon when n is even and the n-gon when n is odd. We additionally show that any quandle with at least one trivial column has equivalent displacement and inner automorphism groups. Then, using a known enumeration of quandles which we confirm up to order 10, we verify the automorphism group and the inner automorphism group of all quandles (up to isomorphism) of orders less than or equal to 7, compute these for all 115,431 quandles orders 8, 9, and 10, and extend these results by computing the displacement group of all 115,837 quandles (up to isomorphism) of order less than or equal to 10.</description>

      <title>The Wiegold problem and free products of left-orderable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A group has normal rank (or weight) greater than one if no single element normally generates the group. The Wiegold problem from 1976 asks about the existence of a finitely generated perfect group of normal rank greater than one. We show that any free product of nontrivial left-orderable groups has normal rank greater than one. This solves the Wiegold problem by taking free products of finitely generated perfect left-orderable groups, a plethora of which are known to exist. We obtain our estimate of normal rank by a topological argument, proving a type of spectral gap property for an unsigned version of stable commutator length. A key ingredient in the proof is an intricate new construction of a family of left-orders on free products of two left-orderable groups.</description>

      <title>Towards a symplectic Khovanov homology for links in fibered $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is twofold: (i) define a symplectic Khovanov type homology for a transverse link in a fibered closed $3$-manifold $M$ (with an auxiliary choice of a homotopy class of loops that intersect each fiber once) and (ii) give conjectural combinatorial dga descriptions of surface categories that appear in (i). These dgas are higher-dimensional analogs of the strands algebras in bordered Heegaard Floer homology, due to Lipshitz-Ozsv\'ath-Thurston \cite{LOT}.</description>

      <title>On 3-manifolds admitting co-orientable taut foliations, but none with vanishing Euler class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we construct infinitely many (small Seifert fibred, hyperbolic and toroidal) rational homology $3$-spheres that admit co-orientable taut foliations, but none with vanishing Euler class. In the context of the $L$-space conjecture, these examples provide rational homology $3$-spheres that admit co-orientable taut foliations (and hence are not $L$-spaces) and have left-orderable fundamental groups, yet none of the left orders arise directly from the universal circle actions associated to co-orientable taut foliations.
  The hyperbolic and non-Seifert toroidal examples are obtained from Dehn surgeries on knots in the $3$-sphere and use Heegaard Floer homology to obstruct the existence of a co-orientable foliation with vanishing Euler class. For the Seifert fibred case, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the Euler class of the normal bundle of the Seifert fibration to vanish. Moreover, when the base orbifold is hyperbolic, we also provide a second proof of this condition from the viewpoint of discrete faithful representations of Fuchsian groups.</description>

      <title>The Kervaire conjecture and the minimal complexity of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09811v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kervaire conjecture asserts that adding a generator and then a relator to a nontrivial group always results in a nontrivial group. We introduce new methods from stable commutator length to study this type of problems about nontriviality of one-relator quotients. Roughly, we show that surfaces in certain HNN extensions bounding a given word have complexity no less than the complexity of its boundary. A consequence of this is a Freiheitssatz theorem for HNN extensions, which in particular implies and gives a new proof of Klyachko's theorem that confirms the Kervaire conjecture for torsion-free groups. As another application, we also generalize the following theorem of Klyachko-Lurye to HNN extensions: For any group $G$ and the quotient $Q$ of $G\star\mathbb{Z}$ by any proper power $w^m$ with $w\in G\star\mathbb{Z}$ projecting to $1\in\mathbb{Z}$, the natural map $G\to Q$ is injective.</description>

      <title>Simplicial cell decompositions of $\mathbb{CP}^{\hspace{.3mm}n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to a well-known result in geometric topology, we have \linebreak $\left (\mathbb{S}^2 \right)^{n}\!\!/\operatorname{Sym}(n) = \mathbb{CP}^{n}$, where $\operatorname{Sym}(n)$ acts on $\left (\mathbb{S}^2 \right)^{n}$ by coordinate permutation. We use this fact to explicitly construct a regular simplicial cell decomposition of $\mathbb{CP}^{n}$ for each $n \geq 2$. In more detail, we start with the standard two triangle crystallisation $S^2_3$ of the $2$-sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$, in its $n$-fold Cartesian product. We then construct a simplicial subdivision of this product and prove that the $\operatorname{Sym}(n)$ quotient of this subdivision yields a simplicial cell decomposition of $\mathbb{CP}^n$. The first derived subdivision of this cell complex is a simplicial triangulation of $\mathbb{CP}^n$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first explicit description of triangulations of $\mathbb{CP}^n$ for $n \geq 4$.</description>

Abstract: Let $F:(\mathbb{C}^2,0)\to (\mathbb{C}^n,0)$ be the germ of a finite map and $(X,0)$ be its image. We will in this article using the topology of the link show that $(X,0)$ has to be a quotient singularity if it is normal and describe the possible topological types. Including a discussion of the groups and examples of how to construct a map to a given topology. We will also discuss the case when the image is not normal.</description>
