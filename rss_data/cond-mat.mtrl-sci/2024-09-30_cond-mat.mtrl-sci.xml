      <title>Vibrational and electronic properties of the B$_7$Al$_2$ cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to explore the structure of boron clusters doped with two aluminium atoms (B$_7$Al$_2$ or Al$_2$B$_7$). The results show that the most stable structure is a bipyramidal configuration formed by a B$_7$ ring coordinated with two Al atoms, while the higher energy isomers correspond to peripheral Al$_2$-doped B$_7$ structures. The IR spectra and density of states reveal remarkable differences between the global minimum and the higher energy isomers.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice couplings in $3d$ ferromagnets: analysis from first-principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelasticity plays a crucial role in numerous magnetic phenomena, including magnetocalorics, magnon excitation via acoustic waves, and ultrafast demagnetization/Einstein-de Haas effect. Despite a long-standing discussion on anisotropy-mediated magnetoelastic interactions of relativistic origin, including \textit{ab-initio} calculations, the exchange-mediated magnetoelastic parameters within an atomistic framework have only recently begun to be investigated. As a result, many of their behaviors and values for real materials remain poorly understood. Therefore, by using a proposed simple modification of the embedded cluster approach that reduces the computational complexity, we critically analyze the properties of exchange-mediated spin-lattice coupling parameters for elemental $3d$ ferromagnets (bcc Fe, fcc Ni, and fcc Co), comparing methods used for their extraction and relating their realistic values to symmetry considerations and orbitally-decomposed contributions. Additionally, we investigate the effects of noncollinearity (spin temperature) and applied pressure on these parameters. For Fe, we find that single-site rotations, associated with spin temperatures around $\sim100$ K, induce significant modifications, particularly in Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-type couplings; in contrast, such interactions in Co and Ni remain almost configuration independent. Moreover, we demonstrate a notable change in the exchange-mediated magnetoelastic constants for Fe under isostatic compression. Finally, the conversion between atomistic, quantum-mechanically derived parameters and the phenomenological magnetoelastic theory is discussed, which can be an useful tool towards larger and more realistic dynamics simulations involving coupled subsystems.</description>

      <title>Sulfur and sulfur-oxide compounds as potential optically active defects on SWCNTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) containing sp3-type defects are a promising class of optoelectronic materials, demonstrating single photon emission and long-lived spins. The defect introduces new optical transitions due to both symmetry breaking induced band splitting and introduction of in-gap electronic states. We investigate sulfur-oxide containing compounds as a new class of optically active dopants on (6,5) SWCNT. The SWCNT is exposed to sodium dodecyl sulfate with the resulting compound displaying a red-shifted and bright photoluminescence peak that is characteristic of sp3 doping. Density functional theory calculations are then performed on the adsorbed compounds that may arise (S, SO, SO2 and SO3). These calculations indicate that the two smallest molecules strongly bind to the SWCNT with binding energies of ~ 1.5-1.7 eV and 0.56 eV for S and SO, respectively. Moreover, these adsorbates introduce in-gap electronic states into the bandstructure of the tube consistent with the measured red-shift of (0.1-0.3) eV. Our study suggests that sulfur-based compounds are promising new dopants for (6,5) SWCNT with tunable electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Understanding the chemical and structural variability in the efficiency of band edge optical transitions of 2D monolayer materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a high-throughput density functional theory calculation and comprehensive analysis of the momentum matrix elements between the band edges across a wide range of nonmagnetic two-dimensional monolayer materials with direct band gaps. The primary objectives of our study were twofold: (i) to identify and rank the materials as potential optical emitters and (ii) to enhance our understanding of the physical and chemical factors that determine the strength of the optical coupling. The momentum matrix elements range from nearly 0 to 1.13 at.u., depending on the specific structure and composition of the materials. By comparison, the most prominent group III-V bulk semiconductors have momentum matrix elements on the order of 1 at.u., indicating the high potential of two-dimensional monolayer materials as optical emitters. We applied a criterion derived from the atomic orbital selection rules for electronic transitions. Finally, we examined the prominent family of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides, which exhibited high optical coupling and low criterion values. We propose a connection between the significant contribution to the momentum matrix elements for interband optical transitions and the anomalous Born effective charge phenomena. The implications of this phenomenon are such that, unlike materials that exhibit conventional Born effective charges, in which increased ionicity leads to diminished optical coupling. If the anomalous situation is present, it arises from a distinctive charge transfer and bonding mechanism, resulting in a positive correlation between ionicity and the optical coupling.</description>

      <title>Achieving Different Stoichiometries and Morphologies in Vapor Phase Deposition of Inorganic Halide Perovskites: Single or Dual Precursor Sources?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inorganic halide perovskites have become attractive for many optoelectronic applications due to their outstanding properties. While chemical synthesis techniques have been successful in producing high-quality perovskite crystals, scaling up to wafer-scale thin films remains challenging. Vapor deposition methods, particularly physical vapor deposition and chemical vapor deposition, have emerged as potential solutions for large-scale thin film fabrication. However, the control of phase purity during deposition remains problematic. Here, we investigate single-source (CsPbBr3) and dual-source (CsBr and PbBr2) vapor deposition techniques to achieve phase-pure CsPbBr3 thin films. Utilizing Knudsen Effusion Mass Spectrometry, we demonstrate that while the single-source CsPbBr3 evaporation is partially congruent, it leads to compositional changes in the evaporant over time. The dual-source evaporation, with a precise control of the PbBr2/CsBr flux ratio, can improve phase purity, particularly at elevated substrate temperatures at excess PbBr2 conditions. Our results give direct evidence that the growth is CsBr-limited. Overall, our findings provide critical insights into the vapor phase deposition processes, highlighting the importance of evaporation conditions in achieving the desired inorganic perovskite stoichiometry and morphology.</description>

      <title>Kekul\'e distortions in graphene on cadmium sulfide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deposition of a two-dimensional material on the surface of a three-dimensional crystal can generate superlattices with electronic properties modified through the proximity spin-orbit effect. In this study, we found that Kekul\'e graphene superlattices are obtained by placing graphene on Cd-terminated (001)-(1$\times$1) cadmium sulfide (CdS) surface. From an effective model of Kekul\'e superlattices, which is corroborated by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, we identified that the puckered surfqace of CdS modifies the on-site energies (staggered potential) and C-C bonds, giving rise to two possible $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ hexagonal superlattices, which are known as Kekul\'e-O graphene and Kekul\'e-Y with a quadratic band crossing point. Both Kekul\'e superlattices present spin-orbit coupling due to the interaction of graphene with the CdS surface. To guide the experimental realization of Kekul\'e superlattices based on graphene/CdS heterostructures, we simulate electron diffraction patterns, as well as images from High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM), and Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy in the mode of High Angle Annular Dark Field (STEM-HAADF).</description>

      <title>Highly Antioxidative Lithium Salt Enables High-Voltage Ether Electrolyte for Lithium Metal Battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ether-based electrolytes exhibit excellent compatibility with Li metal anodes, but their instability at high voltages limits their use in high-voltage Li metal batteries. To address this issue, we introduce an alternative perfluorobutane sulfonate (LiPFBS) / dimethoxyethane (DME) electrolyte to stabilize DME in a 4.6 V Li-Li LCO battery. Our study focuses on the formation of solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI) layers compared to the LiTFSI/DME electrolyte. We demonstrate that LiPFBS helps maintain DME's compatibility in SEI formation. Additionally, a durable CEI layer derived from PFBS$^{-}$ enhances the performance of the cell at high voltages by forming a robust, inorganic-dominant CEI layer. A PFBS$^{-}$-derived CEI significantly enhances the overall performance of the full cell under high voltage conditions.</description>

      <title>Record-large magnetically driven polarization in room temperature ferromagnets Os$X_2$ monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetically induced ferroelectrics in multiferroics provide an optimal approach to pursuit intrinsically strong magnetoelectricity. However, the complex antiferromagnetism, faint magnetically induced polarization, and low working temperatures make their magnetoelectric performance incompetent from the applications demands. Here, a family of two-dimensional $5d$ halides Os$X_2$ monolayers is predicted to be ferroelectric and ferromagnetic above room temperature. More interestingly, benefiting from the strong spin-orbital coupling and high-spin state of Os$^{2+}$ ion, the magnetically induced ferroelectric polarization can reach $5.9$ $\mu$C/cm$^2$, a record-large value in type-II multiferroics. The magnetoelectric effect, that is, controlling ferroelectric polarization by magnetic field has been demonstrated, and magnetically driven ferrovalley also emerges in this system. This work provides an effective way to solve the main defects of type-II multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Strain-tunable Dirac semimetal phase transition and emergent superconductivity in a borophane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional (2D) Dirac semimetal with concomitant superconductivity has been long sought but rarely reported. It is believed that light-element materials have the potential to realize this goal owing to their intrinsic lightweight and metallicity. Here, based on the recently synthesized $\beta_{12}$ hydrogenated borophene [Science 371, 1143 (2021)], we investigate its counterpart named $\beta_{12}$-$ \rm {B_5H_3}$. Our first-principles calculations suggest it has good stability. $\beta_{12}$-$ \rm {B_5H_3}$ is a scarce Dirac semimetal demonstrating a strain-tunable phase transition from three Dirac cones to a single Dirac cone. Additionally, $\beta_{12}$-$ \rm {B_5H_3}$ is also a superior phonon-mediated superconductor with a superconducting critical temperature of 32.4 K and can be further boosted to 42 K under external strain. The concurrence of Dirac fermions and superconductivity, supplemented with dual tunabilities, reveals $\beta_{12}$-$ \rm {B_5H_3}$ is an attractive platform to study either quantum phase transition in 2D Dirac semimetal or the superconductivity or the exotic physics brought about by their interplay.</description>

      <title>Giant Magneto-Exciton Coupling in 2D van der Waals CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling magnetic order via external fields or heterostructures enables precise manipulation and tracking of spin and exciton information, facilitating the development of high-performance optical spin valves. However, the weak magneto-optical signals and instability of two dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials have hindered comprehensive studies on the complex coupling between magnetic order and excitons in bulk-like systems. Here, we leverage magneto-optical spectroscopy to reveal the impact of magnetic order on exciton-phonon coupling and exciton-magnetic order coupling which remains robust even under non-extreme temperature conditions (80 K) in thick layered CrSBr. A 0.425T in-plane magnetic field is sufficient to induce spin flipping and transition from AFM to ferromagnetic (FM) magnetic order in CrSBr, while magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy under an out-of-plane magnetic field provides direct insight into the complex spin canting behavior in thicker layers. Theoretical calculations reveal that the strong coupling between excitons and magnetic order, especially the 32 meV exciton energy shift during magnetic transitions, stems from the hybridization of Cr and S orbitals and the larger exciton wavefunction radius of higher-energy B excitons. These findings offer new opportunities and a solid foundation for future exploration of 2D AFM materials in magneto-optical sensors and quantum communication using excitons as spin carriers.</description>

      <title>Magnon-mediated exciton-exciton interaction in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons are fundamental excitations that govern the optical properties of semiconductors. Interacting excitons can lead to various emergent phases of matter and large nonlinear optical responses. In most semiconductors, excitons interact via exchange interaction or phase space filling. Correlated materials that host excitons coupled to other degrees of freedom offer hitherto unexplored pathways for controlling these interactions. Here, we demonstrate magnon-mediated excitonic interactions in CrSBr, an antiferromagnetic semiconductor. This interaction manifests as the dependence of exciton energy on exciton density via a magnonic adjustment of the spin canting angle. Our study demonstrates the emergence of quasiparticle-mediated interactions in correlated quantum materials, leading to large nonlinear optical responses and potential device concepts such as magnon-mediated quantum transducers.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we explore the electronic properties and chemical bonding in the recently discovered mineral zaykovite, the first natural rhodium selenide Rh$_3$Se$_4$. We comprehensively studied the bulk electronic structure, hybridization of rhodium and selenium orbitals, and the influence of spin-orbit interaction on the electronic spectrum, as well as inspected its topological properties. Besides, we investigated the surface electronic structure of zaykovite and revealed the anisotropic Rashba-type spin splitting in the surface states. In addition, using calculations of the phonon spectra and enthalpy of formation we predicted the family of similar selenides based on other $4d$ and $5d$ transition metals such as Ir, Pd, and Pt. The structural and electronic properties of these materials are discussed.</description>

      <title>Atomically Flat Dielectric Patterns for Band Gap Engineering and Lateral Junction Formation in MoSe$_2$ Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining a precise sputter etching method with subsequent AlO$_x$ growth within an atomic layer deposition chamber enables fabrication of atomically flat lateral patterns of SiO$_2$ and AlO$_x$. The transfer of MoSe$_2$ monolayers onto these dielectrically modulated substrates results in formation of lateral heterojunctions, with the flat substrate topography leading to minimal strain across the junction. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements show significant variations in the contact potential difference (CPD) across the interface, with AlO$_x$ regions inducing a 230~mV increase in CPD. Spatially resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals shifts in spectral weight of neutral and charged exciton species across the different dielectric regions. On the AlO$_x$ side, the Fermi energy moves closer to the conduction band, leading to a higher trion-to-exciton ratio, indicating a bandgap shift consistent with CPD changes. In addition, transient reflection spectroscopy highlights the influence of the dielectric environment on carrier dynamics, with the SiO$_2$ side exhibiting rapid carrier decay typical of neutral exciton recombination. In contrast, the AlO$_x$ side shows slower, mixed decay behavior consistent with conversion of trions back into excitons. These results demonstrate how dielectric substrate engineering can tune the electronic and optical characteristics of proximal two-dimensional materials, allowing scalable fabrication of advanced junctions for novel (opto)electronics applications.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fundamental Building Blocks: Plasticity in Structurally Complex Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermetallics, which encompass a wide range of compounds, often exhibit similar or closely related crystal structures, resulting in various intermetallic systems with structurally derivative phases. This study examines the hypothesis that deformation behavior can be transferred from fundamental building blocks to structurally related phases using the binary samarium-cobalt system. We investigate SmCo$_2$ and SmCo$_5$ as fundamental building blocks and compare them to the structurally related SmCo$_3$ and Sm$_2$Co$_{17}$ phases. Nanoindentation and micropillar compression tests were performed to characterize the primary slip systems, complemented by generalized stacking fault energy calculations via atomic-scale modeling. Our results show that while elastic properties of the structurally complex phases follow a rule of mixtures, their plastic deformation mechanisms are more intricate, influenced by the stacking and bonding nature within the crystal's building blocks. These findings underscore the importance of local bonding environments in predicting the mechanical behavior of structurally related intermetallics, providing crucial insights for the development of high-performance intermetallic materials.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical response of magnetic semiconductors EuCd2X2 (X= P, As, Sb)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we identify EuCd2X2 (for X = P, As, Sb) as a series of magnetic semiconductors. We examine how the band gap of the series responds to X changing from phosphorus (P), to arsenic (As), and finally antimony (Sb). We characterize the samples using electronic transport and magnetization measurements. Based on infrared spectroscopy, we find that the band gap reduces progressively from 1.23 eV in EuCd2P2, to 0.77 eV in EuCd2As2, and finally 0.52 eV in EuCd2Sb2. In a magnetic field, all three systems show a strong response and their band gaps decrease at 4 K. This decrease is non-monotonic as we change X. It is strongest in the phosphorous compound and weakest in the antimony compound. For all the three compositions, EuCd2X2 remains a semiconductor up to the highest magnetic field applied (16 T).</description>

      <title>Quantum nuclear motion in silicene: Assessing structural and vibrational properties through path-integral simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the interplay between quantum nuclear motion and anharmonicity, which causes nontrivial effects on the structural and dynamical characteristics of silicene, a two-dimensional (2D) allotrope of silicon with interesting electronic and mechanical properties. Employing path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulations, we investigate the quantum delocalization of nuclei, unraveling its impact on the behavior of silicene at the atomic scale. Our study reveals that this delocalization induces significant deviations in the structural parameters of silicene, influencing in-plane surface area, bond lengths, angles, compressibility, and overall lattice dynamics. Through extensive simulations, we delve into the temperature-dependent behavior between 25 and 1200 K, unveiling the role of quantum nuclear fluctuations in dictating thermal expansion and phonon spectra. The extent of nuclear quantum effects is assessed by comparing results of PIMD simulations using an efficient tight-binding Hamiltonian, with those obtained from classical molecular dynamics simulations. We compare the magnitude of quantum effects in this material with those in other related 2D crystalline solids, such as graphene and SiC monolayers. The observed quantum effects showcase non-negligible deviations from classical predictions, emphasizing the need for accurate quantum treatments in understanding the material's behavior at finite temperatures. At low $T$, the 2D compression modulus of silicene decreases by a 14% due to quantum nuclear motion.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity of Cubic Silicon Carbide Single Crystals Heavily Doped by Nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-purity cubic silicon carbide possesses the second-highest thermal conductivity among large-scale crystals, surpassed only by diamond, making it crucial for practical applications of thermal management. Recent theoretical studies predict that heavy doping reduces the thermal conductivity of 3C-SiC via phonon-defect and phonon-electron scattering. However, experimental evidence has been limited. In this work, we report the thermal conductivity of heavily nitrogen doped 3C SiC single crystals, grown using the top-seeded solution growth method, measured via time domain thermoreflectance. Our results show that a significant reduction (up to 30%) in thermal conductivity is observed with nitrogen doping concentrations around 1020 cm-3. A comparison with theoretical calculations indicates less intensive scatterings are observed in the measured thermal conductivity. We speculate that the electron-phonon scattering may have a smaller impact than previously anticipated or the distribution of defects are nonuniform which leads to less intensive scatterings. These findings shed light on understanding the doping effects on thermal transport in semiconductors and support further exploration of 3C SiC for thermal management in electronics.</description>

      <title>Enabling P-type Conduction in Bilayer WS2 with NbP Topological Semimetal Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are promising for low-power complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) electronics, which require ultrathin n- and p-type transistor channels. Among 2D semiconductors, WS2 is expected to have good conduction for both electrons and holes, but p-type WS2 transistors have been difficult to realize due to the relatively deep valence band and the presence of mid-gap states with conventional metal contacts. Here, we report topological semimetal NbP as p-type electrical contacts to bilayer WS2 with up to 5.8 microamperes per micron hole current at room temperature; this is the highest to date for sub 2 nm thin WS2 and more than 50 times larger than with metals like Ni or Pd. The p-type conduction is enabled by the simultaneously high work function and low density of states of the NbP, which reduce Fermi level pinning. These contacts are sputter-deposited at room temperature, an approach compatible with CMOS fabrication, a step towards enabling ultrathin WS2 semiconductors in future nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Scanning Thermal Microscopy method for self-heating in non-linear devices and application to current filaments in resistive RAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resistive RAM (RRAM) devices are candidates for neuromorphic computing devices in which the functionality lies in the formation and reversible rupture and gap-closing of conducting filaments in insulating layers. To explore the thermal properties of these nanoscale filaments, Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) can be employed. However, since RRAM devices, as well as many other neuromorphic device types, have a non-linear resistance-voltage relationship, the high resolution and quantitative method of AC-modulated SThM cannot readily be used. To this end, an extended non-equilibrium scheme for temperature measurement using SThM is proposed, with which the self-heating of non-linear devices is studied without the need for calibrating the tip-sample contact for a specific material combination, geometry or roughness. Both a DC and an AC voltage are applied to the device, triggering a periodic temperature rise, which enables the simultaneous calculation of the tip-sample thermal resistance and the device temperature rise. The method is applied to $\mathrm{HfO_2}$-based RRAM devices to extract properties like the number of current filaments, thermal confinement and thermal cross-talk. This approach could be applied to other thermometry techniques, including infrafred imaging and Raman thermometry.</description>

      <title>Exploring Intrinsic Bond Orbitals in Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the construction and spatial properties of localized Wannier orbitals in large supercells of insulating solids. The well-known Pipek-Mezey (PM) functional in combination with intrinsic atomic orbitals (IAOs) as projectors is employed, resulting in so-called intrinsic bond orbitals (IBOs). Independent of the bonding type and band gap, a correlation between orbital spreads and geometric properties is observed. As a result, comparable sparsity patterns of the Hartree-Fock exchange matrix are found across all considered bulk 3D materials, exhibiting covalent bonds, ionc bonds, and a mixture of both bonding types. Recognizing the considerable computational effort required to construct localized Wannier orbitals for large periodic simulation cells, we address the performance and scaling of different solvers for the localization problem. This includes the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS), limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS), Conjugate-Gradient (CG), and the Steepest Ascent (SA) method. Each algorithm performs a Riemannian optimization under unitary matrix constraint, efficiently reaching the optimum in the "curved parameter space" on geodesics. Also the Direct Inversion in the Iterative Subspace (DIIS) technique is employed. We observe that the construction of Wannier orbitals for supercells of metal oxides presents a significant challenge, requiring approximately one order of magnitude more iteration steps than other systems studied.</description>

Abstract: Partial complementary energy densities are introduced through partial Legendre transforms from the strain energy density of linear elasticity. They have mixed components of the strain and stress tensors. Mixed variational principles based on these energy densities are presented. It is shown that these variational principles are useful in the derivation of two- and one-dimensional theories of elastic plates and rods.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning Guided Search for Phonon-mediated Superconductivity in Boron and Carbon Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a workflow that iteratively combines \textit{ab-initio} calculations with a machine-learning (ML) guided search for superconducting compounds with both dynamical stability and instability from imaginary phonon modes, the latter of which have been largely overlooked in previous studies. Electron-phonon coupling (EPC) properties and critical temperature (T$_c$) of 417 boron, carbon, and borocarbide compounds have been calculated with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and isotropic Eliashberg approximation. Our study addresses T$_c$ convergence of Brillouin zone sampling with an ansatz test, stabilizing imaginary phonon modes for significant EPC contributions and comparing performance of two ML models especially when including compounds of dynamical instability. We predict a few promising superconducting compounds with formation energy just above the ground state convex hull, such as Ca$_5$B$_3$N$_6$ (35 K), TaNbC$_2$ (28.4 K), Nb$_3$B$_3$C (16.4 K), Y$_2$B$_3$C$_2$ (4.0 K), Pd$_3$CaB (7.0 K), MoRuB$_2$ (15.6 K), RuVB$_2$ (15.0 K), RuSc$_3$C$_4$ (6.6 K) among others.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Torque Driven Chiral Domain Wall Motion in Mn3Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncollinear chiral antiferromagnets, such as Mn3X (X = Sn, Ge), have garnered significant interest in spintronics due to their topologically protected Weyl nodes and large momentum-space Berry curvatures. In this study, we report rapid chirality domain-wall (CDW) motion in Mn3Sn, driven by spin-orbit torque at over 545.3 m.s^-1 a remarkably low current density of 9 10^10 A.m^-2. The results demonstrate that the chirality of the domain wall and the direction of the current collectively determine the displacement direction of the CDW. Theoretically, we provide ananalysis of the effective field experienced by the octupole moment, uncovering the underlying motion mechanism based on the unique profile of the chiral spin structure. Notably, CDWs with opposite chirality can form within the same Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction sample, and the Neel-like CDW type is dictated by the orientation of the kagome plane rather than the negligible magnetostatic energy associated with the small magnetization (approximately 3.957 10^-3). Additionally, the CDW, with a considerable width of 770 nm, is segmented into three 60 portions due to the six-fold anisotropy in Mn3Sn. These emphasize that CDW motion in Mn3Sn cannot be quantitatively studied using ferromagnetic frameworks. We also demonstrate that a small external field can effectively regulate CDW velocity. Our comprehensive results and theoretical analysis provide crucial guidelines for integrating antiferromagnet CDWs into functional spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Defect density quantification in monolayer MoS2 using helium atom micro-diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sulfur vacancy defects mediate a wide range of optoelectronic properties in MoS2, with precise control of defect density allowing for tuneable optoelectronic devices. However, accurate measurement of defect density in monolayer and few-layer samples poses a challenge due to their small scattering cross-sections to photon or electron probes. Conventional lab-based techniques such as Raman and photoluminescence can infer approximate defect density in micro-scale samples via optoelectronic properties, but they require validation using stoichiometric beam-line XPS. We introduce an ultra-low energy (~64 meV) and non-intrusive lab-based technique to quantify the surface defect density in micron-scale monolayer MoS2. Here we show that a recently developed technique, helium atom micro-diffraction (referred to as scanning helium microscopy (SHeM) in literature), can be used to directly measure vacancy-type defect density in 2D materials by performing atom diffraction from a microscopic spot. SHeM uses a neutral, inert, and thermal energy probe of helium-4 atoms to measure ordered and disordered atom-surface scattering allowing the level of surface order to be inferred. The presented method enables rapid, non-damaging, and material-agnostic lab-based quantification of defect density in 2D materials, a crucial step towards the wider adoption of 2D semiconductors in devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin metal-organic framework films grown in a layer-by-layer manner have been the subject of growing interest. Herein we investigate one of the most popular frameworks, type HKUST-1. Firstly, we show a synthesis procedure resulting in quick but optically perfect growth. This enables the synthesis of films of excellent optical quality within a short timeframe. Secondly and most importantly, we address the already known, but not fully understood observation that the expected monolayer growth is strongly exceeded in every single deposition cycle. This is an often-ignored contradiction in the literature. We offer a growth model using mid-cycle reconstruction process leading to a mathematically determined reconstruction-by-reconstruction (RbR) cycle growth with a 4-times higher growth rate representing an up-to-now hidden chemical assembly mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The altermagnet candidate Mn5Si3 has attracted wide attention in the context of non-relativistic spin physics, due to its composition of light elements. However, the presumed structure of the altermagnetic phase had yet to be demonstrated. In this study, we demonstrate a hallmark of altermagnetism in Mn5Si3 thin films, namely the three options, or variants, for the checkerboard distribution of the magnetic Mn atoms. The magnetic symmetries were altered by field-rotation of the N\'eel vector along relevant crystal directions, resulting in anomalous Hall effect anisotropy. The experimental results in nanoscale devices were corroborated by a theoretical model involving atomic site dependent anisotropy and bulk Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction for a single variant.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Thermodynamic Foundation of the Grand-potential Phase Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Choosing the correct free energy functional is critical when developing thermodynamically-consistent phase field models. We show that the grand-potential phase field model minimizes the Helmholtz free energy. While both functionals are at a minimum at equilibrium, the Helmholtz free energy decreases monotonically with time in the grand-potential phase field model, whereas the grand potential does not. Minimizing the grand potential implies a different problem where a system can exchange mass with its surroundings at every point, leading to a condition of iso-chemical-potential and invalidating mass conservation of the system.</description>

      <title>Electronic anisotropy and rotational symmetry breaking at a Weyl semimetal/spin ice interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In magnetic pyrochlore materials, the interplay of spin-orbit coupling, electronic correlations, and geometrical frustration gives rise to exotic quantum phases, including topological semimetals and spin ice. While these phases have been observed in isolation, the interface-driven phenomena emerging from their interaction have never been realized previously. Here, we report on the discovery of interfacial electronic anisotropy and rotational symmetry breaking at a heterostructure consisting of the Weyl semimetal Eu2Ir2O7 and spin ice Dy2Ti2O7. Subjected to magnetic fields, we unveil a six-fold anisotropic transport response that is theoretically accounted by a Kondo-coupled heterointerface, where the spin ice's field-tuned magnetism induces electron scattering in the Weyl semimetal's topological Fermi-arc states. Furthermore, at elevated magnetic fields, we reveal a two-fold anisotropic response indicative of a new symmetry-broken many-body state. This discovery showcases the nascent potential of complex quantum architectures in search of emergent phenomena unreachable in bulk crystals.</description>

      <title>Electrical Spectroscopy of Polaritonic Nanoresonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most captivating properties of polaritons is their capacity to confine light at the nanoscale. This confinement is even more extreme in two-dimensional (2D) materials. 2D polaritons have been investigated by optical measurements using an external photodetector. However, their effective spectrally resolved electrical detection via far-field excitation remains unexplored. This fact hinders their potential exploitation in crucial applications such as sensing molecules and gases, hyperspectral imaging and optical spectrometry, banking on their potential for integration with silicon technologies. Herein, we present the first electrical spectroscopy of polaritonic nanoresonators based on a high-quality 2D-material heterostructure, which serves at the same time as the photodetector and the polaritonic platform. We employ metallic nanorods to create hybrid nanoresonators within the hybrid plasmon-phonon polaritonic medium in the mid and long-wave infrared ranges. Subsequently, we electrically detect these resonators by near-field coupling to a graphene pn-junction. The nanoresonators simultaneously present a record of lateral confinement and high-quality factors of up to 200, exhibiting prominent peaks in the photocurrent spectrum, particularly at the underexplored lower reststrahlen band of hBN. We exploit the geometrical and gate tunability of these nanoresonators to investigate their impact on the photocurrent spectrum and the polaritonic's waveguided modes. This work opens a venue for studying this highly tunable and complex hybrid system, as well as for using it in compact platforms for sensing and photodetection applications.</description>

      <title>Shaping terahertz waves using anisotropic shear modes in a van der Waals mineral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Naturally occurring van der Waals (vdW) materials are currently attracting significant interest due to their potential as low-cost sources of two-dimensional materials. Valuable information on vdW materials' interlayer interactions is present in their low-frequency rigid-layer phonon spectra, which are experimentally accessible by terahertz spectroscopy techniques. In this work, we have used polarization-sensitive terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to investigate a bulk sample of the naturally abundant, large bandgap vdW mineral clinochlore. We observed a strong and sharp anisotropic resonance in the complex refractive index spectrum near 1.13 THz, consistent with our density functional theory predictions for shear modes. Polarimetry analysis revealed that the shear phonon anisotropy reshapes the polarization state of transmitted THz waves, inducing Faraday rotation and ellipticity. Furthermore, we used Jones formalism to discuss clinochlore phononic symmetries and describe our observations in terms of its eigenstates of polarization. These results highlight the potential of exploring vdW minerals as central building blocks for vdW heterostructures with compelling technological applications.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Simulation and Machine Learning Facilitated Design of Two-Dimensional Nanomaterials-Based Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional transistors based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) and metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) are facing significant limitations as device scaling reaches the limits of Moore's Law. These limitations include increased leakage currents, pronounced short-channel effects (SCEs), and quantum tunneling through the gate oxide, leading to higher power consumption and deviations from ideal behavior. Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors (TFETs) can overcome these challenges by utilizing quantum tunneling of charge carriers to switch between on and off states and achieve a subthreshold swing (SS) below 60 mV/decade. This allows for lower power consumption, continued scaling, and improved performance in low-power applications. This review focuses on the design and operation of TFETs, emphasizing the optimization of device performance through material selection and advanced simulation techniques. The discussion will specifically address the use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in TFET design and explore simulation methods ranging from multi-scale (MS) approaches to machine learning (ML)-driven optimization.</description>

      <title>Experimentally validated and empirically compared machine learning approach for predicting yield strength of additively manufactured multi-principal element alloys from Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, yield strength prediction relies on detailed and resource-intensive microstructural characterization combined with empirical equations. However, quantifying microstructural feature length scales for novel processes like additive manufacturing, which involves inhomogeneous hierarchical features, poses a challenge. The lack of accurate material constants for broader composition ranges further limits empirical predictions. This study proposes an alternative machine learning (ML) approach for predicting the yield strength of additively manufactured (AM) multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) from the Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni system by correlating composition, printing parameters, and testing conditions. The best-performing ML model achieved an R2 of 0.84, comparable to that achieved using microstructural detail-driven empirical strengthening contributions. The validity of the ML approach was further confirmed by printing and testing two compositions (one novel and one from the dataset). This data-driven approach directly relates yield strength to initial printing parameters, highlighting their significance and individual effects, such as scan velocity's direct impact and laser power's inverse impact on yield strength. This demonstrates ML's potential to guide AM processes, reducing the need for iterative experiments and enabling rapid exploration of compositional and printing spaces to achieve desired properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to evaluate the Gibbs free energy from constant-volume first-principles phonon calculations. The volume integral of the pressure is performed by determining the volume and the bulk modulus in equilibrium at finite temperatures, where the pressure and its volume derivative are evaluated utilizing first-principles calculations of the Gr\"{u}neisen parameter without varying the volume. As an example, the validity of our method is demonstrated for Al and Ti by comparing with the conventional quasiharmonic approximation that is much more computationally demanding.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Atomic Structures on Faceted and Nonflat Surfaces by the Difference-of-Gaussians Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08436v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detailed analysis of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) data acquired for faceted and non-flat surfaces is usually complicated due to the presence of a large number of surface areas tilted by large/variable angles relative to the scanning plane. As a consequence, standard methods of elimination of global or local slopes by either a plane subtraction or numerical differentiation seem to be ineffective. We demonstrate that a simple difference-of-Gaussians procedure provides output data corresponding to projection of a considered surface onto the scanning plane without undesirable contrast modifications. This method allows us to suppress small-scale noise, minimize effects of finite slopes in the SPM images along both fast and slow scanning directions and removes surface ripples without active participation of the operator. This method can be applied for fast on-the-fly visualization of experimental data, and for more detailed analysis, including high-precision determination of lattice parameters and angles between translation vectors for surface reconstruction of different terraces or surface domains. In order to estimate geometrical distortions introduced by our procedure, we compare the results obtained by the difference-of-Gaussians approach for the tilted surfaces with direct image rotation in 3D space.</description>

      <title>Effective removal of global tilt from topography images of vicinal surfaces with narrow terraces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main feature of vicinal surfaces of crystals characterized by the Miller indices (hhm) is rather small width (less than 10 nm) and substantially large length (more than 200 nm) of atomically-flat terraces on sample surface. This makes difficult to apply standard methods of image processing and correct visualization of crystalline lattices at the terraces and multiatomic steps. Here we consider two procedures allowing us to minimize effects of both small-scale noise and global tilt of sample: (i) analysis of the difference of two Gaussian blurred images, and (ii) subtraction of the plane, whose parameters are determined by optimization of the histogram of the visible heights, from raw topography image. It is shown that both methods provide nondistorted images demonstrating atomic structures on vicinal Si(556) and Si(557) surfaces.</description>

      <title>Electronic Landscape of Group-5 Transition Metal Ditellurides $M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = V, Nb, Ta): Multiple Crystal Phases with Local Bonds and Flat Bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group-5 transition metal ditellurides $M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = V, Nb, Ta) are unique CdI$_2$-type layered materials that exhibit peculiar quasi-one-dimensional intralayer superstructures, known as ribbon-chains and butterfly-like clusters of $M$ atoms. In this review article, we attempt to systematically understand their electronic band structures based on our recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies and first-principles calculations. We underscore the role of the localized molecular-like orbital bonds that form the anomalous flat bands in the momentum space, and demonstrate how they influence the Fermi surface anisotropy, phase stabilities of crystal structures, and nontrivial topological properties in some cases. We also elaborate the future prospects for novel quantum phenomena that can be realized in these materials.</description>

Abstract: We study structurally-triggered metal-insulator transition in CaCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ by means of local density approximation (LDA) +$U$ and LDA+dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The ferrimagnetic insulating phase is essentially the same within both approaches. While LDA+$U$ describes the metal-insulator transition as a Peierls-like instability driven by Fermi surface nesting in the magnetically ordered phase, LDA+DMFT allows also the site-selective Mott transition without magnetic ordering as well as smooth crossover between the two pictures. We point out similarities and differences to rare-earth nickelates.</description>

Abstract: Three-dimensional Hopf insulators are a class of topological phases beyond the tenfold-way classification. The critical point separating two rotation-invariant Hopf insulator phases with distinct Hopf invariants is quite different from the usual Dirac-type or Weyl-type critical points and uniquely characterized by a quantized Berry dipole. Close to such Berry-dipole transitions, we find that the extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity tensors in the weakly doped regime are characterized by two universal functions of the ratio between doping level and bulk energy gap, and are directly proportional to the change in Hopf invariant across the transition. Our work suggests that the nonlinear Hall effects display a general-sense quantized behavior across Berry-dipole transitions, establishing a correspondence between nonlinear Hall effects and Hopf invariant.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Microscopic Mechanism of Elementary Vortex Pinning in Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vortex pinning is a crucial factor that determines the critical current of practical superconductors and enables their diverse applications. However, the underlying mechanism of vortex pinning has long been elusive, lacking a clear microscopic explanation. Here using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we studied single vortex pinning induced by point defect in layered FeSe-based superconductors. We found the defect-vortex interaction drives low-energy vortex bound states away from EF, creating a "mini" gap that effectively lowers the system energy and enhances pinning. By measuring the local density-of-states, we directly obtained the elementary pinning energy and estimated the pinning force via the spatial gradient of pinning energy. The results are consistent with bulk critical current measurement. Furthermore, we show that a general microscopic quantum model incorporating defect-vortex interaction can naturally capture our observation. It suggests that the local pairing near pinned vortex core is actually enhanced compared to unpinned vortex, which is beyond the traditional understanding that non-superconducting regions pin vortices. Our study thus unveils a general microscopic mechanism of vortex pinning in superconductors, and provides insights for enhancing the critical current of practical superconductors.</description>

Abstract: We show that direct laser writing in aqueous silver nitrate with a $\lambda$ = 1030 nm femtosecond laser results in deposition of a mixture of silver oxide and silver, in contrast to the pure silver deposition previously reported with 780 nm femtosecond direct laser writing. However, adding photoinitiator prevents silver oxide formation in a concentration-dependent manner. As a result, the resistivity of the material can also be controlled by photoinitiator concentration with resistivity being reduced from approximately 9e-3 $\Omega$m to 3e-7 $\Omega$m. Silver oxide peaks dominate the X-ray diffraction spectra when no photoinitiator is present, while the peaks disappear with photoinitiator concentrations above 0.05 wt%. A THz polarizer and metamaterial are printed as a demonstration of silver oxide printing.</description>

      <title>Inverse magnetocaloric effect and phase separation induced by giant van Hove singularity in itinerant ferromagnetic metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A thermodynamic theory based on Landau grand potential expansion for ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase transitions is developed for an electronic phase-separated state. It is rigorously shown that ferromagnetic phase involved in the phase-separated state exhibits negative magnetic susceptibility in the vicinity of~tricritical point. Thus, an entropy of the magnetically ordered phase may increase when the magnetic field is applied, which implies positive sign of the total magnetic entropy change $\Delta S$ within magnetocaloric effect~(MCE). The electronic phase separation and MCE are considered within the Hubbard model for~face-centered cubic lattice with giant van Hove singularity of electron density of states at the band bottom. Within the Hartree-Fock approximation it is shown that such model of itinerant magnet exhibits the~first-order ferromagnet-paramagnet phase transition~(FOPT) with electronic phase separation and inverse magnetocaloric effect deep inside the phase-separated region. Temperature dependence of $\Delta S$ for the mean-field solution of the non-degenerate Hubbard model is analyzed in detail for different band filling values. The possibility to control $\Delta S$ sign by changing both temperature and band filling of magnetocaloric materials is demonstrated. This is important to interpret a lot of experimental data, possible technological applications, and further theoretical developments.</description>
