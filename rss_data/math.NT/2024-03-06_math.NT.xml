      <title>The least primary factor of the multiplicative group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S(n)$ denote the least primary factor in the primary decomposition of the multiplicative group $M_n = (\Bbb Z/n\Bbb Z)^\times$. We give an asymptotic formula, with order of magnitude $x/(\log x)^{1/2}$, for the counting function of those integers $n$ for which $S(n) \ne 2$. We also give an asymptotic formula, for any prime power $q$, for the counting function of those integers $n$ for which $S(n) = q$. This group-theoretic problem can be reduced to problems of counting integers with restrictions on their prime factors, allowing it to be addressed by classical techniques of analytic number theory.</description>

      <title>On the $p$-adic values of the weight two Eisenstein series for supersingular primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weight two Eisenstein series may be considered as the first example of a Katz $p$-adic modular form. Classically, its values are defined for the primes of ordinary reduction. We offer a modified definition which applies uniformly to all primes of good reduction, both ordinary and supersingular. We show that, in the case of complex multiplication, these $p$-adic values coincide with the algebraic value of this Eisenstein series.</description>

      <title>The summatory function of the M\"obius function involving the greatest common divisor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\gcd(m,n)$ denote the greatest common divisor of the positive integers $m$ and $n$, and let $\mu$ represent the M\" obius function. For any real number $x&gt;5$, we define the summatory function of the M\" obius function involving the greatest common divisor as $
S_{\mu}(x) := \sum_{mn\leq x} \mu(\gcd(m,n)). $
In this paper, we present an asymptotic formula for $S_{\mu}(x)$. Assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we delve further into the asymptotic behavior of $S_{\mu}(x)$ and derive a mean square estimate for its error term. Our proof employs the Perron formula, Parseval's theorem, complex integration techniques, and the properties of the Riemann zeta-function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the quaternionic Mahler measure for non-commutative polynomials, extending the classical complex Mahler measure. We establish the existence of quaternionic Mahler measure for slice regular polynomials in one and two variables. We study the quaternionic Mahler measure for real and slice regular polynomials, and consider the associated Lehmer problem. Various formulas of quaternionic Mahler measures are proved.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of elliptic curves upon base extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix distinct primes $p$ and $q$ and let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field $K$. The $(p,q)$-entanglement type of $E$ over $K$ is the isomorphism class of the group $\operatorname{Gal}(K(E[p])\cap K(E[q])/K)$. This size of this group measures the extent to which the image of the mod $pq$ Galois representation attached to $E$ fails to be a direct product of the mod $p$ and mod $q$ images. In this article, we study how the $(p,q)$-entanglement group varies over different base fields. We prove that for each prime $\ell$ dividing the greatest common divisor of the size of the mod $p$ and $q$ images, there are infinitely many fields $L/K$ such that the entanglement over $L$ is cyclic of order $\ell$. We also classify all possible $(2,q)$-entanglement types that can occur as the base field $L$ varies.</description>

      <title>Generic models for genus 2 curves with real multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explicit models of families of genus 2 curves with multiplication by $\sqrt D$ are known for $D= 2, 3, 5$. We obtain generic models for genus 2 curves over $\mathbb Q$ with real multiplication in 12 new cases, including all fundamental discriminants $D &lt; 40$. A key step in our proof is to develop an algorithm for minimisation of conic bundles fibred over $\mathbb{P}^2$. We apply this algorithm to simplify the equations for the Mestre conic associated to the generic point on the Hilbert modular surface of fundamental discriminant $D &lt; 100$ computed by Elkies--Kumar.</description>

      <title>Approximating rational points on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective algebraic variety over a number field $k$ and $P$ in $X(k)$. In 2007, the second author conjectured that, in a precise sense, if rational points on $X$ are dense enough, then the best rational approximations to $P$ must lie on a curve. We present a strategy for deducing a slightly weaker conjecture from Vojta's conjecture, and execute this strategy for the full conjecture for split surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify Drinfeld's formal group on the prismatization of $\mathrm{Spf}\,\mathbb{Z}_p$ with a formal group arising from homotopy theory, given locally by the Quillen formal group of a decompleted variant of topological periodic cyclic homology. We also prove that this formal group extends to the syntomization of $\mathrm{Spf}\,\mathbb{Z}_p$, and that it admits a certain algebraization conjectured by Drinfeld.</description>

      <title>SIC-POVMs from Stark Units: Dimensions n^2+3=4p, p prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence problem for maximal sets of equiangular lines (or SICs) in complex Hilbert space of dimension $d$ remains largely open. In a previous publication (arXiv:2112.05552) we gave a conjectural algorithm for how to construct a SIC if $d = n^2+3 = p$, a prime number. Perhaps the most surprising number-theoretical aspect of that algorithm is the appearance of Stark units in a key role: a single Stark unit from a ray class field extension of a real quadratic field serves as a seed from which the SIC is constructed. The algorithm can be modified to apply to all dimensions $d = n^2+3$. Here we focus on the case when $d= n^2+3 = 4p$, $p$ prime, for two reasons. First, special measures have to be taken on the Hilbert space side of the problem when the dimension is even. Second, the degrees of the relevant ray class fields are `smooth' in a sense that facilitates exact calculations. As a result the algorithm becomes easier to explain. We give solutions for seventeen different dimensions of this form, reaching $d = 39604$. Several improvements relative to our previous publication are reported, but we cannot offer a proof that the algorithm works for any dimensions where it has not been tested.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles II: the dynamics of an aperiodic computer chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a new family $(\mathcal{T}_n)_{n\geq1}$ of aperiodic sets of Wang tiles and we describe the dynamical properties of the set $\Omega_n$ of valid configurations $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. The tiles can be defined as the different instances of a square shape computer chip whose inputs and outputs are 3-dimensional integer vectors. The family include the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles and gathers the hallmarks of other small aperiodic sets of Wang tiles. Notably, the tiles satisfy additive versions of equations verified by the Kari--Culik aperiodic sets of 14 and 13 Wang tiles. Also configurations in $\Omega_n$ are the codings of a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action on a 2-dimensional torus like the Jeandel--Rao aperiodic set of 11 Wang tiles. The family broadens the relation between quadratic integers and aperiodic tilings beyond the omnipresent golden ratio as the dynamics of $\Omega_n$ involves the positive root $\beta$ of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$, also known as the $n$-th metallic mean. We show the existence of an almost one-to-one factor map $\Omega_n\to\mathbb{T}^2$ which commutes the shift action on $\Omega_n$ with horizontal and vertical translations by $\beta$ on $\mathbb{T}^2$. The factor map can be explicitely defined by the average of the top labels from the same row of tiles as in Kari and Culik examples. The proofs are based on the minimality of $\Omega_n$ (proved in a previous article) and a polygonal partition of $\mathbb{T}^2$ which we show is a Markov partition for the toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action. The partition and the sets of Wang tiles are symmetric which makes them, like Penrose tilings, worthy of investigation.</description>

      <title>A Hyperbolic Analogue of the Rademacher Symbol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.12354v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most famous results of Dedekind is the transformation law of $\log \Delta(z)$. After a half-century, Rademacher modified Dedekind's result and introduced an $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$-conjugacy class invariant (integer-valued) function $\Psi(\gamma)$ called the Rademacher symbol. Inspired by Ghys' work on modular knots, Duke-Imamo\={g}lu-T\'{o}th (2017) constructed a hyperbolic analogue of the symbol.
  In this article, we study their hyperbolic analogue of the Rademacher symbol $\Psi_\gamma(\sigma)$ and provide its two types of explicit formulas by comparing it with the classical Rademacher symbol. In association with it, we contrastively show Kronecker limit type formulas of the parabolic, elliptic, and hyperbolic Eisenstein series. These limits give harmonic, polar harmonic, and locally harmonic Maass forms of weight 2.</description>

Abstract: We define reflective modular forms on complex balls and use a method of Gritsenko and Hulek to show that some ball quotients of dimensions 3, 4 and 5 are uniruled. We give examples of Hermitian lattices over the rings of integers of imaginary quadratic fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-2})$ for which the associated ball quotients are uniruled. Our examples include the moduli space of 8 points on $\mathbb{P}^1$. Moreover, we find that some of their Satake-Baily-Borel compactifications are rationally chain connected modulo certain cusps.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.04387v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $h_{(m,k)}$ be the class number of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{1-2m^k}).$
  We prove that for any odd natural number $k,$ there exists $m_0$ such that $k \mid h_{(m,k)}$ for all odd $m &gt; m_0.$ We also prove that for any odd $m \geq 3,$ $k \mid h_{(m,k)}$ (when
  $k$ and $1-2m^k$ square-free numbers) and $p \mid h_{(m,p)}$ (except finitely many primes $p$). We deduce that for any pair of twin primes $p_1,p_2=p_1+2$,
  $p_1 \mid h_{(m,p_1)}$ or $p_2 \mid h_{(m,p_2)}.$
  For any odd natural number $k$, we construct an infinite family of pairs of imaginary quadratic fields $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d}), \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d+1})$ whose class numbers are divisible by $k$, which settles a generalized version of Iizuka's conjecture (cf : Conjecture 2.2) for the case $n=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.15582v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study local-global principles for two notions of semi-integral points, termed Campana points and Darmon points. In particular, we develop a semi-integral version of the Brauer-Manin obstruction interpolating between Manin's classical version for rational points and the integral version developed by Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and Xu. We determine the status of local-global principles, and obstructions to them, in two families of orbifolds naturally associated to quadric hypersurfaces. Further, we establish a quantitative result measuring the failure of the semi-integral Brauer-Manin obstruction to account for its integral counterpart for affine quadrics.</description>

Abstract: We propose two families of relative trace formula comparisons in the study of relative Langlands duality conjectured by Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh. This allows us to incorporate numerous relative trace formula comparisons studied during the last four decades under the BZSV duality framework. For the proposed relative trace formula comparisons associated to some strongly tempered spherical varieties, we will prove the fundamental lemma and smooth transfer in the $p$-adic case. Moreover, inspired by the BZSV duality conjecture, we propose a conjecture regarding the degenerate Whittaker period, which generalizes Lapid-Mao's conjecture of the Whittaker period</description>

      <title>Arithmetic degrees of dynamical systems over fields of characteristic zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we generalize the arithmetic degree and its related theory to dynamical systems defined over an arbitrary field $\mathbf{k}$ of characteristic $0$. We first consider a dynamical system $(X,f)$ over a finitely generated field $K$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, we introduce the arithmetic degrees $\alpha(f,\cdot)$ for $\overline{K}$-points by using Moriwaki heights. We study the arithmetic dynamical degree of $(X,f)$ and establish the relative degree formula. The relative degree formula gives a proof of the fundamental inequality, that is, the upper arithmetic degree $\overline{\alpha}(f,x)$ is less than or equal to the first dynamical degree $\lambda_1(f)$ in this setting. By taking spread-outs, we extend the definition of arithmetic degrees to dynamical systems over the field $\mathbf k$. We demonstrate that our definition is independent of the choice of the spread-out. Moreover, in this setting, we prove certain special cases of the Kawaguchi-Silverman conjecture. A main novelty of this paper is that, we give a characterization of arithmetic degrees of "transcendental points" in the case $\mathbf{k}=\mathbb{C}$, from which we deduce that $\alpha(f,x)=\lambda_1(f)$ for very general $x\in X(\mathbb{C})$ when $f$ is an endomorphism.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior for twisted traces of self-dual and conjugate self-dual representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behavior of the sum of twisted traces of self-dual or conjugate self-dual discrete automorphic representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$ for the level aspect of principal congruence subgroups under some conditions. Our asymptotic formula is derived from the Arthur twisted trace formula, and it is regarded as a twisted version of limit multiplicity formula on Lie groups. We determine the main terms for the asymptotic behavior under different conditions, and also obtain explicit forms of their Fourier transforms, which correspond to endoscopic lifts from classical groups. Its main application is the self-dual (resp. conjugate self-dual) globalization of local self-dual (resp. conjugate self-dual) representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$. We further derive an automorphic density theorem for conjugate self-dual representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n$.</description>

      <title>Reflective obstructions of unitary modular varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To prove that a modular variety is of general type, there are three types of obstructions: reflective, cusp and elliptic obstructions. In this paper, we give a quantitative estimate of the reflective obstructions for the unitary case. This shows in particular that the reflective obstructions are small enough in higher dimension, say greater than $138$. Our result reduces the study of the Kodaira dimension of unitary modular varieties to the construction of a cusp form of small weight in a quantitative manner. As a byproduct, we formulate and partially prove the finiteness of Hermitian lattices admitting reflective modular forms, which is a unitary analog of the conjecture by Gritsenko-Nikulin in the orthogonal case. Our estimate of the reflective obstructions uses Prasad's volume formula.</description>

      <title>On the Maximum Gonality of a Curve over a Finite Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gonality of a smooth geometrically connected curve over a field $k$ is the smallest degree of a nonconstant $k$-morphism from the curve to the projective line. In general, the gonality of a curve of genus $g \ge 2$ is at most $2g - 2$. Over finite fields, a result of F.K. Schmidt from the 1930s can be used to prove that the gonality is at most $g+1$. Via a mixture of geometry and computation, we improve this bound: for a curve of genus $g \ge 5$ over a finite field, the gonality is at most $g$. For genus $g = 3$ and $g = 4$, the same result holds with exactly $217$ exceptions: There are two curves of genus $4$ and gonality $5$, and $215$ curves of genus $3$ and gonality $4$. The genus-$4$ examples were found in other papers, and we reproduce their equations here; in supplementary material, we provide equations for the genus-$3$ examples.</description>

      <title>The Multivariate Rate of Convergence for Selberg's Central Limit Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we quantify the rate of convergence in Selberg's central limit theorem for $\log|\zeta(1/2+it)|$ based on the method of proof given by Radziwill and Soundararajan. We achieve the same rate of convergence of $(\log\log\log T)^2/\sqrt{\log\log T}$ as Selberg in the Kolmogorov distance by using the Dudley distance instead. We also prove the theorem for the multivariate case given by Bourgade with the same rate of convergence as in the single variable case.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles I: self-similarity, aperiodicity and minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every positive integer $n$, we introduce a set $\mathcal{T}_n$ made of $(n+3)^2$ Wang tiles (unit squares with labeled edges). We represent a tiling by translates of these tiles as a configuration $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. A configuration is valid if the common edge of adjacent tiles have the same label. For every $n\geq1$, we show that the Wang shift $\Omega_n$ defined as the set of valid configurations over the tiles $\mathcal{T}_n$ is self-similar, aperiodic and minimal for the shift action. We say that $\{\Omega_n\}_{n\geq1}$ is a family of metallic mean Wang shifts since the inflation factor of the self-similarity of $\Omega_n$ is the positive root of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$. This root is sometimes called the $n$-th metallic mean, and in particular, the golden mean when $n=1$ and the silver mean when $n=2$. When $n=1$, the set of Wang tiles $\mathcal{T}_1$ is equivalent to the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles.</description>
