      <title>Design and Development of Laughter Recognition System Based on Multimodal Fusion and Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to design and implement a laughter recognition system based on multimodal fusion and deep learning, leveraging image and audio processing technologies to achieve accurate laughter recognition and emotion analysis. First, the system loads video files and uses the OpenCV library to extract facial information while employing the Librosa library to process audio features such as MFCC. Then, multimodal fusion techniques are used to integrate image and audio features, followed by training and prediction using deep learning models. Evaluation results indicate that the model achieved 80% accuracy, precision, and recall on the test dataset, with an F1 score of 80%, demonstrating robust performance and the ability to handle real-world data variability. This study not only verifies the effectiveness of multimodal fusion methods in laughter recognition but also highlights their potential applications in affective computing and human-computer interaction. Future work will focus on further optimizing feature extraction and model architecture to improve recognition accuracy and expand application scenarios, promoting the development of laughter recognition technology in fields such as mental health monitoring and educational activity evaluation</description>

      <title>Can LLMs "Reason" in Music? An Evaluation of LLMs' Capability of Music Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic Music, akin to language, can be encoded in discrete symbols. Recent research has extended the application of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama2 to the symbolic music domain including understanding and generation. Yet scant research explores the details of how these LLMs perform on advanced music understanding and conditioned generation, especially from the multi-step reasoning perspective, which is a critical aspect in the conditioned, editable, and interactive human-computer co-creation process. This study conducts a thorough investigation of LLMs' capability and limitations in symbolic music processing. We identify that current LLMs exhibit poor performance in song-level multi-step music reasoning, and typically fail to leverage learned music knowledge when addressing complex musical tasks. An analysis of LLMs' responses highlights distinctly their pros and cons. Our findings suggest achieving advanced musical capability is not intrinsically obtained by LLMs, and future research should focus more on bridging the gap between music knowledge and reasoning, to improve the co-creation experience for musicians.</description>

      <title>Robust Lossy Audio Compression Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous research contributions on blind lossy compression identification report near perfect performance metrics on their test set, across a variety of codecs and bit rates. However, we show that such results can be deceptive and may not accurately represent true ability of the system to tackle the task at hand. In this article, we present an investigation into the robustness and generalisation capability of a lossy audio identification model. Our contributions are as follows. (1) We show the lack of robustness to codec parameter variations of a model equivalent to prior art. In particular, when naively training a lossy compression detection model on a dataset of music recordings processed with a range of codecs and their lossless counterparts, we obtain near perfect performance metrics on the held-out test set, but severely degraded performance on lossy tracks produced with codec parameters not seen in training. (2) We propose and show the effectiveness of an improved training strategy to significantly increase the robustness and generalisation capability of the model beyond codec configurations seen during training. Namely we apply a random mask to the input spectrogram to encourage the model not to rely solely on the training set's codec cutoff frequency.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Partially Spoofed Audio Localization with Boundary-aware Attention Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of partially spoofed audio localization aims to accurately determine audio authenticity at a frame level. Although some works have achieved encouraging results, utilizing boundary information within a single model remains an unexplored research topic. In this work, we propose a novel method called Boundary-aware Attention Mechanism (BAM). Specifically, it consists of two core modules: Boundary Enhancement and Boundary Frame-wise Attention. The former assembles the intra-frame and inter-frame information to extract discriminative boundary features that are subsequently used for boundary position detection and authenticity decision, while the latter leverages boundary prediction results to explicitly control the feature interaction between frames, which achieves effective discrimination between real and fake frames. Experimental results on PartialSpoof database demonstrate our proposed method achieves the best performance. The code is available at https://github.com/media-sec-lab/BAM.</description>

      <title>Between the AI and Me: Analysing Listeners' Perspectives on AI- and Human-Composed Progressive Metal Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI models have recently blossomed, significantly impacting artistic and musical traditions. Research investigating how humans interact with and deem these models is therefore crucial. Through a listening and reflection study, we explore participants' perspectives on AI- vs human-generated progressive metal, in symbolic format, using rock music as a control group. AI-generated examples were produced by ProgGP, a Transformer-based model. We propose a mixed methods approach to assess the effects of generation type (human vs. AI), genre (progressive metal vs. rock), and curation process (random vs. cherry-picked). This combines quantitative feedback on genre congruence, preference, creativity, consistency, playability, humanness, and repeatability, and qualitative feedback to provide insights into listeners' experiences. A total of 32 progressive metal fans completed the study. Our findings validate the use of fine-tuning to achieve genre-specific specialization in AI music generation, as listeners could distinguish between AI-generated rock and progressive metal. Despite some AI-generated excerpts receiving similar ratings to human music, listeners exhibited a preference for human compositions. Thematic analysis identified key features for genre and AI vs. human distinctions. Finally, we consider the ethical implications of our work in promoting musical data diversity within MIR research by focusing on an under-explored genre.</description>

      <title>Beat this! Accurate beat tracking without DBN postprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a system for tracking beats and downbeats with two objectives: generality across a diverse music range, and high accuracy. We achieve generality by training on multiple datasets -- including solo instrument recordings, pieces with time signature changes, and classical music with high tempo variations -- and by removing the commonly used Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) postprocessing, which introduces constraints on the meter and tempo. For high accuracy, among other improvements, we develop a loss function tolerant to small time shifts of annotations, and an architecture alternating convolutions with transformers either over frequency or time. Our system surpasses the current state of the art in F1 score despite using no DBN. However, it can still fail, especially for difficult and underrepresented genres, and performs worse on continuity metrics, so we publish our model, code, and preprocessed datasets, and invite others to beat this.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transparency in AI decision-making is crucial in healthcare due to the severe consequences of errors, and this is important for building trust among AI and users in sentiment analysis task. Incorporating reasoning capabilities helps Large Language Models (LLMs) understand human emotions within broader contexts, handle nuanced and ambiguous language, and infer underlying sentiments that may not be explicitly stated. In this work, we introduce a new task - Sentiment Reasoning - for both speech and text modalities, along with our proposed multimodal multitask framework and dataset. Our study showed that rationale-augmented training enhances model performance in sentiment classification across both human transcript and ASR settings. Also, we found that the generated rationales typically exhibit different vocabularies compared to human-generated rationales, but maintain similar semantics. All code, data (English-translated and Vietnamese) and models are published online: https://github.com/leduckhai/MultiMed</description>

      <title>Improving noisy student training for low-resource languages in End-to-End ASR using CycleGAN and inter-domain losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training a semi-supervised end-to-end speech recognition system using noisy student training has significantly improved performance. However, this approach requires a substantial amount of paired speech-text and unlabeled speech, which is costly for low-resource languages. Therefore, this paper considers a more extreme case of semi-supervised end-to-end automatic speech recognition where there are limited paired speech-text, unlabeled speech (less than five hours), and abundant external text. Firstly, we observe improved performance by training the model using our previous work on semi-supervised learning "CycleGAN and inter-domain losses" solely with external text. Secondly, we enhance "CycleGAN and inter-domain losses" by incorporating automatic hyperparameter tuning, calling it "enhanced CycleGAN inter-domain losses." Thirdly, we integrate it into the noisy student training approach pipeline for low-resource scenarios. Our experimental results, conducted on six non-English languages from Voxforge and Common Voice, show a 20% word error rate reduction compared to the baseline teacher model and a 10% word error rate reduction compared to the baseline best student model, highlighting the significant improvements achieved through our proposed method.</description>

      <title>ELP-Adapters: Parameter Efficient Adapter Tuning for Various Speech Processing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has emerged as a key approach for learning generic representations from speech data. Despite promising results in downstream tasks such as speech recognition, speaker verification, and emotion recognition, a significant number of parameters is required, which makes fine-tuning for each task memory-inefficient. To address this limitation, we introduce ELP-adapter tuning, a novel method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning using three types of adapter, namely encoder adapters (E-adapters), layer adapters (L-adapters), and a prompt adapter (P-adapter). The E-adapters are integrated into transformer-based encoder layers and help to learn fine-grained speech representations that are effective for speech recognition. The L-adapters create paths from each encoder layer to the downstream head and help to extract non-linguistic features from lower encoder layers that are effective for speaker verification and emotion recognition. The P-adapter appends pseudo features to CNN features to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. With these adapters, models can be quickly adapted to various speech processing tasks. Our evaluation across four downstream tasks using five backbone models demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. With the WavLM backbone, its performance was comparable to or better than that of full fine-tuning on all tasks while requiring 90% fewer learnable parameters.</description>

Abstract: We use coupled hidden Markov models to automatically annotate the 371 Bach chorales in the Riemenschneider edition, a corpus containing approximately 100,000 notes and 20,000 chords. We give three separate analyses that achieve progressively greater accuracy at the cost of making increasingly strong assumptions about musical syntax. Although our method makes almost no use of human input, we are able to identify both chords and keys with an accuracy of 85% or greater when compared to an expert human analysis, resulting in annotations accurate enough to be used for a range of music-theoretical purposes, while also being free of subjective human judgments. Our work bears on longstanding debates about the objective reality of the structures postulated by standard Western harmonic theory, as well as on specific questions about the nature of Western harmonic syntax.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Models in Automatic Whispered Speech Recognition</title>

Abstract: In automatic speech recognition, any factor that alters the acoustic properties of speech can pose a challenge to the system's performance. This paper presents a novel approach for automatic whispered speech recognition in the Irish dialect using the self-supervised WavLM model. Conventional automatic speech recognition systems often fail to accurately recognise whispered speech due to its distinct acoustic properties and the scarcity of relevant training data. To address this challenge, we utilized a pre-trained WavLM model, fine-tuned with a combination of whispered and normal speech data from the wTIMIT and CHAINS datasets, which include the English language in Singaporean and Irish dialects, respectively. Our baseline evaluation with the OpenAI Whisper model highlighted its limitations, achieving a Word Error Rate (WER) of 18.8% on whispered speech. In contrast, the proposed WavLM-based system significantly improved performance, achieving a WER of 9.22%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in recognising whispered speech and underscore the importance of tailored acoustic modeling for robust automatic speech recognition systems. This study provides valuable insights into developing effective automatic speech recognition solutions for challenging speech affected by whisper and dialect.

      <description>arXiv:2407.21453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring biodiversity at scale is challenging. Detecting and identifying species in fine grained taxonomies requires highly accurate machine learning (ML) methods. Training such models requires large high quality data sets. And deploying these models to low power devices requires novel compression techniques and model architectures. While species classification methods have profited from novel data sets and advances in ML methods, in particular neural networks, deploying these state of the art models to low power devices remains difficult. Here we present a comprehensive empirical comparison of various tinyML neural network architectures and compression techniques for species classification. We focus on the example of bird song detection, more concretely a data set curated for studying the corn bunting bird species. The data set is released along with all code and experiments of this study. In our experiments we compare predictive performance, memory and time complexity of classical spectrogram based methods and recent approaches operating on raw audio signal. Our results indicate that individual bird species can be robustly detected with relatively simple architectures that can be readily deployed to low power devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of neural text-to-speech (TTS) systems enabled its usage in other areas of natural language processing such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) or spoken language translation (SLT). Due to the large number of different TTS architectures and their extensions, selecting which TTS systems to use for synthetic data creation is not an easy task. We use the comparison of five different TTS decoder architectures in the scope of synthetic data generation to show the impact on CTC-based speech recognition training. We compare the recognition results to computable metrics like NISQA MOS and intelligibility, finding that there are no clear relations to the ASR performance. We also observe that for data generation auto-regressive decoding performs better than non-autoregressive decoding, and propose an approach to quantify TTS generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Generative Expressive Conversational Speech Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to express a target utterance with the proper speaking style in a user-agent conversation setting. Existing CSS methods employ effective multi-modal context modeling techniques to achieve empathy understanding and expression. However, they often need to design complex network architectures and meticulously optimize the modules within them. In addition, due to the limitations of small-scale datasets containing scripted recording styles, they often fail to simulate real natural conversational styles. To address the above issues, we propose a novel generative expressive CSS system, termed GPT-Talker.We transform the multimodal information of the multi-turn dialogue history into discrete token sequences and seamlessly integrate them to form a comprehensive user-agent dialogue context. Leveraging the power of GPT, we predict the token sequence, that includes both semantic and style knowledge, of response for the agent. After that, the expressive conversational speech is synthesized by the conversation-enriched VITS to deliver feedback to the user.Furthermore, we propose a large-scale Natural CSS Dataset called NCSSD, that includes both naturally recorded conversational speech in improvised styles and dialogues extracted from TV shows. It encompasses both Chinese and English languages, with a total duration of 236 hours.We conducted comprehensive experiments on the reliability of the NCSSD and the effectiveness of our GPT-Talker. Both subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art CSS systems significantly in terms of naturalness and expressiveness. The Code, Dataset, and Pre-trained Model are available at: https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/GPT-Talker.</description>

      <title>Towards Achieving Human Parity on End-to-end Simultaneous Speech Translation via LLM Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present Cross Language Agent -- Simultaneous Interpretation, CLASI, a high-quality and human-like Simultaneous Speech Translation (SiST) System. Inspired by professional human interpreters, we utilize a novel data-driven read-write strategy to balance the translation quality and latency. To address the challenge of translating in-domain terminologies, CLASI employs a multi-modal retrieving module to obtain relevant information to augment the translation. Supported by LLMs, our approach can generate error-tolerated translation by considering the input audio, historical context, and retrieved information. Experimental results show that our system outperforms other systems by significant margins. Aligned with professional human interpreters, we evaluate CLASI with a better human evaluation metric, valid information proportion (VIP), which measures the amount of information that can be successfully conveyed to the listeners. In the real-world scenarios, where the speeches are often disfluent, informal, and unclear, CLASI achieves VIP of 81.3% and 78.0% for Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese translation directions, respectively. In contrast, state-of-the-art commercial or open-source systems only achieve 35.4% and 41.6%. On the extremely hard dataset, where other systems achieve under 13% VIP, CLASI can still achieve 70% VIP.</description>

      <title>CompA: Addressing the Gap in Compositional Reasoning in Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08753v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental characteristic of audio is its compositional nature. Audio-language models (ALMs) trained using a contrastive approach (e.g., CLAP) that learns a shared representation between audio and language modalities have improved performance in many downstream applications, including zero-shot audio classification, audio retrieval, etc. However, the ability of these models to effectively perform compositional reasoning remains largely unexplored and necessitates additional research. In this paper, we propose CompA, a collection of two expert-annotated benchmarks with a majority of real-world audio samples, to evaluate compositional reasoning in ALMs. Our proposed CompA-order evaluates how well an ALM understands the order or occurrence of acoustic events in audio, and CompA-attribute evaluates attribute-binding of acoustic events. An instance from either benchmark consists of two audio-caption pairs, where both audios have the same acoustic events but with different compositions. An ALM is evaluated on how well it matches the right audio to the right caption. Using this benchmark, we first show that current ALMs perform only marginally better than random chance, thereby struggling with compositional reasoning. Next, we propose CompA-CLAP, where we fine-tune CLAP using a novel learning method to improve its compositional reasoning abilities. To train CompA-CLAP, we first propose improvements to contrastive training with composition-aware hard negatives, allowing for more focused training. Next, we propose a novel modular contrastive loss that helps the model learn fine-grained compositional understanding and overcomes the acute scarcity of openly available compositional audios. CompA-CLAP significantly improves over all our baseline models on the CompA benchmark, indicating its superior compositional reasoning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Practical aspects for the creation of an audio dataset from field recordings with optimized labeling budget with AI-assisted strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18153</link>

Abstract: Machine Listening focuses on developing technologies to extract relevant information from audio signals. A critical aspect of these projects is the acquisition and labeling of contextualized data, which is inherently complex and requires specific resources and strategies. Despite the availability of some audio datasets, many are unsuitable for commercial applications. The paper emphasizes the importance of Active Learning (AL) using expert labelers over crowdsourcing, which often lacks detailed insights into dataset structures. AL is an iterative process combining human labelers and AI models to optimize the labeling budget by intelligently selecting samples for human review. This approach addresses the challenge of handling large, constantly growing datasets that exceed available computational resources and memory. The paper presents a comprehensive data-centric framework for Machine Listening projects, detailing the configuration of recording nodes, database structure, and labeling budget optimization in resource-constrained scenarios. Applied to an industrial port in Valencia, Spain, the framework successfully labeled 6540 ten-second audio samples over five months with a small team, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability to various resource availability situations.

      <title>Stable Audio Open</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open generative models are vitally important for the community, allowing for fine-tunes and serving as baselines when presenting new models. However, most current text-to-audio models are private and not accessible for artists and researchers to build upon. Here we describe the architecture and training process of a new open-weights text-to-audio model trained with Creative Commons data. Our evaluation shows that the model's performance is competitive with the state-of-the-art across various metrics. Notably, the reported FDopenl3 results (measuring the realism of the generations) showcase its potential for high-quality stereo sound synthesis at 44.1kHz.</description>

      <title>YourMT3+: Multi-instrument Music Transcription with Enhanced Transformer Architectures and Cross-dataset Stem Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-instrument music transcription aims to convert polyphonic music recordings into musical scores assigned to each instrument. This task is challenging for modeling as it requires simultaneously identifying multiple instruments and transcribing their pitch and precise timing, and the lack of fully annotated data adds to the training difficulties. This paper introduces YourMT3+, a suite of models for enhanced multi-instrument music transcription based on the recent language token decoding approach of MT3. We enhance its encoder by adopting a hierarchical attention transformer in the time-frequency domain and integrating a mixture of experts. To address data limitations, we introduce a new multi-channel decoding method for training with incomplete annotations and propose intra- and cross-stem augmentation for dataset mixing. Our experiments demonstrate direct vocal transcription capabilities, eliminating the need for voice separation pre-processors. Benchmarks across ten public datasets show our models' competitiveness with, or superiority to, existing transcription models. Further testing on pop music recordings highlights the limitations of current models. Fully reproducible code and datasets are available with demos at \url{https://github.com/mimbres/YourMT3}.</description>
