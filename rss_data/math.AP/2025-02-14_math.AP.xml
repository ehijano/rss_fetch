      <title>Probabilistic global-wellposedness for the energy-supercritical Schr\"odinger equations on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with a general nonlinearity power in all dimensions. We construct invariant measures concentrated on Sobolev spaces $H^s$ of singular orders, $s\leq\frac{d}{2}$. We prove almost sure global wellposedness and bounds on the growth in time of the solutions via invariant measure arguments. Our setting includes a generic compact Riemannian manifold; we specify the cases of the torus and Zoll manifolds.</description>

      <title>Recovery guarantees for compressed sensing photoacoustic tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoacoustic tomography is an emerging medical imaging technology whose primary aim is to map the high-contrast optical properties of biological tissues by leveraging high-resolution ultrasound measurements. Mathematically, this can be framed as an inverse source problem for the wave equation over a specific domain. In this work, for the first time, it is shown how, by assuming signal sparsity, it is possible to establish rigorous stable recovery guarantees when the data collection is given by spatial averages restricted to a limited portion of the boundary. Our framework encompasses many approaches that have been considered in the literature. The result is a consequence of a general framework for subsampled inverse problems developed in previous works and refined stability estimates for an inverse problem for the wave equation with surface measurements.</description>

      <title>Global bifurcations of nodal solutions for coupled elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global bifurcation structure of the radial nodal solutions to the coupled elliptic equations \begin{equation}
  \left\{
  \begin{array}{lr}
  -{\Delta}u+u=u^3+\beta uv^2\mbox{ in }B_1 ,\nonumber
  -{\Delta}v+v=v^3+\beta u^2v\mbox{ in }B_1 ,\nonumber
  u,v\in H_{0,r}^1(B_1).\nonumber
  \end{array}
  \right. \end{equation} Here $B_1$ is a unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and $\beta\in\mathbb{R}$ the coupling constant is used as bifurcation parameter. For each $k$, the unique pair of nodal solutions $\pm w_k$ with exactly $k-1$ zeroes to the scalar field equation $-\Delta w + w=w^3$ generate exactly four synchronized solution curves and exactly four semi-trivial solution curves to the above system. We obtain a fairly complete global bifurcation structure of all bifurcating branches emanating from these eight solution curves of the system, and show that for different $k$ these bifurcation structures are disjoint. We obtain exact and distinct nodal information for each of the bifurcating branches, thus providing a fairly complete characterization of nodal solutions of the system in terms of the coupling.</description>

      <title>Schauder type estimates for degenerate or singular parabolic systems with partially DMO coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study elliptic and parabolic systems in divergence form with degenerate or singular coefficients. Under the conormal boundary condition on the flat boundary, we establish boundary Schauder type estimates when the coefficients have partially Dini mean oscillation. Moreover, as an application, we achieve $k^{\text{th}}$ higher-order boundary Harnack principles for uniformly parabolic equations with H\"older coefficients, extending a recent result in [Audrito-Fioravanti-Vita 24] from $k\ge2$ to any $k\ge1$.</description>

      <title>Generic Structural Stability for $2 \times 2$ Systems of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a proof of generic structural stability for Riemann solutions to $2 \times 2$ system of hyperbolic conservation laws in one spatial variable, without diffusive terms. This means that for almost every left and right state, shocks and rarefaction solutions of the same type are preserved via perturbations of the flux functions. The main assumptions for this proof involve standard assumptions on strict hyperbolicity and genuine non-linearity, a technical assumption on directionality of rarefaction curve, and the regular manifold (submersion) assumption motivated by concepts in differential topology. We show that the structural stability of the Riemann solutions is related to the transversality of the Hugoniot loci and rarefaction curves in the state space. The regular manifold assumption is required to invoke a variant of a theorem from differential topology, Thom's parametric transversality theorem, to illustrate the genericity of transversality of these curves. This in turn implies the genericity of structural stability. We then illustrate the applications of this theorem to two examples: the p-system and a $2 \times 2$ system governing the evolution of gravity-driven monodisperse particle-laden thin films. In particular, we illustrate how one can verify all the above assumptions for the former, and apply the theorem to different numerical and physical aspects of the system governing the latter.</description>

      <title>Conjugate harmonic functions in 3D with respect to a unitary gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to relax the classic Cauchy-Riemann equations for a mapping. We support the interest of such a proposal by looking at one specific situation in 3D, and proving the existence of pairs of harmonic conjugate functions with respect to a unitary gradient as the title of this contribution conveys. We further investigate the relationship between boundary conditions for such pairs, the importance of the unitary constraint, and the eventual link of these ideas to Calder\'on's problem in 3D.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider interacting multi-agent systems where the interaction is not only pairwise but involves simultaneous interactions among multiple agents (multiple-wise interaction). By passing through the mesoscopic and macroscopic limits with a fixed multiple-wise interaction of order m, we derive a macroscopic equation in the limit m $\rightarrow$ $\infty$, capturing the dominant effects in large-size multiple-wise order.</description>

      <title>Optimal rate of convergence in the vanishing viscosity for quadratic Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to provide an optimal rate of convergence in the vanishing viscosity regime for first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations with purely quadratic Hamiltonian. We show that for a globally Lipschitz-continuous terminal condition the rate is of order O($\epsilon$ log $\epsilon$), and we provide an example to show that this rate cannot be sharpened. This improves on the previously known rate of convergence O( $\sqrt$ $\epsilon$), which was widely believed to be optimal. Our proof combines techniques involving regularization by sup-convolution with entropy estimates for the flow of a suitable version of the adjoint linearized equation. The key technical point is an integrated estimate of the Laplacian of the solution against this flow. Moreover, we exploit the semiconcavity generated by the equation.</description>

      <title>Mathematical modeling and simulation of coupled aqueous humor flow and temperature distribution in a realistic 3D human eye geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive computational model to simulate the coupled dynamics of aqueous humor flow and heat transfer in the human eye. To manage the complexity of the model, we make significant efforts in meshing and efficient solution of the discrete problem using high-performance resources. The model accurately describes the dynamics of the aqueous humor in the anterior and posterior chambers and accounts for convective effects due to temperature variations. Results for fluid velocity, pressure, and temperature distribution are in good agreement with existing numerical results in the literature. Furthermore, the effects of postural changes and wall shear stress behavior are analyzed, providing new insights into the mechanical forces acting on ocular tissues. Overall, the present contribution provides a detailed three-dimensional simulation that enhances the understanding of ocular physiology and may contribute to further progress in clinical research and treatment optimization in ophthalmology.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of a nonlinear Boussinesq-fluid-structure interaction system with large initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the global well-posedness of the initial-boundary value problem to a nonlinear Boussinesq-fluid-structure interaction system, which describes the motion of an incompressible Boussinesq-fluid surrounded by an elastic structure with the heat exchange and is one coupled incompressible Boussinesq equations with the wave equation and heat equation by physical interface boundary conditions. Firstly, the global existence of weak solutions to this problem in two/three-dimension is proven by introducing one class of its suitable weak solution and using the compactness method. Then, the uniqueness of the weak solution to this problem in two-dimension is established. Finally, the existence and uniqueness of the global strong and smooth solution to this problem in two-dimension is obtained for any smooth large initial data under the assumptions of suitable compatibility conditions by establishing a priori higher order derivative estimates.</description>

      <title>On the cubic-quintic Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the cubic-quintic Schr\"odinger equation in the entire Euclidean space. Our objectives are twofold: first, to advance the understanding of unresolved issues related to this equation, which are well known in the extensively studied Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Second, to consolidate existing results on the cubic-quintic equation, providing partial contributions. Specifically, we determine the explicit constant for the $L^\infty$ a priori bound and establish a partial existence result for finite energy traveling waves in suitable approximate domains of $\mathbb R^d$.</description>

      <title>Failure of the least action admissibility principle in the context of the compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding a proper solution concept for the multi-dimensional barotropic compressible Euler equations and related systems is still an unsolved problem. As revealed by convex integration, the classical notion of an admissible weak solutions (also known as weak entropy solutions) does not lead to uniqueness and allows for solutions which do not seem to be physical. For this reason, people have studied additional criteria in view of their ability to rule out the counterintuitive solutions generated by convex integration. Recently, in [H.~Gimperlein, M.~Grinfeld, R.~J.~Knops and M.~Slemrod: The least action admissibility principle, arXiv: 2409.07191 (2024)] it was suggested that the least action admissibility principle serves as the desired selection criterion. In this paper, however, we show that the least action admissibility principle rules out the solution which is intuitively the physically relevant one. Consequently, one either has to reconsider one's intuition, or the least action admissibility principle must be discarded.</description>

      <title>Observability and controllability for Schr\"odinger equations in the semi-periodic setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strichartz estimates, well-posedness theory and long time behavior for (nonlinear) Schr\"odinger equations on waveguide manifolds $\mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{T}^n$ are intensively studied in recent decades while the corresponding control theory and observability estimates remain incomplete. The purpose of this short paper is to investigate the observability and controllability for Schr\"odinger equations in the waveguide (semi-periodic) setting.
  Our main result establishes local exact controllability for the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLS) on $\mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{T}$, under certain geometric conditions on the control region. To address the nonlinear control problem, we begin by analyzing the observability properties of the linear Schr\"odinger operator on a general waveguide manifold $\mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{T}^n$. Utilizing $H^s$ estimates of the Hilbert Uniqueness Method (HUM) operator and Bourgain spaces, we then prove local exact controllability through a fixed-point method.</description>

      <title>Stability of composite Wave of Planar Viscous Shock and Rarefaction for 3D Barotropic Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the nonlinear time-asymptotic stability of the composite wave consisting of a planar rarefaction wave and a planar viscous shock for the three-dimensional (3D) compressible barotropic Navier-Stokes equations under generic perturbations, in particular, without zero-mass conditions. It is shown that if the composite wave strength and the initial perturbations are suitably small, then 3D Navier-Stokes system admits a unique global-in-time strong solution which time-asymptotically converges to the corresponding composite wave up to a time-dependent shift for planar viscous shock. Our proof is based on the $a$-contraction method with time-dependent shift and suitable weight function.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Elliptic Equations on Nonsmooth Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1995, D. Jerison and C. Kenig in \cite{JK-1995} considered the the inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem $\Delta u= f$ on $\Omega$, $u=0$ on $\partial\Omega$ in Lipschitz domains. One of their main results shows that the $W^{1,p}$ estimate holds for the sharp range $\frac{3}{2}-\varepsilon&lt;p&lt;3+\varepsilon$ for $d\geq 3$ and $\frac{4}{3}-\varepsilon&lt;p&lt;4+\varepsilon$ if $d=2$. Although the argument employed in \cite{JK-1995} yields optimal results, they rely on an essential fashion on the maximum principle and, as such, do not readily adapt to higher-order case. By using a new method, the aim of this paper is to establish an extension of their theorem for higher order inhomogeneous elliptic equations on bounded Lipschitz and convex domains, uniform $W^{\ell,p}$ estimates are obtained for $p$ in certain ranges. Especially, compare to the result in \cite{MM-2013} for biharmonic equation, a larger, sharp, range of $p's$ was obtained in this paper.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates for nonlinear kinetic Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a comprehensive gradient regularity theory for a broad class of nonlinear kinetic Fokker-Planck equations. We achieve this by establishing precise pointwise estimates in terms of the data in the spirit of nonlinear potential theory, leading to fine gradient regularity results under borderline assumptions on the data. Notably, our gradient estimates are novel already in the absence of forcing terms and even for linear kinetic Fokker-Planck equations in divergence form.</description>

      <title>Analytical study of a generalized Dirichlet-Neumann operator for three-dimensional water waves with vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider three-dimensional water waves with vorticity, under the action of gravity. We discuss a generalized Zakharov-Craig-Sulem formulation of the problem introduced by Castro and Lannes, which involves a generalized Dirichlet-Neumann operator. We study this operator in detail, extending some well-known results about the classical Dirichlet-Neumann operator for irrotational water waves, such as the Taylor expansion in homogeneous powers of the wave profile, the computation of its differential and a paralinearization result. We stress the fact that no geometric condition on either the velocity field or the vorticity is assumed.</description>

      <title>Stability and minimality of the ball for attractive-repulsive energies with perimeter penalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider perimeter perturbations of a class of attractive-repulsive energies, given by the sum of two nonlocal interactions with power-law kernels, defined over sets with fixed measure. We prove that there exists curves in the perturbation-volume parameters space that separate stability/instability and global minimality/non-minimality regions of the ball, and provide a precise description of these curves for certain interaction kernels. In particular, we show that in small perturbation regimes there are (at least) two disconnected regions for the mass parameter in which the ball is stable, separated by an instability region.</description>

      <title>Flow approach on the monotonicity of shape functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a geometric flow framework to investigate the following two classical shape functionals: the torsional rigidity and the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of the Laplacian. First, by constructing novel deformation paths governed by stretching flows, we prove several new monotonicity properties of the torsional rigidity and the first eigenvalue along the evolutions restricted to triangles and rhombuses. These results also lead to new and simpler proofs of some known results, unifying and extending prior symmetrization-based proofs. Second, utilizing the mean curvature flow, we give a new proof of the Saint-Venant inequality for smooth convex bodies. This might represent the first flow-based proof to establish geometric functional inequalities that couple both the domain and the state function associated with it. Third, by discovering a gradient norm inequality for the sides of rectangles, we prove monotonicity and stronger rigidity results of the torsional rigidity on rectangles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies quantitative homogenization of elliptic equations with random, uniformly elliptic coefficients that vanish in a union of random holes. Assuming an upper bound on the size of the holes and a separation condition between them, we derive optimal bounds for the regularity radius $r_*$ and suboptimal growth estimates for the corrector. These results are key ingredients for error analysis in stochastic homogenization and serve as crucial input for recent developments in the double-porosity model, such as those by Bonhomme, Duerinckx, and Gloria (https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02847).</description>

      <title>Morse Index Stability for Sequences of Sacks-Uhlenbeck Maps into a Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider sequences of $p$-harmonic maps, $p&gt;2$, from a closed Riemann surface $\Sigma$ into the $n$-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^n$ with uniform bounded energy. These are critical points of the energy $E_p(u) :=\int_\Sigma \left( 1+|{\nabla u}|^2\right)^{p/2} \ dvol_\Sigma.$ Our two main results are an improved pointwise estimate of the gradient in the neck regions around blow up points and the proof that the necks are asymptotically not contributing to the negativity of the second variation of the energy $E_p.$ This allows us, in the spirit of the paper of the first and second authors in collaboration with M. Gianocca {\em Morse index stability for critical points to conformally invariant Lagrangians}, to show the upper semicontinuity of the Morse index plus nullity for sequences of $p$-harmonic maps into a sphere.</description>

      <title>Localized past stability of the subcritical Kasner-scalar field spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the nonlinear stability, in the contracting direction, of the entire subcritical family of Kasner-scalar field solutions to the Einstein-scalar field equations in four spacetime dimensions. Our proof relies on a zero-shift, orthonormal frame decomposition of a conformal representation of the Einstein-scalar field equations. To synchronise the big bang singularity, we use the time coordinate $\tau = \exp\bigl(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\phi\bigr)$, where $\phi$ is the scalar field, which coincides with a conformal harmonic time slicing. We show that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete to the past and terminate at quiescent, crushing big bang singularities located at $\tau=0$, which are characterised by curvature blow up. Specifically, we establish two stability theorems. The first is a global in-space stability result where the perturbed spacetimes are of the form $M =\bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]} \tau^{-1}(\{t\}) \cong (0,t_0] \times \mathbb{T}^{3}$. The second is a localised version where the perturbed spacetimes are given by $M=\bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]}\tau^{-1}(\{t\})\cong \bigcup_{t\in (0,t_0]} \{t\}\times\mathbb{B}_{\rho(t)}$ with time-dependent radius function $\rho(t)=\rho_0+(1-\vartheta)\rho_0\bigl(\bigl(\frac{t}{t_0}\bigr)^{1-\epsilon}-1\bigr)$. Spatial localisation is achieved through our choice of zero-shift, harmonic time slicing that leads to hyperbolic evolution equations with a finite propagation speed.</description>

      <title>On the heat content of compact quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the heat content for Laplacians on compact, finite metric graphs with Dirichlet conditions imposed at the "boundary" (i.e., a given set of vertices). We prove a closed formula of combinatorial flavour, as it is expressed as a sum over all closed orbits hitting the boundary. Our approach delivers a small-time asymptotic expansion that delivers information on crucial geometric quantities of the metric graph, much in the spirit of the celebrated corresponding result for manifolds due to Gilkey-van den Berg; but unlike other known formulae based on different methods, ours holds for all times $t&gt;0$ and it displays stronger decay rate in the short time limit. Furthermore, we prove new surgery principles for the heat content and use them to derive comparison principles for the heat content between metric graphs of different topology.</description>

      <title>FullSWOF: A free software package for the simulation of shallow water flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4125</link>
      <description>arXiv:1401.4125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of flows are required for numerous applications, and are usually carried out using shallow water equations. We describe the FullSWOF software which is based on up-to-date finite volume methods and well-balanced schemes to solve this kind of equations. It consists of a set of open source C++ codes, freely available to the community, easy to use, and open for further development. Several features make FullSWOF particularly suitable for applications in hydrology: small water heights and wet-dry transitions are robustly handled, rainfall and infiltration are incorporated, and data from grid-based digital topographies can be used directly. A detailed mathematical description is given here, and the capabilities of FullSWOF are illustrated based on analytic solutions and datasets of real cases. The codes, available in 1D and 2D versions, have been validated on a large set of benchmark cases, which are available together with the download information and documentation at http://www.univ-orleans.fr/mapmo/soft/FullSWOF/.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates a semilinear wave equation characterized by nonlinear damping $g(u_t) $ and nonlinearity $f(u)$. First, the well-posedness of weak solutions across broader exponent ranges for $g$ and $f$ is established, by utilizing a priori space-time estimates. Moreover, the existence of a global attractor in the phase space $H^1_0(\Omega)\times L^2(\Omega)$ is obtained. Furthermore, it is proved that this global attractor is regular, implying that it is a bounded subset of $(H^2(\Omega)\cap H^1_0(\Omega))\times H^1_0(\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>Large-time behavior of the 2D thermally non-diffusive Boussinesq equations with Navier-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05400v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the large-time behavior of a buoyancy-driven fluid without thermal diffusion under Navier-slip boundary conditions in a bounded domain with Lipschitz-continuous second derivatives. After establishing improved regularity for classical solutions, we analyze their large-time asymptotics. Specifically, we show that the solutions converge to a state where, as $t \rightarrow \infty$, $\|u\|_{W^{1,p}} \rightarrow 0$, and hydrostatic balance is achieved in the weak topology of $L^2$. Furthermore, we identify the necessary conditions under which stable stratification and hydrostatic balance can be achieved in the strong topology as time approaches infinity. We then analyze a particular steady state, the hydrostatic equilibrium, characterized by $ u = 0 $, $ \theta = \beta x_2 + \gamma $, and $ p = \frac{\beta}{2}x_2^2 + \gamma x_2 + \delta $. In a periodic strip, we establish the linear stability of this state for $\beta &gt; 0$, indicating that the temperature is vertically stably stratified. This work builds upon the results in [Doering et al.], which focus on free-slip boundary conditions, as well as recent studies [Ayd{\i}n, Kukavica, Ziane; Ayd{\i}n, Jayanti] that address no-slip boundary conditions. Notably, the novelty of this study lies in the ability to directly bound the pressure term, made possible by the Navier-slip boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a spatial discretization of the fourth-order nonlinear DLSS equation on the circle. Our choice of discretization is motivated by a novel gradient flow formulation with respect to a metric that generalizes martingale transport. The discrete dynamics inherits this gradient flow structure, and in addition further properties, such as an alternative gradient flow formulation in the Wasserstein distance, contractivity in the Hellinger distance, and monotonicity of several Lypunov functionals. Our main result is the convergence in the limit of vanishing mesh size. The proof relies an a discrete version of a nonlinear functional inequality between integral expressions involving second order derivatives.</description>

Abstract: A nonlinear shell model is studied in this paper. This is a nonlinear variant of the Budiansky-Sanders linear shell model. Under some suitable assumptions on the magnitude of the applied force, we will prove the existence of a minimizer for this shell model. In addition, we will also show that our existence result can be applied to all kinds of geometries of the middle surface of the shell. We will also show that the minimizer found in this fashion is unique, provided the applied forces are small enough. Our result hence extends the one given by Destuynder in [1].</description>

Abstract: Klein, Majda, and Damodaran have previously developed a formalized asymptotic motion law describing the evolution of nearly parallel vortex filaments within the framework of the three-dimensional Euler equations for incompressible fluids. In this study, we rigorously justify this model for two configurations: the central configuration consisting of regular polygons of $N$ helical-filaments rotating with constant speed, and the central configurations of $N+1$ vortex filaments, where an $N$-polygonal central configuration surrounds a central straight filament.</description>

Abstract: We construct and classify all polynomial growth solutions to certain drift-harmonic equations on complete manifolds with paraboloidal asymptotics. These encompass the natural drift-harmonic equations on certain steady gradient Ricci solitons. Specifically, we show that all drift-harmonic functions with polynomial growth asymptotically separate variables, and compute the dimensions of spaces of drift-harmonic functions with a given polynomial growth rate. The proof uses an inductive argument that alternates between constructing and asymptotically controlling drift-harmonic functions.</description>
