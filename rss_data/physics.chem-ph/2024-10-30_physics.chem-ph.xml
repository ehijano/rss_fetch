      <title>Detection of Nanopores with the Scanning Ion Conductance Microscopy: A Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the dielectric breakdown process of thin solid-state nanopores, the application of high voltages may cause the formation of multi-nanopores on one chip, which number and sizes are important for their applications. Here, simulations were conducted to mimic the investigation of in situ nanopore detection with scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM). Results show that SICM can provide accurate nanopore location and relative pore size. Detection resolution is influenced by the dimensions of the applied probe and separation between the probe and membranes, which can be enhanced under large voltages or a concentration gradient.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Million-Electron and 1 EFLOP/s Barriers: Biomolecular-Scale Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics Using MP2 Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate simulation of complex biochemical phenomena has historically been hampered by the computational requirements of high-fidelity molecular-modeling techniques. Quantum mechanical methods, such as ab initio wave-function (WF) theory, deliver the desired accuracy, but have impractical scaling for modelling biosystems with thousands of atoms. Combining molecular fragmentation with MP2 perturbation theory, this study presents an innovative approach that enables biomolecular-scale ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations at WF theory level. Leveraging the resolution-of-the-identity approximation for Hartree-Fock and MP2 gradients, our approach eliminates computationally intensive four-center integrals and their gradients, while achieving near-peak performance on modern GPU architectures. The introduction of asynchronous time steps minimizes time step latency, overlapping computational phases and effectively mitigating load imbalances. Utilizing up to 9,400 nodes of Frontier and achieving 59% (1006.7 PFLOP/s) of its double-precision floating-point peak, our method enables us to break the million-electron and 1 EFLOP/s barriers for AIMD simulations with quantum accuracy.</description>

      <title>Changes in excimer properties under collective strong coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments show that light-matter strong coupling affects chemical properties, though the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We present an ab initio quantum electrodynamics coupled cluster method for collective light-matter strong coupling to investigate the interplay of local molecular details with the collective polaritonic excitation. The model is used to compute the potential energy surfaces of the argon dimer, which provides a general prototype for excimers, and analyze the ground and excited state vibrational levels. Potential energy surfaces are significantly modified for large light-matter couplings (single-molecule regime). On the other hand, in the collective regime (small light-matter coupling, large number of molecules), the ground state potential energy surface and the first vibrational levels of the excited state do not change significantly. However, collective strong coupling produces an abrupt transition in the vibrational landscape of the excimer, causing higher vibrational levels to behave similarly to ground state vibrations. Beyond a critical coupling strength, the excimer formation is thus inhibited for both the single-molecule and collective coupling regimes via different mechanisms. We propose this is a general feature of excimers under strong coupling, offering an additional aspect of polaritonic chemistry.</description>

      <title>$CdTe_{0.25}Se_{0.75}$ Quantum Dots as Efficient Room Temperature Single Photon Source for Quantum Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Room temperature single photon sources (SPS) are crucial for developing the next generation quantum technologies. Quantum dots (QDs), recently, have been reported as promising materials as SPS at room temperature. By optimizing the single particle optical properties of a series of water-soluble, $CdTe_{x}Se_{1-x}$, here we provide an efficient SPS with increased single photon purity. The data revealed that second order photon correlation, $g^2(0)$ value decreases substantially from 0.21 in CdTe to 0.02 in $CdTe_{0.25}Se_{0.75}$ QDs. They also exhibited deterministic emissions with an increase in ON time exceeding 95% of the total time. This was accompanied by an increased photon count rate, substantially reduced blinking events, and extended single particle ON-time. The increased single photon emission in $CdTe_{x}Se_{1-x}$ is attributed to very fast electron trapping to dense trap states, which suppresses the multiexciton recombination.</description>

      <title>Fast and Scalable GPU-Accelerated Quantum Chemistry for Periodic Systems with Gaussian Orbitals: Implementation and Hybrid Density Functional Theory Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient hybrid DFT simulations of solid state materials would be extremely beneficial for computational chemistry and materials science, but is presently bottlenecked by difficulties in computing Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange with plane wave orbital bases. We present a GPU-accelerated, Gaussian orbital based integral algorithm for systems with periodic boundary conditions, which takes advantage of Ewald summation to efficiently compute electrostatic interactions. We have implemented this approach into the TeraChem software package within the $\Gamma$ point approximation, enabling simulation of unit cells with hundreds or thousands of atoms at the HF or hybrid DFT level on a single GPU card. Our implementation readily parallelizes over multiple GPUs and paves the road to accurate simulation of the properties and dynamics of extended materials in both the ground and excited states.</description>

      <title>Capturing the elusive curve-crossing in low-lying states of butadiene with dressed TDDFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A striking example of the need to accurately capture states of double-excitation character in molecules is seen in predicting photo-induced dynamics in small polyenes. Due to the coupling of electronic and nuclear motions, the dark 2$^1$Ag state, known to have double-excitation character, can be reached after an initial photo-excitation to the bright $^1$Bu state via crossings of their potential energy surfaces. However, the shapes of the surfaces are so poorly captured by most electronic structure methods, including adiabatic time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), complete active space self-consistent field, and equation of motion coupled cluster singles and doubles, that the crossing is missed or substantially mislocated. We demonstrate that the frequency-dependent kernel of dressed TDDFT beyond Tamm-Dancoff successfully captures the curve-crossing, providing an energy surface close to the highly accurate but expensive $\delta$-CR-EOMCC(2,3) benchmark reference. This, along with its accurate prediction of the excitation character of the state makes dressed TDDFT a practical and accurate route to electronic structure quantities needed in modeling ultrafast dynamics in molecules.</description>

      <title>The Interplay of Heterogeneity and Product Detachment in Templated Polymer Copying</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Templated copolymerization, in which information stored in the sequence of a heteropolymer template is copied into another polymer product, is the mechanism behind all known methods of genetic information transfer. A key aspect of templated copolymerization is the eventual detachment of the product from the template. A second key feature of natural biochemical systems is that the template-binding free energies of both correctly-matched and incorrect monomers are heterogeneous. Previous work has considered the thermodynamic consequences of detachment, and the consequences of heterogeniety for polymerisation speed and accuracy, but the interplay of both separation and heterogeniety remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate a minimal model of templated copying that simultaneously incorporates both detachment from behind the leading edge of the growing copy and heterogeneous interactions. We first extend existing coarse-graining methods for models of polymerisation to allow for heterogeneous interactions. We then show that heterogeneous copying systems with explicit detachment do not exhibit the subdiffusive behaviour observed in the absence of detachment when near equilibrium. Next, we show that heterogeneity in correct monomer interactions tends to result in slower, less accurate copying, while heterogeneity in incorrect monomer interactions tends to result in faster, more accurate copying, due to an increased roughness in the free energy landscape of either correct or incorrect monomer pairs. Finally, we show that heterogeneity can improve on known thermodynamic efficiencies of homogeneous copying, but these increased thermodynamic efficiencies do not always translate to increased efficiencies of information transfer.</description>

      <title>Classical theory of nucleation applied to condensation of a Lennard-Jones fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical nucleation theory (CNT) and its modified versions provide a convenient framework for describing the nucleation process under the capillary approximation. However, these models often predict nucleation rates that depart significantly from simulation results, even for a simple Lennard-Jones fluid. This large discrepancy is likely due to the inaccurate estimation of the driving force for nucleation, which most traditional models estimate within the ideal solution approximation. In this study, we address this issue by directly calculating the driving force for nucleation using equations of state (EOS) and integrating this approach into the calculation of nucleation rates within the framework of CNT and its modified model. We apply this method to examine the condensation of a Lennard-Jones fluid and compare the resulting nucleation rates with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data. Our results demonstrate that at relatively low supersaturation, where the capillary approximation is reasonable, our thermodynamic models exhibit excellent agreement with MD results, significantly outperforming traditional models. At moderate and high supersaturation, our approach continues to show a reasonable agreement with MD results. Furthermore, when comparing the results obtained by using different EOS, we find that more precise EOS generally yield better agreement with MD data.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Limits of All-Atom Geometric Graph Neural Networks: Pre-Training, Scaling and Zero-Shot Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing transferable descriptors for conformation representation of molecular and biological systems finds numerous applications in drug discovery, learning-based molecular dynamics, and protein mechanism analysis. Geometric graph neural networks (Geom-GNNs) with all-atom information have transformed atomistic simulations by serving as a general learnable geometric descriptors for downstream tasks including prediction of interatomic potential and molecular properties. However, common practices involve supervising Geom-GNNs on specific downstream tasks, which suffer from the lack of high-quality data and inaccurate labels leading to poor generalization and performance degradation on out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this work, we explored the possibility of using pre-trained Geom-GNNs as transferable and highly effective geometric descriptors for improved generalization. To explore their representation power, we studied the scaling behaviors of Geom-GNNs under self-supervised pre-training, supervised and unsupervised learning setups. We find that the expressive power of different architectures can differ on the pre-training task. Interestingly, Geom-GNNs do not follow the power-law scaling on the pre-training task, and universally lack predictable scaling behavior on the supervised tasks with quantum chemical labels important for screening and design of novel molecules. More importantly, we demonstrate how all-atom graph embedding can be organically combined with other neural architectures to enhance the expressive power. Meanwhile, the low-dimensional projection of the latent space shows excellent agreement with conventional geometrical descriptors.</description>

      <title>Understanding Interfacial Ice Premelting: Structure, Adhesion and Nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a systematic computer simulation study of ice premelting, and explore the thickness and structure of quasi-liquid layers formed at the interface of ice with substrates of different hydrophilicity. Our study shows that interfacial premelting occurs on neutral substrates of whatever hydrophilicity, forming films of limited thickness for substrates with contact angles larger than ca. 50$^\circ$ but exhibiting complete interfacial premelting at smaller contact angles. Contrary to most experimental studies, we focus not only on the premelting behavior with temperature, but also with pressure, which is a matter of relevance in important situations such as ice friction. Our study is guided within a rigorous framework of surface thermodynamics, demonstrating that the premelting film structure is a function of a single thermodynamic variable. By this token we are able to relate properties measured along an isobar, with premelting films at arbitrary temperature and pressure. We also find that adhesion strength in atomically smooth surfaces is one to two orders of magnitude larger than those found in experiments, and conjecture that the reason is substrate roughness and the presence of organic adsorbents. Our theoretical framework also allows us to exploit our results on interfacial premelting in order to gain insight into heterogeneous ice nucleation. We show that apolar smooth substrates of whatever hydrophilicity are unlikely nucleators, and that too large hydrophilicity conspires also against ice nucleation. Furthermore, we exploit statistical-thermodynamic framework to shed light into the nature of the surface intermolecular forces promoting interfacial premelting, and provide a model to predict quasi-liquid layer thickness as a function of the substrate's hydrophilicity with great potential applications in fields ranging from earth sciences to aircraft engineering.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design Method with Enhanced Sampling for Complex Open Crystals: Application to Novel Zeolite Self-Assembly in a Coarse-Grained Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the synthesis of zeolites and exploring novel frameworks offer pivotal opportunities and challenges in materials design. While inverse design proves highly effective for simpler crystals, its application to intricate structures like zeolites poses severe challenges. Here, we introduce an innovative inverse design workflow tailored to efficiently reproduce target zeolite frameworks in a binary coarse-grained model using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations. This workflow integrates an evolutionary parameter optimization strategy with a variant of the seeding approach. Using this method, we successfully reproduce Z1 and SGT zeolites, and Type-I clathrates, find new optimal parameters for known phases, such as the SOD and CFI, and even discover novel frameworks, such as Z5. This is done within a simple coarse-grained model for a tetrahedra-forming component and a structure-directing agent. Our methodology not only enables the screening of synthesis protocols but also facilitates the discovery of hypothetical zeolites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how growth of an oxide film will influence the deuterium recycling properties of Li on plasma facing surfaces. Lithium films on the walls or plasma-facing material surfaces of a fusion vacuum vessel improves plasma performance in part by removing residual impurity atoms from the plasma. Oxygen atoms, from residual water vapor or eroded oxide surfaces, are a prominent ubiquitous impurity that can create a layer of oxide on lithium films. The results of the work herein also indicate a possibility for determining the thickness of the oxide layer on such Li films by measuring the reflection probability of incident deuterium particles from the surface.</description>

Abstract: We recently introduced the Alchemical Integral Transform (AIT) enabling the prediction of energy differences, and guessed an Ansatz to parametrize space $\pmb{r}$ in some alchemical change $\lambda$. Here, we present a rigorous derivation of AIT's kernel $\mathcal{K}$ and discuss the parametrization $\pmb{r}(\lambda)$ in $n$ dimensions, i.e. necessary conditions, mathematical freedoms and additional constraints when obtaining it. Analytical expressions for changes in energy spectra and densities are given for a number of systems. Examples include homogeneous potentials like the quantum harmonic oscillator, Hydrogen-like atom, and Dirac well, both for one- and multiparticle cases, and a multiparticle system beyond coordinate scaling for harmonic potentials.</description>

      <title>Predicting solvation free energies with an implicit solvent machine learning potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) potentials are a powerful tool in molecular modeling, enabling ab initio accuracy for comparably small computational costs. Nevertheless, all-atom simulations employing best-performing graph neural network architectures are still too expensive for applications requiring extensive sampling, such as free energy computations. Implicit solvent models could provide the necessary speed-up due to reduced degrees of freedom and faster dynamics. Here, we introduce a Solvation Free Energy Path Reweighting (ReSolv) framework to parametrize an implicit solvent ML potential for small organic molecules that accurately predicts the hydration free energy, an essential parameter in drug design and pollutant modeling. With a combination of top-down (experimental hydration free energy data) and bottom-up (ab initio data of molecules in a vacuum) learning, ReSolv bypasses the need for intractable ab initio data of molecules in explicit bulk solvent and does not have to resort to less accurate data-generating models. On the FreeSolv dataset, ReSolv achieves a mean absolute error close to average experimental uncertainty, significantly outperforming standard explicit solvent force fields. Compared to the explicit solvent ML potential, ReSolv offers a computational speedup of four orders of magnitude and attains closer agreement with experiments. The presented framework paves the way toward deep molecular models that are more accurate yet computationally cheaper than classical atomistic models.</description>

      <title>Quantum Electron Dynamics in Helium Ion Injection onto Tungsten Surfaces Based on Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The neutralization process of an ion particle on a surface is key issue of the plasma-wall interaction (PWI). We investigated helium (He) ion injection onto a tungsten surface using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulation. We developed the TDDFT code QUMASUN for this study, simulating the process of electron transfer from the surface to the He nucleus by solving the time evolution of electron wave function and the classical motion of nuclei simultaneously. Our results show that the probabilities of injected $\text{He}^{2+}$ changing into $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ on the surface are approximately 40 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The captured electrons by $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ predominantly occupy the 2s and 2p orbitals, corresponding to excited states. In addition, we stated some challenges for applying TDDFT to plasma-wall interactions.</description>

      <title>A new Green's function formalism for kinetic energy density functional for atomic and molecular system: Emergence of $N-$dependence using model potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An accurate expression of the kinetic energy density of an electronic distribution in terms of the single particle reduced density matrix for atomic and molecular systems is a long-standing problem in electron structure theory. Existing kinetic energy density functionals are generally expressed as modifications over kinetic energy of homogeneous electron gas and/or von Weizs\"acker kinetic energy. A large class of these functionals also require empirical parametrizations to make accurate predictions of the kinetic energy for atomic and molecular systems restricting their transferability. Moreover, the correct kinetic energy density which produces accurate local properties such as atomic shell structure is still an unsolved problem. In this work, we have developed an exact methodology that can be used to derive the kinetic energy of an electronic system of arbitrary spin multiplicity. One of the attractive features of this present analytical formalism is the possibility of systematic improvement of the kinetic energy by virtue of a novel perturbation series. Applying this methodology to simple model systems such as one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and homogeneous electron gas produces a qualitatively correct $N$-dependence of kinetic energy as a result. A one-to-one correspondence between our formalism to the traditional Green's function formalism is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Molecular Structure: A Multimodal Spectroscopic Dataset for Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spectroscopic techniques are essential tools for determining the structure of molecules. Different spectroscopic techniques, such as Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Infrared spectroscopy, and Mass Spectrometry, provide insight into the molecular structure, including the presence or absence of functional groups. Chemists leverage the complementary nature of the different methods to their advantage. However, the lack of a comprehensive multimodal dataset, containing spectra from a variety of spectroscopic techniques, has limited machine-learning approaches mostly to single-modality tasks for predicting molecular structures from spectra. Here we introduce a dataset comprising simulated $^1$H-NMR, $^{13}$C-NMR, HSQC-NMR, Infrared, and Mass spectra (positive and negative ion modes) for 790k molecules extracted from chemical reactions in patent data. This dataset enables the development of foundation models for integrating information from multiple spectroscopic modalities, emulating the approach employed by human experts. Additionally, we provide benchmarks for evaluating single-modality tasks such as structure elucidation, predicting the spectra for a target molecule, and functional group predictions. This dataset has the potential automate structure elucidation, streamlining the molecular discovery pipeline from synthesis to structure determination. The dataset and code for the benchmarks can be found at https://rxn4chemistry.github.io/multimodal-spectroscopic-dataset.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the molecular electron chirality by electronic excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previously, it was predicted that the parity-violating energy difference (PVED) between enantiomers and the molecular electron chirality (MEC), which is the integrated value of the electron chirality density over the entire molecule are enhanced for ionization or electronic excitation. Following the confirmation of the enhancement of the PVED by electronic excitation in our previous papers, the present work confirms that electronic excitation enhances the MEC for H$_2$Te$_2$ and H$_2$Se$_2$. The PVED in the first excited state is explained by the contribution from the highest occupied molecular orbital if the PVED contribution from the highest occupied molecular orbital in the ground state dominates over any other contributions. In this paper, it is checked whether this explanation can also be applicable to the MEC. It is also reported that the MEC is not the simple sum of contributions from each atom and the mixing by the superposition between atomic orbitals of different atoms is important.</description>

      <title>Classification and Spatiotemporal Correlation of Dominant Fluctuations in Complex Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18844v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The behavior of many complex systems, from nanostructured materials to animal colonies, is governed by local transitions that, while involving a restricted number of interacting units, may generate collective cascade phenomena. Tracking such local events and understanding how they emerge and propagate throughout these systems represent often a challenge. Common strategies monitor specific parameters, tailored ad hoc to describe certain systems, over time. However, such approaches typically require prior knowledge of the underpinning physics and are poorly transferable to different systems. Here we present LEAP, a general, transferable, agnostic analysis approach that can reveal precious information on the physics of a variety of complex dynamical systems simply starting from the trajectory of their constitutive units. Built on a bivariate combination of two abstract descriptors, LENS and {\tau}SOAP, the LEAP analysis allows (i) detecting the emergence of local fluctuations in simulation or experimentally-acquired trajectories of any type of multicomponent system, (ii) classifying fluctuations into categories, and (iii) correlating them in space and time. We demonstrate how LEAP, just building on the abstract concepts of local fluctuations and their spatiotemporal correlation, efficiently reveals precious insights on the emergence and propagation of local and collective phenomena in a variety of complex dynamical systems ranging from the atomic- to the microscopic-scale. Given its abstract character, we expect that LEAP will offer an important tool to understand and predict the behavior of systems whose physics is unknown a priori, as well as to revisit a variety of known complex physical phenomena under a new perspective.</description>

      <title>Self-replicating fuels via autocatalytic molecular bond fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This computational study advances a theoretical framework for practical, electrochemical fuel generation displaying exponential product yields and product formation rates as functions of time. Exponential reaction scaling is simulated through an autocatalytic cycle that emulates the process of DNA replication facilitated by the well-known polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here, an initial buildup of formate into a two-carbon chain through CO2 carboxylation forms oxalate. A subsequent, two-electron reduction yields glyoxylate, with base-mediated hydrolysis driving C-C bond fission of glyoxylate into two molecules of formate. These products are then recycled back to serve as reactants. This recursive process chemistry displays 2^n stoichiometries with respect to formate growth in the limit of ideal reaction selectivity. Each step of the proposed fuel cycle shows direct analogy to the steps of DNA annealing, nucleotide polymerization and hybridized strand fission that are responsible for the exponential product yields observed in PCR-mediated DNA synthesis. As a consequence of this replication behavior, rapid rates of fuel production are accessible even when the individual rate constants for the cycle's constituent processes are slow. Significant focus is placed on practical routes for realizing each of the three steps comprising this model case of formate replication, particularly the challenge of formate carboxylation and the corresponding energy demands and power constraints of the overall process.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics and Machine Learning Unlock Possibilities in Beauty Design -- A Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational molecular design -- the endeavor to design molecules, with various missions, aided by machine learning and molecular dynamics approaches, has been widely applied to create valuable new molecular entities, from small molecule therapeutics to protein biologics. In the small data regime, physics-based approaches model the interaction between the molecule being designed and proteins of key physiological functions, providing structural insights into the mechanism. When abundant data has been collected, a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) can be more directly constructed from experimental data, from which machine learning can distill key insights to guide the design of the next round of experiment design. Machine learning methodologies can also facilitate physical modeling, from improving the accuracy of force fields and extending them to unseen chemical spaces, to more directly enhancing the sampling on the conformational spaces. We argue that these techniques are mature enough to be applied to not just extend the longevity of life, but the beauty it manifests. In this perspective, we review the current frontiers in the research \&amp; development of skin care products, as well as the statistical and physical toolbox applicable to addressing the challenges in this industry. Feasible interdisciplinary research projects are proposed to harness the power of machine learning tools to design innovative, effective, and inexpensive skin care products.</description>
