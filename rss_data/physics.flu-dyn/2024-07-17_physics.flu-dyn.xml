      <title>Deep flows transmitted by forced surface gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine a deep-water surface gravity wave packet generated by a pressure disturbance in the Lagrangian reference frame. The pressure disturbance has the form of a narrow-banded weakly nonlinear deep-water wave packet. During the forcing, the vorticity equation implies that the momentum is entirely in the near-surface Lagrangian mean flow. After the forcing is turned off, the wave packet propagates away from the forcing region carrying with it the energy imparted from the pressure forcing. These waves together with their induced long wave response have no momentum, in agreement with the classical results of Longuet-Higgins and Stewart (1962) and McIntyre (1981). The momentum imparted to the fluid from the form stress of the pressure forcing is entirely in a dipolar structure that remains in the area of the forcing event. This is in contrast with the finite-depth scenario discussed in McIntyre (1981) where the momentum imparted to the fluid by the forcing event propagates away as shallow water waves. Finally, we examine waves propagating from deep to shallow water and argue that wave packets, which initially have no momentum, may have non-zero momentum in finite-depth water through the trapping of a long wave at the step change in depth, which ensures the total momentum of the system remains conserved.</description>

      <title>Wind Tunnel Testing and Modeling Implications of an Advanced Turbine Cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the extensive Wind Tunnel (WT) linear cascade testing campaign carried out on a constant section turbine blade developed for low subsonic applications. Comprehensive experimental program was designed to determine the aerodynamic behaviour of this blade under a wide range of varying geometrical like Pitch to Chord Ratio, Stagger Angle and Aerodynamic like Reynolds Roughness, Mach number, Incidence angle conditions. In addition to the classical Two-Dimensional (2D) measurements, targeted Three-Dimensional (3D) surveys have been performed to complement the 2D results, allowing to draw supplementary conclusions as to the behaviour of the considered blade in three-dimensions. The performed experiments predominantly covered the transitional and beginning of a fully turbulent flow regime (maximum Re is 2.5 million). Post processing of experimental results were done in view of exploitation and judgment of some key aerodynamic aspects; parameters such as profile section load distribution, loss coefficient and flow deviation angle. Alongside with confirmation of the design targets, a parallel goal pursued in the current WT testing, was to get a more accurate idea as to the predictive capabilities of the employed CFD tools (CFX and MISES) under the basic flow condition generated in the WT. The aim was to get a global picture, as to the level of agreement that can be reached by the used design tools while accounting for the afore-mentioned design, operational variables. The obtained measurement results clearly indicated the success of the design in achieving the pre-set targets. The paper further provides a detailed discussion on the identified discrepancies, measurement versus predictions, of the key parameters at the geometric, aerodynamic design as well as off-design conditions.</description>

      <title>Harnessing an elastic flow instability to improve the kinetic performance of chromatographic columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite decades of research and development, the optimal efficiency of slurry-packed HPLC columns is still hindered by inherent long-range flow heterogeneity from the wall to the central bulk region of these columns. Here, we show an example of how this issue can be addressed through the straightforward addition of a semidilute amount (500~ppm) of a large, flexible, synthetic polymer (18~MDa partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide, HPAM) to the mobile phase (1\% NaCl aqueous solution) during operation of a 4.6 mm $\times$ 300 mm column packed with 10~$\mu$m BEH$^{\mathrm{TM}}$ 125~\AA \ Particles. Addition of the polymer imparts elasticity to the mobile phase, causing the flow in the interparticle pore space to become unstable above a threshold flow rate. We verify the development of this elastic flow instability using pressure drop measurements of the friction factor versus Reynolds number. In prior work, we showed that this flow instability is characterized by large spatiotemporal fluctuations in the pore-scale flow velocities that may promote analyte dispersion across the column. Axial dispersion measurements of the quasi non-retained tracer thiourea confirm this possibility: they unequivocally reveal that operating above the onset of the instability improves column efficiency by significantly reducing peak asymmetry. These experiments thereby provide a proof-of-concept demonstration that elastic flow instabilities can be harnessed to mitigate the negative impact of trans-column flow heterogeneities on the efficiency of slurry-packed HPLC columns. While this approach has its own inherent limitations and constraints, our work lays the groundwork for future targeted development of polymers that can impart elasticity when dissolved in commonly used liquid chromatography mobile phases, and can thereby generate elastic flow instabilities to help improve the resolution of HPLC columns.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium wall model for large eddy simulations of complex flows exhibiting turbulent smooth body separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a non-equilibrium wall model is proposed for the prediction of turbulent flows experiencing adverse pressure gradients, including separated flow regimes. The mean-flow nonequilibrium is identified by comparing two characteristic velocities: the friction velocity (u_tau) and the viscous-pressure gradient velocity (up). In regions where the pressure gradient velocity is comparable to the friction velocity (up \sim u_tau, the near-wall turbulent closure is modified to include the effect of the pressure-gradient and convective terms. The performance of this wall model is evaluated in two canonical flows experiencing smooth body separation: the NASA-Boeing speed bump and the Bachalo-Johnson bump. Improvements in the predictive capabilities of the proposed model for the conventional equilibrium wall model are theorized and then demonstrated through numerical experiments. In particular, the proposed wall model can capture the onset of boundary layer separation observed in experiments or DNS calculations at resolutions where the equilibrium wall model fails to separate.</description>

      <title>Wave-kinetic dynamics of forced-dissipated turbulent internal gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internal gravity waves are an essential feature of flows stratified media, such as oceans and atmospheres. To investigate their dynamics, we perform simulations of the forced-dissipated kinetic equation describing the evolution of the energy spectrum of weakly nonlinear internal gravity waves. During the early evolution, the three well-known non-local interactions, the Elastic Scattering, the Induced-Diffusion, and the Parametric Sub-Harmonic Instability, together with the Super-Harmonic Instability play a prominent role. In contrast, local interactions are responsible for anisotropic energy cascade on longer time scales. We reveal emergence of a condensate at small horizontal wavevectors that can be interpreted as a pure wave-wave interaction-mediated layering process. We also observe the dynamical formation of an energy spectrum compatible with the Garrett-Munk prediction.</description>

      <title>Adjoint-based assimilation of sparse time-averaged velocity data in large-eddy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need for accurate and fast scale-resolving simulations of fluid flows, where turbulent dispersion is a crucial physical feature, is evident. Large-eddy simulations (LES) are computationally more affordable than direct numerical simulations, but their accuracy depends on sub-grid scale models and the quality of the computational mesh. In order to compensate related errors, a data assimilation approach for LES is devised in this work.
  The presented method is based on variational assimilation of sparse time-averaged velocity reference data through a stationary corrective forcing term in the LES momentum equation working with the time-averaged LES momentum equation allows to employ a stationary discrete adjoint method. Therefore, the stationary forcing in the unsteady LES momentum equation is iteratively updated within the gradient-based optimization framework in conjunction with the adjoint gradient. The implementation is based on a three-dimensional LES solver in OpenFOAM, which is extended to allow the computation of adjoint quantities and, ultimately, the adjoint gradient.
  Efficacy of the proposed framework is demonstrated for turbulent flow over periodic hills and around a square cylinder. Coarse meshes are leveraged to further enhance the speed of the optimization procedure. Time- and spanwise-averaged velocity reference data from high-fidelity simulations is taken from the literature.
  Our results demonstrate that adjoint-based assimilation of averaged velocity enables the optimization of the mean flow, vortex shedding frequency (i.e., Strouhal number), and turbulent kinetic energy. This highlights the superiority of scale-resolving simulations such as LES over simulations based on the (unsteady) Reynolds-averaged equations.</description>

      <title>Application of the thin-film equations in modelling of Marangoni flow patterns amongst surfactant source and drain locations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surfactants that are deposited at aqueous liquid films have the ability to generate surface tension gradients at the air-water interface, and thereby induce Marangoni flow. Combined with the production and depletion of surfactants at different locations of source and drains, out-of-equilibrium surface tension gradients can be sustained, resulting in Marangoni flow patterns that drive e.g., self-organization of amphiphile myelin assemblies. Here, a mathematical model based on the thin-film equations is proposed to simulate these flow patterns. The model equations are based on the surfactant source and drain concentrations, film-height and surfactant bulk concentration. We present a numerical scheme for approximating the model equations and discuss the numerically observed properties of the model.</description>

      <title>Semi-Analytical Modeling of Transient Stream Drawdown and Depletion in Response to Aquifer Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical and semi-analytical models for stream depletion with transient stream stage drawdown induced by groundwater pumping are developed to address a deficiency in existing models, namely, the use of a fixed stream stage condition at the stream-aquifer interface. Field data are presented to demonstrate that stream stage drawdown does indeed occur in response to groundwater pumping near aquifer connected streams. A model that predicts stream depletion with transient stream drawdown is developed, based on stream channel mass conservation and finite stream channel storage. The resulting models are shown to reduce to existing fixed-stage models in the limit as stream channel storage becomes infinitely large, and to the confined aquifer flow with a no-flow boundary at the streambed in the limit as stream storage becomes vanishingly small. The model is applied to field measurements of aquifer and stream drawdown, giving estimates of aquifer hydraulic parameters, streambed conductance and a measure of stream channel storage. The results of the modeling and data analysis presented herein have implications for sustainable groundwater management.</description>

      <title>Dissociation of red blood cell aggregates in extensional flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11645v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blood rheology and microcirculation are strongly influenced by red blood cell aggregation. We investigate the dissociation rates of red cell aggregates in extensional flow using hyperbolic microfluidic constrictions and image analysis by a convolutional neural network (CNN). Our findings reveal that aggregate dissociation increases sharply when a critical extension rate is reached which falls within the range of microcirculatory conditions, suggesting that large variations of aggregate sizes should be expected in-vivo. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the behavior of red blood cell aggregates in response to extensional stress in microcirculatory networks, provides crucial experimental data to validate theoretical and numerical models, and constitutes the basis for improved evaluation of blood aggregability in clinical contexts.</description>

      <title>Navigating Munk's Abyssal Recipes: Reconciling the Paradoxes and Suggesting an Upwelling Mechanism for Bottom Water in a Flat-Bottom Ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Walter Munk's classical work, known as the "abyssal recipes", introduced a foundational framework for comprehending the upwelling of abyssal waters. While it has spurred numerous investigations into the complexities of deep-ocean processes from theoretical, laboratory, and field perspectives, it has also faced challenges when compared to direct observations spanning decades. Two particularly intriguing paradoxes emerge: the dichotomy of diffusivities and the conundrum of interior downwelling. This study attempts to resolve these paradoxes by examining the isopycnal displacement velocity within the dynamic framework of Munk's abyssal recipes. A relieving inference is that it seems no longer an imperative to seek a globally averaged diapycnal diffusivity of O(1) cm2/s to close the mass budget associated with the bottom-water formation rate. Through box-model experiments, a novel erosion-intrusion model is proposed to elucidate the mechanism of abyssal upwelling in flat-bottom ocean, drawing an analogy to the growth of "tree rings". Based upon this model, the average rising velocity in the abyssal North Pacific is estimated using observational data of biogeochemical tracers. The proposed model does not seek to disprove existing theories but rather acts as a complement for situations that prevailing theories may not apply, such as cases with flat-bottom topography or non-bottom-intensified diffusivity.</description>

      <title>An Edge-based Interface Tracking (EBIT) Method for Multiphase-flows Simulation with Surface Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel Front-Tracking method, the Edge-Based Interface Tracking (EBIT) method for multiphase flow simulations. In the EBIT method, the markers are located on the grid edges and the interface can be reconstructed without storing the connectivity of the markers. This feature makes the process of marker addition or removal easier than in the traditional Front-Tracking method. The EBIT method also allows almost automatic parallelization due to the lack of explicit connectivity.
  In a previous journal article we have presented the kinematic part of the EBIT method, that includes the algorithms for piecewise linear reconstruction and advection of the interface. Here, we complete the presentation of the EBIT method and combine the kinematic algorithm with a Navier--Stokes solver. A circle fit is now implemented to improve the accuracy of mass conservation in the reconstruction phase. Furthermore, to identify the reference phase and to distinguish ambiguous topological configurations, we introduce a new feature: the Color Vertex. For the coupling with the Navier--Stokes equations, we first calculate volume fractions from the position of the markers and the Color Vertex, then viscosity and density fields from the computed volume fractions and finally surface tension stresses with the Height-Function method. In addition, an automatic topology change algorithm is implemented into the EBIT method, making it possible the simulation of more complex flows. The two-dimensional version of the EBIT method has been implemented in the free Basilisk platform, and validated with seven standard test cases: stagnation flow, translation with uniform velocity, single vortex, Zalesak's disk, capillary wave, Rayleigh-Taylor instability and rising bubble. The results are compared with those obtained with the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method already implemented in Basilisk.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional numerical investigation of flashback in premixed hydrogen flames within perforated burners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00744v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting flashback represents a pivotal challenge in the development of innovative perforated burners for household appliances, especially for substituting natural gas with hydrogen as fuel. Most existing numerical studies have utilized two-dimensional (2D) simulations to investigate flashback in these burners, primarily to reduce computational costs. However, the inherent complexity of flashback phenomena suggests that 2D models may inadequately capture the flame dynamics, potentially leading to inaccurate estimations of flashback limits. In this study, three-dimensional (3D) simulations are employed to examine the impact of the actual slit shapes on the flashback velocities of hydrogen-premixed flames. Steady-state simulations are conducted to compute flashback velocities for three equivalence ratios ($\phi=0.6$, $0.8$, and $1.0$), investigating slits with fixed width and varying lengths. Additionally, transient simulations are performed to investigate the flashback dynamics. The results are compared with those from 2D configurations to assess the reliability of the infinite slit approximation. For stable flames, 2D simulations underpredict the burner plate temperature compared to slits with lengths typical of practical devices but match the 3D results as $L\to\infty$. Conversely, flashback velocities are consistently underpredicted in 2D simulations compared to 3D simulations, even as $L\to\infty$. This is due to the critical role of the slit ends in flashback dynamics, where preferential diffusion effects and enhanced heat transfer trigger the initiation of flashback in those regions. These findings underscore the necessity of employing 3D simulations to estimate the flashback velocities in domestic perforated burners accurately.</description>

      <title>An extension of the compound flow theory with friction between the streams and at the wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compound flows consist of two or more parallel compressible streams in a duct and their theoretical treatment has gained attention for the analysis and modelling of ejectors. Recent works have shown that these flows can experience choking upstream of the geometric throat. While it is well known that friction can push the sonic section downstream the throat, no mechanism has been identified yet to explain its displacement in the opposite direction. This study extends the existing compound flow theory and proposes a 1D model including friction between the streams and the duct walls. The model captures the upstream and downstream displacements of the sonic section. Through an analytical investigation of the singularity at the sonic section, it is demonstrated that friction between the streams is the primary driver of upstream displacement. Finally, the predictions of the model are compared to axisymmetric Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of a compound nozzle. The effect of friction is investigated using an inviscid simulation for the isentropic case and viscous simulations with both slip and no-slip conditions at the wall. The proposed extension accurately captures the displacement of the sonic section, offering a new tool for in-depth analysis and modeling of internal compound flows.</description>

      <title>Prediction of turbulent channel flow using Fourier neural operator-based machine-learning strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast and accurate predictions of turbulent flows are of great importance in the science and engineering field. In this paper, we investigate the implicit U-Net enhanced Fourier neural operator (IUFNO) in the stable prediction of long-time dynamics of three-dimensional (3D) turbulent channel flows. The trained IUFNO models are tested in the large-eddy simulations (LES) at coarse grids for three friction Reynolds numbers: $Re_{\tau}\approx180$, $395$ and $590$. The adopted near-wall mesh grids are tangibly coarser than the general requirements for wall-resolved LES. Compared to the original Fourier neural operator (FNO), the implicit FNO (IFNO) and U-Net enhanced FNO (UFNO), the IUFNO model has a much better long-term predictive ability. The numerical experiments show that the IUFNO framework outperforms the traditional dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) and the wall-adapted local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model in the predictions of a variety of flow statistics and structures, including the mean and fluctuating velocities, the probability density functions (PDFs) and joint PDF of velocity fluctuations, the Reynolds stress profile, the kinetic energy spectrum, and the Q-criterion (vortex structures). Meanwhile, the trained IUFNO models are computationally much faster than the traditional LES models. Thus, the IUFNO model is a promising approach for the fast prediction of wall-bounded turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>On the statistical theory of self-gravitating collisionless dark matter flow: high order kinematic and dynamic relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To better understand the collisionless dark matter flow on different scales, statistical theory involving kinematic and dynamic relations must be developed for different types of flow, e.g. incompressible, constant divergence, and irrotational flow. This paper extends our previous work on the second-order statistics (Phys. Fluids 35, 077105) to high order statistics. Kinematic and dynamic relations were developed for dark matter flow on different scales. The results were validated by N-body simulations. On large scales, we found i) third-order velocity correlations can be related to density correlation or pairwise velocity; ii) the $p$th-order velocity correlations follow $\propto a^{(p+2)/2}$ for odd $p$ and $\propto a^{p/2}$ for even $p$, where $a$ is the scale factor; iii) the overdensity $\delta$ is proportional to density correlation on the same scale; iv) velocity dispersion on a given scale $r$ is proportional to the overdensity on the same scale. On small scales, i) a self-closed velocity evolution is developed by decomposing the velocity into motion in haloes and motion of haloes; ii) the evolution of vorticity and enstrophy are derived from the evolution of velocity; iii) dynamic relations are derived to relate second- and third-order correlations; iv) while the first moment of pairwise velocity follows $\langle\Delta u_L\rangle=-Har$ ($H$ is the Hubble parameter), the third moment follows $\langle(\Delta u_L)^3\rangle\propto\varepsilon_uar$ that can be directly compared with simulations and observations, where $\varepsilon_u\approx10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$ is the constant rate for energy cascade; v) the $p$th order velocity correlations follow $\propto a^{(3p-5)/4}$ for odd $p$ and $\propto a^{3p/4}$ for even $p$. Finally, the combined kinematic and dynamic relations lead to exponential and one-fourth power-law velocity correlations on large and small scales, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Geophysical flow simulations using hyperbolic shallow water moment equations require an efficient discretization of a potentially large system of PDEs, the so-called moment system. This calls for tailored model order reduction techniques that allow for efficient and accurate simulations while guaranteeing physical properties like mass conservation. In this paper, we develop the first model reduction for the hyperbolic shallow water moment equations and achieve mass conservation. This is accomplished using a macro-micro decomposition of the model into a macroscopic (conservative) part and a microscopic (non-conservative) part with subsequent model reduction using either POD-Galerkin or dynamical low-rank approximation only on the microscopic (non-conservative) part. Numerical experiments showcase the performance of the new model reduction methods including high accuracy and fast computation times together with guaranteed conservation and consistency properties.</description>

      <title>The MEMENTO code for modelling of macroscopic melt motion in fusion devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The MEMENTO (MEtallic Melt Evolution in Next-step TOkamaks) code is a new numerical implementation of the physics model originally developed for the MEMOS-U code with the objective to self-consistently describe the generation of melt and its subsequent large scale dynamics in fusion devices and to assess the damage of metallic reactor armor under powerful normal and off-normal plasma events. The model has been validated in multiple dedicated EUROfusion experiments. MEMENTO solves the heat and phase transfer problem coupled with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the shallow water approximation for the thin liquid film over the solid metal and with the current propagation equations on a domain that features a time-evolving deforming metal-plasma interface. The code utilizes non-uniform and adaptive meshing along with sub-cycling in time facilitated by the AMReX open-source framework as well as AMReX's built-in parallelization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Simulation of Two-Phase Flows with Neural PDE Surrogates</title>

Abstract: Simulation is a powerful tool to better understand physical systems, but generally requires computationally expensive numerical methods. Downstream applications of such simulations can become computationally infeasible if they require many forward solves, for example in the case of inverse design with many degrees of freedom. In this work, we investigate and extend neural PDE solvers as a tool to aid in scaling simulations for two-phase flow problems, and simulations of oil expulsion from a pore specifically. We extend existing numerical methods for this problem to a more complex setting involving varying geometries of the domain to generate a challenging dataset. Further, we investigate three prominent neural PDE solver methods, namely the UNet, DRN, and U-FNO, and extend them for characteristics of the oil-expulsion problem: (1) spatial conditioning on the geometry; (2) periodicity in the boundary; (3) approximate mass conservation. We scale all methods and benchmark their speed-accuracy trade-off, evaluate qualitative properties, and perform an ablation study. We find that the investigated methods can accurately model the droplet dynamics with up to three orders of magnitude speed-up, that our extensions improve performance over the baselines, and that the introduced varying geometries constitute a significantly more challenging setting over the previously considered oil expulsion problem.</description>
