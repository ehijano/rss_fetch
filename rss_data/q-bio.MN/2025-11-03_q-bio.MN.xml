      <title>Effects of Model Reduction on Coherence and Information Transfer in Stochastic Biochemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplified stochastic models are widely used in the study of frequency-resolved noise propagation in biochemical reaction networks, a common measure being the coherence between random fluctuations in molecule number trajectories. Such models have also found widespread application in the quantification of how information is transmitted in reaction networks via the mutual information (MI) rate. A common assumption is that, under timescale separation, estimates for the coherence and MI rate obtained from simplified (reduced) models closely approximate those in the underlying full models. Here, we challenge that assumption by showing that, while reduced models can faithfully reproduce low-order statistics of molecular counts, they frequently incur substantial discrepancies in the coherence spectrum, especially at intermediate and high frequencies. These errors, in turn, lead to significant inaccuracies in the resulting estimates for the MI rates. We show that the observed discrepancies are due to the interplay between the structure of the underlying reaction networks, the specific model reduction method that is applied, and the asymptotic limits relating the full and the reduced models. We illustrate our results in canonical models of enzyme catalysis and gene expression, highlighting practical implications for quantifying information flow in cells.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of perturbed gradient flow systems on hypergraphs: A perspective towards nonequilibrium physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article serves to concisely review the link between gradient flow systems on hypergraphs and information geometry which has been established within the last five years. Gradient flow systems describe a wealth of physical phenomena and provide powerful analytical technquies which are based on the variational energy-dissipation principle. Modern nonequilbrium physics has complemented this classical principle with thermodynamic uncertaintly relations, speed limits, entropy production rate decompositions, and many more. In this article, we formulate these modern principles within the framework of perturbed gradient flow systems on hypergraphs. In particular, we discuss the geometry induced by the Bregman divergence, the physical implications of dual foliations, as well as the corresponding infinitesimal Riemannian geometry for gradient flow systems. Through the geometrical perspective, we are naturally led to new concepts such as moduli spaces for perturbed gradient flow systems and thermodynamical area which is crucial for understanding speed limits. We hope to encourage the readers working in either of the two fields to further expand on and foster the interaction between the two fields.</description>
