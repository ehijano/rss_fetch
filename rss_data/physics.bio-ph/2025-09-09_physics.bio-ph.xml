      <title>Phyllotaxis in a Keller-Segel model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plants often exhibit regular arrangements of seeds or leaves, known as phyllotaxis, and can famously exhibit Fibonacci spirals, as in sunflower heads or on pine cones. While there are many models which can reproduce spiral formation, the actual mechanism of arrangement remains unclear. Here, we test a more general class of model, based on the Keller-Segel model, in which a diffusing chemical signal produces its own transport signal and can form local instabilities. By modelling the plant as a disc with a signal source at the center and radial growth, we show that we can reproduce both Fibonacci spirals and alternating patterns, depending on a balance between growth and source. Finally, using linear stability analysis, we show how the pattern arises due to a balance between the growth of instabilities and the growth of the plant. Overall, this work demonstrates how the Keller-Segel model can reproduce a wide range of observed patterns, and may act as a phenomenological description of a number of processes in plants.</description>

      <title>A multiscale theory for network advection-reaction-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical network models are extremely useful to capture complex propagation processes between different regions (nodes), for example the spread of an infectious agent between different countries, or the transport and replication of toxic proteins across different brain regions in neurodegenerative diseases. In these models, transport is modeled at the macroscale through an operator, the so-called graph Laplacian, based on the edge properties and topology, capturing the fluxes between different nodes of the network. However, this phenomenological approach fails to take into account the physical processes taking place at the microscale within the edge. A fundamental problem is then to obtain a transport operator from mechanistic principles based on the underlying transport process. Using advection-reaction-diffusion as a generic mechanism for inter-nodal exchanges, we derive a multiscale network transport model and obtain the corresponding linear transport operator at the macroscale from first principles. This effective graph Laplacian is fully determined by the transport mechanisms along the edges at the microscale. We show that this operator correctly captures the transport, and we study its scaling properties with respect to edge length.</description>

      <title>Semi-automated image analysis of Cellulose Nanofibrils using Machine learning segmentation and Morphological thinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable and rapid morphology measurement of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) with a high level of branching and entanglement is crucial for quality control, grade definition, and investigating morphology-performance relationships in various applications. An image analysis framework, Fibril Analysis for Cellulose Technology (FACT), which utilizes machine learning (ML) segmentation and morphological thinning, was developed to measure the fibril width distribution of cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) from negative contrast scanning electron microscopy (NegC-SEM) images. The high-contrast and wide magnification range of NegC-SEM imaging enabled the capture of micro- and nanoscopic hierarchical branching structures of CNFs. Two ML approaches [Weka and U-Net] were used to create detailed binary segmentation of grayscale NegC-SEM images, critical for the width analysis. Morphological thinning was applied to the binary image to produce a 1-pixel-wide skeleton of the CNF fibril structure. Subsequently, the distance between the skeleton and the original fibril edge was used to calculate fibril width. The FACT framework was optimized and validated with idealized geometric and hierarchical branched structures. FACT effectively performed segmentation, skeletonization, and fibril width measurement of these CNF morphologies. FACT width results were comparable with manual measurements. In the manual method, a single measurement is made per fibril. In contrast, FACT simultaneously makes multiple measurements along each fibril within the entire CNF branched network structure. The advantage of FACT is that complicated branching and network CNF structures can be measured without imparting any analyst bias in fibril selection and measurement. Additionally, once the ML model is trained, each image can be analyzed in under 5 minutes.</description>

      <title>Boundary-shape driven transitions in vortex and oscillatory dynamics of confined epithelial cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the collective motion of epithelial cell populations is fundamental for understanding multicellular self-organization and for advancing tissue engineering. Under spatial confinement, cells are known to exhibit either vortex rotation or oscillatory motion depending on boundary geometry, but the mechanisms governing transitions between these states remain unclear. Here, we investigated the collective motion of MDCK cells confined within a doublet circular boundary, where the confinement aspect ratio, defined as the distance between the centers of two circles relative to their radius, can be tuned by varying the degree of overlap. When the overlap is large, cells form a stable vortex. Increasing the confinement aspect ratio destabilizes this vortex and induces oscillatory motion characterized by periodic reversals of migration direction, before ultimately transitioning into disordered dynamics. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we developed simulations of self-propelled particles incorporating local alignment (LA) and contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL). The model successfully reproduced the experimentally observed transitions from vortices to oscillatory motion and further revealed that an appropriate balance between LA and CIL is critical for stabilizing vortex pairs with velocity reversals. Our findings demonstrate that the confinement aspect ratio serves as a minimal control parameter governing transitions in the collective dynamics of epithelial monolayers.</description>

      <title>A mother-machine microfluidic device for non-adherent mammalian cells reveals the population growth strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mother machine-like microfluidic device specifically designed to track the proliferation of T-cells via live-cell microscopy. Although numerous microfluidic setups have been developed to study cell proliferation at the single-cell level, most of them are optimized for use on adherent cells. Here, we present a device to track the proliferation of suspension cells, featuring an array of microchannels that trap cells, easing their monitoring while allowing for controlled growth conditions. Each microchannel, whose geometry has been optimized through computational fluid dynamics simulations, allows a single cell to enter and proliferate while maintaining a continuous flow of nutrients, ensuring long-term monitoring over multiple generations. We show the advantages of this system in characterizing the proliferation of human leukemia T-cells. In particular, we follow the growth and division over multiple generations, finding that cells exhibit a slightly asymmetric volume division where deviations in the size are compensated by a size-like division strategy. Overall, our device design can be easily adapted and used to study different cell types and sizes while maintaining the same high trapping efficiency.</description>

      <title>Bayesian field theory for the rate estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the statistical inference of a time-dependent rate of events in the framework of Bayesian field theory. By mapping the problem to a stochastic partial differential equation, as it is standard approach in field theory, we are able to numerically sample the distribution around the maximum likelihood path. We then analytically consider the perturbative expansion around the local and linear solution, and at the leading-order correction to the variance we find novel terms which depend on the local shape of the maximum likelihood path. We show that this shape correction is statistically most important in the variance expansion than the nonlinearity corrections. We then demonstrate the general applicability of the simulation method by extending it to the case of uncertain event times and by estimating the mortality rate in Venice during the 1348 Black Death epidemics from indirect evidence.</description>

      <title>Computational predictions of nutrient precipitation for intensified cell 1 culture media via amino acid solution thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on the market are produced using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells cultured at scale in chemically defined cell culture medium. Because of the high costs associated with mammalian cell cultures, obtaining high cell densities to produce high product titers is desired. These bioprocesses require high concentrations of nutrients in the basal media and periodically adding concentrated feed media to sustain cell growth and therapeutic protein productivity. Unfortunately, the desired or optimal nutrient concentrations of the feed media are often solubility limited due to precipitation of chemical complexes that form in the solution. Experimentally screening the various cell culture media configurations which contain 50 to 100 compounds can be expensive and laborious. This article lays the foundation for utilizing computational tools to understand precipitation of nutrients in cell culture media by studying the pairwise interactions between amino acids in thermodynamic models. Activity coefficient data for one amino acid in water and amino acid solubility data of two amino acids in water have been used to determine a single set of UNIFAC group interaction parameters to predict the thermodynamic behavior of the multi-component systems found in mammalian cell culture media. The data collected in this study is, to our knowledge, the largest set of ternary system amino acid solubility data reported to date. These amino acid precipitation predictions have been verified with experimentally measured ternary and quaternary amino acid solutions. Thus, we demonstrate the utility of our model as a digital twin to identify optimal cell culture media compositions by replacing empirical approaches for nutrient precipitation with computational predictions based on thermodynamics of individual media components in complex mixtures.</description>

      <title>Seeing new depths: Three-dimensional flow of a free-swimming alga</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A swimming microorganism stirs the surrounding fluid, creating a flow field that governs not only its locomotion and nutrient uptake, but also its interactions with other microorganisms and the environment. Despite its fundamental importance, capturing this flow field and unraveling its biological implications remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we report the first direct, time-resolved measurements of the three-dimensional (3D) flow field generated by a single, free-swimming microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a widely studied model organism for flagellar motility. Supported by hydrodynamic modeling and simulations, our measurements resolve how established two-dimensional (2D) flow features such as in-plane vortices and the stagnation point emerge from and shape the 3D structure of the algal flow. More importantly, we reveal unexpected low-Reynolds-number flow phenomena including micron-sized vortex rings and a periodic train of traveling vortices and uncover topological changes in the underlying fluid structure associated with the puller-to-pusher transition of an alga, substantially deepening our understanding of algal motility. Biologically, access to the complete 3D flow field enables rigorous quantification of the alga's energy expenditure, as well as its swimming and feeding efficiency, significantly improving the precision of these key physiological metrics. Taken together, our study demonstrate extraordinary vortex dynamics in inertialess flows and advances fundamental knowledge of microhydrodynamics and its influence on microbial behavior. The work establishes a powerful method for comprehensively mapping the fluid environment sculpted by the beating flagella of motile cells.</description>

      <title>What is balance? A vital mechano-regulation paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within minutes of birth a newborn gnu or giraffe works to stand and walk, asserting postural balance and organised animate behaviour in an apparently goal-directed manner. In contrast, robots learning to stand and walk from scratch begin with random flailing, the behaviour cohering over time as the robot internalises some reward or value signal. How does the newborn gnu innately know what goal to aim for, and decide to work towards it? How could similar goal-directed balance learning be implemented in robots? Currently, animate balance inherits its axiomatic definition from the Newtonian formulation for inanimate balance - static mechanical equilibrium. This is arguably inappropriate for animate balance, because animals need to move and are never in static mechanical equilibrium, giving rise to the posture-movement paradox. The present perspective article proposes a more fluid, dynamical axiomatic task definition and goal which (a) isolates resisting gravity, (b) admits and enables movement, and (c) subsumes static mechanical equilibrium as a special case. This novel definition is founded upon inevitable biophysical requirements and observable developmental process. The article explains how animals apprehend and embed this goal through prenatal development suspended in equidense amniotic fluid, and then are challenged to self-maintain it by the perinatal transition. The account entails a paradigmatic shift in putative physiological organisation and associated conceptual framework for balance from a subsidiary sensorimotor control task, to a vital mechano-regulation task organisationally akin to thermo-regulation. This vital mechano-regulation model of balance has practical implications and implies a range of predictions.</description>

Abstract: Cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) have two mechanosensitive elements: the hair bundle with mechanotrasducer channels and the piezoelectric lateral wall of the cell body. The present report examines how these elements interact with each other by incorporating OHCs into the simplest local cochlear models. In the frequency range, typically above 1 kHz, where capacitive conductance is greater than the ionic conductance, hair bundle (HB) conductance drives the piezoelectric cell body and amplified oscillation by countering viscous drag, while the cell body increases its stiffness owing to strain-induced polarization, elevating the resonance frequency. Since HB sensitivity is essential for amplification, the resonance is not pure piezoelectric, but semi-piezoelectric. In the lower frequency range, typically lower than 100 Hz, strain induced polarization contributes to drag and the HB sensitivity increases cell body stiffness.</description>

      <title>Nano-chemical cell-surface evaluation in photothermal spectroscopic imaging of antimicrobial interaction in model system Bacillus subtilis &amp; vancomycin</title>

Abstract: The power of photothermal spectroscopic imaging to visualize antimicrobial interaction on the surface of individual bacteria cells has been demonstrated on the model system Bacillus subtilis and vancomycin using mid-infrared photo-induced force microscopy (PiF-IR, also mid-IR PiFM). High-resolution PiF contrasts obtained by merging subsequent PiF-IR scans at two different illumination frequencies revealed chemical details of cell wall destruction after 30 and 60 min incubation with vancomycin with a spatial resolution of $\approx 5$ nm. This approach compensates local intensity variations induced by near-field coupling of the illuminating electric field with nanostructured surfaces, which appear in single-frequency contrasts in photothermal imaging methods, as shown by [Anindo et al., J. Phys. Chem C, 2025, 129, 4517]. Known spectral shifts associated with hydrogen bond formation between vancomycin and the N-acyl-D-Ala4-D-Ala5 termini in the peptidoglycan cell wall have been observed in chemometrics of PiF-IR spectra from treated and untreated Bacillus subtilis harvested after 30 min from the same experiment. Spectral signatures of the vancomyin interaction have been located in the piecrust of a progressing septum with $\approx 10$ nm resolution using PiF contrasts of three selected bands of a PiF-IR hyperspectral scan of an individual Bacillus subtilis cell harvested after 30 min incubation. Our results are complemented by a discussion of imaging artifacts and the influence of parameter settings supporting further development towards standardization in the application of PiF-IR for visualizing the chemical interaction of antibiotics on the surface of microbes with few nanometer resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase separation of biomolecular condensates promotes membrane-free compartmentalization in cells. The dynamics of these biocondensates is routinely regulated by energy-consuming processes. Here, we devise a theory pinpointing how active chemical reactions, interconverting molecules between phase-separating and inert forms, can drive faster condensate coarsening. We find that mass conservation limits droplet volume growth to being linear in time regardless of activity, resembling the passive Lifshitz-Slyozov law. However, if reactions are restricted to occur only outside droplets, the rate of Ostwald ripening can be increased by an arbitrarily large factor. Our theory is quantitatively supported by recent experiments on ripening in the presence of fueled interconversion reactions, under precisely the predicted conditions. We posit that the ability to induce rapid biocondensate coarsening can be advantageous in synthetic-biological contexts, e.g., as a regulator of metabolic channeling.</description>

      <title>Confinement and Activity-Driven Dynamics of Semiflexible Polymers in Motility Assays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of semiflexible polymers driven by motor proteins (MPs) in two-dimensional motility assays under harmonic confinement. Using a coarse-grained agent-based model that incorporates stochastic motor attachment, detachment, and force generation, we study how activity, filament rigidity, and confinement interact to control polymer behavior. We construct dynamical behavior maps as a function of P\'eclet number, motor processivity, and trap strength. We find a two-state transition from a trapped to a free polymer, with an intermediate coexistence region, and obtain a scaling relation for the critical P\'eclet number, which is supported by simulation data across a range of parameters. Polymer flexibility strongly influences confinement: flexible filaments are more easily trapped, while increasing rigidity destabilizes confinement. Processivity of MPs can also induce a change in the effective rigidity of the polymer and, therefore, influence confinement by the trap. Under moderate confinement and activity, we observe the emergence of stable spiral conformations. The center-of-mass dynamics is analyzed through the mean square displacement, showing diffusive, ballistic, and diffusive regimes that depend on the trap strength and activity. Additionally, time series analysis of the excess kurtosis shows the variation of the non-Gaussian fluctuations with trap strength and activity. Our results provide a minimal physical framework to understand the dynamic organization of active filaments under confinement, with relevance to in vitro motility assays, cytoskeletal filament manipulation by optical traps, and synthetic active polymer systems.</description>

Abstract: Two remote agents with synchronized clocks may use them to act in concert and communicate. This necessitates some means of creating and maintaining synchrony. One method, not requiring any direct interaction between the agents, is to expose them to a common, environmental, stochastic forcing. This "noise-induced synchronization" only occurs under sufficiently mild forcing; stronger forcing disrupts synchronization. We investigate the regime of strong noise, where the clocks' relative phases evolve chaotically. Using a simple realization of disruptive noise, we demonstrate effective synchronization. First, although the relative phases of the two clocks varied erratically, we confirm that they became statistically independent of initial conditions and hence equivalent after a well-defined timescale. Second, we show that an agent can estimate an effective phase that closely agrees with the other's phase. Thus, synchronization is practically attainable beyond the regime of conventional noise-induced synchronization. We finally discuss how it might be used in living systems.</description>

Abstract: The functional brain network emerges from the complex, coordinated activity of distinct yet connected regions, which underlie the diverse repertoire of human cognitive functions. Structural Balance Theory (SBT) has been successfully applied to model such nontrivial connections through the analysis of balance and unbalance triadic configurations. In this study, using SBT, we examine the network of imbalanced triads in the resting-state brain subnetworks, which undergo dynamic changes during development. We demonstrate that anticorrelation patterns evolve across the lifespan, reflecting a developmental trajectory from a locally modular organization in childhood to a flexible and reconfigurable architecture during adolescence and finally to a highly segregated and functionally specialized network system in adulthood. This developmental trajectory indicates that the spread of anticorrelations is not an inherent feature of brain organization. This mature organization facilitates a balance between self-referential, internally generated cognitive processes and externally oriented, goal-directed cognition, enabling efficient and adaptive cognitive control. This balance is underpinned by prominent anticorrelations between the Default Mode Network (DMN) and the Frontoparietal Network (FPN) in adulthood. This is while during adolescence these anticorrelations are substantially weaker, suggesting that the maturation of these network connections from adolescence to adulthood establishes a functional architecture that supports the segregation of internal and external cognitive processes. These findings elucidate how the dynamic evolution of anticorrelation patterns in brain networks supports cognitive development across the lifespan, offering new insights into the neural basis of adaptive cognitive control.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Phase Separation and Fractal Interfaces of Colloids in Active Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11000</link>

Abstract: Phase separation driven by nonequilibrium fluctuations is a hallmark of both living and synthetic active matter. Unlike equilibrium systems, where ordered states arise from the minimization of free energy, active systems are fueled by a constant injection of energy at the microscopic scale. The emergence of ordered phases in such driven systems challenges our conventional views of domain growth and interfacial structure. In this study, we investigate the coarsening of colloidal clusters in active liquids containing E. coli. Our experiments reveal that uniform dispersions of colloids and swimmers are inherently unstable, resulting in spontaneous phase separation characterized by fractal interfaces and unconventional kinetics. The correlation function of the order parameter displays dynamical scaling, with the size of colloidal domains growing as $t^{1/z}$, where $z \sim 4$, in contrast to the well-known growth laws for thermal systems with a conserved order parameter. Furthermore, the structure factor exhibits non-Porod behavior, indicating domains with fractal interfaces. This non-Porod behavior also manifests itself as a cusp singularity in the correlation function. We elucidate our experimental findings using a scalar field theory in which the nonequilibrium fluctuations arising from swimmer activity are modeled as spatio-temporally correlated noise. This coarse-grained model, which breaks time-reversal symmetry and detailed balance, successfully reproduces key experimental observations. Furthermore, it reveals a fluctuating microphase separation, where the initial domain growth, following $t^{1/4}$ scaling, is eventually arrested, thereby shedding new light on the microscopic origins of unconventional phase separation of colloids in active liquids.</description>
