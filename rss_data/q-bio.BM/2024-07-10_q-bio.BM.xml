      <title>HERMES: Holographic Equivariant neuRal network model for Mutational Effect and Stability prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the stability and fitness effects of amino acid mutations in proteins is a cornerstone of biological discovery and engineering. Various experimental techniques have been developed to measure mutational effects, providing us with extensive datasets across a diverse range of proteins. By training on these data, traditional computational modeling and more recent machine learning approaches have advanced significantly in predicting mutational effects. Here, we introduce HERMES, a 3D rotationally equivariant structure-based neural network model for mutational effect and stability prediction. Pre-trained to predict amino acid propensity from its surrounding 3D structure, HERMES can be fine-tuned for mutational effects using our open-source code. We present a suite of HERMES models, pre-trained with different strategies, and fine-tuned to predict the stability effect of mutations. Benchmarking against other models shows that HERMES often outperforms or matches their performance in predicting mutational effect on stability, binding, and fitness. HERMES offers versatile tools for evaluating mutational effects and can be fine-tuned for specific predictive objectives.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of computational techniques, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have emerged as powerful tools in biomedical research, enabling in-depth investigations of biological systems at the atomic level. Among the diverse range of simulation software available, LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) has gained significant recognition for its versatility, scalability, and extensive range of functionalities. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the utilization of LAMMPS in the field of biomedical applications. This review begins by outlining the fundamental principles of MD simulations and highlighting the unique features of LAMMPS that make it suitable for biomedical research. Subsequently, a survey of the literature is conducted to identify key studies that have employed LAMMPS in various biomedical contexts, such as protein folding, drug design, biomaterials, and cellular processes. The reviewed studies demonstrate the remarkable contributions of LAMMPS in understanding the behavior of biological macromolecules, investigating drug-protein interactions, elucidating the mechanical properties of biomaterials, and studying cellular processes at the molecular level. Additionally, this review explores the integration of LAMMPS with other computational tools and experimental techniques, showcasing its potential for synergistic investigations that bridge the gap between theory and experiment. Moreover, this review discusses the challenges and limitations associated with using LAMMPS in biomedical simulations, including the parameterization of force fields, system size limitations, and computational efficiency. Strategies employed by researchers to mitigate these challenges are presented, along with potential future directions for enhancing LAMMPS capabilities in the biomedical field.</description>

      <title>Kermut: Composite kernel regression for protein variant effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable prediction of protein variant effects is crucial for both protein optimization and for advancing biological understanding. For practical use in protein engineering, it is important that we can also provide reliable uncertainty estimates for our predictions, and while prediction accuracy has seen much progress in recent years, uncertainty metrics are rarely reported. We here provide a Gaussian process regression model, Kermut, with a novel composite kernel for modelling mutation similarity, which obtains state-of-the-art performance for protein variant effect prediction while also offering estimates of uncertainty through its posterior. An analysis of the quality of the uncertainty estimates demonstrates that our model provides meaningful levels of overall calibration, but that instance-specific uncertainty calibration remains more challenging. We hope that this will encourage future work in this promising direction.</description>
