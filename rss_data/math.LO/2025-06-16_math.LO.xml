      <title>A Universe with large Continuum, global $\Sigma$-Uniformization and a projective Well-Order of its Reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a model in which the continuum has size $\kappa$ for a regular cardinal $\kappa$ and in which the $\Sigma^1_n$-uniformization property holds simultaneously for every $n \ge 2$. Additionally this model has a $\Delta^1_3$- definable well-order of its reals.</description>

      <title>Substitutions of variables are finitely axiomatizable over quantifications and permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves that the equational theory of the class $RA_{\alpha}^{csp}$ of representable polyadic algebras is finitely axiomatizable over its substitution-free reduct $RA_{\alpha}^{cp}$, for finite $\alpha$. That is, substitutions of variables in finite variable first-order logic can be described by finitely many axioms over the Boolean operations, existential quantifiers and permutations of variables.</description>

      <title>Extensional Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joel Hamkins asks whether there is a $\Pi^0_1$-formula $\rho(x)$ such that $\rho(\phi)$ is independent over ${\sf PA}+\phi$, if this theory is consistent, where this construction is extensional in $\phi$ with respect to {\sf PA}-provable equivalence. We show that there can be no such extensional Rosser formula of any complexity.
  We give a positive answer to Hamkins' question for the case where we replace Extensionality by a weaker demand \emph{Consistent Extensionality}. We also prove that we can demand the negation of $\rho$ to be $\Pi^0_1$-conservative, if we ask for the still weaker \emph{Conditional Extensionality}.
  We show that an intensional version of the result for Conditional Extensionality cannot work.</description>

      <title>Coordinate recognition: General theory, Groups, and other surprises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of structures recognizes coordinates if any reduced product of structures from said class witnesses a certain kind of rigidity phenomena. We provide several equivalent characterizations of this property. This property has (at least) two remarkable consequences, one set-theoretic and one model-theoretic, for reduced products of structures of the said class. First, under appropriate set-theoretic assumptions every isomorphism between such reduced products associated with the Fr\' echet ideal lifts (modulo a finite change) to an isomorphism between products of the original structures. Second, with an additional mild assumption, it implies a strong quantifier elimination result. Of note, we show that a class recognizes coordinates if and only if an individual formula witnesses a certain syntactic property. We also consider many concrete classes of structures and determine whether or not they recognize coordinates. We place heavy emphasis on well known classes of groups, but we also discuss other classes of structures.</description>

      <title>Some reflections on the relationship between logical incompleteness and concrete incompleteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12531v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to conceptually examine the relationship between logical incompleteness and concrete incompleteness which both study the incompleteness phenomenon. We argue for two main theses. Firstly, the current research on concrete incompleteness reals both similarities and differences between logical incompleteness and concrete incompleteness. Similarities between them are not universal, and differences between them are essential. Secondly, concrete incompleteness is a higher order phenomenon over logical incompleteness. This verifies that Hilbert's concrete and intuitive proof theory provides us essential new information from non-concrete and non-intuitive ideal proofs. We examine similarities between logical incompleteness and concrete incompleteness from two aspects: equivalences between logical incompleteness and concrete incompleteness, and the ubiquity of the incompleteness phenomenon in both logical incompleteness and concrete incompleteness. We examine differences between logical incompleteness and concrete incompleteness from five aspects: (1) the influence on Hilbert's program; (2) properties of independent sentences; (3) the intensionality problem; (4) the relationship with ordinal analysis; (5) the limit of provability.</description>

      <title>Blockwise Gluings And Amalgamation Failures in Integral Residuated Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study integral residuated chains, and we solve some open problems related to the study of the amalgamation property in varieties of residuated lattices, or equivalently, about the deductive interpolation property in substructural logics. More precisely, we find a V-formation consisting of 2-potent finite commutative integral chains that does not have an amalgam, nor a one-amalgam, in residuated chains; as most relevant consequences, this entails that the following varieties do not have the amalgamation property: semilinear commutative (integral) residuated lattices, MTL-algebras, involutive and pseudocomplemented MTL-algebras, and all of their n-potent subvarieties for n strictly larger than 1. These results entail the failure of the deductive interpolation property for the corresponding substructural logics.</description>

      <title>The interdefinability of expansions of Belnap-Dunn logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Belnap-Dunn logic, also knows as the logic of First-Degree Entailment, is a logic that can serve as the underlying logic of theories that are inconsistent or incomplete. For various reasons, different expansions of Belnap-Dunn logic with non-classical connectives have been studied. This paper investigates the question whether those expansions are interdefinable with an expansion whose connectives include only classical connectives. Surprisingly, this relevant question is not addressed anywhere in the published studies. The notion of interdefinability of logics used is based on a general notion of definability of a connective in a logic that seems to have been forgotten. Attention is also paid to the extent to which the expansion whose connectives include only classical connectives is related to the version of classical logic with the same connectives.</description>

      <title>Free Doubly-Infinitary Distributive Categories are Cartesian Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10447v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate categories in which products distribute over coproducts, a structure we call doubly-infinitary distributive categories. Through a range of examples, we explore how this notion relates to established concepts such as extensivity, infinitary distributivity, and cartesian closedness. We show that doubly-infinitary distributivity strictly strengthens the classical notion of infinitary distributivity. Moreover, we prove that free doubly-infinitary distributive categories are cartesian closed, unlike free distributive categories. The paper concludes with observations on non-canonical isomorphisms, alongside open questions and directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Uncountable Hyperfiniteness and The Random Ratio Ergodic Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the orbit equivalence relation of a free action of a locally compact group is hyperfinite (\`a la Connes-Feldman-Weiss) precisely when it is 'hypercompact'. This implies an uncountable version of the Ornstein-Weiss Theorem and that every locally compact group admitting a hypercompact probability preserving free action is amenable. We also establish an uncountable version of Danilenko's Random Ratio Ergodic Theorem. From this we deduce the 'Hopf dichotomy' for many nonsingular Bernoulli actions.</description>

      <title>Minimal operations over permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify the possible types of minimal operations above an arbitrary permutation group. Above the trivial group, a theorem of Rosenberg yields that there are five types of minimal operations. We show that above any non-trivial permutation group there are at most four such types. Indeed, except above Boolean groups acting freely on a set, there are only three. In particular, this is the case for oligomorphic permutation groups, for which we improve a result of Bodirsky and Chen by showing one of the types in their classification does not exist. Building on these results, we answer three questions of Bodirsky that were previously open.</description>

      <title>An Incremental Framework for Topological Dialogue Semantics: Efficient Reasoning in Discrete Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a tractable, incremental framework for topological dialogue semantics based on finite, discrete semantic spaces. Building on the intuition that utterances correspond to open sets and their combinatorial relations form a simplicial complex (the dialogue nerve), we give a rigorous foundation, a provably correct incremental algorithm for nerve updates, and a reference implementation in the Wolfram Language. The framework supports negative nerve computation (inconsistency tracking), consequence extraction, and a transparent, set-theoretic ranking of entailments. We clarify which combinatorial properties hold in the discrete case, provide motivating examples, and outline limitations and prospects for richer logical and categorical extensions.</description>
