      <title>Nonlinear Nonlocal Diffusion Equations for the Analysis of Continuous Coordination and Anti-Coordination Type Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordination games with explicit spatial or relational structure are of interest to economists, ecologists, sociologists, and others studying emergent global properties in collective behavior. When assemblies of individuals seek to coordinate action with one another through myopic best response or other replicator dynamics, the resulting dynamical system can exhibit many rich behaviors. However, these behaviors have been studied only in the case where the number of players is countable and the relational structure is described discretely. By giving an extension of a general class of coordination-like games, including true coordination games themselves, into a continuous setting, we can begin to study coordination and cooperative behavior with a new host of tools from PDEs and nonlocal equations. In this study, we propose a rigorously supported extension of structured coordination-type games into a setting with continuous space and continuous strategies and show that, under certain hypotheses, the dynamics of these games are described through a nonlinear, nonlocal diffusion equation. We go on to prove existence and uniqueness for the initial value problem in the case where no boundary data are prescribed. For true coordination games, we go further and prove a maximum principle, weak regularity results, as well as some numerical results toward understanding how solutions to the coordination equation behave. We present several modeling results, characterizing stationary solutions both rigorously and through numerical experiments and conclude with a result towards the inhomogeneous problem.</description>

      <title>Nowhere dense competing holes in open dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a compact metric space with no isolated points, and $f:\mathcal{M}\longrightarrow\mathcal{M}$ a homeomorphism. Consider a sequence of shrinking open balls $\{B^i_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}^{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ with centers $\{p_i\}_{i=1}^\infty\subseteq\mathcal{M}$ and radii $\{\rho^i_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$. For every point $x\in\mathcal{M}$ and $n\in\mathbb{N}$, consider which ball the trajectory $\{x,f(x),f^2(x),\dots\}$ of the point first visits. We find that whenever the closure of $\{p_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ is nowhere dense, and with very minor restrictions on $\{\rho_n^i\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}^{i\in\mathbb{N}}$, the typical trajectory $\{f^k(x)\}_{k=0}^\infty$ will first visit, for each $i$, the ball $B^i_n$, for infinitely many $n$. This is never the case, should $\{p_i\}_{i=1}^\infty$ be somewhere dense. Keywords: Open Dynamical System, Topological Dynamics, Transitive Homeomorphism, Baire category.

      <description>arXiv:2506.14032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathcal{M}$ be a continuous map defined on a compact metric space $\mathcal{M}$. An open dynamical system introduces disjoint open balls centered at points in $\mathcal{M}$, and considers the trajectories of points from $\mathcal{M}$, and the balls that they visit first. As the balls in question are allowed to shrink, a point is considered indecisive if its trajectory changes infinitely many times the ball first visited. Here, we let $\mathcal{M}$ be an adding machine, a simple system and a solenoidal system. In each case, we show that the set of points which generate indecisive trajectories is residual.

      <title>Stability of compact actions and a result on divided differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study smooth locally free actions of ${\mathbb R}^n$ on manifolds $M$ of dimension $n+1$. We are interested in compact orbits and in compact actions: actions with all orbits compact. Given a compact orbit in a neighborhood of compact orbits, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a $C^k$ perturbation with noncompact orbits in the given neighborhood. We prove that if such a perturbation exists it can be assumed to differ from the original action only in a smaller neighborhood of the initial orbit. As an application, for each $k$, we give examples of compact actions which admit $C^{k-1}$-perturbations with noncompact orbits but such that all $C^k$-perturbations are compact. The main result generalizes for $k &gt; 1$ a previous result for the case $C^1$.
  A critical auxiliary result is an estimate on divided differences.</description>

      <title>Quantitative finiteness of hyperplanes in hybrid manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative finiteness theorem for the number of totally geodesic hyperplanes of non-arithmetic hyperbolic $n$-manifolds that arise from a gluing construction of Gromov and Piatetski-Shapiro for $n\ge3$. This extends work of Lindenstrauss-Mohammadi in dimension 3. This follows from effective density theorem for periodic orbits of $\mathrm{SO}(n-1,1)$ acting on quotients of $\mathrm{SO}(n,1)$ by a lattice for $n\ge3$. The effective density result uses a number of a ideas including Margulis functions, a restricted projection theorem, and an effective equidistribution result for measures on the horospherical subgroup that are nearly full dimensional.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Neural Network -- Polynomial Series Scheme for Learning Invariant Manifolds of Discrete Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid machine learning scheme to learn -- in physics-informed and numerical analysis-informed fashion -- invariant manifolds (IM) of discrete maps for constructing reduced-order models (ROMs) for dynamical systems. The proposed scheme combines polynomial series with shallow neural networks, exploiting the complementary strengths of both approaches. Polynomials enable an efficient and accurate modeling of ROMs with guaranteed local exponential convergence rate around the fixed point, where, under certain assumptions, the IM is demonstrated to be analytic. Neural networks provide approximations to more complex structures beyond the reach of the polynomials' convergence. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed scheme using three benchmark examples, examining convergence behavior, numerical approximation accuracy, and computational training cost. Additionally, we compare the IM approximations obtained solely with neural networks and with polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that the proposed hybrid scheme outperforms both pure polynomial approximations (power series, Legendre and Chebyshev polynomials) and standalone shallow neural network approximations in terms of numerical approximation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Invasive species control via a discrete model for the Trojan Y-chromosome strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Invasive species are a growing threat to ecosystems, particularly in aquatic environments. The Trojan Y Chromosome (TYC) strategy is a promising biological method for reducing invasive populations by introducing genetically modified males (supermales) that produce only male offspring, leading to population decline due to a shortage of females. In this study, we develop a novel discrete--time, age--structured mathematical model to simulate the effects of this strategy. Our model divides the life cycle of species into two stages--egg and maturity--and tracks different sub--populations, including supermales. We analyze the equilibria of the system and prove the existence and stability of extinction and positive equilibrium points. Numerical simulations show that extinction depends on factors such as fecundity, the number of supermales released, and initial population sizes. The model also reveals complex behaviors, such as bistability and thresholds for population collapse. This discrete approach offers a useful framework for understanding and optimizing the TYC strategy and can help guide future field applications of invasive species control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for any countable group $ G $ equipped with a probability measure $ \mu $, there exists a randomized stopping time $ \tau $ such that $ (G, \mu _{\tau} )$ admits a strictly larger space of bounded harmonic functions than $ (G,\mu) $, unless this space is trivial for all measures on $ G $. In particular, we exhibit an irreducible probability measure on the free group $F_2$ such that the Poisson boundary is strictly larger than the geometric boundary equipped with the hitting measure, resolving a longstanding open problem. As another consequence, there is never a nontrivial universal topological realization of the Poisson boundary for any countable group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Schr\"odinger operators in $\ell^2(\Z)$ whose potentials are defined via continuous sampling along the orbits of a homeomorphism on a compact metric space. We show that for each non-atomic ergodic measure $\mu$, there is a dense set of sampling functions such that the associated almost sure spectrum has finitely many gaps, the integrated density is smooth, and the Lyapunov exponent is smooth and positive. As a byproduct we answer a question of Walters about the existence of non-uniform $\SL(2,\R)$ cocycles in the affirmative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study periodic orbits in the spatial rotating Kepler problem from a symplectic-topological perspective. Our first main result provides a complete classification of these orbits via a natural parametrization of the space of Kepler orbits, using angular momentum and the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. We then compute the Conley-Zehnder indices of non-degenerate orbits and the Robbin-Salamon indices of degenerate families, establishing their contributions to symplectic homology via the Morse-Bott spectral sequence. To address coordinate degeneracies in the spatial setting, we introduce a new coordinate system based on the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. These results offer a full symplectic-topological profile of the three-dimensional rotating Kepler problem and connect it to generators of symplectic homology.</description>

      <title>Predicting the response of structurally altered and asymmetrical networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the response of coupled dynamical systems is modified due to a structural alteration of the interaction. The majority of the literature focuses on additive perturbations and symmetrical interaction networks. Here, we consider the challenging problem of multiplicative perturbations and asymmetrical interaction coupling. We introduce a framework to approximate the averaged response at each network node for general structural perturbations, including non-normal and asymmetrical ones. Our findings indicate that both the asymmetry and non-normality of the structural perturbation impact the global and local responses at different orders in time. We propose a set of matrices to identify the nodes whose response is affected the most by the structural alteration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is an amenable group and $A\subseteq G$ has positive upper Banach density, then there is an identity neighborhood $B$ in the Bohr topology on $G$ that is almost contained in $AA^{-1}$ in the sense that $B\backslash AA^{-1}$ has upper Banach density $0$. This generalizes the abelian case (due to F{\o}lner) and the countable case (due to Beiglb\"{o}ck, Bergelson, and Fish). The proof is indirectly based on local stable group theory in continuous logic. The main ingredients are Grothendieck's double-limit characterization of relatively weakly compact sets in spaces of continuous functions, along with results of Ellis and Nerurkar on the topological dynamics of weakly almost periodic flows.</description>

      <title>Splitting of Tensor Products and Intermediate Factor Theorem: Continuous Version</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08635v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a discrete group. Given unital $G$-$C^*$-algebras $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, we give an abstract condition under which every $G$-subalgebra $\mathcal{C}$ of the form $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{C}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ is a tensor product. This generalizes the well-known splitting results in the context of $C^*$-algebras by Zacharias and Zsido. As an application, we prove a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. When a product group $G=\Gamma_1\times\Gamma_2$ acts (by a product action) on the product of corresponding $\Gamma_i$-boundaries $\partial\Gamma_i$, using the abstract condition, we show that every intermediate subalgebra $C(X)\subset\mathcal{C}\subset C(X)\otimes_{\text{min}}C(\partial\Gamma_1\times \partial\Gamma_2)$ is a tensor product (under some additional assumptions on $X$). This can be considered as a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. We prove that our assumptions are necessary and cannot generally be relaxed. We also introduce the notion of a uniformly rigid action for $C^*$-algebras and use it to give various classes of inclusions $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ for which every invariant intermediate algebra is a tensor product.</description>

      <title>Periodic colorings and orientations in infinite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of periodic colorings and orientations in locally finite graphs. A coloring or orientation of a graph $G$ is periodic if the resulting colored or oriented graph is quasi-transitive, meaning that $V(G)$ has finitely many orbits under the action of the group of automorphisms of $G$ preserving the coloring or the orientation. When such a periodic coloring or orientation of $G$ exists, $G$ itself must be quasi-transitive and it is natural to investigate when quasi-transitive graphs have such periodic colorings or orientations. We provide examples of Cayley graphs with no periodic orientation or non-trivial coloring, and examples of quasi-transitive graphs of treewidth 2 without periodic orientation or proper coloring. On the other hand we show that every quasi-transitive graph $G$ of bounded pathwidth has a periodic proper coloring with $\chi(G)$ colors and a periodic orientation. We relate these problems with techniques and questions from symbolic dynamics and distributed computing and conclude with a number of open problems.</description>

      <title>When are dynamical systems learned from time series data statistically accurate?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06311</link>

Abstract: Conventional notions of generalization often fail to describe the ability of learned models to capture meaningful information from dynamical data. A neural network that learns complex dynamics with a small test error may still fail to reproduce its \emph{physical} behavior, including associated statistical moments and Lyapunov exponents. To address this gap, we propose an ergodic theoretic approach to generalization of complex dynamical models learned from time series data. Our main contribution is to define and analyze generalization of a broad suite of neural representations of classes of ergodic systems, including chaotic systems, in a way that captures emulating underlying invariant, physical measures. Our results provide theoretical justification for why regression methods for generators of dynamical systems (Neural ODEs) fail to generalize, and why their statistical accuracy improves upon adding Jacobian information during training. We verify our results on a number of ergodic chaotic systems and neural network parameterizations, including MLPs, ResNets, Fourier Neural layers, and RNNs.</description>

      <title>Real-analyticity of 2-dimensional superintegrable metrics and solution of two Bolsinov-Kozlov-Fomenko conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional Riemannian metrics which are superintegrable in the class of polynomial in momenta integrals. The study is based on our main technical result, Theorem 3, which states that the Poisson bracket of two polynomial in momenta integrals is an algebraic function of
  the integrals and of the Hamiltonian. We conjecture that two-dimensional superintegrable Riemannian metrics are necessary real-analytic in isothermal coordinate systems, and give arguments supporting this conjecture. Small modification of the arguments, discussed in the paper, provides a methods to construct new superintegrable systems. We prove a special case of the above conjecture which is sufficient to show that
  the metrics constructed by K. Kiyohara in 2001, which admit irreducible polynomial in momenta integrals of arbitrary high degree $k$, are not superintegrable and in particular do not admit nontrivial polynomial in momenta integral of degree less than $k$. This result solves Conjectures (b) and (c) explicitly formulated in Bolsinov, KOzlov and Fomenko in 1995.</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis of multiplicative chaos Part II: a unified approach to Fourier dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03298v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified approach for studying the polynomial Fourier decay of classical multiplicative chaos measures. As consequences, we obtain the precise Fourier dimensions for multiplicative chaos measures arising from the following key models: the sub-critical 1D and 2D GMC (which in particular resolves the Garban-Vargas conjecture); the sub-critical $d$-dimensional GMC with $d \ge 3$ when the parameter $\gamma$ is near the critical value; the canonical Mandelbrot random coverings; the canonical Mandelbrot cascades. For various other models, we establish the non-trivial lower bounds of the Fourier dimensions and in various cases we conjecture that they are all optimal and provide the exact values of Fourier dimensions.</description>

      <title>Counting totally real units and eigenvalue patterns in $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$ and $\rm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb Z)$ in thin tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13288</link>

Abstract: For a vector $v=(v_1,\dots ,v_n)$ with $v_1&gt;\cdots&gt;v_n$ and $\sum v_i=0$, we study the "directional entropy" of two arithmetic objects: (1) the logarithmic embeddings of degree-$n$ totally real units, and (2) the logarithmic eigenvalue data of $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$. In each case, the entropy in the direction of $v$ is $\mathsf E_n(v)= \rho_{\operatorname{SL}_n}(v)=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(n-i)\,v_i,$ the value of the half-sum of positive roots of $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb R)$ evaluated at $v$. More precisely, the number of objects lying in a thin tube around the ray $\mathbb R_+v$ and of norm at most $T$ grows on the order of $ \exp\!\bigl(\rho_{\operatorname{SL}_n}(v)\,T\bigr)$ as $T\to \infty$.
  Because each eigenvalue data determines an $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb R)$-conjugacy class, this implies a lower bound of order $\exp\!\bigl(\rho_{\operatorname{SL}_n}(v)T\bigr)$ for the number of $\operatorname{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$-conjugacy classes with a prescribed eigenvalue data; we also obtain an upper bound of order $\exp\!\bigl(2\rho_{\operatorname{SL}_n}(v)T\bigr)$.
  A parallel argument for the symplectic lattice $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb Z)$, taken in the symmetric direction $v=(v_1,\dots ,v_n,-v_n,\dots ,-v_1),\quad v_1&gt;\cdots&gt;v_n&gt;0,$ shows that $\mathsf E_{2n}^{\operatorname{Sp}}(v)=\rho_{\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}}(v)=\sum_{i=1}^n(n+1-i)v_i,$ the half-sum of positive roots of $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb R)$.</description>
