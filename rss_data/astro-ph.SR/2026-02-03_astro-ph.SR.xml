      <title>Carbon measurements in two ultra-faint dwarf galaxies: Grus II and Tucana IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are some of the oldest and most metal-poor environments in the Local Group. In particular, they are predicted to host the first stars (only H and He) that lit up in our Universe. No metal-free stars have been found to date, but their chemical products can be observed on the surfaces of the ancient second-generation stars such as the carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars (CEMP-no, [C/Fe]&gt;+0.7).} However, in each UFD there are only a few stars bright enough for spectroscopic follow-up, therefore it is crucial to study as many of these systems as possible. Here we follow up stars belonging to two recently discovered UFDs, Grus II and Tucana IV. The spectra analyzed were obtained with the multi-object spectrograph FLAMES/Giraffe at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). This includes spectra in two wavelength ranges: red spectra around the CaII triplet (8498 {\AA}, 8542 {\AA}, 8662 {\AA}) used to derive radial velocity and [Fe/H], and blue spectra covering the CH band at ~ 4300 {\AA}. In total, we analyzed 21 spectra of member candidates for Grus II and 17 for Tucana IV, including both Red Giant Branch (RGB) and Horizontal Branch (HB) stars. We identified 13 members in Grus II (thereof 8 RGB stars) and 7 members in Tucana IV (thereof 3 RGB stars). Among the RGB stars in Grus II, we found three CEMP-no stars at [Fe/H]~-3 and [C/Fe]&gt;+1 and two CEMP-no stars at slightly higher [Fe/H] and [C/Fe]&gt;+0.7. In Tucana IV, we found one CEMP-no star ([Fe/H]=-2.75 and [C/Fe] = +0.83). This project, along with future investigations of CEMP stars in UFDs, allows us to study the impact of the first stars in these ancient and primitive systems and consequently the first chemical enrichment that occurred in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Radial and Rotational Velocities of a Volume-Complete Sample of M Dwarfs with Masses 0.1-0.3 Msun within 15 parsecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results from a five-year campaign to gather multi-epoch, high-resolution spectra of a volume-complete sample of 413 M dwarfs with masses 10-30% that of the Sun that lie within 15 parsecs. We report weighted mean systemic radial velocities (RV) and rotational broadening measurements ($v \sin i$) for our targets. Our typical relative RV uncertainties are less than $50$ m/s for the isolated, slowly rotating targets in our sample, and increase but remain less than 1 km/s for more rapidly rotating stars. The majority of the single stars in our sample ($71\pm3$%) have rotational broadening below our detection limit of 3.4 km/s. When combined with astrometric data, our radial velocities allow us to calculate galactic space motions, which we use to assign thin or thick disk membership. We determine that 81% and 8% of our sample are highly probable thin and highly probable thick disk members, respectively. We report seven new multi-lined multiple systems and identify six additional targets with velocity variations indicative of long-period binaries, of which three are new detections. Finally, we find no significant difference in the stellar multiplicity rates of the thin disk ($22\pm2$%) and thick disk ($21\pm8$%) populations in our sample, implying that mid-M dwarfs are not significantly losing their companions at these relative ages. Our survey more than triples the number of these fully-convective stars with complete astrometric data and uniformly derived, multi-epoch, high-resolution RVs and rotational broadening measurements.</description>

      <title>Nested, asymmetric H$-$He circumstellar shells in the Type Icn/Ibn SN 2024abvb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting transients probe mass loss in the final stages of stellar evolution; however, the geometry and timing of multi-episode mass loss remain poorly constrained. SN 2024abvb is a nearby interacting event with transitional Ibn/Icn spectroscopic properties and multi-epoch polarimetry, offering a rare opportunity to study structured circumstellar material (CSM). We aim to characterise the kinematics, composition and geometry of the CSM around SN 2024abvb and to identify plausible progenitor/ejection scenarios that can produce the observed spectro-polarimetric evolution. We present high-resolution (VLT/UVES and VLT/X-Shooter) optical/NIR spectroscopy across several epochs, complemented by broadband polarimetry and spectropolarimetry (VLT/FORS2 and NOT/ALFOSC). Line identifications, velocity decompositions and polarimetric time-series are used to trace multiple kinematic components and changes in scattering geometry. The high-resolution spectra reveal multiple narrow CSM components composed of He, C and O with absorption minima at $\sim150 - 400$ km s$^{-1}$ and additional faster material up to $\sim2000$ \kms. Low-velocity Balmer absorptions are present, indicating distant H-rich material, a first in SNe Ibn/Icn. Polarimetry shows a marked evolution ($P\sim1\%$ near peak, $\lesssim0.5\%$ after $\sim1$ week, rising to $\sim1.5\%$ at $\sim20$ d with $\sim50^\circ$ position-angle rotation and to $\sim4\%$ at $\sim30$ d, stronger in the blue), implying a time-variable, wavelength-dependent scattering/obscuration component. The combination of kinematics and polarimetric behaviour is consistent with multiple, concentric toroidal shells with differing orientations and partial dust content.</description>

      <title>Envelope Inflation and outflow Driven by Energy Deposition in Massive Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolved massive stars are known to undergo outflow with high mass ejections, resulting in the loss of a substantial portion of their envelopes. One proposed mechanism driving these events is the release or deposition of energy within the stellar envelope. We use a one-dimensional hydrodynamical code to investigate the resulting outflow and stellar response to energy deposition at specific regions inside a $\rm 70 \, M_{\odot}$ star. We compare hydrostatic and hydrodynamic models and test for different energies and widths of the depositing region. We find that due to the deposited energy, the envelope expands significantly, and under certain conditions, such as assuming a uniform electron scattering opacity, this energy input becomes sufficient to unbind material from the outer envelope. This, in turn, leads to the formation of an outflow. We find that higher deposited energy triggers a strong outflow and results in a somewhat hotter and less expanded envelope due to the rapid loss of energy through expelled material. This driving mechanism leads to sudden envelope expansion and the formation of strong outflows in our models, highlighting the generic hydrodynamic response of massive star envelopes to impulsive energy input.</description>

      <title>Population synthesis of double white dwarfs: evolutionary effects on system properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double white dwarf (DWD) binaries are natural outcomes of binary stellar evolution and key sources for future space-based gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We investigate how different binary interaction channels shape the physical and orbital properties of DWD systems, focusing on component masses, orbital separations, core compositions, and mass transfer rates. Using the binary population synthesis code COMPAS, we evolve $10^7$ binaries with physically motivated initial distributions of binary parameters. Our simulations reproduce the strong bimodality in the final orbital separations, including a pronounced deficit of systems around $100-500 \rm\,R_\odot$, arising from distinct evolutionary pathways: wide DWDs predominantly originate from stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), while close DWDs form through unstable RLOF leading to at least one common envelope (CE) phase. Moreover, we show that the core compositions of WDs provide a powerful tracer of evolutionary history: He-core WDs are strongly concentrated in close systems, whereas CO-core WDs span the full separation range and exhibit a small mass gap in wide binaries. We further identify a correlation between the accreted mass and the final orbital separation, highlighting the impact of non-conservative mass transfer on the resulting orbital configuration of DWD systems. These results underscore the links among evolutionary channels, chemical composition, and mass transfer rates; thereby provide a unique framework for interpreting Gaia DWD samples and forecasting the joint electromagnetic and GW population accessible to LISA.</description>

      <title>A study of solar energetic particle transport on 30 March 2022 using multi-spacecraft data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a unique solar energetic particle event observed simultaneously by the BepiColombo and STEREO-A spacecraft on March 30, 2022. The two spacecraft at heliocentric distances of 0.6 and 1.0 AU are expected to be aligned approximately along the same magnetic field line, providing a valuable opportunity to investigate particle transport processes in the inner heliosphere. Protons with energies above 1.0 MeV exhibit velocity dispersion during the rise phase, suggesting that the energetic particles are produced close to the Sun, possibly associated with a coronal mass ejection. In contrast, protons during the decay phase are characterized by long-lasting time profiles with longer time scales at 1.0 AU than at 0.6 AU, suggesting that the particles deviate from ballistic propagation. By assimilating these multi-spacecraft observation data into numerical simulations of the focused transport equation, for the first time, we estimate the mean free path parallel to the magnetic field as a time series. The inferred mean free path decreases over time and approaches around 0.5-1.0 AU at the STEREO-A location during the decay phase, suggesting an increasing influence of scattering on particle transport. This interpretation is qualitatively supported by independent STEREO-A observations that showed increasing magnetic field fluctuations, suggesting the connection between the particle transport and the local field fluctuations. However, only a fraction of these fluctuations is expected to contribute to particle scattering, which may be due to the multidimensional nature of magnetic field fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Elongation of a Solar Filament and its Three-Dimensional Numerical Reconstruction for Magnetic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quiescent filaments are prominent features of the solar atmosphere, and their evolution reflects the coronal magnetic field's response to photospheric magnetic activity. Here, we report on a quiescent filament observed from 2023 September 28-29, aiming to understand how the magnetic configuration shapes its feet and drives its extension. For this purpose, high-resolution spectral data in H$\alpha$ and Mg II k are used from the T\'elescope H\'eliographique pour l'Etude du Magn\'etisme et des Instabilit\'es Solaires (THEMIS) and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), respectively. To track changes in the filament, we utilise long-term data from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG). We analyse the longitudinal magnetic field in the photosphere using the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard Hinode, as well as SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data. In addition to this, we use GONG H$\alpha$ data to analyze the longitudinal oscillations in the filament. Observations show that parasitic polarities and canceling flux play a key role in forming and reorganizing the filament feet and in lengthening the filament. A 3D MHD reconstruction using vector magnetograms reveals that its magnetic configuration evolves into a full flux rope (FR), whose extension on the second day matches the observed filament growth. The FR is separated from the surrounding nearly potential field by quasi-separatrix layers, which in turn are separated by current layers. They get more organized around the FR as it is growing up. Moreover, the longitudinal oscillations in the extended filament are attributed to heating from flux cancellation in underlying bright points.</description>

      <title>What's Their Age Again? A Blue-Straggler Merger Scenario in the $\gamma$ Persei Binary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used MIST isochrone fitting and a dedicated grid of stellar evolution models computed with MESA to constrain the ages of the components of the $\gamma$ Persei binary system. While individual stars can be matched to the models at specific metallicities, no joint isochrone solution reproduces both the observed masses and evolutionary states.
  The stellar evolutionary tracks calculated by \texttt{MESA} reveal a clear evolutionary mismatch. The primary component of the system is in a post-main-sequence phase consistent with the red giant branch or red clump. In contrast, the lighter secondary component lies near the turn-off point of the main-sequence or is in the early phase of the subgiant branch.
  This discrepancy can be overcome by assuming that the $\gamma$ Persei system was born as a triple and the primary component is a rejuvenated star formed through a merger of a close-by pair of main-sequence stars. We show that the merger must have occurred no later than a few hundred Myr after system formation, and the progenitor masses of the merging stars are restricted by a combination of stars that fall within a narrow band in the $(M_{1,a},M_{1,b})$ plane, corresponding to $M_{1,a}\simeq0.9$-$2.1\,M_\odot$ and $M_{1,b}\simeq2.3$-$2.5\,M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Herringbone structures during an X-class eruptive flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we report quasi-periodic herringbone structures during the impulsive phase of an X-class flare, coinciding with the distinct acceleration phase of eruptive prominence ejection on 2023 December 31. The prominence propagates non-radially in the southeast direction with an inclination angle of $\sim$35$\fdg$4. The fast coronal mass ejection (CME) at a speed of $\sim$2852 km s$^{-1}$ drives a shock wave and a coronal EUV wave. The herringbone structures lasting for $\sim$4 minutes take place at the initial stage of a group of type II radio burst. The herringbones in the frequency range 20$-$70 MHz are characterized by simultaneous forward-drift and reverse-drift bursts with average durations of $\sim$2.5 s and $\sim$3.1 s. The frequency drift rates of these bursts fall in a range of 1.3$-$9.4 MHz s$^{-1}$ with average values of $\sim$3.6 and $\sim$4.1 MHz s$^{-1}$, respectively. The speeds of electron beams producing the herringbones are estimated to be 0.04$-$0.41 $c$, with average values of $\sim$0.23 $c$ and $\sim$0.11 $c$ for forward-drifting and reverse-drift bursts, respectively. The heights of particle acceleration regions are estimated to be 0.64$-$0.78 $R_{\sun}$ above the photosphere, which are consistent with the height of CME front ($\sim$0.75 $R_{\sun}$) when the shock forms. Quasi-periodic pulsations with periods of 17.5$-$21.3 s are found in the radio fluxes of herringbones, suggesting that electrons are accelerated by the CME-driven shock intermittently.</description>

      <title>Solar Flare Hosts MeV-peaked Electrons in a Coronal Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar flares promptly release large amounts of free magnetic energy in the solar corona to produce substantial populations of high-energy charged particles, both ions and electrons. These particles are detected when they radiate microwaves in solar magnetic fields and X- and {\gamma}-rays when they encounter matter. Analysis of {\gamma}-rays in solar flares has revealed a distinct continuum component dominating at MeV energies, which differs from the well-studied X-ray continuum produced by flare-accelerated electrons with steeply falling energy spectra. The origin and precise spatial location and extent of this mysterious MeV component have been unknown up to now. If it is produced by bremsstrahlung, such a {\gamma}-ray component requires an unusual population of electrons peaked at a few MeV. Here we report a joint study of this MeV-peaked electron population in the 2017-Sep-10 solar flare with Fermi MeV {\gamma}-ray data and EOVSA spatially resolved microwave imaging spectroscopy data. We demonstrate that the microwave spectrum from the peaked MeV distribution has a distinctly different shape from that produced by the well-known population of electrons with falling energy spectrum. We inspected microwave maps of the flare and identified an evolving area where the measured microwave spectra matched the theoretically expected one for the MeV-peaked population, thus pinpointing the site where this MeV component resides in the flare. The locations are in a coronal volume adjacent to the region where prominent release of magnetic energy and bulk electron acceleration were detected, which implies that transport effects play a key role in forming this population.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for understanding pulsating stars I: the non-linear phenomenon in {\delta} Scuti stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\delta$ Scuti stars are pulsating variable stars that exhibit both radial and non-radial pulsations, making them key objects for understanding stellar evolution and internal structures. The current classification of $\delta$ Scuti stars into High-Amplitude $\delta$ Scuti (HADS) and Low-Amplitude $\delta$ Scuti (LADS) stars is based on the peak-to-peak amplitude of their light curves (&gt;0.3 mag). Nevertheless, this classification may not fully capture the complexity of their pulsation mechanisms and non-linear effects, leading to possible misclassifications.
  This investigation aims to challenge the existing classification of $\delta$ Scuti stars according to amplitude, employing the exploration of frequency domain features and non-linear mechanisms in order to identify intrinsic subgroups. The objective is to get a deeper understanding of the properties of $\delta$ Scuti stars.
  We use machine learning clustering techniques, specifically hierarchical clustering (HC) with Ward's linkage, to analyze a sample of 142 $\delta$ Scuti stars observed by space telescopes such as CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS. We focus on frequency-domain features, including fundamental and overtone modes, as well as non-linear features such as harmonic, sums, and subtraction frequencies, to uncover intrinsic subgroups within $\delta$ Scuti stars.
  The results of the clustering process indicate that the present amplitude-based classification (HADS/LADS) exhibits partial alignment with the clusters identified by using features from the frequency-domain. However, the study identified additional sub-groups, suggesting a greater variety of nonlinear effects that are not captured by the amplitude alone. It highlights the importance of non-linear features, such as the number of subtraction combinations, which may be indicative of resonance effects or other internal physical mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: V658 Car (HD 92406) is a newborn resp. rejuvenated shell star binary system at the age of only 1 Myr after the end of mass transfer. In this renewed study the peculiarities of the Be star are at first by-passed by the determination of the properties of the contracting hot subdwarf precursor, but finally resolved by combining photometric data and radial velocity results with existing stellar models. For the effective temperatures, radii and masses we get about 12900 K, 1.92/2.20 Rsun and 4.49 Msun for the Be star, and about 18400 K, 1.87 Rsun and 0.56 Msun for its companion star. The Be star has a rotational velocity of 336 km/s and is surrounded and dimmed in our view by a large and luminous equatorial decretion disk having a radius of ~ 42 Rsun. According to stellar models these results fit to a surprisingly low metallicity Z of 0.003 and a Teff ~ 5400 K higher than observational expectations for the Be star, which hence should belong to the chemically peculiar stars, in spite of its rapid rotation.</description>

      <title>Investigation of magnetic topology and triggering mechanisms of a C-class flare and active-region blowout jet</title>

Abstract: Coronal jets are collimated plasma eruptions which are ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere. Believed to be triggered by magnetic reconnection, these jets can contribute to various phenomena, including coronal heating and particle acceleration. Coronal jets are a contemporary area of research with their onset mechanism meriting further attention. Importantly, a subclass of jets, the blowout jets, are particularly interesting because of their broad spire, suggesting substantial three-dimensional (3D) reconnection between open and closed field lines involving 3D null points. Consequently, here we explore the onset of a blowout jet associated with Active Region (AR) SPoCA 29093 detected by Spatial Possibilistic Clustering Algorithm (SPoCA). This AR produced a C1.1-class flare on 10 November 2022 and we investigate it using a data-constrained magnetohydrodynamic simulation initiated with a non force-free-field (NFFF) extrapolation of the photospheric magnetic field. Key elements of the extrapolated field lines are the presence of a 3D null and a magnetic flux rope (MFR) co-located with the jet activity region, the evolution of which is further traced in the simulation. The simulation suggests that magnetic reconnection is responsible for the evolution of the MFR, leading to a near-simultaneous onset of the flare and jet as observed by the AIA/SDO. In particular, the simulation shows spontaneous creation and annihilation of 3D null pairs via magnetic reconnection near the jet region. Such spontaneous null pair generation, in principle, can trigger or contribute to coronal jets; opening up a new avenue for further research.</description>

      <title>Two late-T dwarfs at kiloparsec distances revealed by JWST UNCOVER survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a search for brown dwarf candidates in a James Webb Space Telescope deep field around A2744 to investigate the space density of these objects at kiloparsec distances. Our methodology employed an initial selection based on photometric colours, followed by spectral energy distribution fitting to both stellar atmospheric models and high-redshift galaxy templates. This approach yielded two robust T dwarf candidates and one possible L subdwarf candidate. The T dwarfs have estimated Galactic heights of 0.43 and 0.86 kpc, likely residing near the outer edges of the Galactic thin and thick discs, respectively. We measure a T dwarf surface number density of 0.094 per squared arcmin in the UNCOVER field, lower than previous predictions but consistent at the order-of-magnitude level. We also provide space number density estimates for T5-T8.9 dwarfs across different effective temperature and spectral type bins, finding that T5-T7 dwarfs out to 2 kpc have significantly lower densities than their solar neighbourhood counterparts, whilst T8 dwarfs within the thick disc exhibit densities comparable to local values. Our analysis demonstrates that broad-band near- to mid-infrared photometry provides high sensitivity to late-T dwarfs but is relatively less sensitive to L and early-T dwarfs. Spectroscopy is typically required to distinguish photometric candidates of L dwarfs, early-T subdwarfs, and high-redshift galaxies in JWST deep fields. This study demonstrates the potential for expanding our understanding of brown dwarf distributions and characteristics at unprecedented distances, offering new insights into substellar populations beyond the solar neighbourhood.</description>

      <title>Gravitational trapping and ram pressure trapping of ultracompact and hypercompact H II regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observationally, early H II regions are classified by size into ultracompact and hypercompact configurations. It remains unclear whether these phases are long-lived or transient. Understanding the physical processes that stall H II region growth may help to solve the so-called lifetime problem: the observation of more compact H II regions than expected from theory. Utilizing two-dimensional, axially symmetric radiation hydrodynamic simulations of young expanding H II regions, including the phase of early star and disk formation, we seek to better understand the trapping of H II regions. Trapping forces include gravity and ram pressure, which oppose forces such as thermal pressure expansion, radiation pressure, and centrifugal force. Without radiation pressure, the H II region remains gravitationally trapped in the ultracompact phase indefinitely. With radiation pressure, the H II region escapes gravitational trapping but experiences ram pressure trapping on larger scales. For initial mass reservoirs with high central density, no trapping occurs, while a less steep density gradient yields clear trapped phases. Hypercompact trapped phases exhibit a so-called flickering variation in H II region radius, in agreement with observations of stalling and even contraction over small time scales. With radiation pressure, low-density reservoirs experience both gravitational and ram pressure trapping, while high-mass reservoirs undergo only the latter.</description>

      <title>X-ray counterparts to stellar MeerKAT Galactic-plane compact radio sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio emission from magnetically active stars arises mainly from non-thermal processes and complements high-energy X-ray emission. Sensitive, wide-field radio and X-ray surveys now allow identification of larger samples of active stars across the Galaxy. We aim to identify and characterise radio and X-ray-emitting stars in the Galactic plane by combining MeerKAT radio data with soft X-ray observations and assess their consistency with the canonical G\"udel-Benz relation, which links thermal coronal X-rays to non-thermal gyrosynchrotron radio emission. We cross-matched compact sources from the SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey with counterparts from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey and the first release of SRG/eROSITA (eRASS1). We computed radio-brightness temperatures and radio-X-ray luminosities to test the relation. We identify 137 stars with both radio and X-ray detections. Their $T_B$ ranges from $10^7$ to $10^{12}$ K, except two outliers: AXJ1600.9-5142 ($4.8 \pm 1.5 \times 10^{12}$ K) and HD~124831 ($8 \pm 1 \times 10^{6}$ K). The remainder are consistent with incoherent gyrosynchrotron emission. The sample lies below the canonical G\"udel-Benz relation, driven by enhanced 1.3 GHz radio luminosities relative to the 5 GHz relation. This suggests the classical relation represents an upper envelope rather than a tight correlation. Additionally, eROSITA detections show early-type stars lie below the typical $\log (L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}) \sim -3$ relation.</description>

      <title>Noble gases Neon and argon: a role for the chemical patterns of multiple populations in globular clusters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on the sodium destruction in models reaching the high hot bottom burning temperatures needed to efficiently cycle oxygen to nitrogen in AGB models at the nominal [Fe/H] of the cluster NGC 2808. We increase the initial neon abundance by a factor 2-4 with respect to the "standard" abundances obtained by scaling the solar values down to the metallicity of this cluster, and explore the average abundances in the ejecta obtained by adopting smaller mass-loss rates. Higher neon produces higher sodium in the AGB envelope. Lowering the mass-loss rate allows both to keep reasonably large sodium abundances and to increase the depletion of oxygen and magnesium. A balance between the lower mass-loss rates and the necessity of not increasing too much the episodes of third dredge up gives a neon abundance larger by a factor two and a mass-loss rate smaller by a factor four as best compromise. Comparison with the abundances in NGC 2808 shows a better agreement than the standard models for all the patterns of abundances, but the extreme stars (group E) requires models slightly less rich in iron. t Thus, we propose that the extreme population in NGC 2808 is composed of stars having a slightly smaller metallicity, and sketch a possible scenario for its formation, in the framework of the hierarchical clusters assembly scenario. Abundances of potassium are larger by $\sim 0.2 dex$ in the E group, but the explanation in terms of burning of the initial argon requires a drastic increase of the relevant cross section. The abundances of neon and argon at low metallicities may be an important tool to better reproduce the abundances of light elements in the framework of the AGB model for globular clusters.</description>

      <title>Massive stellar cannibals: How stellar mergers drive mass-loss in extremely massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been theorized that the formation of extremely massive and supermassive stars ($&gt;10^3\ {\rm M}_\odot$) could plausibly be the outcome of stellar mergers in low metallicity ($Z&lt;10^{-1}$~Z$_\odot$) and dense ($\gtrsim10^3\ {\rm M}_\odot\ {\rm pc}^{-3}$) stellar environments. These objects remain relevant as they can serve as the progenitors of intermediate-mass black holes and they are also formidable chemical polluter candidates, as evidenced by the peculiar abundances seen across cosmic history. This work investigates merger-induced mass loss in extremely massive stars within a hydrodynamic framework and provides a prescription derived from the simulations to estimate both the mass loss and the outcome of the interaction. We adapted the 1D hydrodynamic, stellar structure, and evolution code MESA to simulate stellar inspirals. In our simulations, we considered stars of $&gt;1000\,\rm M_{\odot}$ with inspiraling companions of $&lt;100$ M$_\odot$; hence, with mass ratios of $&lt;0.1$. As the inspiral progresses, the orbital energy of the system is lost through the hydrodynamic and gravitational drag forces. This energy gets deposited as thermal energy in the extremely massive star's envelope. We find that the total ejected mass is $\sim$10-30$\%$ of the system's mass. Our results point out that most of the energy deposited by the inspiral is used to eject mass. These findings demonstrate that merger-induced mass loss is non-negligible for the considered configurations. Thus, it is an important process to account for when investigating the formation of extremely massive stars and predicting their possible role throughout cosmic history.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Coronal Mass Ejections in Different Data-Driven Solar Wind Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical models of the solar wind and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) utilize photospheric magnetic field observations to prescribe the inner boundary conditions for the plasma solutions. These magnetic field data are available to the community through various observational instruments, prepared via different methodologies and/or flux-transport models. The solar wind solution driven by these maps provides the ambient plasma environment into which CMEs travel, coupling, and interacting with the surrounding plasma and governing the CME evolution and propagation in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. In this work, we use different input magnetic field maps for the same time period to drive the global Alfven Wave Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM). We obtain the ambient solar wind conditions and compare the plasma properties and magnetic morphology in the coronal domain to study the influence of the input maps. To understand how the resulting coronal solutions impact CMEs, we launch eruptions described by analytical flux ropes into these data-driven solutions and compare their evolution in the coronal domain (up to 24 solar radii radially). The CMEs achieve varying speeds, deceleration rates, propagation directions, mass and energies while coupling with the background solar wind. We quantify these differences to show that the different input driving maps can significantly impact the simulated CME propagation in the solar wind plasma. This also highlights the importance of understanding the uncertainties associated with data-driven modeling that become increasingly important in operational models and space weather prediction.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear interaction between dynamo-generated magnetic fields, mean flows and internal gravity waves in stellar stably-stratified layers: From 3D to 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields have been constrained at the surface of several massive and intermediate-mass stars, but their origin and properties in deep stellar radiative interiors are still debated, despite recent detections in the core of some red giant stars. Therefore, the modelling of AM transport in stellar radiative layers only relies on theoretical and numerical estimates of magnetic fields. Recent 3D numerical simulations show that a dynamo could occur in deep radiative regions. A realistic setup for understanding AM transport in such layers thus requires to take into account the mutual interactions of IGW and dynamo-generated magnetic field. We model the dynamics induced by IGW and dynamo in rotating radiative stellar layers using a simple description applicable to various evolutionary stages. As dynamo action and the propagation of IGW are 3D processes that have characteristic timescales short compared to periods associated with structural evolution of stars, we propose a mean-field 1D model by taking advantage of the dynamo coefficients computed from 3D spherical simulations. In this model, the necessary mean shear flow to trigger the dynamo results from the dissipation of monochromatic IGW generated in existing adjacent convective layers, which are expected to drive the formation of an oscillating rotational shear layer, the so-called Shear Layer Oscillation (SLO). In turn, magnetic effects can act on the mean flow through the Lorentz force. We show that the inclusion of magnetic fields adds up to the already very complex nonlinear problem and gives rise to the emergence of new dynamical regimes. Particularly, the fast SLO generated very close to the place where IGW are generated is perturbed by magnetic fields. This dynamical change can filter the wave energy spectrum transmitted towards further layers, with potential influence on the long-term evolution of the inner rotation.</description>

      <title>Painting a Family Portrait of the Yellow Super- and Hypergiants in the Milky Way I. Constraining the Distances and Luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Distances to evolved massive stars in the Milky Way are not well constrained by Gaia parallaxes due to their brightness and variability. This makes it difficult to determine their fundamental stellar parameters, such as radius or luminosity, and infer their evolutionary states. Aims. We aim to improve the distance estimates of Yellow Hypergiants (YHGs) and Yellow Supergiants (YSGs) by identifying possible cluster and association memberships. Using these distances, we derived updated luminosities and revised their positions in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Methods. We compiled from the literature a sample of 35 luminous yellow massive stars (YHGs and the most luminous YSGs). We used Gaia DR3 astrometry to identify possible membership in clusters and OB associations. We derived distances by combining the parallaxes of nearby co-moving stars. We independently validated these distances by comparing the stellar radial velocities to the Galactic H I kinematic map. We combined angular diameters and effective temperature values from the literature with the new distances to estimate luminosities. Results. We improved the distance estimates for 28 of the 35 stars through association with co-moving stellar groups. For an additional six stars, we provided distance estimates based on the H I kinematic map. For one star, the distance remains unclear. Most YSGs are members of young stellar populations, while the environments of the YHGs are more diverse, and for some of them, their origin populations remain unclear. We derived updated luminosities for a subset of 20 stars. Most YHGs have luminosities above log L/L = 5.4, while YSGs occupy a wider range of luminosities and the most luminous YSGs have luminosities similar to YHGs.</description>

      <title>A JWST NIRCam/MIRI view of the W51A high-mass star-forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present observations of the W51A region, including the massive protoclusters W51-E and W51-IRS2, with JWST in 10 NIRCam and 5 MIRI filters. In this work, we highlight the most novel features apparent in these images and compare them with other multi-wavelength images. The broad view of the NIRCam/MIRI images of the W51A region shows that areas dominated by warm dust and ionized gas are distinct from those dominated by PAHs. The high angular resolution of the JWST images resolves dust filaments in high contrast, revealing geometrically converging features feeding W51-E and a cavity around W51-IRS2. This picture adds support to the hypothesis that feedback from W51-IRS2 is suppressing further gas infall onto the protocluster, while by contrast, gas is still accreting onto W51-E. Comparing the NIRCam and MIRI images to ALMA data, we find 24 sources detected by both JWST and ALMA, accounting for only $\sim10\%$ of the ALMA sources; the rest are too embedded or too cool to be detected by JWST. A knot of [Fe II] and H$_2$ emission north of W51-IRS2, previously detected in ground-based images, reveals peculiarly bright and compact peaks detected in all JWST bands. The knot is likely the most energetic example of a protostellar jet driven by a massive star impacting dense interstellar medium. The new images provide a complementary view to the previous long-wavelength perspective on this 4 x 8 pc area of one of the most active star-forming regions in our Galaxy, revealing new mysteries to be further explored.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Characterizing Companions with a Calibrated Gaia DR2, DR3, and Hipparcos Catalog (G23H)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia DR4 epoch astrometry will enable the detection of thousands of exoplanets through astrometric motion. Here, we present a composite catalog and modeling framework that extracts the maximum information from existing Hipparcos and Gaia data releases. We calibrate Gaia DR2 proper motions and DR3-DR2 scaled position differences against the Gaia DR3 reference frame, and combine these with the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations, the Hipparcos intermediate astrometric data, Gaia astrometric excess noise, and Gaia radial velocity variability constraints. We implement a joint likelihood model for these data in Octofitter that marginalizes over Gaia's unpublished observation epochs. This results in full orbit posteriors that can be computed uniformly for a large class of companions. We compare these posteriors to published orbital solutions for 25 stellar binaries from the Sixth Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars, recovering all companions at high significance and broadly consistent orbital separations. We then recover independent evidence to support 94 of 120 tested Jovian exoplanetary systems from the NASA Exoplanet Archive (plus 3 known stellar companions, and one previously detected planet we now rule out). We demonstrate that in cases like 14 Her b, the posteriors confirm the planetary nature of a signal using only Gaia and Hipparcos data. We find no false positives among 25 RV-quiet standard stars without significant Hipparcos-Gaia accelerations. Our method can break degeneracies inherent to proper motion anomaly or excess noise modeling alone by resolving orbital curvature within the Gaia baseline. The catalog and updated Octofitter are made publicly available to the community.</description>

      <title>ATOMS-QUARKS survey: Inflow and infall in massive protocluster G318.049+00.086: Evidence of competitive accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a gas kinematic study of the massive protocluster G318.049+00.086. The protocluster is reported to contain 12 prestellar core candidates and 4 protostellar cores. Filamentary structures are identified using the 1.3 mm dust continuum map, with four of them converge into a dense central region, forming a hub-filament system (HFS). High velocity gradients (10 - 20 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$) derived from PV analysis of H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ emission along three of those filaments are suggestive of mass inflow onto the central hub. A mass inflow rate higher than $10^{3}$ M$_{\odot}$ Myr$^{-1}$ along the filaments is indicating that the central hub is capable of forming massive star(s). Investigation of H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and CCH spectral profiles revealed the majority of the cores having the characteristic blue asymmetric line profiles, typical signature of gravitational collapse. The remaining few cores showed red asymmetric profiles, indicative of gas expansion. Also, the derived mass infall rates for the protostellar cores in hub-region is significantly higher in comparison to those located along the filaments. The mass-radius relationship of the cores revealed that the cores with red profiles reside in the massive star formation regime. However, the global velocity gradient along the filaments suggests that these particular cores are losing material to the hub. Our results are supporting a competitive accretion scenario of massive star formation where gas is expected to be funnelled from less gravitationally dominant cores to the cores located at the gravitationally favorable position.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility and Entropy Exclusion in Collisionless Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine entropy production in reduced descriptions of collisionless plasmas. Introducing a closure dependent entropy hierarchy, we show that non-conservative moment closures generate a residual entropy associated with irreversible information loss, whereas invariant closures remain reversible. The monotonic growth of this residual entropy imposes a statistical realizability constraint on macroscopic plasma states, excluding regions of phase space independent of dynamical stability. For anisotropic plasmas, we evaluate entropy production within a second-order moment closure, identifying contributions from transport and magnetic field inhomogeneity. The resulting entropy exclusion boundary is broadly consistent with observed anisotropy distributions in space plasmas. Statistical realizability thus emerges as an organizing principle for reduced collisionless plasma descriptions.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Dynamics and Thermochemistry for the Outer Atmospheres of the Ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-121b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present three-dimensional simulations of the ultra-hot Jupiter (UHJ) WASP-121b from the planetary surface to extended outflows, coupling hydrodynamics with consistent non-equilibrium thermochemistry, ray-tracing radiative transfer, and hydrodynamics using the GPU-accelerated Kratos framework. The fiducial model exhibits several atmospheric layers, including the lower atmospheres controlled by day-night circulation, and transonic photoevaporative outflows at higher altitudes shaped into two spiral arms by the stellar gravity and orbital motion effects. Different species could trace different regions: Fe probes rotation-dominated inner layers, Na maps dense spiral arms where recombination balances photoionization, and H$\alpha$ and He $10830~{\rm A}$ features trace progressively more extended, ionized gas. With spiral arm velocities reaching $\sim 40~{\rm km\ s}^{-1}$ projected along the line of sight, this morphology explains observed high-velocity Na and H$\alpha$ absorption features without requiring significant super-rotation jet streams. Parametric studies reveal complex dependencies on stellar irradiation: enhanced FUV intensifies outflows and extends spiral arms spatially and kinematically, while EUV and X-ray expands spiral structures into attenuated, ionized regions. Stellar wind confinement compresses the dayside outflow and enhances metastable helium absorption. This work demonstrates that current and future transmission spectral observations that probe multiple species can provide important constraints on astrophysical environments of UHJs by comparing state-of-the-art simulations.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of transition data of astrophysical importance in neutral sulphur</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and comprehensive atomic data are essential for the modelling of stellar spectra. Uncertainties in the oscillator strengths of specific lines used for abundance analyses directly translate into uncertainties in the derived elemental abundances; incomplete or biased atomic data sets can impart significant errors in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) modelling. Theoretical calculations of atomic data are therefore crucial to supplement the limited experimental results. In this work, we present extensive atomic data, including oscillator strengths, transition rates, and lifetimes for 1730 electric-dipole (E1) transitions among 107 levels in neutral sulphur (S I) using the multi-configuration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) and relativistic-configuration-interaction (RCI) methods. These levels belong to the configurations $\mathrm{3p^3np (n=3-7)}$, $\mathrm{3p^3nf (n=4,5)}$, $\mathrm{3s3p^5}$, $\mathrm{3p^3ns (n=4-7)}$, and $\mathrm{3p^3nd (n=3-6)}$. The accuracy of the computed transition rates is assessed by combining the comparison of the differences in transition rates between the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges with a cancellation-factor (CF) analysis. Approximately 16% of the ab initio results achieved an accuracy classification of A-B, corresponding to uncertainties within 10%, as defined by the Atomic Spectra Database of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST ASD). Applying a fine-tuning technique was found to significantly improve the accuracy of the results in the Coulomb gauge, thereby improving the consistency between the Babushkin and Coulomb gauges; about 24% of the fine-tuned transition data are assigned to the accuracy classes A-B.</description>

      <title>Helium escape in context: Comparative signatures of four close-in exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of escaping atmospheres on close-in exoplanets show a wide range in the strength and morphology of He I 10830 A and H I absorption. Scaling relations attempt to link the He I signal to XUV irradiation, mass loss, and bulk planetary parameters. We test these relations with a comparative analysis of HD209458b, HD189733b, HD149026b, and GJ1214b using a 1D hydrodynamic, multi-species, full-atmosphere escape model. For the benchmark HD209458b, our previously validated solution reproduces the observed He I and Ha transit depths without imposing composition constraints. HD189733b exhibits comparable He I depths, but the broadest reported profiles require ~12 km/s of additional non-thermal broadening, whereas more recent measurements are narrower, consistent with our predictions. For HD149026b, despite similar system properties, our model shows that higher gravity suppresses escape and enhances diffusive separation, depleting helium at high altitudes and yielding extremely weak He I absorption. For the sub-Neptune GJ1214b, H/He-only models overestimate He I absorption; including H2 and its ions (H2+, H3+, HeH+) lowers the escape rate and modifies the ion/electron balance, reducing the metastable helium densities. Compared against scaling relations, HD189733b observations and our HD149026b prediction fall below the trend, whereas some observations of HD209458b and GJ1214b are consistent; however, the observed transit depths are variable. Across all targets, we find diffusive separation of helium and hydrogen, which may explain why sub-solar He/H ratios are often required in simplified models. We conclude that interpreting He I and Ha absorption requires first-principles models that include self-consistent temperature and velocity profiles, multi-species transport, and molecular chemistry.</description>

      <title>The role of rotation on the yields of the two {\gamma}-ray emitters 26Al and 60Fe ejected by massive stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the observed 60Fe/26Al flux ratio provided by the SPectrometer on INTEGRAL satellite (0.24 +- 0.04) can be reproduced only if rotation is taken into account in the computation of the stellar models. Predictions from non-rotating stellar models yield to a significantly lower ratio (0.062), which is incompatible with the observed value. The adopted models and the associated yields are based on a combination of models already published by Limongi &amp; Chieffi (2018) complemented by additional ones fully consistent with the original grid, allowing a finer resolution in the initial rotational velocity distribution.</description>

      <title>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) abundances in the disk around T Chamaeleontis (T Cha): PAH sizes, ionization fraction, and mass during JWST observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The T Tauri star T Cha is known to have a protoplanetary disk with a dust gap separating the inner and outer disk regions. The mid-infrared JWST spectrum of T Cha shows multiple prominent aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) around 6.2, 8.1, and 11.3 $\mu$m. AIBs are commonly accepted as the emission stemming from PAH molecules. We aim to characterize the PAHs giving rise to the AIBs observed in the JWST spectrum of T Cha. Our objective is to estimate the PAH abundances, in terms of their sizes, ionization fraction, and mass, in the disk of T Cha. We perform spectral fitting of the observed AIBs to identify the possible underlying PAH emission components. We transfer the stellar radiation through a parametric disk model in order to reproduce the mid-IR spectrum, optical photometric fluxes, and mm continuum band fluxes of T Cha. We include PAH dust grains, which are stochastically heated, in our model calculations to simulate the AIBs. Thus, we estimate the PAH abundances from our modelling. We use the results from previous observations and modelling efforts to reduce our model degeneracies. The overall disk morphology - an inner and an outer disk separated by a dust gap - derived in this work is consistent with the previous results from Spitzer, VLT, and ALMA observations. PAHs are located within the outer disk in our model. Given our best fiducial model, we estimate a population of small PAHs of &lt;26 C atoms, with an ionized PAH fraction of $\sim0.15$. We also obtain a PAH-to-dust mass ratio of ~7$\times$10$^{-3}$, which amounts to ~17% of the PAH-to-dust mass ratio observed in the ISM. We predict the outer disk to have a frontal wall with smaller dust grains, sizes limited up to $\mu$m-order, in order to properly fit the continuum slope within 14-25 $\mu$m. We propose a possibility of sub-micron dust grains within the gap to justify an observed plateau around ~10 $\mu$m in the JWST spectrum.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical mass-loss rates for Very Massive Stars. I. Investigating the wind kink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radiation-driven winds are ubiquitous in massive stars, but in Very Massive Stars (VMSs), mass loss dominates their evolution, chemical yields, and ultimate fate. Theoretical predictions have often relied on extrapolations of O star prescriptions, likely underestimating true VMS mass-loss rates. In the first of a series of papers on VMS wind properties, we investigate a feature predicted by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations: a mass-loss `kink' or upturn where the single-scattering limit is breached and winds transition from optically thin to optically thick. We calculate hydrodynamically consistent non-LTE atmosphere models using the PoWR$^\mathrm{HD}$ code, with a grid spanning $40-135M_\odot$ and 12-50 kK at fixed $\log(L_\star/L_\odot) = 6.0$ and solar-like metallicity with $Z=0.02$. Our models confirm the existence of the kink, where the wind optical depth crosses unity and spectral morphology shifts from O star to WNh types. The predicted location of the kink coincides with the transition stars in the Galactic Arches cluster and reproduces the model-independent transition mass-loss rate of $\log(\dot{M}_\mathrm{trans}) \approx -5.16$ from Vink &amp; Gr\"afener (2012). For the first time, we locate the kink at $\Gamma_\mathrm{e} \approx 0.43$ ($M_\star \approx 60M_\odot$) without relying on uncertain stellar masses. Above the kink, mass-loss rates scale much more steeply with decreasing mass (slope ~ 10), in qualitative agreement with MC predictions. We additionally identify two bistability jumps in the mass loss driven by Fe ionisation shifts: the first from FeIV to FeIII near 25 kK and the second from FeIII to FeII near 15 kK. Our models thus provide the first comprehensive confirmation of the VMS mass-loss kink while establishing a mass-loss relation with complex mass and temperature dependencies with consequences for stellar evolution, chemical yields, and the black hole mass spectrum.</description>

      <title>GW231123: Likely a product of successive mergers from $\sim 10 $ stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GW231123 is an exceptionally massive binary black hole (BBH) merger with unusually high component spins. Such extreme properties challenge conventional stellar evolution models predicting a black hole mass gap due to pair-instability supernovae. We test possible formation scenarios for GW231123 using population-informed priors on BH spin distributions, in light of population properties built on the previous (GWTC-3) data. Our analysis shows that GW231123 belongs to the high-spin subpopulation that is naturally interpreted as hierarchical BBH mergers. By comparing the spin magnitudes and component masses of GW231123 to those of the remnants of previous mergers, we show that both components of GW231123 are multi-generation ($&gt;$2G) merger remnants, and plausibly originated from the successive mergers of $\sim 6$ and $\sim 4$ first-generation BHs, respectively. This suggests that repeated mergers can be frequent and even more massive intermediate-mass black holes may be produced. Thus mechanisms that can efficiently harden the BBHs' orbits are required, e.g., gas dynamical friction in the disks of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Modeling Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei Using Hydrodynamic Simulations and Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear star clusters represent some of the most extreme collisional environments in the Universe. A nuclear star cluster like that of the Milky Way harbors a supermassive black hole at its center, which accelerates stars to high speeds ($\gtrsim 100$-$1000$ km/s) in a region where millions of other stars reside. Direct collisions occur in such high-density environments, where they can shape the stellar populations and influence the evolution of the cluster. We present a suite of a couple hundred high-resolution smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of collisions between $1$ M$_\odot$ stars, at impact speeds representative of galactic nuclei. We use our SPH dataset to develop physically-motivated fitting formulae for predicting collision outcomes. While collision-driven mass loss has been examined in detail in the literature, we present a new framework for understanding the effects of ``hit-and-run'' collisions on a star's trajectory. We demonstrate that the change in stellar velocity follows the tidal-dissipation limit for grazing encounters, while the deflection angle is well-approximated by point-particle dynamics for periapses $\gtrsim 0.3$ times the stellar radii. We use our SPH dataset to test two machine learning (ML) algorithms, k-Nearest Neighbors and neural networks, for predicting collision outcomes. We find that the neural network out-performs k-Nearest Neighbors and delivers results on par with and in some cases exceeding the accuracy of our fitting formulae. We conclude that both fitting formulae and ML have merits for modeling collisions in dense stellar environments, however ML may prove more effective as the parameter space of initial conditions expands.</description>

      <title>Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C- MetaLL) survey: VIII: Spectroscopic detection of rare earth dysprosium, erbium, lutetium and thorium in Classical Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids are among the most important distance calibrators thanks to the correlation between their period and luminosity, and play a crucial role in the calibration as the first rung of the extragalactic distance ladder. Given their typical age, they also constitute an optimal tracer of the young population in the Galactic disc. We performed a complete spectroscopic analysis of 136 spectra obtained from three different high-resolution spectrographs, for a total of 60 DCEPs. More than half have pulsational periods longer than 15 days, up to 70 days, doubling the number of stars in our sample with P&gt;15d. We derived radial velocities, atmospheric parameters, and chemical abundances for up to 33 different species. We present an updated list of trusted spectroscopic lines for the detection and estimation of chemical abundances. We used this new set to revisit the abundances already published in the context of the C-MetaLL survey and increase the number of available chemical species. For the first time (to our knowledge), we present the estimation of abundances for Cepheids for dysprosium, as well as a systematic estimation of erbium, lutetium, and thorium abundances. We calculated a galactic radial gradient for [Fe/H] with a slope of -0.064 pm 0.002 dex kpc-1, in good agreement with recent literature estimation. The other elements also exhibit a clear negative radial trend, with this effect diminishing and eventually disappearing for heavier neutron-capture elements. Depending on the proposed spiral arms model present in several literature sources, our most external stars agree on tracing either the Perseus, the Norma-Outer, or both the Outer and the association Outer-Scutum-Centaurus arms.</description>

      <title>Evidence of 1:1 slope between rocky Super-Earths and their host stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between the composition of rocky exoplanets and their host stars is fundamental to understanding planetary formation and evolution. However, previous studies have been limited by inconsistent datasets, observational biases and methodological differences. This study investigates the compositional relationship between rocky exoplanets and their host stars, utilizing a self-consistent and homogeneous dataset of 21 exoplanets and their 20 host stars. By applying sophisticated interior structure modeling and comprehensive chemical analysis, we identify a potential 1:1 best-fit line between the iron-mass fraction of planets and their host stars equivalent with a slope of $m = 0.94^{+1.02}_{-1.07}$ and intercept of $c = -0.02^{+0.31}_{-0.29}$. This results are consistent at the 1$\sigma$ level with other homogeneous studies, but not with heterogeneous samples that suggest much steeper best-fit lines. Although, our results remain tentative due to sample size and data uncertainties, the updated dataset significantly reduces the number of super-Mercuries from four to one, but it remains that several high-density planets are beyond what a primordial origin would suggest. The planets in our sample have a wider range of compositions compared to stellar equivalent values, that could indicate formation pathways away from primordial or be the result of random scattering owing to current mass-radius uncertainties as we recover the observed outliers in mock population analysis $\sim15\%$ of the time. To truly determine whether the origin is primordial with a 1:1 true relation, we find that sample of at least 150 planets is needed and that stars that are iron enrich or depleted are high value targets.</description>

      <title>Constraining r-process nucleosynthesis via enhanced accuracy neutron-capture experiments</title>

Abstract: The isotopic abundances of r-process elements in the solar system are traditionally derived as residuals from the subtraction of s-process contributions from total solar abundances. However, the uncertainties in s-process nucleosynthesis -- particularly those arising from Maxwellian Averaged Cross Sections (MACS) -- propagate directly into the r-process residuals, affecting their reliability. Building upon the seminal work of Goriely (1999), who introduced a multi-event s-process model to quantify these uncertainties, we revisit the problem using a simplified yet effective approach. By assuming that the relative uncertainty in s-process isotopic abundances scales linearly with the MACS uncertainties from data libraries (KADoNiS), we identify a subset of isotopes for which the r-process residuals remain significantly uncertain. Using updated solar abundances (Lodders 2025) and s-process contributions from Bisterzo et al. (2014), we present a short list of isotopes that are prime candidates for improved (n,g) measurements at CERN n_TOF in the near future. Our analysis provides a practical framework for prioritizing future experimental efforts that will profit from upgrades and enhancements of the n_TOF facility. It also highlights the need to revisit key neutron-capture cross sections to refine our understanding of the r-process isotopic abundance pattern, commonly used as a benchmark in stellar models of explosive nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>The Effect of a Non-universal Extinction Curve on the Wesenheit Function and Cepheid Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wesenheit function is widely used to reduce the effects of interstellar reddening in distance measurements. Its construction, however, relies on the assumption of a universal extinction curve and on fixed values of the total-to-selective extinction ratio, Rv. Recent studies have shown that Rv varies significantly across the Milky Way and between different galaxies, raising concerns about systematic biases in Wesenheit magnitudes and period-Wesenheit relations. In this work, we discuss the impact of non-universal extinction on Wesenheit indices by combining the Rv-dependent extinction curve with a grid of stellar atmosphere models. We compute the integrated extinction in optical and near-infrared passbands, derive Rv-dependent R coefficients for multiple Wesenheit indices, and examine how changes in Rv propagate into Wesenheit magnitudes and Cepheid distances in our Galaxy. We find that the R coefficients in the Wesenheit functions vary strongly with Rv. For classical Cepheids in the Milky Way disk, variations of Rv within the typical observed range (2.6-3.6) can lead to substantial differences in the Wesenheit function, reaching +-0.7 mag from the mean for the Gaia-based Wesenheit index W_G and resulting in distance errors of almost 40%. Near-infrared Wesenheit indices are much less sensitive to Rv changes. Our results clearly show that accounting for variable Rv is essential when applying period-Wesenheit relations, particularly in the optical regime, or that near or mid infrared based distances should be used. While we present this effect for classical Cepheids, it applies to all pulsating stars for which period-Wesenheit relations are used to infer distances.</description>

      <title>Testing the three massive neutrino paradigm: Constraints on Neutrino Properties and Interactions from Recent Experimental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino physics offers unique insights into phenomena beyond the Standard Model (BSM). This thesis presents phenomenological investigations organized around three pillars: consolidation of the three-flavor oscillation paradigm, exploration of new physics viability, and precise determination of solar neutrino fluxes.
  The theoretical framework introduces massive neutrinos, leptonic mixing, and flavor transitions, followed by experimental results emphasizing Borexino and NOvA data analyses.
  The first pillar establishes the three-flavor framework through global analysis of solar, atmospheric, reactor, and accelerator data, providing updated determinations of mixing angles ($\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$) and mass-squared differences ($\Delta m^2_{21}$, $\Delta m^2_{31}$), while quantifying ambiguities in mass ordering and $\theta_{23}$ octant.
  The second pillar investigates Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) with electrons and quarks, combining Borexino data with COHERENT's CE$\nu$NS measurements to establish bounds on propagation and detection couplings, excluding viable NSI parameter regions including potential LMA-D solutions.
  The third pillar advances solar neutrino physics through precision flux determinations, integrating pp-chain and CNO-cycle measurements. Results show preference for high-metallicity Standard Solar Models and incompatibility between $3+1$ mixing parameters favored by Gallium experiments and solar observations.
  This synthesis guides future experiments toward resolving mass ordering, CP violation, and dark sector interactions.</description>

      <title>proto-Lightspeed: a high-speed, ultra-low read noise imager on the Magellan Clay Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: proto-Lightspeed is a new instrument that has been commissioned on the Nasmyth East port of the Magellan Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory to deliver high-speed optical imaging with deep sub-electron read noise. Making use of commercial re-imaging lenses and the ORCA-Quest 2 camera from Hamamatsu, proto-Lightspeed images a field $1'$ in diameter at up to $200$ Hz or windowed fields at higher rates, up to 6600 Hz for a $1.6''\times 1'$ field of view. proto-Lightspeed delivers seeing-limited image quality in the $g'$, $r'$, and $i'$ bands and adjustable magnification for pixel scales between $0.017''-0.050''$. proto-Lightspeed is well suited to studying compact binary systems, exoplanet transits, rapid flaring associated with accretion, periodic optical emission from pulsars, occultations of background stars by small trans-Neptunian Objects, and any other rapidly variable source. proto-Lightspeed will be a P.I. instrument beginning in 2026B, available for use by members of the Magellan Consortium. In this paper, we discuss the design and performance of the instrument, results from its two commissioning runs, and plans for a facility instrument, Lightspeed, to support simultaneous multicolor imaging across a $7'\times4'$ field.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Resonance Detectability during Binary Neutron Star Inspiral: Accurate Mismatch Computations for Low-lying Dynamical Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute deviations from observed gravitational wave signals, where the amplitude of the signal is unchanged. As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior. We show that tidal resonance effects primarily cause a time advance of the merger, rather than a phase difference, and that the single-frequency approximation commonly used in the literature significantly overestimates the detectability of this effect.</description>

      <title>Statistical study for binary star evolution in dense embedded clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: The dynamical evolution of binary populations in embedded star clusters shapes the statistical properties of binaries observed in the Galactic field. Accurately modelling this process requires resolving both early cluster dynamics and binary interactions.
  Aims: We aim to characterize the early dynamical evolution of primordial binaries in embedded clusters and identify the key parameters that govern binary survival and disruption.
  Methods: We perform a set of direct $N$-body simulations starting from 100\% primordial binaries in a time-varying gas potential of a gas-embedded cluster. To describe the evolution of binary orbital properties, we define empirical dynamical operators for period, binding energy, and mass ratio, and calibrate them across the simulated ensemble.
  Results:The binding energy and orbital period evolve in a consistent, sigmoidal fashion. Their dynamical operators reveal that hard binaries heat the cluster and suppress wide binary formation, while a small residual population of soft binaries survives. The evolution of the mass-ratio distribution is less directly linked to dynamical processing and more shaped by internal processes such as stellar physics process in the pre-main-sequence phase. High-$q$ systems tend to be enhanced, while low-$q$ systems are prone to disruption.
  Conclusions: The binary evolution in clusters is primarily governed by binding energy and orbital period. Our model improves over previous parameterizations of the dynamical operator by allowing for the existence of wide binaries and incorporating the embedded cluster phase. For individual clusters, direct $N$-body modelling remains the only reliable approach. On Galactic scales, population synthesis methods based on the stellar dynamical operator approach developed here remain essential.</description>
