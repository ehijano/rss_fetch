      <title>On the detection of knotted spheres by their traces in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every $n \geq 4$, we demonstrate the existence of non-isotopic smooth $(n-2)$-knots in $S^n$ with diffeomorphic traces by generalising the RBG link construction to all dimensions. Conversely, we prove that for every $n \geq 4$, the unknot in $S^n$ is detected by the diffeomorphism type of its surgery and hence by its trace.</description>

      <title>The computation of higher order Alexander invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1928, Alexander defined a sequence of knot polynomials, D_i(K). The first, D_1(K), is the classical Alexander polynomial. These are easily defined in terms of the homology of the infinite cyclic cover of the knot. In theory they can be computed by putting an associated Alexander matrix in Smith normal form. However, standard algorithms for computing the Smith form become impractically slow, even for some 16 crossing knots. Here, methods are developed that can effectively compute the Alexander polynomials of knots with up to 100 crossings.</description>

      <title>The asymptoticity of pairs of Teichm\"uller rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the limit of Teichm\"uller distance between two points along a pair of Teichm\"uller rays. We obtain an explicit formula for the limiting Teichm\"uller distance when the vertical measured foliations of the quadratic differentials are finite sums of weighted simple closed curves and uniquely ergodic measures. The limit is expressed in terms of ratios of the corresponding moduli and the Teichm\"uller distance between the limit surfaces when the vertical measured foliations are absolutely continuous. Consequently, two Teichm\"uller rays are asymptotic if and only if their vertical measured foliations are modularly equivalent and their limit surfaces coincide, which implies a main result of Masur on the asymptoticity of Teichm\"uller rays determined by uniquely ergodic quadratic differentials. Furthermore, we prove that the infimum of the limiting Teichm\"uller distances can be represented in terms of the distance between the limit surfaces of the Teichm\"uller rays and the detour metric of their endpoints on the Gardiner-Masur boundary, when the initial points of the rays vary along the Teichm\"uller geodesics.</description>

      <title>The Stolz' positive scalar curvature sequence for G-proper manifolds and depth-1 pseudomanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis revolves around the Stolz' positive scalar curvature sequence: in particular adapted to the context of (G, F)-spaces, i.e. proper G-spaces with isotropy groups belonging to a family F of subgroups of G, and to that of manifolds with non-isolated singularities. In both cases, the sequence is studied for appropriate classes of metrics with positive scalar curvature, and it is shown how the Stolz R-groups have a strict dependence on the 2-skeleton. This latter result will then be used in the (G, F) framework to establish an isomorphism between the R-groups for spaces having isomorphic fundamental functors, a suitable generalization of the fundamental group. A universal space is also introduced, where universal means that each space with this characterization admit a map with values in it, inducing isomorphisms at the level of R-groups. Subsequently, the mapping of the Stolz sequence to the Higson-Roe surgery sequence for singular spaces with (L, G)-singularities will be studied. Specifically, a version of the delocalized APS-index theorem, which makes use of localization algebras, will be employed. This includes a description of K-theory for graded $C^{*}-algebras$, which will be introduced for Real $C^{*}-algebras$, with the advantage of simultaneously including both the real and complex case. Finally, as an application of these results, the wedge index difference homomorphism is studied in the singular context. This homomorphism, besides serving as an obstruction for two well-adapted wedge metrics to be concordant, is used to provide a lower bound on the rank of the structure group of such positive scalar curvature metrics, namely the bordism group $Pos_*^{spin,(L,G)}$.</description>

      <title>The asymptoticity of extremal length in Teichm\"uller space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of extremal length along Teichm\"uller rays. Specifically, we determine the limit of extremal length along a Teichm\"uller ray and obtain an explicit expression for this limit, which complements a related formula established by Cormac Walsh. Building on this result and Kerckhoff's formula, we establish a formula for the limiting Teichm\"uller distance between two points moving along arbitrary pairs of Teichm\"uller rays. Furthermore, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for two Teichm\"uller rays to be asymptotic. Finally, by shifting the initial points of the Teichm\"uller rays along their associated Teichm\"uller geodesics, we show that the minimum of the limiting Teichm\"uller distance coincides with the detour metric between the endpoints of the rays on the horofunction boundary.</description>

Abstract: We show that the higher-dimensional Heegaard Floer homology between tuples of cotangent fibers and the conormal bundle of a homotopically nontrivial simple closed curve on $T^2$ recovers the polynomial representation of double affine Hecke algebra of type A. We also give a topological interpretation of Cherednik's inner product on the polynomial representation.</description>

Abstract: We prove that if $\mathcal{D}$ is a collection of $k$ nontrivial partitions of a positive integer $d$ satisfying the Riemann-Hurwitz formula, and if $k$ is greater than one plus the minimum length among the partitions in $\mathcal{D}$, then $\mathcal{D}$ is realizable as the branch data of a rational map $f \colon S^2 \to S^2$. As an application, we confirm a conjecture of Zheng [\textit{Topology Appl.} \textbf{153} (2006), no.~12, 2124--2134].</description>

Abstract: We show that the projectivized strata of holomorphic differentials with prescribed zero orders contain no positive-dimensional complete subvarieties. In the case of the minimal strata, this resolves a question of Harris concerning the existence of complete families of subcanonical points. Our proof relies on the geometry of flat cylinders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies knots in three dimensional projective space. Our technique is to associate a virtual link to a link in projective space so that equivalent projective links go to equivalent virtual links (modulo a special flype move). We apply techniques in virtual knot theory to obtain a Jones polynomial for projective links. We show that this is equivalent to the known Jones polynomial defined by Drobotukhina for them. We apply virtual Khovanov homology and the virtual Rasmussen invariant of Dye, Kaestner, and Kauffman to projective links. We compare this cohomology theory with the Khovanov type theory developed by Manolescu and Willis for projective knots. We show that these theories are essentially equivalent.</description>

      <title>Patterns of the $V_2$-polynomial of knots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03557v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Kashaev and the first author defined a sequence $V_n$ of 2-variable
  knot polynomials with integer coefficients, coming from the $R$-matrix of a rank
  2 Nichols algebra, the first polynomial been identified with the Links--Gould
  polynomial. In this note we present the results of the computation of the
  $V_n$-polynomials for $n=1,2,3,4$. This leads to the discovery of emerging patterns,
  including the genus bound for $V_2$ being an equality for all 58 million
  knots with at most $18$ crossings, as well as
  unexpected Conway mutations that seem undetected by the $V_n$-polynomials
  as well as by Heegaard Floer Homology and Khovanov Homology.</description>

      <title>Gordian split links in the Gehring ropelength problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A thick link is a link in $\mathbb{R}^3$ such that each component of the link lies at distance at least $1$ from every other component. Strengthening the notion of thickness, we define a thickly embedded link to be a thick link whose open radius-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ normal disk bundles of all components are embedded. The Gehring ropelength problem asks how large the sum of the lengths of the components of a thick (respectively thickly embedded) link must be, given the link homotopy (respectively isotopy) class of the link. A thick homotopy (isotopy) is a link homotopy (isotopy) of a thick (thickly embedded) link that preserves thickness throughout, and such that during the homotopy the total length of the link never exceeds the initial total length. These notions of thick homotopy and isotopy are more permissive than other notions of physical link isotopies in which the length of each individual component must remain constant. We construct an explicit example of a thickly embedded 4-component link which is topologically split but cannot be split by a thick homotopy, and thick links in every homotopy class with 2 components that are non-global local minima for ropelength. This is the first time such local minima for ropelength have been explicitly constructed. In particular, we construct a thick 2-component link in the link homotopy class of the unlink which cannot be split through a thick homotopy.</description>

Abstract: We establish a version of Howe duality that involves a tensor product of Verma modules. Surprisingly, this duality leaves the realm of lowest and highest weight modules.
  We quantize this duality, and as an application, we prove that the (colored higher) LKB representations arise from this duality and use this description to show that they are simple as modules for the braid group and for various of its subgroups, including the pure braid group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recall Petit's construction of "dichromatic" invariants of 4-manifolds computed from Kirby diagrams using a nested pair of ribbon fusion categories $ B \subset C $ as initial data. Along the way we prove a lemma that fits the use of formal linear combinations of simple objects with quantum dimensions a coefficients as in the constructions of Reshetikhin-Turaev, Broda, and Petit more firmly in the functorial framework favored by the authors.
  We then show that Hughes et al.'s banded-link presentations of surfaces embedded in 4-manifolds provide a means whereby Frobenius algebra in $B$ together with a suitable module over it lying in $C$, give rise to an invariant of a surface-4-manifold pair. We provide a class of examples of suitable initial data and compute sufficient examples to show the invariant is sensitive to both genus and knotting.</description>

Abstract: We study geometry of curves passing through a Whitney umbrella by using a Darboux frame along it. We define three invariants by using Frenet-Serre type formula relating to the geodesic curvature, the normal curvature, and the geodesic torsion. We investigate the degrees of divergence and the top-terms of these invariants and their geometric meanings. We also consider a developable surface along the curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate Jones polynomials $V(H_r,t)$ for a family of alternating knots and links $H_r$ with arbitrarily many crossings $r$, by computing the Tutte polynomials $T(G_+(H_r),x,y)$ for the associated graphs $G_+(H_r)$ and evaluating these with $x=-t$ and $y=-1/t$. Our method enables us to circumvent the generic feature that the computational complexity of $V(L_r,t)$ for a knot or link $L_r$ for generic $t$ grows exponentially rapidly with $r$. We also study the accumulation set of the zeros of these polynomials in the limit of infinitely many crossings, $r \to \infty$.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected algebraic semisimple real Lie group with finite center and no compact factors, and let $\Gamma$ be a Zariski dense discrete subgroup of $G$. We show that $\Gamma$ contains free, finitely generated subsemigroups whose critical exponents are arbitrarily close to that of $\Gamma$. Furthermore, these subsemigroups are Zariski dense in $G$ and $P$-Anosov in the sense of Kassel--Potrie. This shows that no gap phenomenon holds for critical exponents of discrete subsemigroups of Lie groups, which is in contrast with Leuzinger's critical exponent gap theorem for infinite covolume discrete subgroups of Lie groups with Kazhdan's property (T), proven in 2003.
  As an application, we prove that the critical exponent is lower semicontinuous in the Chabauty topology, in the following sense: if a sequence of Zariski dense discrete subgroups $\{\Gamma_{n}\}$ of $G$ converges in the Chabauty topology to a Zariski dense discrete subgroup $\Gamma$, then $\liminf_{n \to \infty} \delta(\Gamma_{n}) \geq \delta(\Gamma)$.</description>

      <title>Weaving Geodesics and New Phenomena in Horocyclic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct geometrically infinite hyperbolic surfaces supporting horocycles with tailored recurrence properties. In particular, we obtain the first examples of non-trivial minimal horocyclic orbit closures and of infinite locally-finite conservative horocyclic invariant measures which are singular with respect to the geodesic flow. Other examples include surfaces supporting horocyclic orbit closures of arbitrary Hausdorff dimension in $(1,2)$.</description>
