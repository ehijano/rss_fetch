      <title>Potential Flows with Electromagnetically-Induced Circulation in a Hele-Shaw Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Hele-Shaw cells, pressure-driven viscous fluid motion between two closely-spaced plates gives rise to a two-dimensional potential flow with zero circulation. Here, we show how the introduction of electromagnetic effects enables the realization of potential flows with circulation. We present canonical Hele-Shaw experiments with circulation prescribed by the electromagnetic configuration, and rationalize the observed flows theoretically. We also draw an analogy between this new class of circulatory potential flows and a class of electrostatic systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting 2D Viscoelastic Kolmogorov Flow: A Centre-mode-driven transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit viscoelastic Kolmogorov flow to show that the elastic linear instability of an Oldroyd-B fluid at vanishing Reynolds numbers ($Re$) found by Boffetta et al. (J. Fluid Mech. 523, 161-170, 2005) is the same `centre-mode' instability found at much higher $Re$ by Garg et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 024502, 2018) in a pipe and Khalid et al. (J. Fluid Mech. 915, A43, 2021) in a channel. In contrast to these wall-bounded flows, the centre-mode instability exists even when the solvent viscosity vanishes (e.g. it exists in the upper-convective Maxwell limit with $Re=0$). Floquet analysis reveals that the preferred centre-mode instability almost always has a wavelength twice that of the forcing. All elastic instabilities give rise to familiar `arrowheads' (Page et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 154501, 2020) which in sufficiently large domains and at sufficient Weissenberg number ($W$) interact chaotically in 2D to give elastic turbulence via a bursting scenario. Finally, it is found that the $k^{-4}$ scaling of the kinetic energy spectrum seen in this 2D elastic turbulence is already contained within the component arrowhead structures.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for multi-field visualization with single-color laser induced fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing fields from sparsely observed data is an ill-posed problem that arises in many engineering and science applications. Here, we investigate the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to reconstruct complete temperature, velocity and pressure fields from sparse and noisy experimental temperature data obtained through single-color laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). The PINNs are applied to the laminar mixed convection system, a complex but fundamentally important phenomenon characterized by the simultaneous presence of transient forced and natural convection behaviors. To enhance computation efficiency, this study also explores transfer learning (TL) as a mean of significantly reducing the time required for field reconstruction. Our findings demonstrate that PINNs are effective, capable of eliminating most experimental noise that does not conform to governing physics laws. Additionally, we show that the TL method achieves errors within 5% compared to the regular training scheme while reducing computation time by a factor of 9.9. We validate the PINN reconstruction results using non-simultaneous particle image velocimetry (PIV) and finite volume method (FVM) simulations. The reconstructed velocity fields from the PINN closely match those obtained from PIV. When using FVM data as a reference, the average temperature errors are below 1%, while the pressure and velocity errors are below 10%. This research provides insights into the feasibility of using PINNs for solving ill-posed problems with experimental data and highlights the potential of TL to enable near real-time field reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Flow control-oriented coherent mode prediction via Grassmann-kNN manifold learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A data-driven method using Grassmann manifold learning is proposed to identify a low-dimensional actuation manifold for flow-controlled fluid flows. The snapshot flow field are twice compressed using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and a diffusion model. Key steps of the actuation manifold are Grassmann manifold-based Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) as the encoder and K-nearest neighbor regression (kNN) as the decoder. This methodology is first tested on a simple dielectric cylinder in a homogeneous electric field to predict the out-of-sample electric field, demonstrating fast and accurate performance. Next, the present model is evaluated by predicting dynamic coherence modes of an oscillating-rotation cylinder. The cylinder's oscillating rotation amplitude and frequency are regarded as independent control parameters. The mean mode and the first dynamic mode are selected as the representative cases to test present model. For the mean mode, the Grassman manifold describes all parameterized modes with 8 latent variables. All the modes can be divided into four clusters, and they share similar features but with different wake length. For the dynamic mode, the Grassman manifold describes all modes with 12 latent variables. All the modes can be divided into three clusters. Intriguingly, each cluster is aligned with clear physical meanings. One describes the near-wake periodic vortex shedding resembling Karman vortices, one describes the far wake periodic vortex shedding, and one shows high-frequency K-H vortices shedding. Moreover, Grassmann-kNN manifold learning can accurately predict the modes. It is possible to estimate the full flow state with small reconstruction errors just by knowing the actuation parameters. This manifold learning model is demonstrated to be crucial for flow control-oriented flow estimation.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Spreading Radius in Droplet Impact: The Viscous Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of droplet impact and droplet spreading on a smooth surface in the case of a viscous Newtonian fluid. We revisit the concept of the rim-lamella model, in which the droplet spreading is described by a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We show that these models contain a singularity which needs to be regularized to produce smooth solutions, and we explore the different regularization techniques in detail. We adopt one particular technique for further investigation, and we use differential inequalities to derive upper and lower bounds for the maximum spreading radius $\mathcal{R}_{max}$. Without having to resort to dimensional analysis or scaling arguments, our bounds confirm the leading-order behaviour $\mathcal{R}_{max} \sim \mathrm{Re}^{1/5}$, as well as a correction to the leading-order behaviour involving the combination $\mathrm{We}^{-1/2}\mathrm{Re}^{2/5}$, in agreement with the experimental literature on droplet spread. Our bounds are also consistent with full numerical solutions of the ODEs, as well as with energy-budget calculations, once head loss is accounted for in the latter.</description>

      <title>Similarity Learning with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a neural network algorithm designed to automatically identify similarity relations from data. By uncovering these similarity relations, our network approximates the underlying physical laws that relate dimensionless quantities to their dimensionless variables and coefficients. Additionally, we develop a linear algebra framework, accompanied by code, to derive the symmetry groups associated with these similarity relations. While our approach is general, we illustrate its application through examples in fluid mechanics, including laminar Newtonian and non-Newtonian flows in smooth pipes, as well as turbulent flows in both smooth and rough pipes. Such examples are chosen to highlight the framework's capability to handle both simple and intricate cases, and further validates its effectiveness in discovering underlying physical laws from data.</description>

      <title>Bubble dynamics in a Hele-Shaw channel and velocity selection without surface tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.04327v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inviscid bubble dynamics in a viscous fluid, moving with velocity $V$ far from the bubble, is considered. The Cauchy problem of recovering the bubble evolution from its initial shape is completely solved without surface tension. The well-posed (after a Tikhonov regularization) dynamical system provides an extensive list of unsteady closed form solutions due to integrability. A new (rational) class of solutions is obtained and added to the logarithmic class found earlier (Phys. Rev. E 89, 061003(R), 2014). The only attractor selects the observable bubble shape and velocity $U = 2V$ from the continuum of possible solutions. The attractor is asymptotically stable. Numerical results illustrate the most salient aspects of the bubble dynamics.</description>

      <title>Preventing mass loss in the standard level set method: New insights from variational analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For decades, the computational multiphase flow community has grappled with mass loss in the level set method. Numerous solutions have been proposed, from fixing the reinitialization step to combining the level set method with other conservative schemes. However, our work reveals a more fundamental culprit: the smooth Heaviside and delta functions inherent to the standard formulation. Even if reinitialization is done exactly, i.e., the zero contour interface remains stationary, the use of smooth functions lead to violation of mass conservation. We propose a novel approach using variational analysis to incorporate a mass conservation constraint. This introduces a Lagrange multiplier that enforces overall mass balance. Notably, as the delta function sharpens, i.e., approaches the Dirac delta limit, the Lagrange multiplier approaches zero. However, the exact Lagrange multiplier method disrupts the signed distance property of the level set function. This motivates us to develop an approximate version of the Lagrange multiplier that preserves both overall mass and signed distance property of the level set function. Our framework even recovers existing mass-conserving level set methods, revealing some inconsistencies in prior analyses. We extend this approach to three-phase flows for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) simulations. We present variational equations in both immersed and non-immersed forms, demonstrating the convergence of the former formulation to the latter when the body delta function sharpens. Rigorous test problems confirm that the FSI dynamics produced by our simple, easy-to-implement immersed formulation with the approximate Lagrange multiplier method are accurate and match state-of-the-art solvers.</description>

      <title>Interpretable data-driven turbulence modeling for separated flows using symbolic regression with unit constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have been applied to enhance turbulence modeling in recent years. However, the "black box" nature of most machine learning techniques poses significant interpretability challenges in improving turbulence models. This paper introduces a novel unit-constrained turbulence modeling framework using symbolic regression to overcome these challenges. The framework amends the constitutive equation of linear eddy viscosity models (LEVMs) by establishing explicit equations between the Reynolds stress deviation and mean flow quantities, thereby improving the LEVM model's predictive capability for large separated turbulence. Unit consistency constraints are applied to the symbolic expressions to ensure physical realizability. The effectiveness of the framework and the generalization capability of the learned model are demonstrated through its application to the separated flow over 2D periodic hills and a backward-facing step. Compared to the standard k-{\epsilon} model, the learned model shows significantly improved predictive accuracy for anisotropic Reynolds stresses, velocity and skin friction, while exhibiting promising generalization capabilities across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal trajectories for Bayesian olfactory search in turbulent flows: the low information limit and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In turbulent flows, tracking the source of a passive scalar cue requires exploiting the limited information that can be gleaned from rare, stochastic encounters with the cue. When crafting a search policy, the most challenging and important decision is what to do in the absence of an encounter. In this work, we perform high-fidelity direct numerical simulations of a turbulent flow with a stationary source of tracer particles, and obtain quasi-optimal policies (in the sense of minimal average search time) with respect to the empirical encounter statistics. We study the trajectories under such policies and compare the results to those of the infotaxis heuristic. In the presence of a strong mean wind, the optimal motion in the absence of an encounter is zigzagging (akin to the well-known insect behavior "casting") followed by a return to the starting location. The zigzag motion generates characteristic $t^{1/2}$ scaling of the rms displacement envelope. By passing to the limit where the probability of detection vanishes, we connect these results to the classical linear search problem and derive an estimate of the tail of the arrival time pdf as a stretched exponential, which agrees with Monte Carlo results. We also discuss what happens as the wind speed decreases.</description>

      <title>MSPINN: Multiple scale method integrated physics-informed neural networks for reconstructing transient natural convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study employs physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to reconstruct multiple flow fields in a transient natural convection system solely based on instantaneous temperature data at an arbitrary moment. Transient convection problems present reconstruction challenges due to the temporal variability of fields across different flow phases. In general, large reconstruction errors are observed during the incipient phase, while the quasi-steady phase exhibits relatively smaller errors, reduced by a factor of 2 to 4. We hypothesize that reconstruction errors vary across different flow phases due to the changing solution space of a PINN, inferred from the temporal gradients of the fields. Furthermore, we find that reconstruction errors tend to accumulate in regions where the spatial gradients are smaller than the order of $10^{-6}$, likely due to the vanishing gradient phenomenon. In convection phenomena, field variations often manifest across multiple scales in space. However, PINN-based reconstruction tends to preserve larger-scale variations, while smaller-scale variations become less pronounced due to the vanishing gradient problem. To mitigate the errors associated with vanishing gradients, we introduce a multi-scale approach that determines scaling constants for the PINN inputs and reformulates inputs across multiple scales. This approach improves the maximum and mean errors by 72.2% and 6.4%, respectively. Our research provides insights into the behavior of PINNs when applied to transient convection problems with large solution space and field variations across multiple scales.</description>

      <title>Experimental Characterization of Non-Isothermal Sloshing in Microgravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sloshing of cryogenic liquid propellants can significantly impact a spacecraft's mission safety and performance by unpredictably altering the center of mass and producing large pressure fluctuations due to the increased heat and mass transfer within the tanks. This study, conducted as part of the NT-SPARGE (Non-isoThermal Sloshing PARabolic FliGht Experiment) project, provides a detailed experimental investigation of the thermodynamic evolution of a partially filled upright cylindrical tank undergoing non-isothermal sloshing in microgravity. Sloshing was induced by a step reduction in gravity during the 83rd European Space Agency (ESA) parabolic flight, resulting in a chaotic reorientation of the free surface under inertia-dominated conditions. To investigate the impact of heat and mass transfer on the sloshing dynamics, two identical test cells operating with a representative fluid, HFE-7000, in single-species were considered simultaneously. One cell was maintained in isothermal conditions, while the other started with initially thermally stratified conditions. Flow visualization, pressure, and temperature measurements were acquired for both cells. The results highlight the impact of thermal mixing on liquid dynamics coupled with the significant pressure and temperature fluctuations produced by the destratification. The comprehensive experimental data gathered provide a unique opportunity to validate numerical simulations and simplified models for non-isothermal sloshing in microgravity, thus contributing to improved cryogenic fluid management technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.05048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every $\alpha &lt; \frac13$, we construct an explicit divergence-free vector field $\mathbf{b}(t,x)$ which is periodic in space and time and belongs to $C^0_t C^{\alpha}_x \cap C^{\alpha}_t C^0_x$ such that the corresponding scalar advection-diffusion equation $$\partial_t \theta^\kappa + \mathbf{b} \cdot \nabla \theta^\kappa - \kappa \Delta \theta^\kappa = 0$$ exhibits anomalous dissipation of scalar variance for arbitrary $H^1$ initial data: $$\limsup_{\kappa \to 0} \int_0^{1} \int_{\mathbb{T}^d} \kappa \| \nabla \theta^\kappa (t,x) \|^2 \,dx\,dt &gt;0.$$ The vector field is deterministic and has a fractal structure, with periodic shear flows alternating in time between different directions serving as the base fractal. These shear flows are repeatedly inserted at infinitely many scales in suitable Lagrangian coordinates. Using an argument based on ideas from quantitative homogenization, the corresponding advection-diffusion equation with small $\kappa$ is progressively renormalized, one scale at a time, starting from the (very small) length scale determined by the molecular diffusivity up to the macroscopic (unit) scale. At each renormalization step, the effective diffusivity is enhanced by the influence of advection on that scale. By iterating this procedure across many scales, the effective diffusivity on the macroscopic scale is shown to be of order one.</description>

      <title>Universal Physics Transformers: A Framework For Efficiently Scaling Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12365v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators, serving as physics surrogate models, have recently gained increased interest. With ever increasing problem complexity, the natural question arises: what is an efficient way to scale neural operators to larger and more complex simulations - most importantly by taking into account different types of simulation datasets. This is of special interest since, akin to their numerical counterparts, different techniques are used across applications, even if the underlying dynamics of the systems are similar. Whereas the flexibility of transformers has enabled unified architectures across domains, neural operators mostly follow a problem specific design, where GNNs are commonly used for Lagrangian simulations and grid-based models predominate Eulerian simulations. We introduce Universal Physics Transformers (UPTs), an efficient and unified learning paradigm for a wide range of spatio-temporal problems. UPTs operate without grid- or particle-based latent structures, enabling flexibility and scalability across meshes and particles. UPTs efficiently propagate dynamics in the latent space, emphasized by inverse encoding and decoding techniques. Finally, UPTs allow for queries of the latent space representation at any point in space-time. We demonstrate diverse applicability and efficacy of UPTs in mesh-based fluid simulations, and steady-state Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes simulations, and Lagrangian-based dynamics.</description>
