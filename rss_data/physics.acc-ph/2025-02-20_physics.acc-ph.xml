      <title>High Power Fast Frequency Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fast and highly efficient frequency modulation at a high power level is described. The system incorporates ferroelectric phase shifters and a magic-T or a circulator. A magnetron may be considered as a potential application. The magnetron output may be converted to a selected reference frequency with negligible insertion loss. The method also allows simultaneous amplitude and phase control.</description>

      <title>2020 Physics Critique: Can a muon collider be operational within the next 30 years?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 2020 physics critique report for Year 4 MSci Physics with Particle Physics &amp; Cosmology with the University of Birmingham, School of Physics &amp; Astronomy. Muon colliders are a proposed next-generation particle accelerator which benefit from the muon's fundamentality and relatively high mass to perform simultaneous high precision, high energy experiments. This critique reviews their physics potential and technological feasibility, then proposes a roadmap for how a 3 TeV muon collider could be built, concluding that it is experimentally possible for a muon collider to be operational in 30 years.</description>

      <title>Application of autoresonance in rapid beam extraction of synchrotrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the ultra-high dose rate (FLASH) radiotherapy has become a novel cancer treatment technique because of its similar tumor-killing efficacy as conventional particle therapy while significantly protecting normal tissues. However, due to the limitation of number of particles, achieving FLASH effect in a compact heavy-ion synchrotron requires a short extraction time of tens of milliseconds, which is challenging for conventional RF-KO method. The conventional RF-KO method excites particle amplitudes through local resonance, but the extremely high dose rates required for FLASH therapy necessitate large excitation amplitudes that current driver technologies cannot adequately provide within the required millisecond scale. To address this challenge, this paper introduces autoresonance into resonant extraction for the first time. Leveraging the principles of autoresonance, this technique achieves whole beam amplitude resonance through frequency locking, facilitating rapid and uniform beam extraction using a single-period frequency sweeping excitation. Compared to conventional slow extraction methods, this innovative approach requires only the addition of an octupole magnet. We derived the autoresonance threshold under rapid extraction conditions and conducted some simulations. Simulation results confirm the theoretical analysis, demonstrating that this method can achieve millisecond scale extraction, validating the effectiveness of the proposed Autoresonance Rapid Extraction method.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Leaky Surface Plasmon Accelerator in Nanostructured Carbon Nanotube Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum-degenerate metallic carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the conduction electron gas forms a solid-state plasma environment where collective dynamics are dominant. This dense plasma is capable of supporting the excitation of surface plasmon on the CNT surface. In this study, we demonstrate a new class of microscale relativistic surface plasmons (RSPs) that, independent of laser polarisation and matching medium, can be directly excited by paraxial propagation of a high-intensity optical laser pulse through a cylindrical vacuum channel nanostructured in a CNT forest. The leaky field of the resonant RSP mode can support a non-evanescent longitudinal component with amplitude up to several TV/m-levels and a phase-matched focusing field. This field enables the sustained acceleration of relativistic electrons and positrons over long distances. We also investigate two possible mechanisms for electron injection, including edge injection and self-injection, both of which are feasible with current laser facilities, paving the way for experimental realisation. As well as highlighting a promising avenue for the development of ultra-compact, high-energy solid-state plasma particle accelerators, this work also opens up the potential for high-energy plasmonics.</description>
