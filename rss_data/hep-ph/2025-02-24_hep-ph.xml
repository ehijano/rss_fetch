      <title>One-Loop QCD Corrections to $\bar{u}d \rightarrow t\bar{t}W$ at $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computation of the one-loop QCD corrections to top-quark pair production in association with a $W$ boson, including terms up to order $\varepsilon^2$ in dimensional regularization. Providing a first glimpse into the complexity of the corresponding two-loop amplitude, this result is a first step towards a description of this process at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. We perform a tensor decomposition and express the corresponding form factors in terms of a basis of independent special functions with compact rational coefficients, providing a structured framework for future developments. In addition, we derive an explicit analytic representation of the form factors, valid up to order $\varepsilon^0$, expressed in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms. For the complete set of special functions required, we obtain a semi-numerical solution based on generalized power series expansion.</description>

      <title>Lepton Flavor Asymmetries: from the early Universe to BBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large primordial lepton flavor asymmetries with almost vanishing total baryon-minus-lepton number can evade the usual BBN and CMB constraints if neutrino oscillations lead to perfect flavor equilibration. Solving the momentum averaged quantum kinetic equations (QKEs) describing neutrino oscillations and interactions, we perform the first systematic investigation of this scenario, uncovering a rich flavor structure in stark contradiction to the assumption of simple flavor equilibration. We find (i) a particular direction in flavor space, $\Delta n_e \simeq -2/3 \, (-1) \Delta n_\mu$ for normal (inverted) neutrino mass hierarchy, in which the flavor equilibration is efficient and primordial asymmetries are essentially unconstrained, (ii) a minimal washout factor, $\Delta n_e^2|_\mathrm{BBN} \leq 0.03 \, (0.016) \sum_\alpha \Delta n_\alpha^2|_{\mathrm{ini}}$ yielding a conservative estimate for the allowed primordial asymmetries in a generic flavor direction, and (iii) particularly strong or weak washout if one of the initial flavor asymmetries vanishes due to non-adiabatic muon- or electron-driven MSW transitions. These results open up the possibility of a first-order QCD phase transition facilitated by large lepton asymmetries as well as baryogenesis from large and compensated $\Delta n_e =- \Delta n_\mu$ asymmetries. Our first-principles approach of deriving momentum averaged QKEs includes collision terms beyond the damping approximation, energy transfer between the neutrino and electron-photon plasma, and provides a fast and reliable way to investigate the impact of primordial lepton asymmetries at the time of BBN. We publicly release the Mathematica code COFLASY-M on GitHub which solves the QKEs numerically.</description>

      <title>Matter-Dark Matter Coincidence and Mirror World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why matter and dark matter contents of the universe are of the same order of magnitude, is one of the puzzles of modern cosmology. At the face of it, this would seem to point towards a basic similarity between matter and dark matter, suggesting perhaps the widely discussed mirror world picture as an ideal setting for a discussion of this issue. Here we outline a new and simple mirror world scenario to explain this puzzle. Our model uses Affleck-Dine mechanism to generate baryon asymmetry and dark matter relic density leading to an asymmetric dark matter picture. We find that for a certain parameter range of the model, the mirror electron is the unique possibility for dark matter whereas in the complementary parameter range, the mirror baryons constitute the dark matter. In either case, the mirror photon must have mass in the MeV range for consistency with observations. For the case of mirror electron dark matter, the model predicts a lower bound on the amount of dark radiation i.e. $\Delta N_{eff} \geq 0.007$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Collins-Soper kernel in inclusive DIS at threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the factorization of inclusive deep inelastic scattering near the kinematic threshold to explicitly track off-lightcone effects. Particle production develops around two opposite near-lightcone directions like in transverse-momentum-dependent processes, and the Collins-Soper kernel emerges as a universal function in the rapidity evolution of the relevant parton correlators. We clarify outstanding issues regarding soft radiation and rapidity divergences, and uncover a new way to calculate the Collins-Soper kernel on the lattice with collinear operators.</description>

      <title>Practical parametrization of two-pole structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest that the extended Lee-Friedrichs model could be directly used as a practical parametrization method for the experimental analysis of resonance structures. This parametrization incorporates the constraints of relativistic phase space and the threshold behavior, and respects both unitarity and analyticity constraints of the scattering amplitude. As such, the poles on unphysical Riemann sheets could be easily extracted. This parametrization method offers a comparable fit quality to the improved Breit-Wigner parametrization with an energy-dependent width function when the coupling strength is moderate. It is found that the parametrization could be used to correctly extract the poles near the physical region correctly. In particular, it can naturally incorporate the two-pole structure in which one pole is shifted from the discrete state and the other is dynamically generated. Moreover, the coupled-channel formulation of the extended Lee-Friedrichs parameterization is straightforward and its relationship with the Flatt\'{e} parametrization form is discussed. Using $\rho(770)$, $\Delta(1232)$, $K^*_0$ and $f_0$ states as illustrative examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this parametrization in capturing fit qualities and identifying relevant poles. It is illustrated that the $K_0^*(700)$ and $K_0^*(1430)$ could be perfectly parameterized in the Lee-Friedrichs form as a two-pole structure. A tentative investigation of $f_0$s in coupled-channel parametrization form are discussed, and a possible lineshape contributed by $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ and $\chi_{c1}(4012)$ is presented. The proposed parametrization scheme holds promise for future studies involving exotic hadron states near thresholds, offering a valuable tool for analyzing resonance structures in upcoming experimental investigations.</description>

      <title>Novel Search for absorption of ultra-light fermionic dark matter on electron with cosmic ray boost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for the absorption of fermionic dark matter (DM) on electron is hindered by a partial or complete loss of sensitivity for the mass of DM ($m_\chi$) below $\mathcal{O} (10)$ keV. We introduce a novel search using a small but high-energy portion of DM boosted by cosmic rays, and the loss of sensitivity is circumvented because the subsequent absorption within the detector imparts to the target electron not only $m_\chi$ but also substantial $T_\chi$. The one-sided 90\% confidence level constraints on ($\sigma_e v_\chi$) are derived with the XENONnT public dataset for $m_\chi$ $\in$ (1$\times$10$^{-5}$--1) keV which has not been explored yet. Our results have placed constraints on DM at the lowest $m_\chi$ currently achievable among the DMDD experiments utilizing ionizing signals from DM interactions within the detectors.</description>

      <title>Quasi parton distributions of pions at large longitudinal momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an approach to calculate the valence-quark quasi parton distribution amplitude (quasi-PDA) and quasi parton distribution function (quasi-PDF) for the pion with a large longitudinal momentum with the functional renormalization group (fRG). This is demonstrated in a low energy effective theory (LEFT) with four-quark scatterings. In the study of the complex structure of quasi-PDA, we introduce a deformed integration contour in the calculations of quasi-PDA or quasi-PDF, which allows us to obtain correct integrals for all momentum fractions. It is found that the pion light-front PDA extrapolated from quasi-PDA based on the large momentum effective theory (LaMET) in the LEFT is comparable with lattice QCD and Dyson-Schwinger equation. This work paves the way to study the PDA and PDF within the fRG approach to first-principles QCD.</description>

      <title>Bounds on variations of the strange quark mass from Big Bang nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of a variation of the strange nucleon matrix element $\langle N| m_s \bar{s}s|N\rangle$ on the abundances of the light elements produced in the Big Bang. For that, we vary the nucleon mass in the leading eight reactions that involve neutrons, protons and the four lightest nuclei. We use various available Big Bang nucleosynthesis codes and find that the measured deuterium and $^4$He abundances set strict limits on the nucleon mass variations. This translates into an upper bound of possible variations of the strange quark mass, $\left| \Delta m_s/m_s \right| \leq 5.1\%$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting gluon density from the BK equation with kinematical constraint and large x terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform analysis of the small x non-linear evolution equation formulated in momentum space supplemented by higher order terms. The equation is defined in wide range of transverse momentum and longitudinal momentum fraction extending previous studies performed in \cite{Kutak:2003bd,Kutak:2004ym}. The linear part of the equation is motivated by the renormalization group improved small x approach which accounts for resummation of higher orders, and includes collinear splitting function and kinematical constraint. The solution to the equation is then used to perform the fit to Deep Inelastic Scattering reduced cross section data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak radiative hyperon decays represent a rich interplay between weak interactions and the internal structure of baryons, offering profound insights into Quantum Chromodynamics and weak interactions. Recent experimental observations, particularly from BESIII, have revealed deviations from theoretical predictions. These deviations could signal new physics or the need for refined theoretical models incorporating intermediate resonance effects. This review discusses recent theoretical advancements and key experimental findings, focusing on recent measurements from BESIII and their implications for strong interactions and baryon structure.</description>

      <title>Spin precession and neutrino helicity flip in various spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically study spin precession of neutral particles freely moving in spacetime. We first derive the formula describing spin precession within a general stationary and axisymmetric spacetime. We then apply our formula to study spin precession of neutral spinning particles moving within various spacetimes that are among the most ubiquitous ones found in the literature. Our results are then used to extract the helicity flip probability for neutrinos propagating in each one of those selected spacetimes. It is found that low-energy neutrinos acquire a spin-flip probability that is as large as unity in all the spacetimes considered here. The remarkable result, however, is that while spin-flip probability for high-energy neutrinos remains insignificant in most of these spacetimes, some of them do allow spin-flip probability to reach unity even for high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>On the phenomenological implications of a Pati-Salam model spontaneously broken by Higgs fields in fundamental representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a supersymmetric Pati-Salam model with small representations as a potential candidate for physics beyond the Standard Model. The model features a Higgs sector with bifundamental fields $H_R+\bar H_R=(4,1,2)+(\bar 4,1,2)$, $H_L+\bar H_L=(4,2,1)+(\bar 4,2,1)$ as well as a pair of bi-doublet fields $h_a=(1,2,2)$ where $ a=1,2$, with three families of fermions accommodated in $ (4,2,1)+(\bar 4,1,2)$ as usual. The matter spectrum is augmented with three copies of neutral singlets that mix with ordinary neutrinos to realize the seesaw mechanism. The model introduces supersymmetric R-symmetry and a global discrete $\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry ($n &gt; 2$) that prevents disastrous superpotential couplings, while its spontaneous breaking implies the existence of domain walls that are successfully addressed. Interestingly, the one-loop beta coefficient of the $SU(4)_C$ gauge coupling is zero in the minimal $\mathbb{Z}_3$ model, rendering the corresponding gauge coupling near-conformal in the UV. Meanwhile, Landau poles are avoided up to the Planck scale and proton decay is suppressed, resulting in a proton lifetime beyond current experimental bounds. By virtue of the extended Higgs sector, the key advantage of this PS model is its ability to disentangle quark and lepton masses through higher-dimensional effective operators, addressing a common limitation in GUT models with small Higgs representations. This makes the model more economical and easier to be constructed from string theory, particularly in several heterotic and F-theory models where Higgses in the adjoint representation are absent.</description>

      <title>Critical Unstable Qubits: an Application to $B^0\bar{B}^0$-Meson System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our previous work on a novel class of unstable qubits which we have identified recently and called them Critical Unstable Qubits (CUQs). The characteristic property of CUQs is that the energy-level and decay-width vectors, ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf \Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the key parameter $r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/|2{\bf E}|$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, CUQs exhibit two atypical behaviours: (i) they display coherence-decoherence oscillations in a co-decaying frame of the system described by a unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$, and (ii) the unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$ describing a pure CUQ sweeps out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. The latter anharmonic phenomenon emerges beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system, which governs an ordinary qubit. By making use of a Fourier series decomposition, we define anharmonicity observables that quantify the degree of non-sinusoidal oscillation of a CUQ. We apply the results of our formalism to the $B^0\bar{B}^0$-meson system and derive, for the first time, generic upper limits on these new observables.</description>

Abstract: We present universal \emph{building blocks} for the quantum integration of generic cross sections in high-energy physics. We make use of Fourier Quantum Monte Carlo Integration as implemented in {\sc Quantinuum}'s Quantum Monte Carlo Integration engine to provide an extendable methodology for generating efficient circuits that can implement generic cross-section calculations, providing a quadratic speed-up in root mean-squared error convergence with respect to classical Monte Carlo integration. We focus on a concrete example of a $1\to 3$ decay process to illustrate our work.</description>

Abstract: Our present contribution sets out to investigate how combined effects of Lorentz-symmetry violation (LSV) and Loop-Quantum-Gravity(LQG)-modified photon dispersion relations affect the threshold anomaly of cosmic photons. The point of departure is the post-Maxwellian version of Electromagnetism induced by LQG effects. We then consider the problem of gamma-ray attenuation by the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) and the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation (CMB) dominated by the Breit-Wheeler Effect. By following this path, we aim at the establishment of a new bridge between LSV and astrophysical phenomena in the framework of LQG.</description>

      <title>The holographic space-time model of inflation and its predictions for the CMB primordial spectra</title>

Abstract: In 1998 Carlip and Solodukhin independently conjectured the equality between fluctuations in the modular Hamiltonian of black holes and its expectation value. Banks and Zurek's 2021 work generalized this observation to any causal diamonds. We use this observation to calculate the precise normalization of primordial scalar and tensor power spectra in the Holographic Space-time (HST) model of inflation. In previous work Banks and Fischler outlined the general calculation of inflationary power spectra in this model, which we review here. Its conceptual basis is radically different from field theoretic inflation and it has no Transplanckian problems, but its predictions for power spectra will be shown to fit extant data equally well, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio agrees with experimental observations.

      <title>Hadron Production in Open-charm Meson Pair at $e^+e^-$ Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard model of particle physics is a well-established theoretical framework, yet there remain several unresolved issues that warrant further experimental and theoretical exploration. In the realm of quark physics, these include understanding the nature of quark confinement and elucidating the mechanism linking quarks and gluons to strongly interacting particles within the standard model theory, which may offer insights into underlying physics mechanisms. These inquiries can be addressed through the study of hadron production in open-charm meson pair final states at $e^+e^-$ annihilations utilizing the capabilities of BABAR, Belle, BESIII, and CLEO-c experiments, which have yielded valuable insights into non-standard hadrons over recent decades. This review examines the contributions of $e^+e^-$ colliders from BABAR, Belle, BESIII, and CLEO-c experiments to such studies and discusses future prospects for $e^+e^-$ collider experiments.</description>

      <title>PhyLiNO -- A Forward-Folding Likelihood-Fit Framework for Neutrino Oscillation Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for the analysis of data from neutrino oscillation experiments. The framework performs a profile likelihood fit and employs a forward folding technique to optimize its model with respect to the oscillation parameters. It is capable of simultaneously handling multiple datasets from the same or different experiments and their correlations. The code of the framework is optimized for performance and allows for convergence times of a few seconds handling hundreds of fit parameters, thanks to multi-threading and usage of GPUs. The framework was developed in the context of the Double Chooz experiment, where it was successfully used to fit three- and four-flavor models to the data, as well as in the measurement of the energy spectrum of reactor neutrinos. We demonstrate its applicability to other experiments by applying it to a study of the oscillation analysis of a medium baseline reactor experiment similar to JUNO.</description>

      <title>Entropy correction and quasinormal modes of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter-like black hole in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the tunneling of fermion particle for Kerr-Newman-de Sitter-like (KNdS-like) black hole in bumblebee gravity model by applying the generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). The Hawking temperature of KNdS-like black hole has been modified under GUP. The quantum gravity effect reduces the rise of Hawking temperature of KNdS-like black hole. The modified Hawking temperature and the correction of black hole entropy are investigated by using the tunneling of fermion beyond the semiclassical approximation. We study the scalar field perturbation and effective potential of KNdS-like black hole in bumblebee gravity model by using Klein-G\"ordon equation. The quasinormal modes for scalar perturbation is investigated using WKB method and P\"oschl-Teller fitting method. The significant impact on the greybody factor, Hawking spectra and sparsity of Hawking radiation of the black hole are also studied in the presence of Lorentz violating parameter L.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter we first describe the early history of primordial black hole (PBH) research. We then discuss their possible formation mechanisms, including critical collapse from inflationary fluctuations and various types of phase transition. We next describe the numerous constraints on the number density of PBHs from various quantum and astrophysical processes. This was the main focus of research until recently but there is currently a shift of emphasis to the search for evidence for PBHs. We end by discussing this evidence, with particular emphasis on their role as dark matter candidates, sources of gravitational waves and seeds for supermassive black holes and early cosmic structures.</description>

      <title>Feynman integrals, elliptic integrals and two-parameter K3 surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The three-loop banana integral with three equal masses and the conformal two-loop five-point traintrack integral in two dimensions are related to a two-parameter family of K3 surfaces. We compute the corresponding periods and the mirror map, and we show that they can be expressed in terms of ordinary modular forms and functions. In particular, we find that the maximal cuts of the three-loop banana integral with three equal masses can be written as a product of two copies of the maximal cuts of the two-loop equal-mass sunrise integral. Our computation reveals a hidden symmetry of the banana integral not manifest from the Feynman integral representation, which corresponds to exchanging the two copies of the sunrise elliptic curve.</description>

      <title>Topological observables and $\theta$ dependence in high temperature QCD from lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study topology in Quantum Chromodynamics at high temperatures by means of lattice calculations. Simulations are performed with $N_f=2+1+1$ Wilson twisted mass fermions at maximal twist with physical quark masses, and temperatures $T~\gtrsim~180$ MeV. The results obtained with three lattice spacings ranging between $0.057$ and $0.080$ fm are extrapolated to the continuum limit. We compare the results for the topological susceptibility obtained with the field-theoretic definition with those obtained from an observable constructed with the disconnected part of the chiral susceptibility, and we confirm their agreement -- within the largish errors -- on our range of temperatures. We also study the topological charge distribution, the next order cumulant $b_2$ and, for the first time, the Free Energy as a function of the $\theta$ angle. We find a rapid crossover to the Dilute Instanton Gas behaviour above $ T \simeq 300$ MeV for all the observables we have considered.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission associated with the tail of a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15447v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of an unidentified point-like ultra-high-energy (UHE) $\gamma$-ray source, designated as 1LHAASO J1740+0948u, situated in the vicinity of the middle-aged pulsar PSR J1740+1000. The detection significance reached 17.1$\sigma$ (9.4$\sigma$) above 25$\,$TeV (100$\,$TeV). The source energy spectrum extended up to 300$\,$TeV, which was well fitted by a log-parabola function with $N0 = (1.93\pm0.23) \times 10^{-16} \rm{TeV^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-2}}$, $\alpha = 2.14\pm0.27$, and $\beta = 1.20\pm0.41$ at E0 = 30$\,$TeV. The associated pulsar, PSR J1740+1000, resides at a high galactic latitude and powers a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula (BSPWN) with an extended X-ray tail. The best-fit position of the gamma-ray source appeared to be shifted by $0.2^{\circ}$ with respect to the pulsar position. As the (i) currently identified pulsar halos do not demonstrate such offsets, and (ii) centroid of the gamma-ray emission is approximately located at the extension of the X-ray tail, we speculate that the UHE $\gamma$-ray emission may originate from re-accelerated electron/positron pairs that are advected away in the bow-shock tail.</description>

      <title>Implications of Photon Mass: Vortextrap Magnetization of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss certain astrophysical implications of the photon mass. It offers a new mechanism of black hole magnetization, described as ``vortextrap magnetization" (VTM), which can generate a near-saturated magnetic field in astrophysical black holes. The extreme magnetic field is provided by a large number of Nielsen-Olesen type vortex lines piercing a black hole. In massive photon scenario the galactic magnetic field is a densely populated forest of overlapping magnetic flux tubes. These get trapped and collected by a black hole over a cosmological time-scale. The VTM mechanism neatly fits supermassive black holes with sizes matching the phenomenologically-acceptable values of the photon mass, and has implications for magnetic-field based particle acceleration. Even in absence of surrounding plasma, the near-saturated magnetic field is expected to result into an intense electromagnetic radiation as well as gravitational waves in black hole mergers. We provide a numerical simulation of the VTM phenomenon in a prototype system.</description>

      <title>Projective imaging of high-energy nuclei through coherent exclusive vector meson production in electron-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15596v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the major goals of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is to better understand the distributions of quarks and gluons inside nuclei at high-energy. A principal measurement is coherent exclusive vector meson (VM) production in diffractive $eA$ collisions. The gluon spatial distribution inside the nucleus can be obtained through a Fourier transform of the nuclear momentum transfer ($|t|$) distribution for these VMs. However, the $|t|$ distribution is one of the most challenging measurements at the EIC. This research aims to overcome one of the main obstacles in this measurement: limited precision in measuring $|t|$, making it difficult to resolve the diffractive pattern from coherent events. We employ a method for reconstructing $|t|$ by utilizing the electron beam polarization in $eA$ collisions and measuring the projected $|t|$ distribution to overcome this complication. Through the study of diffractive VM production, we carry out an experimental simulation of how the detector effect would change the extracted nuclear geometry and how to use projective techniques to avoid defects. This technique will allow us to measure the diffractive pattern in coherent events more precisely, providing a potential solution for a critical measurement that is difficult for the EIC baseline detector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a generalized determinant as a function of $N$ distinct $N \times N$ complex matrices into a complex number. This function, originally introduced in the study of the chiral anomaly in QCD (PRD 97 (2018) 9, 091901 PRD 109 (2024) 7, L071502), in particular in connections to mesons, reduces to the usual determinant when all the matrices are taken as equal. Hence, we denote it as `polydeterminant'. Here, we explore its main algebraic properties as well as its geometric interpretation in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The master equation of the Proca field in the Schwarzschild spacetime is studied by using the Seiberg-Witten/quasinormal modes duality. We establish the dictionary between the parameters in gauge and gravity theories, since both sides lead to Heun-type equations. Applying the technique of instanton counting, we analytically find the eigenfrequencies of the quasinormal modes and quasi-bound states for massive vector fields around black holes, with the boundary conditions linked by the connection formula. The results show consistency with known numerical researches in the literature.</description>

      <title>Radiative Corrections to Light Thermal Pseudo-Dirac Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light thermal dark matter has emerged as an attractive theoretical possibility and a promising target for discovery at experiments in the near future. Such scenarios generically invoke mediators with very small couplings to the Standard Model, but moderately strong couplings within the dark sector, calling into question theoretical estimates based on the lowest order of perturbation theory. As an example, we focus on a scenario in which (pseudo)-Dirac fermion dark matter is connected to the standard model via a dark photon charged under a new $U(1)^{\prime}$ extension of the standard model, and we investigate the impact of the next-to-leading order corrections to annihilation and scattering. We find that radiative corrections can significantly impact model predictions for the relic density and scattering cross-section, depending on the strength of the dark sector coupling and ratio of the dark matter to mediator mass. We also show why factorization into the yield parameter $Y$ typically presented in literature leads to imprecision. Our results are necessary to accurately map experimental searches into the model parameter space and assess their ability to reach thermal production targets.</description>

      <title>Determination of Strong Coupling Constant from Inclusive Semileptonic Decays of Charmed Mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16119v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the heavy quark expansion model with the kinetic scheme, we evaluate $\alpha_S(m_c^2)$, the strong coupling constant at the charm quark mass $m_c$ with data on inclusive semileptonic decays of charmed mesons. Using the experimental values of semileptonic decay widths of the $D^0$ and the $D^+$, the value of $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ is determined to be $0.445\pm0.009\pm0.114$, where the first uncertainty is experimental and the second systematic. This reported $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ is in good agreement with the value of $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ calculated by running $\alpha_S(m_Z^2)$ at the $Z^0$ boson mass $m_Z$ with the renormalization group evolution equation. In addition, values of $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ obtained individually from each of the $D^0$, $D^+$, and $D_s^+$ mesons are found to be consistent being of the same origin.</description>

      <title>Fractionally Charged Particles at the Energy Frontier: The SM Gauge Group and One-Form Global Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed Standard Model is consistent with the existence of vector-like species with electric charge a multiple of $e/6$. The discovery of a fractionally charged particle would provide nonperturbative information about Standard Model physics, and furthermore rule out some or all of the minimal theories of unification. We discuss the phenomenology of such particles and focus particularly on current LHC constraints, for which we reinterpret various searches to bound a variety of fractionally charged representations. We emphasize that in some circumstances the collider bounds are surprisingly low or nonexistent, which highlights the discovery potential for these species which have distinctive signatures and important implications. We additionally offer pedagogical discussions of the representation theory of gauge groups with different global structures, and separately of the modern framework of Generalized Global Symmetries, either of which serves to underscore the bottom-up importance of these searches.</description>

Abstract: We resum threshold double logarithms that appear in inclusive production of heavy quarkonium. This resolves the catastrophic failure of fixed-order perturbation theory where quarkonium cross sections at large transverse momentum can turn negative due to large radiative corrections. We find that resummation is imperative for describing measured prompt production rates of $J/\psi$ at large transverse momentum.</description>

Abstract: After reviewing the sound speeds in various forms and conditions of matter, we investigate the sound speed of hadronic matter that has decoupled from the hot and dense system formed during high-energy collisions. We comprehensively consider factors such as energy loss of the incident beam, rapidity shift of leading nucleons, and the Landau hydrodynamic model for hadron production. The sound speed is related to the width or standard deviation of the Gaussian rapidity distribution of hadrons. The extracted square speed of sound lies within a range from 0 to 1/3 in most cases. For scenarios exceeding this limit, we also provide an explanation.</description>

      <title>Implementation and investigation of electron-nucleus scattering in the \textsc{NEUT} neutrino event generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding nuclear effects is essential for improving the sensitivity of neutrino oscillation measurements. Validating nuclear models solely through neutrino scattering data is challenging due to limited statistics and the broad energy spectrum of neutrinos. In contrast, electron scattering experiments provide abundant high-precision data with various monochromatic energies and angles. Since both neutrinos and electrons interact via electroweak interactions, the same nuclear models can be applied to simulate both interactions. Thus, high-precision electron scattering data is essential for validating the nuclear models used in neutrino experiments. To enable this, the author has introduced a new electron scattering framework in the \textsc{NEUT} neutrino event generator, covering two interaction modes: quasielastic (QE) and single pion production. \textsc{NEUT} predictions of QE agree well with numerical calculations, supporting the validity of this implementation. From comparisons with \textsc{NEUT} predictions and inclusive electron scattering data, the momentum-dependent removal energy correction is derived, addressing effects beyond the plane wave impulse approximation. This correction is applied to neutrino interactions, observing significant changes in charged lepton kinematics. Notably, the reconstructed neutrino energy distribution shows a peak shift of approximately 20--30\,MeV, which is crucial for accurately measuring neutrino oscillation parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Similar to the covalent bond in chemical molecules induced by shared electrons, we proposed in [Commun. Theor. Phys. 74 (2022) 125201] the hadronic covalent bond induced by shared light quarks to explain the $T_{cc}(3875)$ and the deuteron. In this paper we improve and extend this mechanism to explain the $Z_c(3900)$, which is bound by the shared light quark-antiquark pair along with sea quark-antiquark pairs from the vacuum. Our analysis is based on the following forward and backward reasoning: a hadronic molecule exists, iff the attraction between its components is strong enough, iff the wave functions of its components significantly overlap with each other, iff the Pauli principle is well satisfied among all the shared quarks and antiquarks. Additionally, the $X(3872)$ is so unique that we need to further consider the annihilation of the shared light quark-antiquark pair, just in line with the reasoning that the production and annihilation of sea quark-antiquark pairs should be given equal consideration. Both the production and annihilation molecular bonds exist only in the strong interaction, not in the electromagnetic interaction, and they provide a quasi-static low-energy platform for studying the QCD confinement.</description>

      <title>Topological Sum Rules and Spectral Flows of Chiral and Gravitational Axion-like Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the structure of off-shell effective actions arising from chiral and gravitational anomalies, focusing on the $JJJ_A$ (axial-vector/vector/vector) and $J_A TT $ (axial-vector/stress-energy tensors) correlators, relevant in the analysis of anomaly-driven interactions in perturbation theory. Our approach relies on conformal field theory in momentum space, extended to chiral anomalies. The analysis centers on the presence of both particle poles and anomaly poles within these interactions, characterizing their behavior both in the conformal and non conformal limits. Through explicit computations, we show that universal sum rules in the longitudinal sector regulate these interactions for all kinematic conditions, extending previous analysis, and we discuss the resulting spectral flow, an area law of the absorptive part of the anomaly form factors as one moves away from or returns to the conformal point. These features are absent in the local effective action of anomaly interactions, commonly used in the description of axion-like particles. The spectral densities in both cases are shown to be self-similar. Our results further show that anomaly poles correspond to true particle poles only in the conformal limit, when the interaction describes a massless S-matrix process supported on a null-surface. Under these conditions, they can be effectively described by two kinetically mixed pseudoscalar fields propagating on the light-cone. These studies find application in polarized deeply inelastic scattering, axion-like dark matter and analogue systems such as topological materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03219v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate quantum correlations in Higgs-boson decays $\bigl(H \rightarrow ZZ^* \rightarrow 2e\,2\mu\bigr)$ using CMS open data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV, incorporating realistic detector effects. By reconstructing the polarization density matrix of the two-boson system and evaluating the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP) Bell operator $I_3$, we quantify entanglement in the $ZZ$ state. Our analysis yields an $I_3$ value of $2.152 \pm 0.003$ for signal events $\bigl(H \rightarrow ZZ^*\bigr)$, indicating the presence of quantum entanglement. The non-resonant continuum background events $\bigl(pp \rightarrow ZZ\bigr)$ yield $I_3 = 1.158 \pm 0.012$, suggesting the absence of quantum correlations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of testing fundamental quantum mechanics at high energy colliders.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Effective Field Theory of Stochastic Single Field Inflation at NNNLO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications.

      <title>Ab initio calculation of hyper-neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>

      <title>$1/N$ Corrections in $\text{QCD}_2$: Small Mass Limit and Threshold States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate $1/N$ corrections to mesonic spectrum in $1+1$-dimensional Quantum Chromodynamics ($\text{QCD}_2$) with fundamental quarks using effective Hamiltonian method. We express the corrections in terms of 't Hooft equation solutions. First, we consider 2-flavor model with a heavy and a light quark. We show that, in contrast to some claims in earlier literature, the $1/N$ correction to the mass of the heavy-light meson remains finite when the light quark mass is taken to zero. Nevertheless, the corrections become significantly larger in this limit; we attribute this to the presence of massless modes in the spectrum. We also study the corrections to the lightest meson mass in 1-flavor model and show that they are consistent with recent numerical data, but not with the prediction coming from bosonization. Then we study low energy effective theory for 2 flavors. We show that the 3-meson interaction vertex correctly reproduces Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) coupling when both quarks become massless. This coupling does not change even if one of the quarks is massive. We employ Discretized Light Cone Quatization (DLCQ) to check the continuum results and show that the improved version can be used for small quark mass. Finally, we study the states associated with $1\to 2$ meson thresholds. Using degenerate perturbation theory, we show that when the decay is allowed by parity, the infinite $N$ theory has near-threshold bound states that mix one- and two-meson parts. They are $1/3$ two-meson and $2/3$ one-meson and the corrections to their masses have unusual scaling $\sim 1/N^{2/3}$.</description>

      <title>Qutrit and Qubit Circuits for Three-Flavor Collective Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the utility of qutrits and qubits for simulating the flavor dynamics of dense neutrino systems. The evolution of such systems impacts some important astrophysical processes, such as core-collapse supernovae and the nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei. Many-body simulations require classical resources beyond current computing capabilities for physically relevant system sizes. Quantum computers are therefore a promising candidate to efficiently simulate the many-body dynamics of collective neutrino oscillations. Previous quantum simulation efforts have primarily focused on properties of the two-flavor approximation due to their direct mapping to qubits. Here, we present new quantum circuits for simulating three-flavor neutrino systems on qutrit- and qubit-based platforms, and demonstrate their feasibility by simulating systems of two, four and eight neutrinos on IBM and Quantinuum quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Photon Ring Dimming as a Signature of Photon-Axion Conversion in Janis-Newman-Winicour Naked Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possible existence of axions in the universe introduces the intriguing possibility of photon-axion conversion in strong magnetic fields, particularly near compact objects like supermassive black holes or even naked singularity. In this study, we investigate the conversion of photons into axions in the vicinity of a Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) spacetime, a well-known naked singularity solution. Our analysis reveals that photons can efficiently convert into axions with masses less than $100 \rm \ neV$. We calculate the conversion probability and find that it is significantly influenced by the characteristic parameter of the JNW spacetime. The potential observational signatures of this conversion, would be the dimming of photon ring in the X-ray and gamma-ray spectrum. Our findings suggest that compact objects like M87* could be prime candidates for detecting photon-axion conversion effects, provided future advances in high-resolution observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves and Black Hole perturbations in Acoustic Analogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonons in Bose-Einstein condensates propagate as massless scalar particles on top of an emergent acoustic metric. This hydrodynamics/gravity analogy can be exploited to realize acoustic black holes, featuring an event horizon that traps phonons. We show that by an appropriate external potential, gravitational wave-like perturbations of the acoustic metric can be produced. Such perturbations can be used to excite an acoustic black hole, which should then relax by phonon emission.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in halos of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the (axial) quasinormal modes of black holes embedded in generic matter profiles. Our results reveal that the axial QNMs experience a redshift when the black hole is surrounded by various matter environments, proportional to the compactness of the matter halo. Our calculations demonstrate that for static black holes embedded in galactic matter distributions, there exists a universal relation between the matter environment and the redshifted vacuum quasinormal modes. In particular, for dilute environments the leading order effect is a redshift $1+U$ of frequencies and damping times, with $U \sim -{\cal C}$ the Newtonian potential of the environment at its center, which scales with its compactness ${\cal C}$.</description>
