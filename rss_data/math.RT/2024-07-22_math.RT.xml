      <title>Cohomology of the Bruhat-Tits strata in the supersingular locus of the $\mathrm{GU}(1,n-1)$ Shimura variety at a ramified prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supersingular locus of the $\mathrm{GU}(1,n-1)$ Shimura variety at a ramified prime $p$ is stratified by Coxeter varieties attached to finite symplectic groups. In this paper, we compute the $\ell$-adic cohomology of the Zariski closure of any such stratum. These are known as closed Bruhat-Tits strata. We prove that the cohomology groups of odd degree vanish, and those of even degree are explicitely determined as representations of the symplectic group with a Frobenius action. Each closed Bruhat-Tits stratum is linearly stratified by Coxeter varieties attached to smaller symplectic groups. Thanks to results of Lusztig who computed the cohomology of Coxeter varieties for classical groups, we make use of the spectral sequence associated to this stratification and describe explicitely all the terms at infinity. We point out that the closed Bruhat-Tits strata have isolated singularities when the dimension is greater than 1. Our analysis requires discussing the smoothness of the blow-up at the singular points, as well as comparing the ordinary $\ell$-adic cohomology with intersection cohomology. A by-product of our computations is that these two cohomologies actually coincide, so that surprisingly the presence of singularities does not interfere with the cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a finite field and $G=\GL(2n,F)$. In this paper, we calculate the dimension of the twisted Jacquet module $\pi_{N,\psi_{A}}$ where $A\in \M(n,F)$ is a rank $k$ matrix and $\pi$ is an irreducible cuspidal representation of $G$.</description>

      <title>Disconnected Cliques in Derangement Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain a correspondence between pairs of $N\times N$ orthogonal Latin squares and pairs of disconnected maximal cliques in the derangement graph with $N$ symbols. Motivated by methods in spectral clustering, we also obtain modular conditions on fixed point counts of certain permutation sums for the existence of collections of mutually disconnected maximal cliques. We use these modular obstructions to analyze the structure of maximal cliques in $X_N$ for small values of $N$. We culminate in a short, elementary proof of the nonexistence of a solution to Euler's $36$ Officer Problem.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Lewis-Reiner-Stanton conjecture for the Borel subgroup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each parabolic subgroup $P$ of the general linear group $GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$, a conjecture due to Lewis, Reiner and Stanton \cite{LewisReinerStanton2017} predicts a formula for the Hilbert series of the space of invariants $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)^{P}$ where $\mathcal{Q}_m(n)$ is the quotient ring $\mathbb{F}_q[x_1,\ldots,x_n]/(x_1^{q^m},\ldots,x_n^{q^m})$. In this paper, we prove the conjecture for the Borel subgroup $B$ by constructing a linear basis for $mathcal{Q}_m(n)^B$. The construction is based on an operator $\delta$ which produces new invariants from old invariants of lower ranks. We also upgrade the conjecture of Lewis, Reiner and Stanton by proposing an explicit basis for the space of invariants for each parabolic subgroup.</description>

      <title>Almost commuting scheme of symplectic matrices and quantum Hamiltonian reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Losev introduced the scheme $X$ of almost commuting elements (i.e., elements commuting upto a rank one element) of $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sp}(V)$ for a symplectic vector space $V$ and discussed its algebro-geometric properties. We construct a Lagrangian subscheme $X^{nil}$ of $X$ and show that it is a complete intersection of dimension $\text{dim}(\mathfrak{g})+\frac{1}{2}\text{dim}(V)$ and compute its irreducible components.
  We also study the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the algebra $\mathcal{D}(\mathfrak{g})$ of differential operators on the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ tensored with the Weyl algebra with respect to the action of the symplectic group, and show that it is isomorphic to the spherical subalgebra of a certain rational Cherednik algebra of Type $C$.</description>

      <title>A Jordan-Chevalley decomposition beyond algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.02637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a decomposition of definable groups in o-minimal structures generalizing the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of linear algebraic groups. It follows that any definable linear group G is a semidirect product of its maximal normal definable torsion-free subgroup N(G) and a definable subgroup P, unique up to conjugacy, definably isomorphic to a semialgebraic group.
  Along the way, we establish two other fundamental decompositions of classical groups in arbitrary o-minimal structures: 1) a Levi decomposition and 2) a key decomposition of disconnected groups, relying on a generalization of Frattini's argument to the o-minimal setting. In o-minimal structures, together with p-groups, 0-groups play a crucial role. We give a characterization of both classes and show that definable p-groups are solvable, like finite p-groups, but they are not necessarily nilpotent. Furthermore, we prove that definable p-groups (p=0 or p prime) are definably generated by torsion elements and, in definably connected groups, 0-Sylow subgroups coincide with p-Sylow subgroups for each p prime.</description>

      <title>Crepant resolutions of stratified varieties via gluing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07539v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a variety with a stratification $\mathcal{S}$ into smooth locally closed subvarieties such that $X$ is locally a product along each stratum (e.g., a symplectic singularity). We prove that assigning to each open subset $U \subset X$ the set of isomorphism classes of locally projective crepant resolutions of $U$ defines an $\mathcal{S}$-constructible sheaf of sets. Thus, for each stratum $S$ and basepoint $s \in S$, the fundamental group acts on the set of germs of projective crepant resolutions at $s$, leaving invariant the germs extending to the entire stratum. Global locally projective crepant resolutions correspond to compatible such choices for all strata. For example, if the local projective crepant resolutions are unique, they automatically glue uniquely.
  We give criteria for a locally projective crepant resolution $\rho: \tilde X \to X$ to be globally projective. We show that the sheafification of the presheaf $U \mapsto \text{Pic}(\rho^{-1}(U)/U)$ of relative Picard classes is also constructible. The resolution is globally projective only if there exist local relatively ample bundles whose classes glue to a global section of this sheaf. The obstruction to lifting this section to a global ample line bundle is encoded by a gerbe on the singularity $X$. We show the gerbes are automatically trivial if $X$ is a symplectic quotient singularity. Our main results hold in the more general setting of partial crepant resolutions, that need not have smooth source. We apply the theory to symmetric powers and Hilbert schemes of surfaces with du Val singularities, finite quotients of tori, multiplicative and Nakajima quiver varieties, as well as to canonical threefold singularities.</description>
