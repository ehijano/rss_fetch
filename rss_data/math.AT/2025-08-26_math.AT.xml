      <title>Graphs arising from the dual Steenrod algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Wood's graph theoretic interpretation of certain quotients of the mod $2$ dual Steenrod algebra to quotients of the mod $p$ dual Steenrod algebra where $p$ is an odd prime and to quotients of the $C_2$-equivariant dual Steenrod algebra. We establish connectedness criteria for graphs associated to monomials in these algebra quotients and investigate questions about trees and Hamilton cycles in these settings. We also give graph theoretic interpretations of algebraic structures such as the coproduct and antipode arising from the Hopf algebra structure on the mod $p$ dual Steenrod algebra and the Hopf algebroid structure of the $C_2$-equivariant dual Steenrod algebra.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of parametrized motion planning algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a probabilistic variant of the r-th sequential parametrized topological complexity, which bounds this classical invariant from below and measures the difficulty in constructing permissive parametrized motion planning algorithms. On one hand, we use cohomology to show that this new invariant behaves similarly to the classical invariant on Fadell-Neuwirth fibrations and oriented sphere bundles; on the other hand, we use equivariant homotopy theory to prove that its behavior is wildly different on bundles whose fibers are real projective spaces and whose structure groups are special orthogonal groups. We also explore several other features of our invariant and its relationships with various other invariants motivated by topological robotics.</description>

      <title>How to build a Hopf algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a functor that inputs a retract in an $(\infty,3)$-category satisfying some adjunctibility conditions and outputs a Hopf algebra in a braided monoidal $(\infty,1)$-category. Provided the braided monoidal category is presentable, any Hopf algebra can be obtained in this way. Our functor specializes to - and provides a higher-categorical explanation for - the Tannakian reconstruction of a Hopf algebra from a monoidal category with duals and a fiber functor.
  Towards this end, we review and develop the lax (aka Gray) tensor product $\otimes$ of $(\infty,\infty)$-categories, and we analyze the "lax smash product" of pointed $(\infty,\infty)$-categories. We compute the lax-$\wedge$-square of the "walking adjunction" and show that its $3$-localization corepresents retracts with some adjunctibilty conditions, whereas the $3$-localization of the "walking monad" corepresents bialgebras. In these terms, our functor is restriction along the lax-$\wedge$-square of the inclusion $\{\text{walking monad}\} \to \{\text{walking adjunction}\}$. After $3$-localization, we show that this restriction inverts a certain shear map, proving the existence of an antipode.
  We discuss generalizations of this construction to Hopf monads, analyze additional adjunctibility conditions and their interplay with integrals and cointegrals, and finally explain how variants of classical Tannakian reconstruction fit into our scheme.</description>

      <title>The Balmer spectrum of pseudo-coherent complexes over a discrete valuation ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the derived category of pseudo-coherent complexes over a noetherian commutative ring, building on prior work by Matsui-Takahashi. Our main theorem is a computation of the Balmer spectrum of this category in the case of a discrete valuation ring. We prove that it coincides with the spectral space associated to a bounded distributive lattice of asymptotic equivalence classes of monotonic sequences of natural numbers. The proof of this theorem involves an extensive study of generation behaviour in the derived category of pseudo-coherent complexes. We find that different types of generation are related to different asymptotic boundedness conditions on the growth of torsion in homology. Consequently, we introduce certain distributive lattices of (equivalence classes of) monotonic sequences where the partial orders are defined by different notions of asymptotic boundedness. These lattices, and the spectral spaces corresponding to them via Stone duality, may be of independent interest. The complexity of these spectral spaces shows that, even in the simplest nontrivial case, the spectrum of pseudo-coherent complexes is vastly more complicated than the spectrum of perfect complexes. From a broader perspective, these results demonstrate that the spectrum of a rigid tensor-triangulated category can expand tremendously when we pass to a (non-rigid) tensor-triangulated category which contains it.</description>

      <title>Idempotents and homology of diagram algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematization of some recent results in homology of algebras. Our main theorem gives criteria under which the homology of a diagram algebra is isomorphic to the homology of the subalgebra on diagrams having the maximum number of left-to-right connections. From this theorem, we deduce the `invertible-parameter' cases of the Temperley-Lieb and Brauer results of Boyd-Hepworth and Boyd-Hepworth-Patzt. We are also able to give a new proof of Sroka's theorem that the homology of an odd-strand Temperley-Lieb algebra vanishes, as well as an analogous result for Brauer algebras and an interpretation of both results in the even-strand case. Our proofs are relatively elementary: in particular, no auxiliary chain complexes or spectral sequences are required. We briefly discuss the relationship to cellular algebras in the sense of Graham-Lehrer.</description>

      <title>Stable homology isomorphisms for the partition and Jones annular algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the homology of the Jones annular algebras is isomorphic to that of the cyclic groups below a line of gradient $\frac{1}{2}$. We also show that the homology of the partition algebras is isomorphic to that of the symmetric groups below a line of gradient 1, strengthening a result of Boyd-Hepworth-Patzt. Both isomorphisms hold in a range exceeding the stability range of the algebras in question. Along the way, we prove the usual odd-strand and invertible parameter results for the Jones annular algebras.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of Symplectic Vector Bundles and Azumaya Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a connected CW complex. Let $\mathcal{V}$ be a symplectic vector bundle of rank $2mn$ over $X$, and let $\mathcal{A}$ be a topological Azumaya algebra of degree $2mn$ with a symplectic involution over a $X$. We give conditions for the positive integers $m$ and $n$, and the dimension of $X$ so that $\mathcal{V}$ can be decomposed as the tensor product of a symplectic vector bundle of rank $2m$ and an orthogonal vector bundle of rank $n$; and so that $\mathcal{A}$ can be decomposed as the tensor product of topological Azumaya algebras of degrees $2m$ and $n$ with involutions of the first kind.</description>

      <title>Axiomatic Sectional category, Topological complexity, and Homotopic distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06969v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many of the properties of sectional category, topological complexity and homotopic distance are in fact derived from a small number of basic properties, which, once established, lead to all the others without further recourse to topology. On the other hand, there are several variants of these notions: with open covers or else Whitehead-Ganea constructions, also with spaces and maps that are unpointed or else pointed, fibrewise, equivariant, etc. or even with algebraic models of spaces and maps. These are two reasons why we build an axiomatic approach to all these notions, based on just three simple axioms. We also introduce the notion of `lifting category' which unifies the notions of sectional category, topological complexity, and homotopic distance, all of which are special cases of lifting category.</description>

      <title>A discrete wedge product on general polygonal meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14275v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete exterior calculus offers a coordinate-free discretization of exterior calculus especially suited for computations on curved spaces. In this work, we present a wedge product on 2-dimensional pseudomanifolds, whose faces are any polygons. We prove that this polygonal wedge product is compatible with the discrete exterior derivative in the sense that it satisfies the Leibniz product rule. We thus extend previously studied discretizations of wedge products from simplicial or quadrilateral meshes to surface meshes whose faces are arbitrary simple polygons. We also prove that our discrete wedge product corresponds to a cup product of cochains on 2-pseudomanifolds. By rigorously justifying our construction we add another piece to ever evolving discrete versions of exterior calculus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the notion of short natural directed path, we introduce the homotopy branching space of a precubical set. It is unique only up to homotopy equivalence. We prove that, for any precubical set, it is homotopy equivalent to the branching space of any q-realization, any m-realization and any h-realization of the precubical set as a flow. As an application, we deduce the invariance of the homotopy branching space and of the branching homology up to cubical subdivision. By reversing the time direction, the same results are obtained for the merging space and the merging homology of a precubical set.</description>

      <title>Odd fake $\mathbb{Q}$ -homology quadrics exist</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the existence of odd fake $\mathbb{Q}$-homology quadrics, namely of minimal surfaces $S$ of general type which have the same $\mathbb{Q}$-homology as a smooth quadric $Q \cong (\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{C}))^2$, but have an odd intersection form on $ H^2(S, \mathbb{Z})/Tors(S)$, where $Tors(S)$ is the Torsion subgroup.
  Our examples are provided by a special 1-dimensional family of surfaces isogenous to a product of unmixed type.</description>

      <title>Topological potentials guiding protein self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simulated self-assembly of molecular building blocks into functional complexes is a key area of study in computational biology and materials science. Self-assembly simulations of proteins, driven by short-range non-polar interactions, can find the biologically correct assembly as the energy minimizing state. Short-ranged potentials produce rugged energy landscapes however, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional, local minimizers.
  Successful self-assembly simulations depend both on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space.
  We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy. This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales.
  Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes.</description>
