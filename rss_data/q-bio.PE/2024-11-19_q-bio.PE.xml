      <title>Emergent kin selection of altruistic feeding via non-episodic neuroevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kin selection theory has proven to be a popular and widely accepted account of how altruistic behaviour can evolve under natural selection. Hamilton's rule, first published in 1964, has since been experimentally validated across a range of different species and social behaviours. In contrast to this large body of work in natural populations, however, there has been relatively little study of kin selection \emph{in silico}. In the current work, we offer what is to our knowledge the first demonstration of kin selection emerging naturally within a population of agents undergoing continuous neuroevolution. Specifically, we find that zero-sum transfer of resources from parents to their infant offspring evolves through kin selection in environments where it is hard for offspring to survive alone. In an additional experiment, we show that kin selection in our simulations relies on a combination of kin recognition and population viscosity. We believe that our work may contribute to the understanding of kin selection in minimal evolutionary systems, without explicit notions of genes and fitness maximisation.</description>

      <title>The role of inducible defence in ecological models: Effects of nonlocal intraspecific competitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phenotypic plasticity is a key factor in driving the evolution of species in the predator-prey interaction. The natural environment is replete with phenotypic plasticity, which is the source of inducible defences against predators, including concealment, cave-dwelling, mimicry, evasion, and revenge. In this work, a predator-prey model is proposed where the prey species shows inducible defence against their predators. The dynamics produce a wide range of non-trivial and impactful results, including the stabilizing effect of the defence mechanism. The model is also analyzed in the presence of spatio-temporal diffusion in a bounded domain. It is found in the numerical simulation that the Turing domain shrinks with the increase of defence level. The work is extended further by introducing a nonlocal term in the intra-specific competition of the prey species. The Turing instability condition has been studied for the local model around the coexisting steady state, followed by the Turing and non-Turing patterns in the presence of the nonlocal interaction term. The work reveals how an increase in inducible defence reduces the Turing domain in the local interaction model but expands it when the range of nonlocal interactions is extended, suggesting a higher likelihood of species colonization.</description>

      <title>Random walk models in the life sciences: including births, deaths and local interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random walks and related spatial stochastic models have been used in a range of application areas including animal and plant ecology, infectious disease epidemiology, developmental biology, wound healing, and oncology. Classical random walk models assume that all individuals in a population behave independently, ignoring local physical and biological interactions. This assumption simplifies the mathematical description of the population considerably, enabling continuum-limit descriptions to be derived and used in model analysis and fitting. However, interactions between individuals can have a crucial impact on population-level behaviour. In recent decades, research has increasingly been directed towards models that include interactions, including physical crowding effects and local biological processes such as adhesion, competition, dispersal, predation and adaptive directional bias. In this article, we review the progress that has been made with models of interacting individuals. We aim to provide an overview that is accessible to researchers in application areas, as well as to specialist modellers. We focus particularly on derivation of asymptotically exact or approximate continuum-limit descriptions and simplified deterministic models of mean-field behaviour and resulting spatial patterns. We provide worked examples and illustrative results of selected models. We conclude with a discussion of current areas of focus and future challenges.</description>

      <title>Phase transition to coexistence in transposon populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transposons are tiny intragenomic parasites found in every branch of life. Often, one transposon will hyperparasitize another, forming an intracellular ecosystem. In some species these ecosystems thrive, while in others they go extinct, yet little is known about when or why this occurs. Here, we present a stochastic model for these ecosystems and discover a dynamical phase transition from stable coexistence to population collapse when the propensity for a transposon to replicate comes to exceed that of its hyperparasites. Our model also predicts that replication rates should be low in equilibrium, which appears to be true of many transposons in nature.</description>

      <title>Relating dynamics and structure of discrete and continuous time systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many instances, in subjects such as biology, where a population number, or related quantity, changes in discrete time. For the population number at time $n=0,1,2,\ldots$, written $x_{n}$, we show that some exactly soluble cases of $x_{n}$ can be related to a different problem, where the number of individuals changes in continuous time. With $x(t)$ the population number at continuous time $t\geq0$, the relation is that $x(t=n)$ precisely coincides with $x_{n}$. In such a case, we call the two models 'equivalent', even though $x_{n}$ obeys a difference equation and $x(t)$ obeys a differential equation. Cases of equivalence can be found for both time homogeneous and time inhomogeneous equations.
  A comparison of the difference equation and the differential equation of the equivalent problem, allows us to make a correspondence between coefficients in these equations, thereby exposing structural similarities and differences of the two problems.
  When the equation that $x_{n}$ obeys is modified, e.g., by the introduction of time inhomogeneity, so $x_{n}$ has no exact solution, we show how to construct an approximate equivalent continuous time solution, $x^{(\mathrm{app})}(t)$. We find that $x^{(\mathrm{app})}(t=n)$ can yield a good approximation to $x_{n}$ because $x^{(\mathrm{app})}(t)$ encapsulates much of the behaviour of $x_{n}$.
  We note that some discrete time problems may have solutions with an oscillatory component that changes sign as $n\rightarrow n+1$. This occurs with the Fibonacci numbers. We find that the way an equivalent continuous time solution replicates this oscillatory behaviour is by becoming complex; it no longer represents a simple interpolation.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning in Group Social Dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful machine learning technique that has been successfully applied to a wide variety of problems. However, it can be unpredictable and produce suboptimal results in complicated learning environments. This is especially true when multiple agents learn simultaneously, which creates a complex system that is often analytically intractable. Our work considers the fundamental framework of Q-learning in Public Goods Games, where RL individuals must work together to achieve a common goal. This setting allows us to study the tragedy of the commons and free rider effects in AI cooperation, an emerging field with potential to resolve challenging obstacles to the wider application of artificial intelligence. While this social dilemma has been mainly investigated through traditional and evolutionary game theory, our approach bridges the gap between these two by studying agents with an intermediate level of intelligence. Specifically, we consider the influence of learning parameters on cooperation levels in simulations and a limiting system of differential equations, as well as the effect of evolutionary pressures on exploration rate in both of these models. We find selection for higher and lower levels of exploration, as well as attracting values, and a condition that separates these in a restricted class of games. Our work enhances the theoretical understanding of evolutionary Q-learning, and extends our knowledge of the evolution of machine behavior in social dilemmas.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Infectious Disease Prediction and Prevention: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and infectious diseases prediction have recently experienced a common development and advancement. Machine learning (ML) apparition, along with deep learning (DL) emergence, extended many approaches against diseases apparition and their spread. And despite their outstanding results in predicting infectious diseases, conflicts appeared regarding the types of data used and how they can be studied, analyzed, and exploited using various emerging methods. This has led to some ongoing discussions in the field. This research aims not only to provide an overview of what has been accomplished, but also to highlight the difficulties related to the types of data used, and the learning methods applied for each research objective. It categorizes these contributions into three areas: predictions using Public Health Data to prevent the spread of a transmissible disease within a region; predictions using Patients' Medical Data to detect whether a person is infected by a transmissible disease; and predictions using both Public and patient medical data to estimate the extent of disease spread in a population. The paper also critically assesses the potential of AI and outlines its limitations in infectious disease management.</description>

      <title>Optimal reduction of an epidemic outbreak size via temporary quarantine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of an epidemic spread is crucial for effective control measures. During the COVID-19 pandemic, quarantines were implemented to minimize infections while mitigating social and economic impacts, raising the question of how to maximize quarantine efficiency. Previous research on periodic quarantines using the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) and similar models identified optimal duration for periodic quarantines. However, the question of the optimal initiation time for a single quarantine remains unanswered. Here, we use the SIR model in order to determine the optimal quarantine initiation time, by computing the optimal susceptible fraction at the onset of the quarantine, which minimizes the total outbreak size. Our analysis extends from a well-mixed scenario to strongly-heterogeneous social networks. We show that the optimal quarantine initiation time is closely related to the so-called "herd immunity" threshold, occurring at the onset of epidemic decline. Importantly, providing a methodology for identifying the optimal quarantine initiation time across different network structures, entails significant implications for epidemic control.</description>

      <title>Speed and shape of population fronts with density-dependent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate travelling wave solutions in reaction-diffusion models of animal range expansion in the case that population diffusion is density-dependent. We find that the speed of the selected wave depends critically on the strength of diffusion at low density. For sufficiently large low-density diffusion, the wave propagates at a speed predicted by a simple linear analysis. For small or zero low-density diffusion, the linear analysis is not sufficient, but a variational approach yields exact or approximate expressions for the speed and shape of population fronts.</description>

      <title>Finding high posterior density phylogenies by systematically extending a directed acyclic graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian phylogenetics typically estimates a posterior distribution, or aspects thereof, using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. These methods integrate over tree space by applying local rearrangements to move a tree through its space as a random walk. Previous work explored the possibility of replacing this random walk with a systematic search, but was quickly overwhelmed by the large number of probable trees in the posterior distribution. In this paper we develop methods to sidestep this problem using a recently introduced structure called the subsplit directed acyclic graph (sDAG). This structure can represent many trees at once, and local rearrangements of trees translate to methods of enlarging the sDAG. Here we propose two methods of introducing, ranking, and selecting local rearrangements on sDAGs to produce a collection of trees with high posterior density. One of these methods successfully recovers the set of high posterior density trees across a range of data sets. However, we find that a simpler strategy of aggregating trees into an sDAG in fact is computationally faster and returns a higher fraction of probable trees.</description>

      <title>The epidemiological footprint of contact structures in models with two levels of mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models with several levels of mixing (households, workplaces), as well as various corresponding formulations for R0, have been proposed in the literature. However, little attention has been paid to the impact of the distribution of the population size within social structures, effect that can help plan effective interventions. We focus on the influence on the model outcomes of teleworking strategies, consisting in reshaping the distribution of workplace sizes. We consider a stochastic SIR model with two levels of mixing, accounting for a uniformly mixing general population, each individual belonging also to a household and a workplace. The variance of the workplace size distribution appears to be a good proxy for the impact of this distribution on key outcomes of the epidemic, such as epidemic size and peak. In particular, our findings suggest that strategies where the proportion of individuals teleworking depends sublinearly on the size of the workplace outperform the strategy with linear dependence. Besides, one drawback of the model with multiple levels of mixing is its complexity, raising interest in a reduced model. We propose a homogeneously mixing SIR ODE-based model, whose infection rate is chosen as to observe the growth rate of the initial model. This reduced model yields a generally satisfying approximation of the epidemic. These results, robust to various changes in model structure, are very promising from the perspective of implementing effective strategies based on social distancing of specific contacts. Furthermore, they contribute to the effort of building relevant approximations of individual based models at intermediate scales.</description>
