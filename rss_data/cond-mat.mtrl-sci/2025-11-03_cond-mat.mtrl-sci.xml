      <title>Higher-dimensional Fermiology in bulk moir\'e metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, moir\'e materials have revolutionized how we engineer and control quantum phases of matter. Among incommensurate materials, moir\'e materials are aperiodic composite crystals whose long-wavelength moir\'e superlattices enable tunable properties without chemically modifying their layers. To date, nearly all reports of moir\'e materials have investigated van der Waals heterostructures assembled far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Here we introduce a conceptually new approach to synthesizing high-mobility moir\'e materials in thermodynamic equilibrium. We report a new family of foliated superlattice materials (Sr$_6$TaS$_8$)$_{1+\delta}$(TaS$_2$)$_8$ that are exfoliatable van der Waals crystals with atomically incommensurate lattices. Lattice mismatches between alternating layers generate moir\'e superlattices, analogous to those of 2D moir\'e heterobilayers, that are coherent throughout these crystals and are tunable through their synthesis conditions without altering their chemical composition. High-field quantum oscillation measurements map the complex Fermiology of these moir\'e metals, which can be tuned via the moir\'e superlattice structure. We find that the Fermi surface of the structurally simplest moir\'e metal is comprised of over 40 distinct cross-sectional areas, the most observed in any material to our knowledge. This can be naturally understood by postulating that bulk moir\'e materials can encode electronic properties of higher-dimensional superspace crystals in ways that parallel well-established crystallographic methods used for incommensurate lattices. More broadly, our work demonstrates a scalable synthesis approach potentially capable of producing moir\'e materials for electronics applications and evidences a novel material design concept for accessing a broad range of physical phenomena proposed in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>MaterialsGalaxy: A Platform Fusing Experimental and Theoretical Data in Condensed Matter Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern materials science generates vast and diverse datasets from both experiments and computations, yet these multi-source, heterogeneous data often remain disconnected in isolated "silos". Here, we introduce MaterialsGalaxy, a comprehensive platform that deeply fuses experimental and theoretical data in condensed matter physics. Its core innovation is a structure similarity-driven data fusion mechanism that quantitatively links cross-modal records - spanning diffraction, crystal growth, computations, and literature - based on their underlying atomic structures. The platform integrates artificial intelligence (AI) tools, including large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction, generative models for crystal structure prediction, and machine learning property predictors, to enhance data interpretation and accelerate materials discovery. We demonstrate that MaterialsGalaxy effectively integrates these disparate data sources, uncovering hidden correlations and guiding the design of novel materials. By bridging the long-standing gap between experiment and theory, MaterialsGalaxy provides a new paradigm for data-driven materials research and accelerates the discovery of advanced materials.</description>

      <title>Generative diffusion modeling protocols for improving the Kikuchi pattern indexing in electron back-scatter diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron back-scatter diffraction (EBSD) has traditionally relied upon methods such as the Hough transform and dictionary Indexing to interpret diffraction patterns and extract crystallographic orientation. However, these methods encounter significant limitations, particularly when operating at high scanning speeds, where the exposure time per pattern is decreased beyond the operating sensitivity of CCD camera. Hence the signal to noise ratio decreases for the observed pattern which makes the pattern noisy, leading to reduced indexing accuracy. This research work aims to develop generative machine learning models for the post-processing or on-the-fly processing of Kikuchi patterns which are capable of restoring noisy EBSD patterns obtained at high scan speeds. These restored patterns can be used for the determination of crystal orientations to provide reliable indexing results. We compare the performance of such generative models in enhancing the quality of patterns captured at short exposure times (high scan speeds). An interesting observation is that the methodology is not data-hungry as typical machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Simulations of H-Cu Vacancy Cosegregation and H Diffusion in Cu Grain Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement remains a critical challenge in structural and electronic applications of copper (Cu) but its mechanism is still not fully understood. In this study, we combine density functional theory (DFT) and bond-order potential (BOP) simulations to determine the atomistic pathways for hydrogen adsorption/incorporation and fast interfacial diffusion at Cu grain boundaries (GBs), including its interaction with vacancies. Undercoordinated regions, such as surfaces and GBs, serve as preferential adsorption/incorporation sites for atomic hydrogen, especially in the presence of Cu vacancies. The presence of hydrogen in GB further enhances the segregation of Cu vacancies, leading to the formation of stable H-$V_\mathrm{Cu}$ complexes with cosegregation energy gains of up to $-0.8$ eV. Furthermore, our simulations reveal that the migration barriers for hydrogen within the GB networks are as low as $0.2$ eV and significantly lower than in bulk Cu ($0.42$ eV). The results presented in this paper suggest an atomistic mechanism that links $H_2$ exposure to H accumulation in GBs, providing information on the early stages of hydrogen-induced degradation.</description>

      <title>Stability and Dynamics of Sn-based Halide Perovskites: Insights from MACE-MP-0 and Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tin-based halide perovskites have emerged as promising lead-free alternatives for optoelectronic applications, yet their structural stability and phase behavior at finite temperatures remain challenging to predict. Here, we assess the predictive capabilities of the foundational machine learning model MACE-MP-0 - trained on a broad chemical space and applied without system-specific fine-tuning - for the temperature-dependent behavior of CsSnBr3 and Cs2SnBr6. Molecular Dynamics simulations in the NpT ensemble were performed from 100 K to 500 K, and thermodynamic and structural descriptors including enthalpy, specific heat, radial distribution functions, translational order, bond angle distributions, and vibrational spectra were analyzed. Our results show that CsSnBr3 undergoes a low-temperature orthorhombic-to-cubic phase transition, evidenced by both the evolution of lattice parameters and subtle anomalies in enthalpy and specific heat, although the experimentally observed intermediate tetragonal phase is not captured. In contrast, Cs2SnBr6 remains cubic and maintains a more rigid octahedral framework across the entire temperature range. Overall, MACE-MP-0 qualitatively reproduces key thermal and structural features of these materials, highlighting its usefulness as a first step for studying new materials. For cases where capturing more subtle phase behavior is required, system-specific fine-tuning with Density Functional Theory data should be considered.</description>

      <title>Defect Engineered Hexagonal-Boron Nitride Enables Ionic Conduction for Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The practical implementation of lithium-metal anodes has been hindered by uncontrollable dendrite formation and interfacial instability. This study presents a defect-engineering approach of a chemically stable and electrically insulating interfacial layer of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) that markedly enhances ionic conductivity through argon ion irradiation. Initially, the electrochemical performance from commercially available, large-area chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown h-BN films with industrial-scale argon ion implantation motivated our subsequent detailed investigations using lab-scale exfoliated single-crystal h-BN flakes. Integration of these exfoliated flakes into a hybrid microfluidic-microelectronic chip provided direct evidence that controlled vacancy defects transform h-BN into an efficient lithium-ion conductor while preserving its intrinsic electrical insulation. Experimental validation confirmed improved lithium-metal anode stability, achieving dendrite-free cycling with Li plating/stripping Coulombic efficiencies exceeding 99.5% about 1000 cycles. Further assemble of irradiated h-BN in lithium-sulfur batteries effectively mitigates the polysulfide shuttle effect, sustaining over 97% specific capacity around 300 cycles. These results establish a robust, scalable interface-engineering route for next-generation lithium-metal batteries that combine high ionic transport with excellent electrical insulation.</description>

      <title>Crossover between intrinsic and temperature-assisted regimes in spin-orbit torque switching of antiferromagnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intensive studies have been made on antiferromagnets as candidate materials for next generation memory bits due to their ultrafast dynamics reaching picosecond time scales. Recent demonstrations of electrical bidirectional switching of antiferromagnetic states have attracted significant attention. However, under the presence of significant Joule heating that destabilizes the magnetic order, the timescales associated with the switching can be limited to nanoseconds or longer. Here, we present the observation of a crossover in the switching behavior of the chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn by tuning the magnetic layer thickness. While Joule heating interferes with switching in thicker devices, we find clear signatures of an intrinsic spin-orbit torque mechanism as the thickness is reduced, avoiding the heating effect. The suppression of heating enables switching without significant attenuation of the readout signal using pulses shorter than those required by temperature-assisted mechanisms. The crossover into the spin-orbit torque switching behavior clarifies the potential for achieving ultrafast switching as expected from the picosecond spin dynamics of antiferromagnets. Our results lay the groundwork for designing antiferromagnetic memory devices that can operate at ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>High thermal conductivity of rutile-GeO$_2$ films grown by MOCVD: $52.9~\mathrm{W\,m^{-1}\,K^{-1}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rutile germanium dioxide (r-GeO2) has recently emerged as a promising ultrawide-bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor owing to its wide bandgap (~4.4-5.1 eV), ambipolar doping potential, and high theoretical thermal conductivity. However, experimental data on the thermal conductivity of r-GeO2 epitaxial layers have not been reported, primarily due to challenges in phase control and surface roughness. Here, we report a high thermal conductivity of 52.9 +/- 6.6 W m^-1 K^-1 for high-quality (002) r-GeO2 films grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and characterized using time-domain thermoreflectance (TDTR). The phase control was achieved through a seed-driven stepwise crystallization (SDSC) approach, and the surface roughness was significantly reduced from 76 nm to 16 nm (locally as low as 1 A) via chemical mechanical polishing (CMP). These results highlight the promise of r-GeO2 as a UWBG oxide platform for power electronics applications.</description>

      <title>First-principles design of excitonic insulators: A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excitonic insulator (EI) is a more than 60-year-old theoretical proposal that yet remains elusive. It is a purely quantum phenomenon involving the spontaneous generation of excitons in quantum mechanics and the spontaneous condensation of excitons in quantum statistics. At this point, the excitons represent the ground state rather than the conventional excited state. Thus, the scarcity of candidate materials is a key factor contributing to the lack of recognized EI to date. In this review, we begin with the birth of EI, presenting the current state of the field and the main challenges it faces. We then focus on recent advances in the discovery and design of EIs based on the first-principles Bethe-Salpeter scheme, in particular the dark-exciton rule guided screening of materials. It not only opens up new avenues for realizing excitonic instability in direct-gap and wide-gap semiconductors, but also leads to the discovery of novel quantum states of matter such as half-EIs and spin-triplet EIs. Finally, we will look ahead to possible research pathways leading to the first recognized EI, both computationally and theoretically.</description>

      <title>The plastic flow of polycrystalline solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polycrystalline solid is modelled as an ensemble of random irregular polyhedra filling the entire space occupied by the solid body, leaving no voids or flaws between them. Adjacent grains can slide with a relative velocity proportional to the local shear stress resolved in the plane common to the two sliding grains, provided it exceeds a threshold. The local forces associated to the continuous grain shape accommodation for preserving matter continuity are assumed much weaker. The model can be solved analytically and for overcritical conditions gives two regimes of deformation, plastic and superplastic. The plastic regime, from yield to fracture, is dealt with. Applications to nickel superalloys and stainless steels give impressive agreement with experiment. Most work of the last century relies on postulating pre--existent cracks and voids to explain plastic deformation and fracture. The present model gives much better results.</description>

      <title>Influence of Hydrogen-Incorporation on the Bulk Electronic Structure and Chemical Bonding in Palladium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Palladium hydride is a model system for studying metal-hydrogen interactions. Yet, its bulk electronic structure has proven difficult to directly probe, with most studies to date limited to surface-sensitive photoelectron spectroscopy approaches. This work reports the first in-situ ambient-pressure hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-HAXPES) study of hydrogen incorporation in Pd thin films, providing direct access to bulk chemical and electronic information at elevated hydrogen pressures. Structural characterisation by in-situ X-ray diffraction and neutron reflectometry under comparable conditions establishes a direct correlation between hydrogen loading, lattice expansion, and electronic modifications. Comparison with density functional theory (DFT) reveals how hydrogen stoichiometry and site occupancy govern the density of occupied states near the Fermi level. These results resolve long-standing questions regarding PdH and establish AP-HAXPES as a powerful tool for probing the bulk electronic structure of metal hydrides under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Lattice dynamics in chiral tellurium by linear and circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy: crystal orientation and handedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trigonal tellurium (Te) has attracted researchers' attention due to its transport and optical properties, which include electrical magneto-chiral anisotropy, spin polarization and bulk photovoltaic effect. It is the anisotropic and chiral crystal structure of Te that drive these properties, so the determination of its crystallographic orientation and handedness is key to their study. Here we explore the structural dynamics of Te bulk crystals by angle-dependent linearly polarized Raman spectroscopy and symmetry rules in three different crystallographic orientations. The angle-dependent intensity of the modes allows us to determine the arrangement of the helical chains and distinguish between crystallographic planes parallel and perpendicular to the chain axis. Furthermore, under different configurations of circularly polarized Raman measurements and crystal orientations, we observe the shift of two phonon modes only in the (0 0 1) plane. The shift is positive or negative depending on the handedness of the crystals, which we determine univocally by chemical etching. Our analysis of three different crystal faces of Te highlights the importance of selecting the proper orientation and crystallographic plane when investigating the transport and optical properties of this material. These results offer insight into the crystal structure and symmetry in other anisotropic and chiral materials, and open new paths to select a suitable crystal orientation when fabricating devices.</description>

      <title>High-performance thermochromic multilayer coatings with W-doped VO2 nanoparticles dispersed in SiO2 matrix prepared on glass at a low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a high-performance thermochromic VO2-based coating prepared by using a three-step process, consisting of magnetron sputter depositions of SiO2 films and V-W films and their postannealing, on standard glass at a low substrate temperature of 350 {\deg}C without opening the vacuum chamber to atmosphere. It is formed by four layers of W-doped VO2 nanoparticles dispersed in SiO2 matrix. The coating exhibits a transition temperature of 33 {\deg}C with an integral luminous transmittance of 65.4% (low-temperature state) and 60.1% (high-temperature state), and a modulation of the solar energy transmittance of 15.3%. Such a combination of properties, together with the low temperature during preparation, fulfill the requirements for large-scale implementation on building glass and have not been reported yet.</description>

      <title>Hexagonal BeX (X: S, Te) monolayer as potential electrode material for alkali metal-ion batteries: A DFT perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-ion batteries (MIBs) are essential for transitioning to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future. By employing the density functional formalism, we have investigated the hexagonal (h) monolayer of BeS and BeTe as electrode materials for alkali (Li and Na) MIBs. The structural and thermodynamic stability, adsorption of Li/Na atoms, density of states, diffusion, and migration of atoms, as well as capacity, are systematically investigated. The structures of h-BeS and h-BeTe remain stable upon the adsorption of adatoms, resulting in improved electronic conductivity of these monolayers. The climbing image-nudged elastic band calculations estimate a low diffusion barrier of 0.16 eV (0.01 eV) for Li (Na) in h-BeS and 0.20 eV (0.16 eV) for Li (Na) in h-BeTe. Additionally, a maximum storage capacity of 580 mAh g-1 for Li and 1305 mAh g-1 for Na in h-BeS, as well as 174 mAh g-1 for h-BeTe, is estimated for both metal ions.</description>

      <title>Density functional investigations on 2D-Be2C as an anode for alkali Metal-ion batteries</title>

Abstract: Metal-ion batteries are in huge demand to cope with the increasing need for renewable energy, especially in automobiles. In this work, we apply first-principle calculations to examine two-dimensional beryllium carbide (2D-Be2C) as a possible anode material for metal-ion (Na and K) batteries. 2D-Be2C is a semiconductor and becomes metallic by adsorbing metal ions. Negative adsorption energy indicates stable adsorption on the monolayer of Be2C. Alkali metal diffusion barrier and optimum path for minimum energy are studied within the framework of the climbing image nudged elastic band method. Here, six intermediate images are considered between the initial and final states. The lowest diffusion barriers for a single adsorbed Na and K atom are 0.016 and 0.026 eV, respectively. A maximum open circuit voltage of around 1 V is computed for K ions, whereas 0.5 V is for Na ions. Also, the maximum storage capacity of the Be2C monolayer is estimated at 1785 Ah/kg.</description>

      <title>Size-dependent transformation patterns in NiTi tubes under tension and bending: Stereo digital image correlation experiments and modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dependence of transformation pattern in superelastic NiTi tubes on tube outer diameter D and wall-thickness t is investigated through quasi-static uniaxial tension and large-rotation bending experiments. The evolution of outer-surface strain fields is synchronized with global stress-strain and moment-curvature responses using a multi-magnification, high-resolution stereo digital image correlation system at 0.5-2x magnifications. The transformation patterns exhibit systematic size-dependent behaviors. Under tension and for a specific D, as the diameter-to-thickness ratio D/t decreases, a decreasing number of fat/diffuse helical bands emerge, in contrast to sharp/slim bands in thin tubes. Consequently, the austenite-martensite front morphology transitions from finely-fingered to coarsely-fingered with decreasing D/t. Below a characteristic D/t, front morphology no longer exhibits patterning and phase transformation proceeds via propagation of a finger-less front. Moreover, the transformation pattern exhibits an interrelation between D and D/t, where a front possessing diffuse fingers is observed in a thin but small tube. Under bending, both the global moment-curvature response and transformation pattern exhibit D- and D/t-dependence. While wedge-like martensite domains consistently form across all tube sizes, their growth is noticeably limited in smaller and thicker tubes due to geometrical constraints. A gradient-enhanced model of superelasticity is employed to analyze the distinct transformation patterns observed in tubes of various dimensions. The size-dependent behavior is explained based on the competition between bulk and interfacial energies, and the energetic cost of accommodating martensite fingers. By leveraging an axisymmetric tube configuration as a reference energy state, the extra energy associated with the formation of fingers is quantified.</description>

      <title>First-principles calculations of thermal transport at metal/silicon interfaces: evidence of interfacial electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing miniaturization of electronic components and the need to optimize thermal management, it has become essential to understand heat transport at metal/semiconductor interfaces. While it has been recognized decades ago that an electron phonon channel may take place at metal-semiconductor interfaces, its existence is still controversial. Here, we investigate thermal transport at metal-silicon interfaces using the combination of first principles calculations and nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF). We explain how to correct NEGF formalism to account for the out of equilibrium nature of the energy carriers in the vicinity of the interface. The relative corrections to the equilibrium distribution are shown to arise from the spectral mean free paths of silicon and may reach 15 percents. Applying these corrections, we compare the predictions of NEGF to available experimental data for Au/Si, Pt/Si and Al/Si interfaces. Based on this comparison, we infer the value of the electron phonon interfacial thermal conductance by employing the two temperature model. We find that interfacial thermal transport at Au/Si interfaces is mainly driven by phonon phonon processes, and that electron phonon processes play a negligible role in this case. By contrast, for Al/Si interfaces, we show that phonon-phonon scattering alone can not explain the experimental values reported so far, and we estimate that the electron-phonon interfacial conductance accounts for one third of the total conductance. This work demonstrates the importance of the electron-phonon conductance at metal-silicon interfaces and calls for systematic experimental investigation of thermal transport at these interfaces at low temperatures. It paves the way for an accurate model to predict the conductance associated to the interfacial electron phonon channel.</description>

      <title>Molecular ink-based synthesis of Bi(SzSe1-z)(IxBr1-x) solid solutions as tuneable materials for sustainable energy applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional (Q-1D) van der Waals chalcohalides have emerged as promising materials for advanced energy applications, combining tunable optoelectronic properties and composed by earth-abundant and non-toxic elements. However, their widespread application remains hindered by challenges such as anisotropic crystal growth, composition control and lack of knowledge on optoelectronic properties. A deeper understanding of the intrinsic limitations of these materials, as well as viable defect mitigation strategies like the engineering of solid solutions, is critical. This work presents a low-temperature synthesis route based on molecular ink deposition enabling direct crystallization of tunable Bi(SzSe1-z)(IxBr1-x) solid solutions without need for binary chalcogenide precursors. This approach yields phase-pure films with precise control over morphology, composition, and crystallographic orientation. XRD analysis and DFT calculations confirm the formation of homogeneous solid solutions, while optoelectronic measurements reveal the distinct roles of halogen and chalcogen anions in tuning bandgap energy and carrier type, with Se shifting downwards the conduction band. The versatility of this synthesis technique enables morphology control ranging from compact films to rod-shaped microcrystals, expanding the functional adaptability of these materials. These findings offer a foundational framework for defect engineering and the scalable integration of chalcohalides in next-generation energy technologies, including photovoltaics, photocatalysis, thermoelectrics, and chemical sensing.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of organic-inorganic perovskite and all-inorganic lead-free double perovskite nanocrystals by femtosecond laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite materials are at the forefront of modern materials science due to their exceptional structural, electronic, and optical properties. The controlled fabrication of perovskite nanostructures is crucial for enhancing their performance, stability, and scalability, directly impacting their applications in next-generation devices such as solar cells, LEDs, and sensors. Here, we present a novel, ligand-free approach to synthesize perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with average sizes up to 100 nm, using femtosecond pulsed laser ablation (PLA) in ambient air without additional liquid media. We demonstrate this method for both organic-inorganic (methylamino lead) hybrid perovskites (MAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) and fully inorganic lead-free double perovskites (Cs2AgBiX6, X = Cl, Br), achieving high-purity NCs without stabilizing ligands - a critical advancement over conventional chemical synthesis methods. By tailoring laser parameters, we systematically elucidate the influence of perovskite composition (halide type, organic vs. inorganic cation, single versus double perovskite structure) on the ablation process and the resulting nanocrystal properties. Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction confirm the preservation of crystallinity, with MAPbX3 forming larger (approximately 90 nm) cubic NCs and Cs2AgBiX6 forming smaller (approximately 10 nm) rounded NCs. Photoluminescence spectroscopy reveals pronounced size-dependent blue shifts (17-40 nm) due to quantum confinement, particularly for Br and I containing perovskites. This clean, scalable, and versatile PLA approach not only provides direct access to high-purity, ligand-free perovskite NCs with tunable optical properties but also represents a significant advance in the fabrication of nanostructures, enabling the exploration of new perovskite-based optoelectronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Learning viscoplastic constitutive behavior from experiments: II. Dynamic indentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the development of a method to accurately and efficiently identify the constitutive behavior of complex materials through full-field observations that we started in Akerson, Rajan and Bhattacharya (2024). We formulate the problem of inferring constitutive relations from experiments as an indirect inverse problem that is constrained by the balance laws. Specifically, we seek to find a constitutive behavior that minimizes the difference between the experimental observation and the corresponding quantities computed with the model, while enforcing the balance laws. We formulate the forward problem as a boundary value problem corresponding to the experiment, and compute the sensitivity of the objective with respect to the model using the adjoint method. In this paper, we extend the approach to include contact and study dynamic indentation. Contact is a nonholonomic constraint, and we introduce a Lagrange multiplier and a slack variable to address it. We demonstrate the method on synthetic data before applying it to experimental observations on rolled homogeneous armor steel and a polycrystalline aluminum alloy.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Study of Transition Metal Doped in 2D Polyaramid for Novel Material Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first--principles density functional theory (DFT) study of transition metal (TM = Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) functionalized two--dimensional polyaramid (2DPA) to explore their structural, electronic, and magnetic properties. Mechanical parameters, such as bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and Pugh ratio, together with phonon dispersion, confirm the mechanical and dynamic stability of all doped systems. Electronic structure analysis shows strong binding of Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Ti with formation energies between --1.15 eV and --2.96 eV, while Mn binds more weakly (--0.67 eV). TM doping introduces new electronic states that reduce the band gap, with Fe-doped 2DPA exhibiting the lowest value of 0.26 eV. The systems display predominantly ferromagnetic ordering, with magnetic moments of 1.14 {\mu}B (Co), 3.57 {\mu}B (Cr), 2.26 {\mu}B (Fe), 4.19 {\mu}B (Mn), and 1.62 {\mu}B (Ti). These results demonstrate that TM--doped 2DPA possesses tunable magnetic and electronic characteristics, highlighting its potential for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Kinematical and dynamical contrast of dislocations in thick GaN substrates observed by synchrotron-radiation X-ray topography under six-beam diffraction conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dislocations in a thick ammonothermal GaN substrate were investigated using synchrotron-radiation X-ray topography (SR-XRT) under six-beam diffraction conditions. The high brilliance of the synchrotron source enabled the observation of the super-Borrmann effect, which markedly enhanced the anomalous transmission of X-rays through the 350~$\mu$m-thick crystal. Systematic variation of the deviation angle~$\Delta\omega$ revealed a clear transition from kinematical to dynamical diffraction, consistent with theoretical predictions based on dynamical diffraction theory. By selectively exciting five equivalent two-beam diffraction conditions near the six-beam configuration, the Burgers vectors of individual threading edge dislocations (TEDs) were determined according to the $g\cdot b$ invisibility criterion. The measured dislocation image widths agreed well with calculated values derived from the extinction distance and $|g\cdot b|$ dependence, confirming that most dislocations possess Burgers vectors containing an $a$-type component of $\frac{1}{3}\langle 11\bar{2}0\rangle$ or $\frac{2}{3}\langle 11\bar{2}0\rangle$. These results demonstrate that SR-XRT under multibeam diffraction provides a powerful, nondestructive method for quantitative dislocation analysis in thick GaN crystals, offering valuable insights into defect structures critical for high-performance GaN-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Magnetoresistance in the magnetic topological semimetals NdSbxTe2-x</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological semimetals LnSbTe (Ln = lanthanide elements) provide a platform to study the interplay of structure, magnetism, topology, and electron correlations. Varying Sb and Te compositions in LnSbxTe2-x can effectively control the electronic, magnetic, and transport properties. Here, we report the evolution of transport properties with Sb and Te contents in NdSbxTe2-x, (0 &lt; x &lt; 1). Our work reveals nonmonotonic evolution in magnetoresistance with varying composition stoichiometry. Specifically, reducing Sb content x leads to strong negative magnetoresistance up to 99.9%. Such a strong magnetoresistance, which is likely attributed to the interplay between structure, magnetism, and electronic bands, establishes this material as a promising platform for investigating topological semimetal for future device applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern fuel cell technologies use Nafion as the material of choice for the proton exchange membrane (PEM) and as the binding material (ionomer), used to assemble the catalyst layers of the anode and cathode. These applications demand high proton conductivity as well as other requirements. For example, PEM is expected to block electrons, oxygen, and hydrogen from penetrating and diffusing while the anode/cathode ionomer should allow hydrogen/oxygen to move easily, so that they can reach the catalyst nanoparticles. Given some of the well-known limits of Nafion, such as low glass-transition temperature, the community is in the midst of an active search for Nafion replacements. In this work, we present an informatics-based scheme to search large polymer chemical spaces, which includes establishing a list of properties needed for the targeted applications, developing predictive machine-learning models for these properties, defining a search space, and using the developed models to screen the search space. Using the scheme, we have identified 60 new polymer candidates for PEM, anode ionomer, and cathode ionomer that we hope will be advanced to the next step, i.e., validating the designs through synthesis and testing. The proposed informatics scheme is generic, and can be used to select polymers for multiple applications in the future.</description>

      <title>Programmable digital quantum simulation of 2D Fermi-Hubbard dynamics using 72 superconducting qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the time-dynamics of quantum many-body systems was the original use of quantum computers proposed by Feynman, motivated by the critical role of quantum interactions between electrons in the properties of materials and molecules. Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to $6\times 6$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including on-site electron-electron interaction strength and magnetic flux, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons, i.e. charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation, dynamical symmetry breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now competitive on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Nanomechanics of Shear Rate-Dependent Stiffening in Micellar Electrically Conductive Polymers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrically conducting polymers with mechanical adaptability are essential for flexible electronics, yet most suffer structural degradation under rapid deformation. In this study, multiscale coarse-grained (MSCG) simulations are used to uncover the nanoscale origins of an unusual strain-rate-dependent stiffening in a poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid) (PAMPSA)-polyaniline (PANI) blend. The self-assembled morphology consists of semi-crystalline PANI-rich micellar cores dispersed in a soft, viscoelastic PAMPSA matrix. At low shear rates, micelles migrate and coalesce into larger aggregates, enhancing local crystallinity and transient entanglement density while dissipating stress through matrix deformation. At high shear rates, micelles cannot reorganize quickly enough, leading to core dissociation and the emergence of highly aligned PANI filaments that directly bear the load, with PAMPSA serving as a weak but extended support phase. These contrasting regimes (densification-driven local alignment versus dissociation-driven global alignment) enable reversible mechanical stiffening across three orders of magnitude in shear rate. The results provide a molecular-level framework for designing solid-state polymers with tunable, rate-adaptive mechanical properties.</description>

      <title>Metallic electro-optic effects in topological chiral crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological chiral crystals have emerged as a fertile material platform for investigating optical phenomena derived from the distinctive Fermi surface Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment textures around multifold chiral band crossings pinned at the time-reversal invariant momenta. In this work, by means of tight-binding model and first principles based calculations, we investigate metallic electro-optic (EO) responses stemming from the Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment of Bloch electrons across 37 materials belonging to space group 198 (SG198). Previously thought to vanish in SG198, our findings reveal a nonzero Berry curvature dipole attributed to the energetic misalignment between topologically charged point nodes of opposite chirality. Moreover, we find that the recently predicted magnetoelectric EO effects, which arise from the interplay between the Berry curvature and magnetic moment on the Fermi surface, are readily accessible in BeAu under experimentally feasible electric biases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in ultrafast laser systems and high harmonic generation (HHG) techniques have enabled time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on femtosecond timescales, opening up unprecedented opportunities to explore quantum materials in both time and momentum space. In this review, we present recent representative studies utilizing HHG-laser-based time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy for a variety of quantum materials. We particularly highlight electron-phonon interactions and non-equilibrium dynamics in time and frequency domain, through which rich information about non-equilibrium electron-phonon couplings and related phenomena has been clearly revealed.</description>

      <title>Plastic or Viscous? A Reappraisal of Yielding in Soft Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many soft jammed materials, such as pastes, gels, concentrated emulsions, and suspensions, possess a threshold stress, known as yield stress, that must be exceeded to cause permanent deformation or flow. In rheology, the term plastic flow is commonly used to describe continuous flow (unbounded increase in strain with time) that a material undergoes above a yield stress threshold. However, in solid mechanics, plasticity refers to irreversible but finite, rate-independent deformation (strain that does not evolve with time). In addition, many soft materials exhibit viscosity bifurcation, a prominent thixotropic signature, which further complicates the definition and interpretation of yield stress. The threshold stress at which viscosity bifurcation occurs is also termed a yield stress, even though deformation below this threshold is not purely elastic, while above this threshold, the material flows homogeneously with a constant shear rate. This paper revisits these critical issues by analyzing the rheological and solid mechanics perspectives on plasticity. The insights presented here are intended to address certain terminological ambiguities for interpreting flow in soft jammed materials.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Investigation of Anomalous Hall and Nernst Responses in Potassium Tri Vanadium Pentantimonide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the anomalous Nernst and Hall conductance in the Kagome metal potassium tri vanadium pentantimonide, based on a system Hamiltonian incorporating nearest neighbour and complex next nearest neighbour hopping, Rashba spin orbit coupling, an exchange field induced by magnetic proximity, and a charge density wave potential. Our analysis reveals that the Nernst conductivity exhibits a non monotonic temperature dependence. It increases with temperature, reaches a pronounced peak, and subsequently declines at higher temperatures due to thermal broadening, which diminishes the influence of Berry curvature. Notably, small shifts in the chemical potential can lead to dramatic changes in the Nernst signal enhancing its magnitude or even reversing its sign highlighting the system sensitivity to carrier density. We further explore the anomalous Hall behaviour within this framework. The band structure hosts multiple bands with nonzero Berry curvature, and preliminary Chern number calculations suggest weak topological features, namely, while not fully quantized, the system exhibits significant Berry curvature accumulation. Upon introducing momentum space winding, implemented via a momentum dependent phase in the complex hopping terms to mimic orbital magnetic flux, we observe that two bands acquire opposite Chern numbers. The remaining bands remain topologically trivial.</description>

      <title>Spatial organization of biomass controls intrinsic permeability of porous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biofilms in porous media critically influence hydraulic properties in environmental and engineered systems. However, a mechanistic understanding of how microbial life controls permeability remains elusive. By combining microfluidics, controlled pressure gradient and time-lapse microscopy, we quantify how motile and non-motile bacteria colonize a porous landscape and alter its resistance to flow. We find that while both strains achieve nearly identical total biomass, they cause drastically different permeability reductions - 78% for motile cells versus 94% for non-motile cells. This divergence stems from motility, which limits biomass spatial accumulation, whereas non-motile cells clog the entire system. We develop a mechanistic model that accurately predicts permeability dynamics from the pore-scale biomass distribution. We conclude that the spatial organization of biomass, not its total amount, is the primary factor controlling permeability.</description>

      <title>Single femtosecond laser pulse-driven ferromagnetic switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light pulses offer a faster, more energy-efficient, and direct route to magnetic bit writing, pointing toward a hybrid memory and computing paradigm based on photon transmission and spin retention. Yet progress remains hindered, as deterministic, single-pulse optical toggle switching has so far been achieved only with ferrimagnetic materials, which require too specific a rare-earth composition and temperature conditions for technological use. In mainstream ferromagnet--central to spintronic memory and storage--such bistable switching is considered fundamentally difficult, as laser-induced heating does not inherently break time-reversal symmetry. Here, we report coherent magnetization switching in ferromagnets, driven by thermal anisotropy torque with single laser pulses. The toggle switching behavior is robust over a broad range of pulse durations, from femtoseconds to picoseconds, a prerequisite for practical applications. Furthermore, the phenomenon exhibits reproducibility in CoFeB/MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions with a high magnetoresistance exceeding 110%, as well as the scalability down to nanoscales with remarkable energy efficiency (17 fJ per 100-nm-sized bit). These results mark a notable step toward integrating opto-spintronics into next-generation memory and storage technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the response of materials with nanoscale pores containing sodium chloride solutions, to cycles of relative humidity (RH). Compared to pure fluids, we show that these sorption isotherms display much wider hysteresis, with a shape determined by salt crystallization and deliquescence rather than capillary condensation and Kelvin evaporation. Both deliquescence and crystallization are significantly shifted compared to the bulk and occur at unusually low RH. We systematically analyze the effect of pore size and salt amount, and rationalize our findings using confined thermodynamics, osmotic effects and classical nucleation theory.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Spin Transition at Single Particle Level in Levitating Spin Crossover Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to control and understand the phase transitions of individual nanoscale building blocks is key to advancing the next generation of low-power reconfigurable nanophotonic devices. To address this critical challenge, molecular nanoparticles (NPs) exhibiting a spin crossover (SCO) phenomenon are trapped by coupling a quadrupole Paul trap with a multi-spectral polarization-resolved scattering microscope. This contact-free platform simultaneously confines, optically excites, and monitors the spin transition in Fe(II)-triazole NPs in a pressure-tunable environment, eliminating substrate artifacts. Thus, we show light-driven manipulation of the spin transition in levitating NPs free from substrate-induced effects. Using the robust spin bistability near room temperature of our SCO system, we quantify reversible opto-volumetric changes of up to 6%, revealing precise switching thresholds at the single-particle level. Independent pressure modulation produces a comparable size increase, confirming mechanical control over the same bistable transition. These results constitute full real-time control and readout of spin states in levitating SCO NPs, charting a route toward their integration into ultralow-power optical switches, data-storage elements, and nanoscale sensors.</description>

      <title>Reducing the strain required for ambient-pressure superconductivity in bilayer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The remarkable discovery of high temperature superconductivity in bulk bilayer nickelates under high pressure has prompted the conjecture that epitaxial compressive strain might mimic essential aspects of hydrostatic pressure. The successful realization of superconductivity in films on SrLaAlO4 (001) (SLAO) supports this correspondence, yet it remains unclear whether the rich pressure-temperature phase diagram of bilayer nickelates can be systematically mapped (and studied at ambient pressure) as a function of epitaxial strain. To this end, experimental access near the elusive edge of the superconducting phase boundary would provide invaluable insight into the nature of the superconducting state and the ground state from which it emerges. It would also offer a benchmark for theoretical models. Here we report superconducting bilayer nickelates grown on LaAlO3 (001) (LAO), where the compressive strain required for ambient-pressure superconductivity is nearly halved to -1.2%. These films exhibit a superconducting onset above 10 K and reach zero resistance at 3 K, with normal-state transport properties differing from those of films grown on SLAO. Our results offer a new opportunity to probe emergent phenomena near the superconducting phase boundary in the strain-temperature phase diagram of bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Poroelasticity in the presence of active fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a model for characterizing porous, deformable media embedded with magnetorheological fluids (MRFs). These active fluids exhibit tunable mechanical and rheological properties that can be controlled through the application of a magnetic field, which induces a phase transition from a liquid to a solid-like state. This transition profoundly affects both stress transmission and fluid flow within the composite, leading to a behaviour governed by a well-defined threshold that depends on the ratio between the pore size and the characteristic size of clusters of magnetic particles, and can be triggered by adjusting the magnetic field intensity. These effects were confirmed through an experimental campaign conducted on a prototype composite obtained by imbibing a selected MRF into commercial sponges. To design and optimize this new class of materials, a linear poroelastic formulation is proposed and validated through comparison with experimental results. The constitutive relationships, i.e. overall elastic constitutive tensor and permeability, of the model are updated from phenomenological observations, exploiting the experimental data obtained for both the pure fluid and the composite material. The findings demonstrate that the proposed simplified formulation is sufficiently robust to predict and optimize the behaviour of porous media containing MRFs. Such materials hold significant promise for a wide range of engineering applications, including adaptive exosuits for human tissue and joint rehabilitation, as well as innovative structural systems.</description>

      <title>Deep learning denoising unlocks quantitative insights in operando materials microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization. Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase classification in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduces noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography to resolve heterogeneous lithium transport. Collectively, these results establish deep denoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exceptional magnetic, optical and phononic properties of Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) make it unique for spin-wave based and photonic applications. Yet, nanostructuring crystalline YIG and manipulating its magnetism in a non-destructive way is an outstanding challenge, and so far mostly limited to two-dimensional capabilities. Here, we show that irradiation of single-crystal YIG films with a focused UV laser drives a stable, giant enhancement of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, preserving the crystalline quality. This modulation is highly confined at the nanoscale in both the lateral and vertical directions, and its extension within the volume can be finely tuned with a continuous depth-control. By harnessing these three-dimensional anisotropy profiles, we demonstrate a large tuning of the spin-wave band structure, volume spatial localization, and non-reciprocity, realizing proof-of-principle 3D magnonic crystals. This straightforward, single-step, laser nanofabrication of three-dimensional magnetic systems based on crystalline YIG thin films opens the way to design novel functions in magnonic and magneto-optic devices.</description>

Abstract: Accurate modelling of magnetism is pivotal for elucidating the microscopic origins of magnetic phenomena in functional materials. However, for a specified class of materials, such as random dilute ferromagnets or alloys, the reliance on simplifying assumptions, such as single-ion anisotropy, limits the accuracy of existing spin models. In such systems, there is a significant probability of the formation of nearest-neighbor magnetic ion pairs or higher order clusters, whose presence breaks the local symmetry of otherwise isolated magnetic species. Here, we introduce the concept of pair-induced uniaxial anisotropy and demonstrate how nearby atoms influence each other's anisotropic behavior. This effect is investigated in the dilute magnetic semiconductor Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N, by means of density functional theory calculations. The inclusion of pair anisotropy in the atomistic spin simulations significantly improves the agreement between simulated and experimental magnetization curves, in contrast to models that consider only single-ion anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain in single van-der-Waals layer of MnBi2Te4 the spin-valve-like ferromagnet/spin glass (SG)/ferromagnet architecture, where the switch of individual spin states in the SG-like layer appears as the resistance switch behavior. The characteristic temperature of SG can be effectively tuned by fine-control of Bi-doping in the SG layer. A doping- and temperature-dependent phase diagram is established. We demonstrate the remote manipulation and detection of the states of individual Mn-layer spins by tunneling electrons in favor of the electron-phonon, spin-phonon, spin-transfer torque and spin-flip interactions among hot electrons, lattice and local spins, where the spin valve layer is even buried below two-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3. The integration of the SG state into spin valves opens the opportunity of realizing atomic-scale spintronics by integrating different degrees of freedom in two dimensional materials.</description>

Abstract: On the spin-valve-like ferromagnet/spin glass/ferromagnet (FM/SG/FM) structure, the tunneling current is dominated by resistance switch (RS) instead of the local density of states according to the conventional tunneling theory. Here we show lattice-site dependent RS behaviors in one-quintuple-layer Bi2Te3 deposited on single MnBi2Te4 septuple layer, which comes from the difference in the efficiency of tunneling electrons to induce focused current or phonons at different sites, switching remotely the spin valve by spin-transfer torque or spin-phonon interactions. These lead to the observation of the dynamic 2-state lattice when the tip scans across the surface as well as the ability of scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to reveal atomic-scale features of electron-phonon (EP) interactions. Our work demonstrates the possibility of the spin-switch STM to image lattice-site dependent EP interactions of any materials deposited on the FM/SG/FM structure.</description>

      <title>Orientation-Adaptive Virtual Imaging of Defects using EBSD</title>

Abstract: EBSD is a foundational technique for characterizing crystallographic orientation, phase distribution, and lattice strain. Embedded within EBSD patterns lies latent information on dislocation structures, subtly encoded due to their deviation from perfect crystallinity - a feature often underutilized. Here, a novel framework termed orientation-adaptive virtual apertures (OAVA) is introduced. OAVAs enable the generation of virtual images tied to specific diffraction conditions, allowing the direct visualization of individual dislocations from a single EBSD map. By dynamically aligning virtual apertures in reciprocal space with the local crystallographic orientation, the method enhances contrast from defect-related strain fields, mirroring the principles of diffraction-contrast imaging in TEM, but without sample tilting. The approach capitalizes on the extensive diffraction space captured in a single high-quality EBSD scan, with its effectiveness enhanced by modern direct electron detectors that offer high-sensitivity at low accelerating voltages, reducing interaction volume and improving spatial resolution. We demonstrate that using OAVAs, identical imaging conditions can be applied across a polycrystalline field-of-view, enabling uniform contrast in differently oriented grains. Furthermore, in single-crystal GaN, threading dislocations are consistently resolved. Algorithms for the automated detection of dislocation contrast are presented, advancing defect characterization. By using OAVAs across a wide range of diffraction conditions in GaN, the visibility/invisibility of defects, owing to the anisotropy of the elastic strain field, is assessed and linked to candidate Burgers vectors. Altogether, OAVA offers a new and high-throughput pathway for orientation-specific defect characterization with the potential for automated, large-area defect analysis in single and polycrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Colossal dielectric response of HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal a colossal dielectric response of small (5 - 10 nm) oxygen-deficient HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles (x = 1 - 0.4), prepared by the solid-state organonitrate synthesis. The effective dielectric permittivity of the pressed HfxZr1-xO2 nanopowders has a pronounced maximum at 38 - 88 C, which shape can be fitted by the Curie-Weiss type dependence modified for the diffuse ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition. The maximal value of the dielectric permittivity increases from 1.5*10^3 (for x = 1) to 1.5*10^5 (for x= 0.4) at low frequencies (~4 Hz); being much smaller, namely changing from 7 (for x = 1) to 20 (for x = 0.4) at high frequencies (~500 kHz). The frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity maximum position is almost absent, meanwhile the shape and width of the maximum changes in a complex way with increase in frequency. The temperature dependencies of the dielectric permittivity and resistivity are almost mirror-like turned over in respect to each other, which means that all their features, such as position and shape of maxima, plateau, minima and inflexions, almost coincide after the mirror reflection in respect to the temperature axis. These correlations of resistivity and dielectric permittivity are well-described in the Heywang barrier model applied together with the variable range hopping conduction model in semiconducting ferroelectrics. The ferroelectric-like behavior of the small oxygen-deficient HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles is expected from the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory calculations. Obtained results may be useful for developing silicon-compatible functional nanomaterials based on HfxZr1-xO2 nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Thickness dependent rare earth segregation in magnetron deposited NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin films studied by Xray reflectivity and Hard Xray photoemission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic anisotropy of amorphous NdCo$_{4.6}$ compounds deposited by magnetron sputtering change with film thickness from in plane to out of plane anisotropy at thickness above 40 nm. Xray reflectivity measurements shows the progressive formation of an additional layer in between the 3 nm thick Si capping layer and the NdCo compound film. Hard Xray Photoemission spectroscoy (HAXPES) was used to analyze the composition and distribution of cobalt and neodymium at the top layers region of NdCo$_{4.6}$ films of thickness ranging from 5 nm to 65 nm using 7 keV, 10 keV and 13 keV incident photon energies, with inelastic electron mean free paths ranging from 7.2 nm to 12.3 nm in cobalt. The atomic cobalt concentration of the alloy deduced from HAXPES measurements at the Nd 3d and Co 2p excitations results to be below the nominal value, changing with thickness and incident photon energy. This proves a segregation of the rare earth at the surface of the NdCo$_{4.6}$ thin film which increases with thickness. The analysis of the background of the Co 2p and Nd 3d peaks was consistent with this conclusion. This demonstrates that neodymium incorporation in the cobalt lattice have a cost in energy which can be associated to strain due to the difference in volume between the two elements. The lowering of this strain energy will favor atomic anisotropic environments for neodymium that explains the perpendicular anisotropy and its thickness dependence of these NdCo compound films.</description>

      <title>Fock-Darwin states in a circular n-p junction of topological surface states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze and observe the Fock-Darwin (FD) states in a circular n-p junction (CNPJ) of topological surface states. Theoretically, in the CNPJ induced by the sub-surface point charge, the FD states of Dirac fermions are found to have a unique core-shell structure of trapped electrons and holes. The interplay between them is highly tunable by the magnetic field, which has no analog in their conventional counterparts and even in FD states of Dirac fermions confined by the most-studied parabolic-like potentials. A modified Einstein-Brillouin-Keller method is introduced to derive the electron-core states semiclassically. Experimentally, we obtain the clearly resolved FD states of topological surface states up to 14 Tesla which are very different from those of conventional electrons. Our data also visualizes directly directly the field-dependent potential landscape that may be modified by the electron-electron interactions in a CNPJ at the surface of a three-dimensional topological insulator thin film. Our findings signal the high tunability of the FD states of topological surface states in CNPJs that can be obtained by molecular beam epitaxy.</description>

      <title>Evidence for energy-dependent scattering dominating thermoelectricity in heavy fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the field of thermoelectric materials and devices, improving energy conversion efficiency remains a long-standing challenge. As a promising approach to address this issue, utilizing energy-dependent electron-scattering beyond the ordinary constant relaxation time approximation (CRTA) has been proposed. However, direct experimental evidence for an energy-dependent scattering reflected in the Seebeck coefficient is still lacking. Here we demonstrate using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy that the relaxation time of heavy fermion quasiparticles is highly dependent on the energy near the Fermi level. The observed energy dependence of the relaxation time is due to the coherent Kondo scattering, describing the sign of the Seebeck coefficient reasonably well, which cannot be deduced from CRTA. Our findings provide not only deeper insight into the understanding of thermoelectricity in correlated materials, but also future perspectives on possible orbital-selective engineering of thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Zeeman Quantum Geometry as a Probe of Unconventional Magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconventional magnets with momentum-dependent spin-splitting but zero net magnetization form a recently identified class of collinear magnets that are challenging to probe via conventional means. We show that these systems can be distinguished through their intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic (IGM) currents, enabled by the Zeeman quantum geometry, which captures the coupled response of electronic states to momentum translation and spin rotation. Examining two prototypical two-dimensional unconventional magnets with Rashba spin-orbit coupling, a time-reversal-broken $d$-wave altermagnet and a time-reversal-symmetric $p$-wave magnet, we uncover a direct link between crystalline symmetry, spin-split band structures, and transport signatures. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave altermagnet exhibits both transverse conduction and longitudinal displacement IGM currents, whereas the $p$-wave magnet supports only a transverse conduction IGM current. Remarkably, the mixed $d$-wave altermagnet supports all four types of IGM currents, including a longitudinal conduction current enabled by symmetric (Zeeman) Berry curvature that is forbidden in conventional quantum geometry. These responses, measurable via Hall transport and optical probes, persist even when conventional quantum geometry-driven linear responses vanish, offering unique access to hidden spin-split band structures. Our results establish Zeeman quantum geometry as both a diagnostic tool and a design principle for novel magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Reaction/Diffusion Competition Drives Anomalous Relaxation of Vitrimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since their discovery in 2011, vitrimers - covalent associative network polymers - have challenged the traditional understanding of soft matter relaxation dynamics: unlike in typical glass-forming liquids, vitrimers' viscous relaxation can be entirely decoupled from their underlying structural (segmental) dynamics. Beyond this fundamental mystery, the origin of vitrimers' Arrhenius viscosity in the presence of super-Arrhenius structural relaxation behavior has been of high interest due to vitrimers' potential to provide readily reprocessable high-performance plastics. Here, we combine simulations, theory, and experiments to establish a foundational understanding of vitrimer relaxation dynamics. We identify two types of transient networks based on the ratio of atomic displacement scales required for bond exchange to those required to relax a segment. In systems where bond exchange only requires sub-segmental motion, we show that network relaxation is governed by a competition between chemical exchange reactions and segmental diffusion. This competition produces vitrimers' signature network/segment decoupling, while also driving a crossover between Arrhenius and super-Arrhenius behavior that is observed for many vitrimers. This work provides an explanation for longstanding puzzling features of vitrimer dynamics and establishes a foundation for rational vitrimer design.</description>
