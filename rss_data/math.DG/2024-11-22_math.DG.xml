      <title>Einstein manifolds of negative lower bounds on curvature operator of the second Kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that $n$-dimension closed Einstein manifolds, whose smallest eigenvalue of the curvature operator of the second kind of $\mathring{R}$ satisfies $\lambda_1 \ge -\theta(n) \bar\lambda$, are either flat or round spheres, where $\bar \lambda$ is the average of the eigenvalues of $\mathring{R}$, and $\theta(n)$ is defined as in equation (1.2). Our result improves a celebrated result (Theorem 1.1) concerning Einstein manifolds with nonnegative curvature operator of the second kind.</description>

      <title>On comass and stable systolic inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the maximum ratio of the Euclidean norm to the comass norm of p-covectors in Euclidean n-space and improve the known upper bound found in the standard references by Whitney and Federer. We go on to prove stable systolic inequalities when the fundamental cohomology class of the manifold is a cup product of forms of lower degree.</description>

      <title>Rigidity Results for Compact Submanifolds with Pinched Ricci Curvature in Euclidean and Spherical Space Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For compact submanifolds in Euclidean and Spherical space forms with Ricci curvature bounded below by a function $\alpha(n,k,H,c)$ of mean curvature, we prove that the submanifold is either isometric to the Einstein Clifford torus, or a topological sphere for the maximal bound $\alpha(n,[\frac{n}{2}],H,c)$, or has up to $k$-th homology groups vanishing. This gives an almost complete (except for the differentiable sphere theorem) characterization of compact submanifolds with pinched Ricci curvature, generalizing celebrated rigidity results obtained by Ejiri, Xu-Tian, Xu-Gu, Xu-Leng-Gu, Vlachos, Dajczer-Vlachos.</description>

      <title>Statistical Biharmonicity of Identity Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tension field of the identity map from a statistical manifold to a Riemannian statistical manifold, which shares the same Riemannian metric, is the Tchevychev vector field multiplied by negative one. We derive a new class of statistical manifolds that satisfy the semi-equiaffine condition based on the statistical biharmonicity of the identity map. Furthermore, we determine the statistical structures of this class, when the pair of the manifold and the Riemannian metric is a simply connected complete Riemannian manifold of constant curvature.</description>

      <title>Harmonic maps to the circle with higher dimensional singular set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a closed, oriented ambient manifold $(M^n,g)$ we consider the problem of finding $\mathbb{S}^1$-valued harmonic maps with prescribed singular set. We show that the boundary of any oriented $(n-1)$-submanifold can be realised as the singular set of an $\mathbb{S}^1$-valued map, which is classically harmonic away from the singularity and distributionally harmonic across. If the singular set $\Gamma$ is also embedded and $C^{1,1}$, we consider three variational relaxations of the same problem and show that the energy of minimisers converges, after renormalisation, to the volume $\mathcal{H}^{n-2}(\Gamma)$ plus a lower-order "renormalised energy" -- common to all relaxations -- describing an energetic interaction between different components of the singular set.</description>

      <title>Closed geodesics on compact Lorentzian solvmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this work is the study of geodesics on Lorentzian homogeneous spaces of the form $M=G/\Lambda$, where $G$ is a solvable Lie group endowed with a bi-invariant Lorentzian metric and $\Lambda &lt; G$ is a cocompact lattice. Conditions to assert closedness of light, time or spacelike geodesics on the compact quotient spaces are given. This study implicitly requires additional information about the lattices in each case. We found conditions for which every lightlight geodesic on the quotient space is closed. And more important, this situation depends on the lattice. Moreover, even in dimension four, there are examples of compact solvmanifolds for which not every lightlike geodesic is closed. For time and spacelike geodesics, the conclusion are different. Finally, we study isometry groups of those compact spaces and show some computations in dimension six.</description>

      <title>Canonical foliation of bubblesheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new curvature condition for high-codimension submanifolds of a Riemannian ambient space, called quasi-parallel mean curvature (QPMC). The class of submanifolds with QPMC includes all CMC hypersurfaces and submanifolds with parallel mean curvature. We use our notion of QPMC to prove that certain kinds of high-curvature regions which appear in geometric flows, called bubblesheets, can be placed in a suitable normal form. This follows from a more general result asserting that the manifold $\mathbb{R}^k \times \mathbb{S}^{n-k}$, equipped with any metric which is sufficiently close to the standard one, admits a canonical foliation by embedded $(n-k)$-spheres with QPMC.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of K\"ahler--Frobenius manifolds and their classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to show that flat compact K\"ahler manifolds exhibit the structure of a Frobenius manifold, a structure originating in 2D Topological Quantum Field Theory and closely related to Joyce structure. As a result, we classify all such manifolds. It can be deduced that K\"ahler--Frobenius manifolds include certain Calabi--Yau manifolds, complex tori $T=\mathbb{C}^n/\mathbb{Z}^n$, Hantzsche--Wendt manifolds, hyperelliptic manifolds and manifolds of type $T/G$, where $G$ is a finite group acting on $T$ freely and containing no translations. An explicit study is provided for the two-dimensional case. Additionally, we can prove that Chern's conjecture for K\"ahler pre-Frobenius manifolds holds. Lastly, we establish that certain classes of K\"ahler-Frobenius manifolds share a direct relationship with theta functions which are important objects in number theory as well as complex analysis.</description>

      <title>Veronese polytopes: Extending the framework of cyclic polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces the theory of Veronese polytopes, a broad generalisation of cyclic polytopes. These arise as convex hulls of points on curves with one or more connected components, obtained as the image of the rational normal curve in affine charts. We describe their facial structure by extending Gale's evenness condition, and provide a further combinatorial characterisation of facets via $\sigma$-parity alternating sequences. Notably, we establish a bijective correspondence between combinatorial types of Veronese polytopes and partitions of finite sets equipped with a cyclic order, called circular compositions. We show that, although the only Veronese $3$-polytopes are the cyclic $3$-polytopes and the octahedron, in general dimension they form a rich and diverse class including all combinatorial types of simplicial $d$-polytopes with at most $d+3$ vertices, the cross-polytope and particular stacked polytopes. In addition, we characterise which curves defining Veronese polytopes are $d$-order curves, and provide a closed formula for the number of facets of any Veronese polytope.</description>

      <title>Einstein metrics on homogeneous superspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper initiates the study of the Einstein equation on homogeneous supermanifolds. First, we produce explicit curvature formulas for graded Riemannian metrics on these spaces. Next, we present a construction of homogeneous supermanifolds by means of Dynkin diagrams, resembling the construction of generalised flag manifolds in classical (non-super) theory. We describe the Einstein metrics on several classes of spaces obtained through this approach. Our results provide examples of compact homogeneous supermanifolds on which the Einstein equation has no solutions, discrete families of solutions, and continuous families of Ricci-flat solutions among invariant metrics. These examples demonstrate that the finiteness conjecture from classical homogeneous geometry fails on supermanifolds, and challenge the intuition furnished by Bochner's vanishing theorem.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the minimal surface system with large singular sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lawson and Osserman proved that the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface system is not always solvable in the class of Lipschitz maps. However, it is known that minimizing sequences (for area) of Lipschitz graphs converge to objects called Cartesian currents. Essentially nothing is known about these limits. We show that such limits can have surprisingly large interior vertical and non-minimal portions. This demonstrates a striking discrepancy between the parametric and non-parametric area minimization problems in higher codimension. Moreover, our construction has the smallest possible dimension ($n = 3$) and codimension $(m = 2)$.</description>

      <title>Topological Twisting of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Supersymmetric Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss what topological data must be provided to define topologically twisted partition functions of four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric field theories. The original example of Donaldson-Witten theory depends only on the diffeomorphism type of the spacetime and 't Hooft fluxes (characteristic classes of background gerbe connections, a.k.a. "one-form symmetry connections.") The example of $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ theories shows that, in general, the twisted partition functions depend on further topological data. We describe topological twisting for general four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories and argue that the topological partition functions depend on (a): the diffeomorphism type of the spacetime, (b): the characteristic classes of background gerbe connections and (c): a "generalized spin-c structure," a concept we introduce and define. The main ideas are illustrated with both Lagrangian theories and class $\mathcal{S}$ theories. In the case of class $\mathcal{S}$ theories of $A_1$ type, we note that the different $S$-duality orbits of a theory associated with a fixed UV curve $C_{g,n}$ can have different topological data.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study extremal subsets in Alexandrov spaces with dimension $n$, curvature $\ge\kappa$, and diameter $\le D$. We show that the following three quantities are uniformly bounded above in terms of $n$, $\kappa$, and $D$: (1) the number of extremal subsets in an Alexandrov space; (2) the Betti numbers of an extremal subset; (3) the volume of an extremal subset. The proof is an application of essential coverings introduced by Yamaguchi.</description>

      <title>On the formality of nearly K\"ahler manifolds and of Joyce's examples in $G_2$-holonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.10915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a prominent conjecture (relating Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology) that all simply-connected compact manifolds of special holonomy should be formal spaces, i.e., their rational homotopy type should be derivable from their rational cohomology algebra already -- an as prominent as particular property in rational homotopy theory. Special interest now lies on exceptional holonomy $G_2$ and $Spin(7)$. In this article we provide a method of how to confirm that the famous Joyce examples of holonomy $G_2$ indeed are formal spaces; we concretely exert this computation for one example which may serve as a blueprint for the remaining Joyce examples (potentially also of holonomy $Spin(7)$). These considerations are preceded by another result identifying the formality of manifolds admitting special structures: we prove the formality of nearly K\"ahler manifolds. A connection between these two results can be found in the fact that both "special holonomy" and "nearly K\"ahler" naturally generalize compact K\"ahler manifolds, whose formality is a classical and celebrated theorem by Deligne-Griffiths-Morgan-Sullivan.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each positive integer $g$ we use variational methods to construct a genus $g$ self-shrinker $\Sigma_g$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with entropy less than $2$ and prismatic symmetry group $\mathbb{D}_{g+1}\times\mathbb{Z}_2$. For $g$ sufficiently large, the self-shrinker $\Sigma_g$ has two graphical asymptotically conical ends and the sequence $\Sigma_g$ converges on compact subsets to a plane with multiplicity two as $g\to\infty$. Angenent-Chopp-Ilmanen conjectured the existence of such self-shrinkers in 1995 based on numerical experiments. Using these surfaces as initial conditions for large $g$, we obtain examples of mean curvature flows in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with smooth initial non-compact data that evolve non-uniquely after their first singular time.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we survey some results on Ricci flowing non-smooth initial data. Among other things, we give a non-exhaustive list of various weak initial data which can be evolved with the Ricci flow. We also survey results which show that various curvature lower bounds will, possibly up to a constant, be preserved, if we start with such possibly non-smooth initial data. Some proofs/proof sketches are given in certain cases. A list of some open problems related to these areas is given in the last section of the paper.</description>

Abstract: Building on previous results on the quadratic helicity in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) we investigate particular minimum helicity states. Those are eigenfunctions of the curl operator and are shown to constitute solutions of the quasi-stationary incompressible ideal MHD equations. We then show that these states have indeed minimum quadratic helicity.</description>

      <title>Higher spins and Finsler geometry</title>

Abstract: Finsler geometry is a natural generalization of (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry, where the line element is not the square root of a quadratic form but a more general homogeneous function. Parameterizing this in terms of symmetric tensors suggests a possible interpretation in terms of higher-spin fields. We will see here that, at linear level in these fields, the Finsler version of the Ricci tensor leads to the curved-space Fronsdal equation for all spins, plus a Stueckelberg-like coupling. Nonlinear terms can also be systematically analyzed, suggesting a possible interacting structure. No particular choice of spacetime dimension is needed. The Stueckelberg mechanism breaks gauge transformations to a redundancy that does not change the geometry. This creates a serious issue: non-transverse modes are not eliminated, at least for the versions of Finsler dynamics examined in this paper.</description>

      <title>Categorical quantization on K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizing deformation quantizations with separation of variables of a K\"ahler manifold $M$, we adopt Fedosov's gluing argument to construct a category $\mathsf{DQ}$, enriched over sheaves of $\mathbb{C}[[\hbar]]$-modules on $M$, as a quantization of the category of Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles over $M$ with morphisms being smooth sections of hom-bundles.
  We then define quantizable morphisms among objects in $\mathsf{DQ}$, generalizing Chan-Leung-Li's notion [4] of quantizable functions. Upon evaluation of quantizable morphisms at $\hbar = \tfrac{\sqrt{-1}}{k}$, we obtain an enriched category $\mathsf{DQ}_{\operatorname{qu}, k}$. We show that, when $M$ is prequantizable, $\mathsf{DQ}_{\operatorname{qu}, k}$ is equivalent to the category $\mathsf{GQ}$ of holomorphic vector bundles over $M$ with morphisms being holomorphic differential operators, via a functor obtained from Bargmann-Fock actions.</description>
