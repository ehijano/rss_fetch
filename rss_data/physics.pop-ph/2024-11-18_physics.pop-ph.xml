      <title>The Epistemology of Contemporary Physics: Classical Mechanics II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper of "The Epistemology of Contemporary Physics" series we investigate Newton's third law and discuss and analyze its epistemological significance from some aspects with special attention to its relation to the principle of conservation of linear and angular momentum. The main issue in this investigation is the potential violations of this law according to the claims made in the literature of mainstream physics. This issue may cast a shadow on the validity of classical mechanics, and its Newtonian formulation in particular, formally and epistemologically and could have important implications and consequences on contemporary physics in general. However, what is more important about this issue from our perspective is the lack of clarity, comprehensibility and coherence in the investigation and analysis of this issue and its implications marked by the absence of appropriate conceptual and epistemological frameworks to deal with this issue properly and systematically. As a result, what we find in the literature is a collection of contradicting views which are mostly based on personal choices and preferences and selective or biased theoretical analysis with the lack of proper experimental verification and substantiation.</description>

      <title>A Simple Experimental System for Predicting the Temperature Rise of the Global Warming Induced by the Greenhouse Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report, a simple experimental system is shown, by which the temperature rise of global warming due to greenhouse gases can be demonstrated quantitatively. The system configuration is similar to that of the earth-atmosphere-space system based on a simple gray atmosphere model. The space (heat sink), the ground surface and the radiation power from the sun were replaced by a liquid nitrogen, and a black coated aluminum plated with an electric heater and an electric power of the heater, respectively. We believe that it can be a unique experimental system, that is useful for the study of the greenhouse effect in a laboratory, as well as for the educational demonstration tool of this phenomenon.</description>
