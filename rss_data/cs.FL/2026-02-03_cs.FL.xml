      <title>On Normality and Equidistribution for Separator Enumerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A separator is a countable dense subset of $[0,1)$, and a separator enumerator is a naming scheme that assigns a real number in $[0,1)$ to each finite word so that the set of all named values is a separator. Mayordomo introduced separator enumerators to define $f$-normality and a relativized finite-state dimension $\dim^{f}_{\mathrm{FS}}(x)$, where finite-state dimension measures the asymptotic lower rate of finite-state information needed to approximate $x$ through its $f$-names. This framework extends classical base-$k$ normality, and Mayordomo showed that it supports a point-to-set principle for finite-state dimension. This representation-based viewpoint has since been developed further in follow-up work, including by Calvert et al., yielding strengthened randomness notions such as supernormal and highly normal numbers.
  Mayordomo posed the following open question: can $f$-normality be characterized via equidistribution properties of the sequence $\left(|\Sigma|^{n} a^{f}_{n}(x)\right)_{n=0}^{\infty}$, where $a^{f}_{n}(x)$ is the sequence of best approximations to $x$ from below induced by $f$? We give a strong negative answer: we construct computable separator enumerators $f_0,f_1$ and a point $x$ such that $a^{f_0}_{n}(x)=a^{f_1}_{n}(x)$ for all $n$, yet $\dim^{f_0}_{\mathrm{FS}}(x)=0$ while $\dim^{f_1}_{\mathrm{FS}}(x)=1$. Consequently, no criterion depending only on the sequence $\left(|\Sigma|^{n} a^{f}_{n}(x)\right)_{n=0}^{\infty}$ - in particular, no equidistribution property of this sequence - can characterize $f$-normality uniformly over all separator enumerators. On the other hand, for a natural finite-state coherent class of separator enumerators we recover a complete equidistribution characterization of $f$-normality.</description>

      <title>A Complexity Bound for Determinisation of Min-Plus Weighted Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determinisation problem for min-plus (tropical) weighted automata was recently shown to be decidable. However, the proof is purely existential, relying on several non-constructive arguments. Our contribution in this work is twofold: first, we present the first complexity bound for this problem, placing it in the Fast-growing hierarchy. Second, our techniques introduce a versatile framework to analyse runs of weighted automata in a constructive manner. In particular, this significantly simplifies the previous decidability argument and provides a tighter analysis, thus serving as a critical step towards a tight complexity bound.</description>

      <title>Well-Formed Free-Choice Petri Nets Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of free-choice Petri nets is an established field, initiated in the 1970s by Commoner and Hack at MIT. We revisit well-formed free-choice nets (those admitting markings that are both live and bounded) and provide a new characterization by introducing semi-T-components. This notion is dual to that of semi-S-components, which in turn correspond to the well-known minimal siphons. By highlighting the symmetry between these dual concepts, we derive the classical coverability theorems for T- and S-components, as well as the duality theorem -- stating that a free-choice net is well-formed if and only if its reverse-dual is also well-formed -- using arguments that are as symmetric as possible.</description>

      <title>Deciding Reachability and the Covering Problem with Diagnostics for Sound Acyclic Free-Choice Workflow Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central decision problem in Petri net theory is reachability asking whether a given marking can be reached from the initial marking. Related is the covering problem (or sub-marking reachbility), which decides whether there is a reachable marking covering at least the tokens in the given marking. For live and bounded free-choice nets as well as for sound free-choice workflow nets, both problems are polynomial in their computational complexity. This paper refines this complexity for the class of sound acyclic free-choice workflow nets to a quadratic polynomial, more specifically to $O(P^2 + T^2)$. Furthermore, this paper shows the feasibility of accurately explaining why a given marking is or is not reachable. This can be achieved by three new concepts: admissibility, maximum admissibility, and diverging transitions. Admissibility requires that all places in a given marking are pairwise concurrent. Maximum admissibility states that adding a marked place to an admissible marking would make it inadmissible. A diverging transition is a transition which originally "produces" the concurrent tokens that lead to a given marking. In this paper, we provide algorithms for all these concepts and explain their computation in detail by basing them on the concepts of concurrency and post-dominance frontiers - a well known concept from compiler construction. In doing this, we present straight-forward implementations for solving (sub-marking) reachability.</description>

      <title>LOGOS-CA: A Cellular Automaton Using Natural Language as State and Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained solely on massive text data, have achieved high performance on the Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), a benchmark proposed to measure commonsense knowledge and reasoning abilities about the real world. This suggests that the language produced by humanity describes a significant portion of the world with considerable nuance. In this study, we attempt to harness the high expressive power of language within cellular automata. Specifically, we express cell states and rules in natural language and delegate their updates to an LLM. Through this approach, cellular automata can transcend the constraints of merely numerical states and fixed rules, providing us with a richer platform for simulation. Here, we propose LOGOS-CA (Language Oriented Grid Of Statements - Cellular Automaton) as a natural framework to achieve this and examine its capabilities. We confirmed that LOGOS-CA successfully performs simple forest fire simulations and also serves as an intriguing subject for investigation from an Artificial Life (ALife) perspective. In this paper, we report the results of these experiments and discuss directions for future research using LOGOS-CA.</description>

      <title>Recursive numeral systems are highly regular and easy to process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27049v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Much recent work has shown how cross-linguistic variation is constrained by competing pressures from efficient communication. However, little attention has been paid to the role of the systematicity of forms (regularity), a key property of natural language. Here, we demonstrate the importance of regularity in explaining the shape of linguistic systems by looking at recursive numeral systems. Previous work has argued that these systems optimise the trade-off between lexicon size and average morphosyntatic complexity (Deni\'c and Szymanik, 2024). However, showing that only natural-language-like systems optimise this trade-off has proven elusive, and existing solutions rely on ad-hoc constraints to rule out unnatural systems (Yang and Regier, 2025). Drawing on the Minimum Description Length (MDL) approach, we argue that recursive numeral systems are better viewed as efficient with regard to their regularity and processing complexity. We show that our MDL-based measures of regularity and processing complexity better capture the key differences between attested, natural systems and theoretically possible ones, including "optimal" recursive numeral systems from previous work, and that the ad-hoc constraints naturally follow from regularity. Our approach highlights the need to incorporate regularity across sets of forms in studies attempting to measure efficiency in language.</description>
