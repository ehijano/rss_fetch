      <title>Phase modulation detection of a strontium atom interferometer gyroscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a strontium thermal beam atom interferometer gyroscope (AIG) on a rotation table using the $^{1\!}S_0$-$ ^{3\!}P_1$ intercombination line, and measure large rotation rates exceeding 6 rad/s. Our demonstration relies upon a transit-time-resonant (TTR), phase modulation technique for detecting the AIG phase which rejects signal background and variations in fringe amplitude.</description>

      <title>Trap-induced atom-ion complexes: a time-independent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A trapped ion immersed in a neutral bath shows long-lived atom-ion complexes that significantly alter its chemical properties, and, thus the ion stability. In this work, we present a general study of trapped ion-atom scattering with the ion modeled as a charge distribution defined by the spatial extent of its ground-state wavefunction. After mapping the time-dependent problem onto a time-independent framework, we investigate the role of the trap, the atomic species, atom-ion interaction, and collision energy in shaping the chaotic dynamics of the system. We find that the probability of atom-ion complex formation directly measures its chaoticity. Therefore, our results establish a clear relationship between the emergence of chaotic scattering and the presence of ion-atom complexes.</description>

      <title>Loading and decay dynamics of an optical dipole trap using spatio-temporal Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we present our studies on intra-trap dynamics of an optical dipole trap (ODT) loaded from a Magneto-optical trap (MOT) of $^{87}$Rb atoms. A spatio-temporal Monte Carlo (MC) simulation approach has been employed in conjunction with the semi-classical theory based calculations for estimation of various intra-trap two-body loss parameters in the ODT. The temporal MC method based on estimated parameters from spatial MC, gives a close estimation of the experimentally observed atom-number evolution in ODT. We also find that, the decay rate of atoms in an ODT is dominated by momentum-transfer elastic collisions in the absence of MOT beams. However, in presence of MOT beams, the radiative escape process is the dominant two-body loss mechanism in the trap, which surpasses the fine-structure changing and hyperfine changing collisional losses by nearly an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Orders-of-magnitude improved precision spectroscopy of an inner-shell orbital clock transition in neutral ytterbium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An inner-shell orbital clock transition $^1S_0 \leftrightarrow 4f^{13}5d6s^2 \: (J=2)$ in neutral ytterbium atoms has attracted much attention as a new optical frequency standard as well as a highly sensitive probe to several new physics phenomena, such as ultra-light dark matter, violation of local Lorentz invariance, and a new Yukawa potential between electrons and neutrons. Here, we demonstrate almost two-orders-of-magnitude improved precision spectroscopy over the previous reports by trapping atoms in a three-dimensional magic-wavelength optical lattice. In particular, we successfully observe the coherent Rabi oscillation, the relaxation dynamics of the excited state, and the interorbital Feshbach resonance. To highlight the high precision of our spectroscopy, we carry out precise isotope shift measurements between five stable bosonic isotopes well below 10 Hz uncertainties, successfully setting bounds for a hypothetical boson mediating a force between electrons and neutrons. These results open up the way for various new physics search experiments and a wide range of applications to quantum science with this clock transition.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling for trapped-ion thermometry using dark resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate simulation of vibrational energy transport and quantum thermodynamics with trapped ions requires good methods for the estimation of temperatures. One valuable tool with this purpose is based on the fit of dark resonances in the fluorescence spectrum. However, the reliability of the procedure is still unclear. Here, we discuss several techniques with simplified dynamical equations for the numerical simulation of the spectrum of a trapped ion undergoing thermal motion, identifying advantages and limitations of each method. We start with a simplified three-level model to provide a better insight into the approximations involved and then move on to tackle the experimentally relevant case of an eight-level calcium ion. We observe that mimicking the effect of thermal motion by means of additional dephasing is computationally very convenient but can lead to significant errors in the estimation of the temperature. However, this can be counteracted by a proper calibration, supporting the use of dark resonances as a practical thermometer.</description>

      <title>Light propagation through an atomic vapor with non-orthogonal electric field modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkali-metal atomic vapors are the foundation of an ever-growing range of applications, driven by a comprehensive understanding of their interaction with light. In particular, many models have been developed which characterize this interaction for low intensity laser fields. An atomic medium subject to an external magnetic field of arbitrary direction exhibits two electric field modes that, in general, are non-orthogonal. Mode non-orthogonality is currently neglected by the models used in this context. We derive a new light propagation formalism which takes into account the non-zero overlap of the two modes. We verify the theory using weak-probe spectroscopy of the Rb D$_{2}$ line, showing excellent agreement with experiment. The predictions of the new theory can be exploited, and optimized, to design better atomic photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Observation of Order and Disorder in Solid-Electrolyte Interphases of Lithium-Metal Anodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Battery interfaces critically influence lithium-metal battery performance through their role in ion diffusion and dendrite formation. However, structural characterization of these interfaces has remained challenging due to limitations in high-resolution methods and artifacts from electron irradiation. Using cryogenic conditions for both specimen preparation and scanning electron nanobeam diffraction, we can determine the structural organization at the interface between the vitrified electrolyte and adjacent layers. We identified two distinct interface types: one showing short-range order adjacent to lithium metal, and another displaying a mixed structure of short-range ordering and defective lithium fluoride nanoscale crystallites at a copper collector. Notably, short-range order appeared exclusively in electrolytes demonstrating high reversibility. Our results establish that solid-electrolyte-interphase structure directly influences lithium deposition morphology and battery performance. This methodology opens new possibilities for high-resolution characterization of interfaces in energy storage materials, advancing our understanding of their critical structural properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum CNOT Gate with Actively Synchronized Photon Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the synchronization of photons from probabilistic quantum sources plays a pivotal role in advancing efficient quantum information processing. We report the realization of a probabilistic entangling gate operating on actively synchronized photon pairs, using a quantum memory based on warm atomic vapor. We achieve a truth-table fidelity exceeding 85% and demonstrate Bell- inequality violation for all four Bell states. The reduction in visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference introduced by the storage process is identified as a primary factor limiting the gate fidelity. We derive an exact quantitative relation between HOM visibility and gate fidelity for pure single photons, which applies to all photonic gates relying on interference, regardless of the physical platform.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating Dynamic Stability in Paul Traps: Exploring Rotating Saddles with Liquid Nitrogen Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating saddle potentials provide a compelling visual demonstration of dynamic stability, widely used in undergraduate physics as mechanical analogs to the RF Paul trap. Traditional demonstrations typically rely on rolling ball bearings, whose frictional effects and internal rotation obscure fundamental particle dynamics. We introduce a simple yet significant improvement by employing droplets of liquid nitrogen LN2, which levitate via the Leidenfrost effect, eliminating rolling dynamics and greatly reducing friction. LN2 droplets clearly illustrate the rotating ponderomotive-like force, producing trajectories closely consistent with theoretical predictions. Using experimental data, we compare the stability threshold and particle trajectories of LN2 droplets and traditional ball bearings. LN2 droplets exhibit a sharply defined and visually distinct stability threshold, transitioning abruptly from unstable to stable motion at a critical rotation frequency. In contrast, ball bearings demonstrate a more gradual threshold, accompanied by trajectories complicated by friction-induced deviations. We present detailed measurements of particle lifetimes and trajectories as functions of dimensionless stability parameters for both symmetric and intentionally asymmetric saddles. These improvements significantly enhance visual and conceptual clarity, reduce common misconceptions related to frictional dynamics, and provide natural opportunities for exploring related phenomena such as the Leidenfrost effect. We also offer practical guidance on assembling and implementing this enhanced demonstration for effective classroom and laboratory instruction.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Frequency Metrology with Optimal Ramsey Interferometry in Optical Atomic Clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency metrology is a cornerstone of modern precision measurements and optical atomic clocks have emerged as the most precise measurement devices. In this progress report, we explore various Ramsey interrogation schemes tailored to optical atomic clocks primarily limited by laser noise. To incorporate frequency fluctuations directly into the theoretical model, we consider a Bayesian framework. In this context, we review fundamental bounds arising in Bayesian estimation theory, which serve as a benchmark throughout this work. We investigate the trade-off between entanglement-enhanced sensitivity and robustness against laser noise in order to identify optimal initial states, measurement schemes and estimation strategies. Beside standard protocols based on coherent spin states, squeezed spin states and GHZ states, we consider variational Ramsey protocols implemented via low-depth quantum circuits based on one-axis twisting operations to approach optimal stability. In particular, we review known and identify new optimal interrogation schemes for a variety of scenarios, including different experimental platforms, ensemble sizes and regimes characterized by a wide range of interrogation durations and dead times. Hence, this work establishes a comprehensive theoretical framework for optimizing Ramsey interrogation schemes, providing guidance for the development of next-generation optical atomic clocks.</description>

      <title>Clock precision beyond the Standard Quantum Limit at $10^{-18}$ level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical atomic clocks with unrivaled precision and accuracy have advanced the frontier of precision measurement science and opened new avenues for exploring fundamental physics. A fundamental limitation on clock precision is the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), which stems from the uncorrelated projection noise of each atom. State-of-the-art optical lattice clocks interrogate large ensembles to minimize the SQL, but density-dependent frequency shifts pose challenges to scaling the atom number. The SQL can be surpassed, however, by leveraging entanglement, though it remains an open problem to achieve quantum advantage from spin squeezing at state-of-the-art stability levels. Here we demonstrate clock performance beyond the SQL, achieving a fractional frequency precision of 1.1 $\times 10^{-18}$ for a single spin-squeezed clock. With cavity-based quantum nondemolition (QND) measurements, we prepare two spin-squeezed ensembles of $\sim$30,000 strontium atoms confined in a two-dimensional optical lattice. A synchronous clock comparison with an interrogation time of 61 ms achieves a metrological improvement of 2.0(2) dB beyond the SQL, after correcting for state preparation and measurement errors. These results establish the most precise entanglement-enhanced clock to date and offer a powerful platform for exploring the interplay of gravity and quantum entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that resonant absorption of smooth laser fields can yield Mollow-like triplet patterns. General conditions for such triplets are derived and illustrated with a super-Gaussian pulse sequence. Gaussian pulses can not exhibit triplets, super-Gaussian pulses can form triplets depending on the pulse area and flat-top pulses can produce absorption triplets after one Rabi cycle. Our results are compared side-by-side with resonance fluorescence to emphasize similarities and differences between these unlike observables. In the high-intensity limit, we show that the central absorption peak is asymmetric, which we attribute to non-linear photoionization, beyond two-level atomic physics.</description>

      <title>Interplay between external driving, dissipation and collective effects in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03297v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how external driving and dissipation jointly influence the dynamics of open quantum systems is essential for advancing the study of non-equilibrium quantum phenomena and developing quantum technologies. The present study addresses the issue by exploring the behavior of open systems in driven optical setups coupled to a bosonic field. Starting from an exact non-Markovian master equation for linear systems, we extend the analysis to an ensemble of quantum emitters and validate the proposed solution. The analytical results unveil a range of intriguing phenomena, including pronounced non-Markovian corrections to the coherent driving and a collective cross-driving effect. These effects are experimentally accessible in platforms such as cavity QED, photonic crystals, and state-dependent optical lattices. In the Markovian limit, comparison with exact solutions reveal short-time non-Markovian effects that endure well beyond the environmental correlation decay time, alongside memory effects triggered by short laser pulses. These findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of driven open systems, laying the groundwork for precise quantum state control.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal interactions induce frequency shifts in superradiant lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiant lasers, which consist of incoherently driven atoms coupled to a lossy cavity, are a promising source of coherent light due to their stable frequency and superior narrow linewidth. We show that when a fraction of the atoms is not driven, a shift in the lasing frequency and a broadening of the linewidth occur, limiting the performance of a superradiant laser. We explain this behavior by identifying nonreciprocal interactions between driven and undriven atoms, i.e., competing alignment and antialignment of their dipoles. Our results have implications for the realization of superradiant lasers, establishing the relevance of nonreciprocal phenomena for quantum technologies.</description>
