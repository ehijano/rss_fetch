      <title>Solving the Kinetic Ising Model with Non-Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are a generic feature of non-equilibrium systems. We define a non-reciprocal generalization of the kinetic Ising model in one spatial dimension. We solve the model exactly using two different approaches for infinite, semi-infinite and finite systems with either periodic or open boundary conditions. The exact solution allows us to explore a range of novel phenomena tied to non-reciprocity like non-reciprocity induced frustration and wave phenomena with interesting parity-dependence for finite systems of size $N$.
  We study dynamical questions like the approach to equilibrium with various boundary conditions. We find new regimes, separated by $N^{th}$-order exceptional points, which can be classified as overdamped, underdamped and critically damped phases. Despite these new regimes, long-time order is only present at zero temperature. Additionally, we explore the low-energy behavior of the system in various limits, including the ageing and spatio-temporal Porod regimes, demonstrating that non-reciprocity induces unique scaling behavior at zero temperature. Lastly, we present general results for systems where spins interact with no more than two spins, outlining the conditions under which long-time order may exist.</description>

      <title>A Martingale-Free Introduction to Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Conditional Gaussian Nonlinear System (CGNS) is a broad class of nonlinear stochastic dynamical systems. Given the trajectories for a subset of state variables, the remaining follow a Gaussian distribution. Despite the conditionally linear structure, the CGNS exhibits strong nonlinearity, thus capturing many non-Gaussian characteristics observed in nature through its joint and marginal distributions. Desirably, it enjoys closed analytic formulae for the time evolution of its conditional Gaussian statistics, which facilitate the study of data assimilation and other related topics. In this paper, we develop a martingale-free approach to improve the understanding of CGNSs. This methodology provides a tractable approach to proving the time evolution of the conditional statistics by deriving results through time discretization schemes, with the continuous-time regime obtained via a formal limiting process as the discretization time-step vanishes. This discretized approach further allows for developing analytic formulae for optimal posterior sampling of unobserved state variables with correlated noise. These tools are particularly valuable for studying extreme events and intermittency and apply to high-dimensional systems. Moreover, the approach improves the understanding of different sampling methods in characterizing uncertainty. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through a physics-constrained, triad-interaction climate model with cubic nonlinearity and state-dependent cross-interacting noise.</description>

      <title>Exact calculation of the large deviation function for $k$-nary coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study probabilities of rare events in the general coalescence process, $kA\rightarrow \ell A$, where $k&gt;\ell$. For arbitrary $k, \ell$, by rewriting these probabilities in terms of an effective action, we derive the large deviation function describing the probability of finding $N$ particles at time $t$, when starting with $M$ particles initially. Additionally, the most probable trajectory corresponding to a fixed rare event is derived.</description>

      <title>2D magnetic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is a contribution to the proceedings of the 33rd/35th International Colloquium on Group Theoretical Methods in Physics (ICGTMP, Group33/35) held in Cotonou, Benin, July 15-19, 2024. The stability of matter is an old and mathematically difficult problem, relying both on the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics and on the exclusion principle of quantum statistics. We consider here the stability of the self-interacting almost-bosonic anyon gas, generalizing the Gross-Pitaevskii / nonlinear Schr\"odinger energy functionals to include magnetic self interactions. We show that there is a type of supersymmetry in the model which holds only for higher values of the magnetic coupling but is broken for lower values, and that in the former case supersymmetric ground states exist precisely at even-integer quantized values of the coupling. These states constitute a manifold of explicit solitonic vortex solutions whose densities solve a generalized Liouville equation, and can be regarded as nonlinear generalizations of Landau levels. The reported work is joint with Alireza Ataei and Dinh-Thi Nguyen and makes an earlier analysis of self-dual abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs theory by Jackiw and Pi, Hagen, and others, mathematically rigorous.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced synchronization in coupled quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamics of a pair of coupled quantum oscillators coupled to a common correlated dissipative environment. The resulting equations of motion for both the operator moments and covariances can be integrated analytically using the Lyapunov equations. We find that for fully correlated and fully anti-correlated environments, the oscillators relax into a phase-synchronized state that persists for long times when the two oscillators are nearly resonant and (essentially) forever if the two oscillators are in resonance. This can be traced to the symmetry of the Lindblad dissipator, which can lead to strong damping in one region of state space and under damping in others. In the extreme cases of fully correlated or fully anti-correlated environments, specific regions of state space are fully decoupled from the environment. We also show that the environmental noise correlation leads to quantum entanglement, and all the correlations between the two oscillators are purely quantum mechanical in origin. This work provides a robust mathematical foundation for understanding how long-lived exciton coherences can be linked to vibronic correlation effects.</description>
