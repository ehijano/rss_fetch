      <title>Solvability of the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for the heat equation implies parabolic uniform rectifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be an open set in space-time with boundary $\Sigma = \partial \Omega$. Under minimal and natural background assumptions - namely, that $\Sigma$ is time-symmetrically parabolic Ahlfors--David regular and that $\Omega$ satisfies an interior corkscrew condition - we treat a one-phase parabolic free boundary problem which establishes the necessity of parabolic uniform rectifiability for $L^p(d\sigma)$ solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the heat equation. More precisely, we prove that if the caloric measure associated with $\Omega$ satisfies a weak-$A_\infty$ condition with respect to the surface measure $\sigma = \mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{par}}^{n+1}\!\lfloor_{\Sigma}$, then $\Sigma$ is parabolically uniformly rectifiable, hence equivalently, that solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the heat (or adjoint heat) equation in $\Omega$ with boundary data in $L^p(d\sigma)$, for some $p \in (1,\infty)$, implies parabolic uniform rectifiability. Our main theorem thus identifies parabolic uniform rectifiability as the correct geometric framework for boundary regularity, and $L^p$ solvability, in the parabolic setting.</description>

      <title>Late-time tail for a scalar quasilinear wave equation satisfying the weak null condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of scalar quasilinear wave equations in three spatial dimensions satisfying the weak null condition. For solutions arising from small, localized, smooth data, we give an asymptotic formula describing the global asymptotics towards the future. We prove that the late-time asymptotics is given by a continuous superposition of decay rates, in stark contrast to equations satisfying a null condition.
  The asymptotic formula we obtain is given in terms of a solution to the linear wave equation. Combining this with analysis on the linear wave equation, we strengthen some rigidity results of the third author, showing in particular that any solution with a faster time decay than expected away from the wave zone must vanish identically.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional anisotropic mean curvature flow with contact angle condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study surfaces which evolve by anisotropic mean curvature flow with contact angle boundary condition over a strictly convex domain in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We establish a prior gradient estimate for smooth solutions to this boundary value problem. The same approach can also handle Dirichlet boundary condition in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq 2$. For both problems, we prove that the solutions converge to one that is translation invariant in time.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic mean curvature flow with contact angle and Neumann boundary conditions in arbitrary dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over a bounded strictly convex domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with smooth boundary, we establish a priori gradient estimate for an anisotropic mean curvature flow with prescribed contact angle and Neumann boundary conditions. The estimates require careful analysis of the degeneracy property of the anisotropic mean curvature operator. As a result, for both problems, we can infer that the solutions converge to one that is translation invariant in time.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and finite-time extinction of a PDE-ODE spatial-network model with anisotropic diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of reaction-diffusion equations posed on a bounded domain composed of subdomains separated by a connected network with a metric graph structure. The reaction-diffusion dynamics with anisotropic diffusion on the graph edges are coupled to well-mixed ODE dynamics occurring at the vertices by junction conditions, and to similar PDE dynamics occurring on adjacent subdomains through Robin-like boundary conditions. The resulting PDE-ODE system can be used in epidemiological and ecological settings to study population movement in between cluster centers along road-like structures and into the surrounding continuum. We employ a semi-Galerkin approximation to establish the well-posedness of weak solutions to the PDE-ODE system, and examine further properties such as regularity, boundedness and finite-time extinction.</description>

      <title>Normalized solutions to critical Choquard systems with linear and nonlinear couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the critical Choquard system with both linear and nonlinear couplings
  $-\Delta v_1 + \mu_1 v_1 = ( I_\omega * |v_1|^{2_\omega^*} ) |v_1|^{2_\omega^* -2} v_1 + \theta p( I_\omega * |v_2|^q)|v_1|^{p-2} v_1 + \varepsilon v_2, \quad in \,\, \mathbb{R}^N,
  -\Delta v_2 + \mu_2 v_2 = ( I_\omega * |v_2|^{2_\omega^*} ) |v_2|^{2_\omega^* -2} v_2 + \theta q( I_\omega * |v_1|^p)|v_2|^{q-2} v_2 + \varepsilon v_1 , \quad in \,\, \mathbb{R}^N ,
  \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} v_1^2 = \alpha_1^2\, , \int_{\mathbb{R}^N} v_2^2 = \alpha_2^2,$
  where $N=3\,\, \text{or} \,\, 4$, $\alpha_1,\alpha_2 &gt; 0 $, $\theta &gt; 0 $, $2_{\omega,*} :=\frac{N+\omega}{N} &lt;p,q&lt;2_\omega^*:=\frac{N+\omega}{N-2}$, $\varepsilon&gt;0$, $0&lt;\omega&lt;N$, $I_\omega: \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ represents the Riesz potential. For the $L^2$-subcritical case $p+q&lt;\frac{2N+2\omega+4}{N}$, we utilize the Ekeland's variational principle to obtain the existence of a positive normalized ground state for the system as $0&lt;\theta&lt;\theta_0,\;0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;\varepsilon_*$. For the $L^2$-supercritical case $p+q&gt;\frac{2N+2\omega+4}{N}$, we apply variational methods to establish the existence of a positive normalized ground state for the system as $\theta&gt;\theta_*,\;0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;\overline{\varepsilon}$.</description>

      <title>Quantiative Hypocoercivity and Lifting of Classical and Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantitative convergence analysis for hypocoercive dynamics such as Langevin and Lindblad equations describing classical and quantum open systems. Our goal is to provide an overview of recent results of hypocoercivity estimates based on space-time Poincare inequality, providing a unified treatment for classical and quantum dynamics. Furthermore, we also present a unified lifting framework for accelerating both classical and quantum Markov semigroups, which leads to upper and lower bounds of convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Traveling waves in nonclassical diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of monotone traveling wave solutions in a class of nonclassical diffusion equations that include both standard diffusion and a higher-order mixed space-time dispersive term. The reaction term is nonlinear and subject to general structural conditions. By employing the method of upper and lower solutions, using less smooth super and subsolutions, we construct a monotone iterative scheme within a convex set and prove its convergence using Schauder's fixed point theorem. Explicit constructions of super and subsolutions are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the behavior of the solutions to the Robin problem in bounded $1$-sided NTA domains with Ahlfors-David regular boundary, generalizing the results of \cite{DavDEMM} to the case of a non constant Robin parameter. In particular, we will prove the mutual absolute continuity of the Robin harmonic measure with respect to the surface measure in the setting of variable permeability.</description>

      <title>New cost terms through the homogenization of an optimal control problem under dynamic boundary conditions on the microscopic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an optimal control problem on a heterogeneous body with a periodical structure of particles depending on a small parameter e, we study the asymptotic behavior, as e converges to zero, of the optimal control functional and the optimal state when the initial problem is of parabolic type, and when on the particles' boundary, we assume a dynamic condition and the actuation of some controls for some subset of the particles. We show, in the so-called "critical case" (concerning a certain relation between the structure's period, the diameter of the balls, and the growth coefficient of the particles boundary condition), the appearance of some new non-local in time "strange terms", not only in the limit parabolic equation but also in the limit cost functional. Microscopic localized controls generate peculiar terms in both the limit equation and the cost functional that do not appear in the case of controls applied to the entire set of particles or when the boundary condition on the particles is of Robin type.</description>

      <title>Self-Generated Measures and the Centroid Rigidity of Power Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a classical calculus computation: the centroid of the subgraph of a function on the interval from 0 to a, and show that it hides a rigidity theorem. Let f be twice continuously differentiable on (0, infinity), take values in (0, infinity), and satisfy f(0+) = 0. Define xbar(a) as (integral from 0 to a of x f(x) dx) divided by (integral from 0 to a of f(x) dx), and define ybar(a) as (1/2) times (integral from 0 to a of f(x)^2 dx) divided by (integral from 0 to a of f(x) dx). We prove that the Geometric Scaling Property, namely the identity ybar(a) = lambda * f(xbar(a)) for every a &gt; 0, holds if and only if f(x) = A * x^p with A &gt; 0 and p &gt; 0. For these power laws the optimal constant is lambda = (p+1)/(2(2p+1)) * ((p+2)/(p+1))^p. After a scale-free normalization, the proof is probabilistic: with the self-generated probability measure on (0, a) having density proportional to f, we have xbar(a) equal to the expected value of Xa and ybar(a) equal to (1/2) times the expected value of f(Xa), so the Geometric Scaling Property becomes an equality in expectation across all truncation scales. Differentiating with respect to a yields a weighted mean identity for the elasticity E(x) = x f'(x) / f(x); a second differentiation forces a vanishing variance principle that makes E constant, hence f a pure power, and the stated value of lambda follows. The argument uses no asymptotics and extends to f that is once continuously differentiable on (0, infinity) with locally Lipschitz elasticity.</description>

      <title>Ground state solutions to generalized nonlinear wave equations with infinite-dimensional kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to existence results for time-periodic solutions of generalized nonlinear wave equations in a closed Riemannian manifold M. Our main focus lies on the doubly degenerate setting where the associated generalized wave operator has an infinite dimensional kernel and the nonlinearity may vanish on open subsets of M. To deal with this setting, we apply a direct variational approach based on a new variant of the nonlinear saddle point reduction to the associated Nehari-Pankov set. This allows us to find ground state solutions and to characterize the associated ground state energy by a fairly simple minimax principle.</description>

      <title>Diffusion operators on $p$-adic analytic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel functions for Laplacian integral operators are constructed on $p$-adic analytic manifolds using charts and transition maps like in Riemannian geometry. In the compact case, an operator of Vladimirov-Taibleson type parametrised by a real parameter $s$ is defined. Its $L^2$-spectrum is established, and it is shown that it gives rise to a Feller group. In this way, the Cauchy problem for the corresponding heat equation is solved in the positive by a transition function of a Markov process. Finally the existence of a heat kernel function and a Green function in the case $s &gt; 1$ is proven.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps for radial conductivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of characterizing sequences of real numbers that arise as spectra of Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) maps for elliptic operators has attracted considerable attention over the past fifty years. In this article, we address this question in the simple setting of DtN maps associated with a rotation-invariant elliptic operator $\nabla \cdot (\gamma\nabla \centerdot )$ in the ball in Euclidean space. We show that the spectrum of such a DtN operator can be expressed as a universal term, determined solely by the boundary values of the conductivity $\gamma$, plus a sequence of Hausdorff moments of an integrable function, which we call the Born approximation of $\gamma$. We also show that this object is locally determined from the boundary by the corresponding values of the conductivity, a property that implies a local uniqueness result for the Calder\'on Problem in this setting. We also give a stability result: the functional mapping the Born approximation to its conductivity is H\"older stable in suitable Sobolev spaces. Finally, in order to refine the characterization of the Born approximation, we analyze its regularity properties and their dependence on the conductivity.</description>

Abstract: We study the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a competing cubic-quintic power law nonlinearity on the waveguide domain $\mathbb R_x \times \mathbb T_{L_y}$. This model is globally well-posed and admits line solitary wave solutions, whose transverse (in-)stability is numerically investigated. We consider both spatially localized perturbations and periodic deformations of the line solitary wave and numerically confirm that there exists a critical torus length $L_y&gt;0$ above which instability appears.</description>

      <title>Singularities of the Lagrangian mean curvature flow at the critical Lagrangian phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish interior estimates for singularities of the Lagrangian mean curvature flow when the Lagrangian phase is critical, i.e., $|\Theta|\geq (n-2)\tfrac{\pi}{2}$, and extend our results to the broader class of Lagrangian mean curvature type equations. Our gradient estimates require certain structural conditions, and we construct $C^{\alpha}$ singular viscosity solutions to show that criticality of the phase is necessary, and that these conditions cannot be removed in dimension one. We also introduce a new method for proving $C^{2,\alpha}$ estimates by exponentiating the arctangent operator into a concave one when $|\Theta|\geq (n-2)\tfrac{\pi}{2}$ and $n&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Velocity Moments for the Magnetized Vlasov-Poisson System with Space-Time Dependent Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22753</link>

Abstract: We prove that polynomial velocity moments of solutions to the 2D magnetized Vlasov-Poisson system and the 3D magnetized screened Vlasov-Poisson equation remain finite for all times, provided they are finite initially, even when the external magnetic field $B=B(t,x)$ is space-time dependent. We deduce propagation of regularity, thereby implying the existence of global classical solutions. Moreover, we prove optimal stability estimates in the kinetic-Wasserstein distance on par with the unmagnetised case.</description>

      <title>Optimal Regularity for H\"older continuous Hamiltonian Stationary Lagrangian graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish optimal regularity for H\"older continuous Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian graphs in $\mathbb{C}^n$. We prove that such a graph is smooth whenever its H\"older exponent is strictly larger than $\frac{1}{3}$ and the Lagrangian phase is supercritical, which yields semi-convexity of the potential. We establish the optimality of our result by constructing explicit singular solutions to the fourth order Hamiltonian stationary equation when the H\"older exponent of the graph is $\frac{1}{3}$. The singular solutions exist even under the strongest convexity assumption on the Lagrangian phase, namely the hypercritical phase, which enforces convexity of the potential. This presents a striking departure from the theory of special Lagrangian graphs.</description>

      <title>Doubling and the two-dimensional critical valued Lagrangian phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish interior Hessian and gradient estimates for the two-dimensional Lagrangian mean curvature equation when the phase changes signs, provided the gradient of the phase vanishes along its zero set. At the critical phase in two dimensions, the Jacobi inequality degenerates, preventing the use of higher-dimensional methods to obtain Hessian estimates. To address this difficulty, we introduce a modified doubling technique that applies to degenerate Jacobi inequalities and yields interior estimates.</description>

Abstract: Let $B_1 ^c = \{ x\in \mathbb{R}^N: |x|&gt;1 \}, N \geq 2$, and $\mathcal{D}^{1,N}_0(B^c_1)$, be the Beppo-Levi space. We prove that $\mathcal{D}^{1,N}_0(B^c_1)$ is compactly embedded into the weighted Lebesgue space $L^r(B_1^c;K(x))$ for all $r\in[1,\infty)$ for an appropriate class of weight functions $K$. As an application, we prove the existence of a positive solution to a superlinear semipositone problem on $B_1 ^c$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We also establish boundedness and regularity of solutions of certain boundary value problems and derive their Green's function representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the following zero mass Schr\"{o}dinger-Bopp-Podolsky system with critical growth \[ \begin{cases} -\Delta u +q^2\phi u=\mu|u|^{p-2}u+|u|^4u\\ -\Delta \phi+a^2\Delta^2\phi=4\pi u^2, \end{cases} \] where $a&gt;0$, $q\neq0$, $\mu&gt;0$ is a parameter and $p\in(3,6)$. By introducing a new functional framework developed by Caponio et al. \cite{Cd}, we first establish the existence of positive ground state solutions for the case of $p\in(3,6)$. Moreover, for the case of $p\in(4,6)$, multiplicity results are obtained by applying an abstract critical point theorem due to Perera \cite{Pe}.</description>

      <title>Generalized Strichartz estimates for the massive Dirac equation with critical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove generalized Strichartz estimates for the massive Dirac equation in the case of two critical potential perturbations, namely the $2d$ Aharonov-Bohm magnetic potential and the $3d$ Coulomb potential. The proof makes use of the relativistic Hankel transform introduced in previous works of Cacciafesta, S\'er\'e and Cacciafesta, Fanelli for the massless systems, and here adapted to the massive case: this allows for an explicit representation of the solutions, which reduces the analysis to the proof of suitable estimates on the generalized eigenfunctions of the operators. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first dispersive estimates for the massive Dirac equation with critical potentials.</description>

      <title>Generalized boundary rigidity and minimal surface transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalized boundary rigidity problem, which investigates whether the areas of embedded minimal surfaces can uniquely determine a Riemannian manifold with boundary. We prove that for a conformal perturbation of an analytic metric in dimension $n+1$ ($n \geq 2$), the metric is determined by these volumes under an ampleness condition. Furthermore, we establish H\"older stability for this determination. This result extends earlier works in dimension $2+1$. Instead of relying on reductions to Calder\'on type problems and complex geometrical optics solutions, we study the linearized forward operator that gives rise to the minimal surface transform, a generalization of the X-ray/Radon transform. We demonstrate that this transform fits into the framework of double fibration transforms and satisfies the Bolker condition in the sense of Guillemin. Under certain assumptions, including a foliation condition, we prove invertibility of this transform on an analytic manifold as well as recovery of the analytic wave front set. The methods developed in this paper offer new tools for addressing the generalized boundary rigidity problem and expand the scope of applications of double fibration transforms. We anticipate that these techniques will also be applicable to other geometric inverse problems. Beyond mathematics, our results have implications for the AdS/CFT correspondence in physics.</description>

      <title>Full Benjamin-Feir instability of capillary-gravity Stokes waves in finite depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional gravity-capillary water waves equations for a fluid of finite depth $\mathtt{h}&gt;0$ under the combined effects of gravity and surface tension $\kappa \geq 0$. We analyze the linear stability and instability of small-amplitude, $2\pi$-periodic Stokes wave solutions, under the effect of longitudinal long-wave perturbations. The corresponding linearized operator has periodic coefficients and a defective zero eigenvalue of multiplicity four. Using Bloch-Floquet theory, we investigate the associated family of periodic eigenvalue problems. For all surface tension values $\kappa \geq 0$ and depths $\mathtt{h} &gt; 0$, we establish the complete splitting of the four eigenvalues near zero when both the wave amplitude and the Floquet parameter are small. Specifically, we rigorously prove that in the regions of unstable depth and capillarity identified formally by Djordjevic-Redekopp and Ablowitz-Segur in the 1970's, the spectrum of the linearized operator near the origin depicts a "figure 8" pattern.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every $0 &lt; s &lt;3/4$, we study the asymptotic behavior of the $\varepsilon$-rescaled sum of the $s$-fractional Allen-Cahn energy and the squared $L^2$-norm of its first variation. We prove that the contribution of the first variation vanishes as $\varepsilon \to 0$. This implies the Gamma-convergence of the initial sum to either the classical perimeter or to the $2s$-fractional perimeter, depending on whether $s \ge 1/2$ or not. This contradicts the expectation of finding curvature-dependent terms in the limit, as suggested by the regime $3/4 \le s &lt; 1$, and as known to hold in low dimensions in the local case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct local solutions to the Benjamin-Ono equation for quasi-periodic initial data. The solution is unique among limits of smooth solutions and depends continuously on the data. Our result applies to a richer class of quasi-periodic functions than previous theorems. Central to the argument is an a-priori estimate, the proof of which utilizes Strichartz estimates for quasi-periodic functions obtained recently via decoupling, and a quasi-periodic extension of Tao's gauge transform. As a byproduct of our method, we also establish new local wellposedness results in certain anisotropic Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Control of neural field equations with step-function inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wilson-Cowan and Amari-type models capture nonlinear neural population dynamics, providing a fundamental framework for modeling how sensory and other exogenous inputs shape activity in neural tissue. We study the controllability properties of Amari-type neural fields subject to piecewise/constant-in-time inputs. The model describes the time evolution of the polarization of neural tissue within a spatial continuum, with synaptic interactions represented by a convolution kernel. We study the synthesis of piecewise/constant-in-time inputs to achieve two-point boundary-type control objectives, namely, steering neural activity from an initial state to a prescribed target state. This approach is particularly relevant for predicting the emergence of paradoxical neural representations, such as discordant visual illusions that occur in response to overt sensory stimuli. We first present a control synthesis based on the Banach fixed-point theorem, which yields an iterative construction of a constant-in-time input under minimal regularity assumptions on the kernel and transfer function; however, it exhibits practical limitations, even in the linear case. To overcome these challenges, we then develop a generic synthesis framework based on the flow of neural dynamics drift, enabling explicit piecewise constant and constant-in-time inputs. Extensive numerical results in one and two spatial dimensions confirm the effectiveness of the proposed syntheses and demonstrate their superior performance compared to inputs derived from naive linearization at the initial or target states when these states are not equilibria of the drift dynamics. By providing a mathematically rigorous framework for controlling Amari-type neural fields, this work advances our understanding of nonlinear neural population control with potential applications in computational neuroscience, psychophysics, and neurostimulation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper I study properties of the generators $\triangle_\gamma$ of non-local Dirichlet forms $\mathcal{E}^\mu_\gamma$ on ultrametric spaces which are the path space of simple stationary Bratteli diagrams. The measures used to define the Dirichlet forms are taken to be the Gibbs measures $\mu_\psi$ associated to H\"older continuous potentials $\psi$ for one-sided shifts. I also define a cohomology $H_{lc}(X_B)$ for $X_B$ which can be seen as dual to the homology of Bowen and Franks. Besides studying spectral properties of $\triangle_\gamma$, I show that for $\gamma$ large enough (with sharp bounds depending on the diagram and the measure theoretic entropy $h_{\mu_\psi}$ of $\mu_\psi$) there is a unique harmonic representative of any class $c\in H_{lc}(X_B)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a feedback approximate controllability problem of blowup points for the heat equation. We show that the system is approximately controllable for blowup points with feedback controls and the feedback operator is bounded at any time before blowup. It is also proved that the blowup profile for feedback controllability of blowup points is stable with respect to initial data. That is, suppose that the initial data has a very small perturbation, the blowup profiles also have tiny changes. More precisely, it just undergoes a tiny translation in space and time. This means that our feedback strategy is anti-interference.</description>

      <title>Sharp angle estimates for second order divergence operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is about the (minimal) sector containing the numerical range of the principal part of a linear second-order elliptic differential operator defined by a form on closed subspaces V of the first-order Sobolev space $W^{1,2}(\Omega)$ incorporating mixed boundary conditions. We collect a comprehensive array of results on the angle of sectoriality and the $H^\infty$-angle attached to realizations of the elliptic operator. We thereby consider the operator in several scales of Banach spaces: the Lebesgue space, the negative Sobolev space, and their interpolation scale. For the latter two types of spaces, we rely on recent results regarding the Kato square root property. We focus on minimal assumptions on geometry, and we consider both real and complex coefficients. Not all results presented are new, but we strive for a streamlined and comprehensive overall picture from several branches of operator theory, and we complement the existing results with several new ones, in particular aiming at explicit estimates built on readily accessible problem data. This concerns for example a new estimate on the angle of the sector containing the numerical range of a linear, continuous and coercive Hilbert space operator, but also an explicit estimate for the angle of sectoriality for the elliptic operator on $L^p(\Omega)$ with complex coefficients without any assumptions on geometry and a general transfer principle for the Crouzeix-Delyon theorem from bounded operators to sectorial ones, keeping the explicit constant.</description>

      <title>On the rate of convergence of cylindrical singularity in mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that if a rescaled mean curvature flow is a global graph over the round cylinder with small gradient and converges super-exponentially fast, then it must coincide with the cylinder itself. We also show that the result is sharp with counter-examples of local graphs at arbitrarily super-exponential convergence rate with the domain expanding arbitrarily fast.
  The first part provides the first unique continuation result in the cylindrical setting, the generic singularity model in mean curvature flow. In sharp contrast, in the second part we construct infinite-dimensional families of Tikhonov-type examples for nonlinear equations, including the rescaled mean curvature flow, showing that unique continuation fails for local graphical solutions. These examples demonstrate the essential role of global graphical assumptions in rigidity and highlight new phenomena absent in the compact case. We also construct non-product mean curvature flows that develop singular sets as prescribed lower dimensional Euclidean space at arbitrary super-exponential rates. Our construction works in great generality for a large class of non-linear equations.</description>

      <title>The critical case for the concentration of eigenfunctions on singular Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a compact Riemannian manifold with boundary with a certain class of critical singular Riemannian metrics that are singular at the boundary. The corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator can be seen as a Grushin-type operator plus a potential. We show in the critical case that the average density of eigenfunctions for the Laplace-Beltrami operator with eigenvalues below $\lambda&gt;0$ is distributed over all length scales between $\lambda^{-1/2}$ and $1$ near the boundary. We give a precise description of this distribution as $\lambda\to\infty$.</description>

Abstract: The evolution of two isothermal, incompressible, immiscible fluids in a bounded domain is governed by Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes equations (CHNS System). In this work, we study the well-posedness results for the CHNS system with nonhomogeneous boundary condition for the velocity equation. We obtain the existence of global weak solutions in the two-dimensional bounded domain. We further prove the continuous dependence of the solution on initial conditions and boundary data that will provide the uniqueness of the weak solution. The existence of strong solutions is also established in this work. Furthermore, we show that in the two-dimensional case, each global weak solution converges to a stationary solution.</description>

      <title>Periodic Waves for the Regularized Camassa-Holm Equation: Existence and Spectral Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00433v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and spectral stability of periodic traveling wave solutions for the regularized Camassa-Holm equation. To establish the existence of periodic waves, we employ tools from bifurcation theory to construct solutions with the zero-mean property. We also prove that such waves may not exist for the well-known Camassa-Holm equation. Regarding spectral stability, we analyze the difference between the number of negative eigenvalues of the second variation of the Lyapunov functional at the wave, restricted to the space of zero-mean periodic functions, and the number of negative eigenvalues of the matrix formed from the tangent space associated with the low-order conserved quantities of the evolution model. Finally, we address the problem of orbital stability as a consequence of the spectral stability.</description>

      <title>Regularity Propagation of Global Weak Solutions to a Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard System for Incompressible Two-phase Flows with Chemotaxis and Active Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a diffuse interface model that describes the dynamics of incompressible viscous two-phase flows, incorporating mechanisms such as chemotaxis, active transport, and long-range interactions of Oono's type. The evolution system couples the Navier--Stokes equations for the volume-averaged fluid velocity $\bm{v}$, a convective Cahn--Hilliard equation for the phase-field variable $\varphi$, and an advection-diffusion equation for the density of a chemical substance $\sigma$. For the initial boundary value problem with a physically relevant singular potential in three dimensions, we demonstrate that every global weak solution $(\bm{v}, \varphi, \sigma)$ exhibits a propagation of regularity over time. Specifically, after an arbitrary positive time, the phase-field variable $\varphi$ transitions into a strong solution, whereas the chemical density $\sigma$ only partially regularizes. Subsequently, the velocity field $\bm{v}$ becomes regular after a sufficiently large time, followed by a further regularization of the chemical density $\sigma$, which in turn enhances the spatial regularity of $\varphi$. Furthermore, we show that every global weak solution stabilizes towards a single equilibrium as $t\to +\infty$. Our analysis uncovers the influence of chemotaxis, active transport, and long-range interactions on the propagation of regularity at different stages of time. The proof relies on several key points, including a novel regularity result for a convective Cahn--Hilliard--diffusion system with a velocity field $\bm{v}$ of Leray type, the strict separation property of $\varphi$ for large times, as well as two conditional uniqueness results pertaining to the full system and its subsystem for $(\varphi, \sigma)$ with a given velocity, respectively.</description>

      <title>Generic Structural Stability for $2 \times 2$ Systems of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a proof of generic structural stability for Riemann solutions to $2 \times 2$ system of hyperbolic conservation laws in one spatial variable, without diffusive terms. This means that for almost every left and right state, shocks and rarefaction solutions of the same type are preserved via perturbations of the flux functions, the left state, and the right state. The main assumptions for this proof involve standard assumptions on strict hyperbolicity and genuine non-linearity, a technical assumption on directionality of rarefaction curves, and the regular manifold (submersion) assumption motivated by concepts in differential topology. We show that the structural stability of the Riemann solutions is related to the transversality of the Hugoniot loci and rarefaction curves in the state space. The regular manifold assumption is required to invoke a variant of a theorem from differential topology, Thom's parametric transversality theorem, to show the genericity of transversality of these curves. This in turn implies the genericity of structural stability. We then apply this theorem to two examples: the p-system and a $2 \times 2$ system governing the evolution of gravity-driven monodisperse particle-laden thin films. In particular, we illustrate how one can verify all the above assumptions for the former, and apply the theorem to different numerical and physical aspects of the system governing the latter.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish the existence and spectral stability, with respect to perturbations of the same period, of double-periodic standing waves for the nonlinear focusing Schr\"odinger equation posed on the bi-dimensional torus. We first show that such double-periodic solutions can be constructed via local and global bifurcation theory, under the assumption that the kernel of the linearized operator around the equilibrium solution is one-dimensional. In addition, we prove that these local and global solutions minimize an appropriate variational problem, which enables us to derive spectral properties of the linearized operator about the periodic wave. Finally, we establish the spectral stability of small-amplitude periodic waves by applying the techniques developed in \cite{KapitulaKevrekidisSandstedeII} and \cite{KapitulaKevrekidisSandstedeI}.</description>

Abstract: We consider the semilinear heat equation with a superlinear nonlinearity and we study the properties of threshold or subthreshold solutions, lying on or below the boundary between blow-up and global existence, respectively. For the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem, we prove the boundedness and decay to zero of any subthreshold solution. This implies, in particular, that all global unbounded solutions -- if they exist -- are threshold solutions. For the Cauchy problem, these properties fail in general but we show that they become true for a suitably modified notion of threshold. Our results strongly improve known results even in the model case of power nonlinearities, especially in the Sobolev critical and supercritical cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal metamaterials are artificially manufactured materials with time-dependent material properties that exhibit interesting phenomena when waves propagate through them. The propagation of electromagnetic waves in such time-varying dielectric media is governed by Maxwell's equations, which lead to wave equations with temporal highly oscillatory coefficients for the electric and magnetic fields. In this study, we analyze the effective behavior of electromagnetic fields in time-varying metamaterials using a formal two-scale asymptotic expansion. We provide a mathematical derivation of the effective equations for the leading-order homogenized solution, as well as for the first- and second-order corrections of the effective solution. While the effective solution and the first-order correction are governed by local material laws, we reveal a nonlocal constitutive relation for the second-order corrections. Special attention is also paid to temporal interface conditions through initial values of the homogenized equations. The results provide a mathematically justified framework for the effective description of wave-type equations of time-varying media, applicable to models in optics, elasticity, and acoustics.</description>

Abstract: We prove the global existence of weak solutions to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with ripped density in the half-plane under a slip boundary condition provided the bulk viscosity coefficient is properly large. Moreover, we show that such solutions converge globally in time to a weak solution of the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations as the bulk viscosity coefficient tends to infinity. In particular, the large initial data and an initial patch of density as well as a vacuum are allowed. Our method relies on a Desjardins-type logarithmic interpolation inequality and some new techniques based on the effective viscous flux.</description>

To overcome difficulties in the presence of a curved boundary, some new estimates based on the effective viscous flux and a Desjardins-type logarithmic interpolation inequality play decisive roles.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates time-periodic solutions of both the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation and its generalized form (gSQG) within the more singular regime, focusing on the evolution of patch-type structures. Assuming the underlying point vortex equilibrium satisfies a natural nondegeneracy condition, we employ an implicit function argument to construct families of co-rotating nested polygonal vortex patch solutions. These configurations provide precise asymptotic descriptions of the geometry of the evolving patch boundaries. Our results contribute to the broader understanding of coherent rotating structures arising in active scalar equations with singular velocity coupling.</description>

Abstract: We deal with homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann boundary-value problems for anisotropic elliptic operators of p-Laplace type. They emerge as Euler-Lagrange equations of integral functionals of the Calculus of Variations built upon possibly anisotropic norms of the gradient of trial functions. We establish global Lipschitz regularity of solutions under the weakest possible assumption on right-hand side of the equation, which may also include the gradient term with natural growth exponent. The results hold in either convex domains, or domains enjoying minimal integrability assumptions on the curvature of its boundary.</description>

Abstract: We study the solution theory of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a concentrated nonlinearity on the torus. In particular, we establish existence and uniqueness of global energy-conserving solutions for initial data in $H^1$. Our approach is based on two approximation schemes, namely the concentrated limit of a smoothed nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the inviscid limit of a concentrated complex Ginzburg--Landau equation. We also prove the existence and uniquness of solutions below the energy space. To our knowledge, this is the first rigorous solution theory for a periodic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a concentrated nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>High-friction limit for bipolar Euler-Riesz systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a bipolar Euler-Riesz system and rigorously justify the high-friction limit of weak solutions towards a bipolar aggregation-diffusion system with Riesz interactions. The analysis is carried out via the relative entropy method in the regime where smooth solutions of the limiting equations exist. This extends previous results on the high-friction limit of bipolar Euler-Poisson systems to a more general class of interactions, and extends the one-species Euler-Riesz case to the bipolar setting.</description>

      <title>Functions of bounded Musielak-Orlicz-type deformation and anisotropic Total Generalized Variation for image-denoising problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper we introduce the space of bounded deformation fields with generalized Orlicz growth. We establish their main properties, provide a modular representation, and characterize a decomposition of the modular into an absolutely continuous part and a singular part weighted via a recession function. A further analysis in the variable exponent case is also provided. The second part of the paper contains a notion of Musielak-Orlicz anisotropic Total Generalized Variation. We establish a duality representation, and show well-posedness of the corresponding image reconstruction problem.</description>

      <title>Long-Time Asymptotics for Subordinated Fractional Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of solutions to a class of evolution equations arising from random-time changes driven by subordinators. Our focus is on fractional diffusion equations involving mixed local and nonlocal operators. By combining techniques from probability theory, asymptotic analysis, and partial differential equations (PDEs), we characterize the dynamics of the subordinated solutions. This approach extends classical fractional dynamics and establishes a deeper connection between stochastic processes and deterministic PDEs.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the relaxed Electron MHD equations with random diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the three-dimensional Electron Magnetohydrodynamics (EMHD) equations without resistivity, a regime known to be ill-posed in Sobolev and Gevrey spaces due to the quasilinear nature of the system. Motivated by recent work on stochastic regularization of the inviscid primitive equations [R. Hu, Q. Lin, and R. Liu, J. Nonlinear Sci. 35:84 (2025)], we introduce a modified EMHD model where resistivity is replaced by multiplicative noise and the nonlinear term is regularized by a fractional derivative. In particular, the classical advection term $(B \cdot \nabla)J$ is replaced by its fractional version $(B \cdot \nabla^\alpha)J$ with $0 &lt; \alpha \leq 1$. We show that for $\alpha &lt; 1$, the system is locally well-posed almost surely in suitable Gevrey spaces, and globally well-posed with high probability for small initial data. The results demonstrate that stochastic perturbations can restore well-posedness in a broader class of quasilinear magnetic models relevant to plasma dynamics and turbulence.</description>

Abstract: We study the optimal control of path-dependent piecewise deterministic processes. An appropriate dynamic programming principle is established. We prove that the associated value function is the unique minimax solution of the corresponding non-local path-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. This is the first well-posedness result for nonsmooth solutions of fully nonlinear non-local path-dependent partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16984v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove eigenvalue bounds for Schr\"odinger operator $-\Delta_g+V$ on compact manifolds with complex potentials $V$. The bounds depend only on an $L^q$-norm of the potential, and they are shown to be optimal, in a certain sense, on the round sphere and more general Zoll manifolds. These bounds are natural analogues of Frank's \cite{MR2820160} results in the Euclidean case.</description>

      <title>Sharp microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym estimates for eigenfunctions with applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym bounds for eigenfunctions of Blair--Sogge to a larger range of exponents, which is optimal in odd dimensions. On manifolds of constant sectional curvature we introduce a new anisotropic variant of the microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym norm that further enlarges the admissible $p$-range. As a corollary, we obtain improved $L^p$ bounds for Hecke--Maass forms on compact hyperbolic $3$-manifolds by combining with a recent result of Hou. Further applications include sharp $L^q\!\to\!L^p$ estimates for H\"ormander operators in odd dimensions, improved $L^q\!\to\!L^p$ Fourier extension bounds, and improved bounds for the Bochner--Riesz conjecture in $\mathbb R^3$.</description>

      <title>Sharp Fundamental Gap Estimate on Convex Domains in Gaussian Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a sharp lower bound for the fundamental gap on convex domains in Gaussian spaces, the difference between the first two eigenvalues of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our main result establishes that the gap is bounded below by the gap of the corresponding one-dimensional model, confirming the Gaussian analogue of the fundamental gap conjecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the normalized gap of the one-dimensional model is monotonically increasing with the diameter and prove the sharpness of our estimate. Beyond the fundamental gap, we also establish improved log-concavity properties for the Dirichlet heat kernel on convex domains in Gaussian spaces. Our work on Gaussian spaces complements the existing results of Andrews and Clutterbuck and Ni for Euclidean domains, as well as the work of Seto, Wang, and Wei for spherical domains.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principles for the Gross Pitaevskii Gibbs measure at low temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the large deviation principle for the conditional Gibbs measure associated with the focusing Gross Pitaevskii equation in the low temperature regime. This conditional measure is of mixed type, being canonical in energy and microcanonical in particle number. In particular, our result extends the large deviation principle for the mixed ensemble studied by Ellis, Jordan, Otto, and Turkington to a more singular setting, where the interaction potential is unbounded and the conditional event involves diverging renormalization constants. As a consequence of the large deviation principle, the Gibbs measure concentrates along the soliton manifold in the low temperature limit.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Stationary Solutions to McKean-Vlasov Equations with Applications to Noisy Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle. Our main contributions stem from observing an exact equivalence between solutions of the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and an infinite-dimensional quadratic system of equations over Fourier coefficients, which allows explicit characterization of the stationary states in a sequence space rather than a function space. This framework provides a transparent description of local bifurcations, characterizing their periodicity, and resonance structures, while accommodating singular potentials. We derive analytic expressions that characterize the emergence, form and shape (supercritical, critical, subcritical or transcritical) of bifurcations involving possibly multiple Fourier modes and connect them with discontinuous phase transitions. We also characterize, under suitable assumptions, the detailed structure of the stationary bifurcating solutions that are accurate upto an arbitrary number of Fourier modes. At the global level, we establish regularity and concavity properties of the free energy landscape, proving existence, compactness, and coexistence of globally minimizing stationary measures, further identifying discontinuous phase transitions with points of non-differentiability of the minimum free energy map. As an application, we specialize the theory to the Noisy Mean-Field Transformer model, where we show how changing the inverse temperature parameter $\beta$ affects the geometry of the infinitely many bifurcations from the uniform measure. We also explain how increasing $\beta$ can lead to a rich class of approximate multi-mode stationary solutions which can be seen as `metastable states'. Further, a sharp transition from continuous to discontinuous (first-order) phase behavior is observed as $\beta$ increases.</description>
