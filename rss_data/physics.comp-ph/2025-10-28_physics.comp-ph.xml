      <title>Hybrid Neural Interpolation of a Sequence of Wind Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid and accurate urban wind field prediction is essential for modeling particle transport in emergency scenarios. Traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approaches are too slow for real-time applications, necessitating surrogate models. We develop a hybrid neural interpolation method for constructing surrogate models that can update urban wind maps on timescales aligned with meteorological variations.
  Our approach combines Tucker tensor decomposition with neural networks to interpolate Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) solutions across varying inlet wind angles. The method decomposes high-dimensional velocity, pressure, and eddy viscosity field datasets into a core tensor and factor matrices, then uses Fourier interpolation for angular modes and k-nearest neighbors convolution for spatial interpolation. A neural network correction mitigates interpolation artifacts while preserving physical consistency.
  We validate the approach on a simple cylinder-sphere configuration and, relative to a strong pure neural network benchmark, achieve comparable or improved accuracy ($R^2 &gt; 0.99$) with significantly reduced training time. The pure NN remains a feasible reference model; the hybrid provides an accelerated approximate alternative that suppresses spurious oscillations, maintains wake dynamics, and demonstrates computational efficiency suitable for real-time urban wind simulation.</description>

      <title>Tensor network methods for quantum-inspired image processing and classical optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network methods strike a middle ground between fully-fledged quantum computing and classical computing, as they take inspiration from quantum systems to significantly speed up certain classical operations. Their strength lies in their compressive power and the wide variety of efficient algorithms that operate within this compressed space. In this work, we focus on applying these methods to fundamental problems in image processing and classical optics such as wave-front propagation and optical image formation, by using directly or indirectly parallels with quantum mechanics and computation. These quantum-inspired methods are expected to yield faster algorithms with applications ranging from astronomy and earth observation to microscopy and classical imaging more broadly.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Simulations of Tidal Disruption Encores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO of Tidal Disruption Encores (TDEEs) in nuclear star clusters (NSCs). TDEEs arise when a stellar-mass black hole (sBH) disrupts a star within the NSC, producing debris that is unbound from the sBH but remains gravitationally bound to the central massive black hole (MBH), leading to a delayed secondary flare. We find that the morphology and thermodynamics of the fallback material depend sensitively on the disruption geometry, MBH mass, and sBH-MBH separation. We identify two distinct morphological outcomes: ring encores, where debris circularize into a torus, and direct encores, where streams plunge toward the MBH, with encore luminosities peaking at times corresponding to the freefall timescale and one orbital period, respectively. Across all simulated cases, we find these events exhibit luminosities of $10^{40}-10^{42}$ erg/s with lightcurves characteristic of their morphology. Our work greatly improves the predictions of TDEE lightcurves and empowers observations to probe into NSC dynamics and sBH population while providing possible explanations for anomalous TDE-like flares.</description>

      <title>A Physics-informed Multi-resolution Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs), often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications. These datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup, addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.</description>

      <title>Exploiting biased noise in variational quantum models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising tools for demonstrating quantum utility on near-term quantum hardware, with applications in optimisation, quantum simulation, and machine learning. While researchers have studied how easy VQAs are to train, the effect of quantum noise on the classical optimisation process is still not well understood. Contrary to expectations, we find that twirling, which is commonly used in standard error-mitigation strategies to symmetrise noise, actually degrades performance in the variational setting, whereas preserving biased or non-unital noise can help classical optimisers find better solutions. Analytically, we study a universal quantum regression model and demonstrate that relatively uniform Pauli channels suppress gradient magnitudes and reduce expressivity, making optimisation more difficult. Conversely, asymmetric noise such as amplitude damping or biased Pauli channels introduces directional bias that can be exploited during optimisation. Numerical experiments on a variational eigensolver for the transverse-field Ising model confirm that non-unital noise yields lower-energy states compared to twirled noise. Finally, we show that coherent errors are fully mitigated by re-parameterisation. These findings challenge conventional noise-mitigation strategies and suggest that preserving noise biases may enhance VQA performance.</description>

      <title>Variational Calculations of the Excited States of the Charged NV-center in Diamond Using a Hybrid Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excited electronic states involved in the optical cycle preparation of a pure spin state of the negatively charged NV-defect in diamond are calculated using the HSE06 hybrid density functional and variational optimization of the orbitals. This includes the energy of the excited triplet as well as the two lowest singlet states with respect to the ground triplet state. In addition to the vertical excitation, the effect of structural relaxation is also estimated using analytical atomic forces. The lowering of the energy in the triplet excited state and the resulting zero-phonon line triplet excitation energy are both within 0.1 eV of the experimental estimates. An analogous relaxation in the lower energy singlet state using spin purified atomic forces is estimated to be 0.06 eV. These results, obtained with a hybrid density functional, improve on previously published results using local and semi-local functionals, which are known to underestimate the band gap. The good agreement with experimental estimates demonstrates how time-independent variational calculations of excited states using density functionals can give accurate results and, thereby, provide a powerful screening tool for identifying other defect systems as candidates for quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>TriDS: AI-native molecular docking framework unified with binding site identification, conformational sampling and scoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a cornerstone of drug discovery to unveil the mechanism of ligand-receptor interactions. With the recent development of deep learning in the field of artificial intelligence, innovative methods were developed for molecular docking. However, the mainstream docking programs adopt a docking-then-rescoring streamline to increase the docking accuracy, which make the virtual screening process cumbersome. Moreover, there still lacks a unified framework to integrate binding site identification, conformational sampling and scoring, in a user-friendly manner. In our previous work of DSDP and its subsequent flexible version, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of guiding conformational sampling with the gradient of analytic scoring function. As the third generation of DSDP, here we expanded the similar strategy to ML-based differentiable scoring model to device a novel docking method named TriDS under the mainstream AI training framework, which unifies the sampling and scoring steps. To be user-friendly, TriDS also integrates ML-based model for binding site prediction and has compatibility with multiple input file formats. We show here that gradients of a suitable ML-based scoring function can lead to excellent docking accuracy in the benchmark datasets, especially for large ligands. Moreover, TriDS is implemented with enhanced computational efficiency in terms of both running speed and GPU memory requirement.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning-Empowered Programmable Topolectrical Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topolectrical circuits provide a versatile platform for exploring and simulating modern physical models. However, existing approaches suffer from incomplete programmability and ineffective feature prediction and control mechanisms, hindering the investigation of physical phenomena on an integrated platform and limiting their translation into practical applications. Here, we present a deep learning empowered programmable topolectrical circuits (DLPTCs) platform for physical modeling and analysis. By integrating fully independent, continuous tuning of both on site and off site terms of the lattice Hamiltonian, physics graph informed inverse state design, and immediate hardware verification, our system bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and practical realization. Through flexible control and adiabatic path engineering, we experimentally observe the boundary states without global symmetry in higher order topological systems, their adiabatic phase transitions, and the flat band like characteristic corresponding to Landau levels in the circuit. Incorporating a physics graph informed mechanism with a generative AI model for physics exploration, we realize arbitrary, position controllable on board Anderson localization, surpassing conventional random localization. Utilizing this unique capability with high fidelity hardware implementation, we further demonstrate a compelling cryptographic application: hash based probabilistic information encryption by leveraging Anderson localization with extensive disorder configurations, enabling secure delivery of full ASCII messages.</description>

      <title>An efficient preconditioned conjugate-gradient solver for a two-component dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a preconditioned nonlinear conjugate-gradient solver for ground states of binary dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates within the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation including Lee-Huang-Yang corrections. The optimization is carried out on the product-of-spheres normalization manifold and combines a manifold-preserving analytic line search, derived from a second-order energy expansion and validated along the exact normalized path, with complementary Fourier-space kinetic and real-space diagonal (Hessian-inspired) preconditioners. The method enforces monotonic energy descent and exhibits robust convergence across droplet, stripe, and supersolid regimes while retaining spectrally accurate discretizations and FFT-based evaluation of the dipolar term. In head-to-head benchmarks against imaginary-time evolution on matched grids and tolerances, the solver reduces iteration counts by one to two orders of magnitude and overall time-to-solution, and it typically attains slightly lower energies, indicating improved resilience to metastability. We reproduce representative textures and droplet-stability windows reported for dipolar mixtures. These results establish a reliable and efficient tool for large-scale parameter scans and phase-boundary mapping, and for quantitatively linking numerically obtained metastable branches to experimentally accessible states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study dives into the applicability of using automated discovery of conserved quantities in dynamical systems relevant to accelerator physics. Specifically, we explore the performance of AI Poincar\'e in analyzing numerical trajectory data obtained using the McMillan system of non-linear integrable optics. A comprehensive evaluation of the algorithm's performance is conducted through diverse methodologies. These include the analysis of the estimated number of conserved quantities embedded in a dataset and the deviation of interpolated points on the inferred manifold with respect to points in actually in the dataset. the investigation identifies an optimal range of perturbation distances where the underlying manifold extraction algorithm inside AI Poincar\'e exhibits optimal performance. Additionally, an improved neural network architecture is proposed based on the observed results. Finally, we apply the algorithm to preliminary experimental data from the Integrable Optics Test Accelerator at Fermilab to successfully infer the number of conserved quantities even in the presence of fast decoherence of the measured signal.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08575v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation of the dynamics. This adaptive tVMC (atVMC) approach is specifically designed to enhance numerical stability when overparameterized variational ans\"atze lead to ill-conditioned equations of motion. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>

      <title>Thermometry of simulated Bose--Einstein condensates using machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise determination of thermodynamic parameters in ultracold Bose gases remains challenging due to the destructive nature of conventional measurement techniques and inherent experimental uncertainties. We demonstrate a machine learning approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the chemical potential and temperature from a single image of an \emph{in situ} imaged density profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second. The model also demonstrates {some} zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating the temperature (although not the chemical potential) for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments. Such capabilities could significantly streamline experimental workflows whilst improving measurement precision across a range of quantum fluid systems.</description>

      <title>Multiscale, Techno-economic Evaluation of Isoreticular Series of CALF-20 for Biogas Upgrading using a Pressure/Vacuum Swing Adsorption (PVSA) Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cyclic swing adsorption processes, such as pressure/vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA), are a promising technology for upgrading biogas by separating carbon dioxide (CO2) from methane (CH4). The rational design of adsorbent materials with tailored properties is important for the deployment of high-performance PVSA technology. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), particularly the CALF-20 isoreticular series, have attracted interest due to their high CO2 selectivity, thermal, and water stability. In this study, we report a multiscale assessment of CALF-20 and its isoreticular five derivatives by integrating molecular simulations with PVSA process optimization and techno-economic analysis. Structural and adsorption characteristics were calculated and employed to assess how each material performs in terms of energy efficiency and cost. The analysis reveals distinct differences in cost performance among the CALF-20 series, with CALF-20 showing the most favorable economics with \gt97\% purity CH4 production cost at \$4.31 per kg of CH4 and energy consumption of 9.35 kWh per kg of CH4. This study demonstrates that the integrated molecular-process optimization framework can effectively guide the search for adsorbent materials for biogas upgrading.</description>

      <title>GoodRegressor: A General-Purpose Symbolic Regression Framework for Physically Interpretable Materials Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has accelerated materials discovery, yet most high-performing models remain black boxes, offering predictions without physical understanding. Here I present GoodRegressor, a general-purpose, C++-based symbolic regression framework that bridges data-driven modeling and physical interpretability. GoodRegressor systematically explores nonlinear transformations and feature interactions across five integrated modules, parser, designer, curator, regressor, and designer as a post-process, to construct compact, physics-consistent analytical models. For example, applied to the experimental activation energy dataset of oxygen-ion conductors, GoodRegressor explored an ensemble-sampled model space comprising approximately $1.44 \times 10^{457}$ possible combinations and achieved superior predictive performance ($\langle R^2 \rangle =0.804$) compared with conventional machine learning methods, outperforming RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Ridge, MLP, and PySR ($\langle R^2 \rangle \leq 0.652$). Unlike black-box models, GoodRegressor reveals transparent structure-property relationships linking ionic transport to coordination environment and lattice flexibility. This interpretable modeling framework mitigates the opacity of conventional ML, enabling hypothesis generation, physical insight, and general applicability to complex scientific systems beyond materials informatics.</description>

Abstract: Emerging altermagnets offer a promising avenue for spintronics, yet their integration into magnetic tunnel junctions has been hindered by reliance on ferromagnetic electrodes (introducing stray fields) or limited functionality (non-tunable magnetoresistance without spin filtering). Here, we propose an all-altermagnetic tunnel junction (AAMTJ) paradigm composed exclusively of altermagnets-exemplified by experiment-feasible RuO2/NiF2/RuO2. Giant tunneling magnetoresistance of 11704%, and high spin-filtering of ~90% in both spin channels are achieved. This architecture unlocks tunable multistate magnetoresistance and spin filtering via magnetization control of electrode and barrier, stemming from their synergistic and antagonistic alignments of momentum-dependent altermagnetic spin-splitting. Our AAMTJ inherently exhibits low consumption and no stray field, with nonrelativistic spin splitting and zero magnetic moment, combining advantages of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions. This AAMTJ paradigm provides a realistically versatile platform to develop revolutionarily potential of altermagnets for reconfigurable magnetic memory devices.</description>
