      <title>Invariants and symmetries of Steiner 4-chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with the Steiner chains consisting of four circles. More precisely, we deal with the invariants of chains introduced in the recent papers of J.Lagarias, C.Mallows, A.Wilks, R.Schwartz and S.Tabachnikov. We also establish certain algebraic relations between those invariants. To this end we use the invariance of certain moments of curvatures of poristic Steiner chains established by R.Schwartz and S.Tabachnikov, combined with the computation of these moments for the socalled symmetric Steiner 4-chains. We also present analogous results for Steiner 3-chains and give an application of our results to the feasibility problem for the radii of Steiner 4-chains.
  Keywords: Steiner chain, parent circles, Steiner porism, poristic Steiner chains, Descartes circle theorem, invariant moments of curvatures, algebraic relations between invariants</description>

      <title>Characterization of t-norms for type-2 fuzzy sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-2 fuzzy set (T2 FS) were introduced by Zadeh in 1965, and the membership degrees of T2 FSs are type-1 fuzzy sets (T1 FSs). Owing to the fuzziness of membership degrees, T2 FSs can better model the uncertainty of real life, and thus, type-2 rule-based fuzzy systems (T2 RFSs) become hot research topics in recent decades. In T2 RFS, the compositional rule of inference is based on triangular norms (t-norms) defined on complete lattice (L, \le ) ( L is the set of all convex normal functions from [0,1] to [0,1], and , \le is the so-called convolution order). Hence, the choice of t-norm on (L,\le) may influence the performance of T2 RFS. Therefore, it is significant to broad the set of t-norms among which domain experts can choose most suitable one. To construct t-norms on (L,\le), the mainstream method is convolution which is induced by two operators on the unit interval [0,1]. A key problem appears naturally, when convolution is a t-norm on (L,\le). This paper gives the necessary and sufficient conditions under which convolution is a t-norm on (L,\le). Moreover, note that the computational complexity of operators prevent the application of T2 RFSs. This paper also provides one kind of convolutions which are t-norms on (L,\le) and extremely easy to calculate.</description>

      <title>MARL-CC: A Mathematical Framework forMulti-Agent Reinforcement Learning in ConnectedAutonomous Vehicles: Addressing Nonlinearity,Partial Observability, and Credit Assignment forOptimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerfulparadigm for cooperative decision-making in connected autonomous vehicles(CAVs); however, existing approaches often fail to guarantee stability, optimality,and interpretability in systems characterized by nonlinear dynamics,partial observability, and complex inter-agent coupling. This study addressesthese foundational challenges by introducing MARL-CC, a unified MathematicalFramework for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Control Coordination.The proposed framework integrates differential geometric control, Bayesian inference,and Shapley-value-based credit assignment within a coherent optimizationarchitecture, ensuring bounded policy updates, decentralized belief estimation,and equitable reward distribution. Theoretical analyses establish convergence andstability guarantees under stochastic disturbances and communication delays.Empirical evaluations across simulation and real-world testbeds demonstrate upto a 40% improvement in convergence rate and enhanced cooperative efficiencyover leading baselines, including PPO, DDPG, and QMIX.These results signify a decisive advance in control-oriented reinforcement learning,bridging the gap between mathematical rigor and practical autonomy.The MARL-CC framework provides a scalable foundation for intelligent transportation,UAV coordination, and distributed robotics, paving the way toward interpretable, safe, and adaptive multi-agent systems. All codes and experimentalconfigurations are publicly available on GitHub to support reproducibilityand future research.</description>
