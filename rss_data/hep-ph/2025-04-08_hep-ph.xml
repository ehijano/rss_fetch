      <title>Color superconductivity under neutron-star conditions at next-to-leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equation of state of deconfined strongly interacting matter at high densities remains an open question, with effects from quark pairing in the preferred color-flavor-locked (CFL) ground state possibly playing an important role. Recent studies suggest that at least large pairing gaps in the CFL phase are incompatible with current astrophysical observations of neutron stars. At the same time, it has recently been shown that in two-flavor quark matter, subleading corrections from pairing effects can be much larger than would be na\"ively expected, even for comparatively small gaps. In the present Letter, we compute next-to-leading-order corrections to the pressure of quark matter in the CFL phase arising from the gap and the strong coupling constant, incorporating neutron-star equilibrium conditions and current state-of-the-art perturbative QCD results. We find that the corrections are again quite sizable, and they allow us to constrain the CFL gap in the quark energy spectrum to $\Delta_{\rm CFL} \lesssim 140~{\rm MeV}$ at a baryon chemical potential $\mu_{\rm B} = 2.6~{\rm GeV}$, even when allowing for a wide range of possible behaviors for the dependence of the gap on the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Exploring Leptogenesis in the Era of First Order Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for implementing baryogenesis via leptogenesis at low scale within neutrino seesaw framework where a sufficient lepton asymmetry can be generated via out of equilibrium CP-violating decays of right handed neutrinos (RHNs) even when their mass falls below the Standard Model (SM) Higgs mass. It becomes possible by keeping the sphaleron in equilibrium below its conventional decoupling temperature $T_{\rm sp}^{\rm SM} \sim131.7$ GeV in SM so as to facilitate the conversion of lepton asymmetry to baryon asymmetry at such a low scale, thanks to the flexibility of the bubble nucleation temperature in case the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) is of first order. The scenario emerges as an exciting (and perhaps unique) possibility for low scale leptogenesis, particularly if the Universe attains a reheating temperature lower than 131.7 GeV. We show that a stochastic gravitational wave, characteristic of such first order EWPT, may be detected in near future detectors while the presence of RHNs of mass as low as 35 GeV opens up an intriguing detection possibility at current and future accelerator experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum properties of $H\to VV^*$: precise predictions in the SM and sensitivity to new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum properties of the Higgs-boson decays into four fermions via two vector bosons $(H\to VV^*\to 4f)$. In particular, we focus on the case of two different-flavour lepton pairs $(H\to ZZ^*\to \mu^+\mu^- e^+ e^-)$. We compute the quantum-information observables for the corresponding two-qutrit system $(ZZ)$ at next-to-leading order electroweak (NLO EW) accuracy in the SM. We find that NLO EW corrections lead to giant (order 1) effects in some specific cases and significantly alter the extraction of the observables quantifying the quantum correlations. We identify the observables that are robust and can be used to extract reliable information. Finally we discuss possible new physics (NP) effects, parametrised via an effective-field-theory approach. We show how quantum observables can increase the sensitivity to NP also for the process considered in this study.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation functions for axial-vector $T_{4c}$ and $T_{4b}$ tetraquarks: A TQ4Q1.1 update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and discuss the release of novel sets of collinear, variable-flavor-number-scheme fragmentation functions for axial-vector, fully heavy $T_{4c}(1^{+-})$ and $T_{4b}(1^{+-})$ tetraquarks. Working within the single-parton approximation at leading power and employing nonrelativistic QCD factorization adapted for tetraquark Fock states, we model the initial-scale fragmentation input using a recent calculation for the constituent heavy-quark channel. Standard DGLAP evolution is then applied, ensuring consistent implementation of evolution thresholds. To support phenomenology, we investigate NLL/NLO$^+$ rates for tetraquark-jet systems at the HL-LHC and FCC from (sym)JETHAD. This study further integrates exotic matter explorations with precision QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Probing triple Higgs production via $4\tau 2b$ decay channel at a 100 TeV hadron collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of triple Higgs boson production in the $4\tau 2b$ decay final state is performed for the first time at a future 100 TeV hadron collider. The analysis incorporates modified Higgs self-couplings via trilinear Higgs self-coupling $c_3$ and quartic Higgs self-coupling $d_4$, enabling for a model-independent investigation of potential new physics effects. Higgs bosons are reconstructed using both resolved and boosted techniques. To optimize sensitivity across different kinematic regions, we introduce a novel event categorization strategy based on the triple Higgs invariant mass spectrum and the multiplicity of boosted Higgs bosons. In addition to a traditional cut-based analysis, a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) approach is employed to exploit multivariate correlations among kinematic observables, leading to a significant improvement in sensitivity. Our result demonstrates that the $4\tau 2b$ channel provides a viable pathway for probing the Higgs quartic coupling, complementing the existing multi-Higgs production studies, and could reach 5 $\sigma$ in significance for $c_3 \lesssim -1$ and $d_4 \gtrsim 10$ in the scanned range.</description>

      <title>Signals of critical end point from jet quenching and quark energy loss in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The jet quenching parameter and energy loss of light and heavy quarks have been investigated in the framework of holographic QCD models with a critical end point (CEP) at finite baryon chemical potential in $N_f=2,2+1,2+1+1$ systems. The properties of the jet quenching parameter and energy loss around CEP have been carefully studied, and some evident signatures for CEP are subtracted. It is found that the dimensionless jet quenching parameter and the energy loss of light and heavy quarks exhibit evident features around CEP. Specifically, all these quantities increase rapidly near the CEP phase transition temperature $T_{CEP}$ with fixed $\mu_{CEP}$. Moreover, the velocity dependent behavior of heavy quark energy loss at CEP differs significantly from charged particle energy loss in QED matter. For electromagnetic interaction, the energy loss of charged particle can be described by the Bethe-Bloch formula and the Lindhand-Scharff-Schiott theory at low and high velocities, respectively. However, the heavy quark energy loss at CEP is approximately proportional to velocity at low velocities and aligns with Bjorken's results at high velocities, which indicates that the heavy quark energy loss is predominantly collisional at low velocities and gluon radiation dominant at high velocities. For light quark energy loss, the behavior of the energy loss per unit length and the total energy loss differs significantly. However, the total energy loss and stopping distance exhibit similar behavior. This implies that the stopping distance predominantly determines the total energy loss. Thus, even with increased energy loss per unit length at higher temperatures or chemical potentials, the total energy loss decreases due to the reduced stopping distance.</description>

      <title>Axion Superradiance in Dipole Magnetic Fields of Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider constraints on the axion-photon coupling by superradiance due to a plasma instability in the magnetospheres of millisecond pulsars. We compute the growth rate of a superradiant axion cloud in a dipole magnetic field, and give a semi-analytical formula for the superradiance rate for the lowest state. By requiring the associated instability time to be longer than the characteristic age of the supermassive black-widow millisecond pulsar PSR J0952-0607, we examine the pulsar-timing array constraints on axions of mass $\sim 10^{-12}\text{ eV}$. We find that competitive axion bounds from plasma instabilities are unlikely unless a new high spin pulsar is discovered.</description>

      <title>Higgs Decay Signal Strengths in an Extended 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combined CMS and ATLAS analysis of \(h \to Z\gamma\) reveals a \(2\sigma\) excess over the Standard Model (SM) prediction, hinting at potential new physics. In contrast, the observed agreement of \(\mu_{\gamma\gamma}\) with the SM imposes stringent constraints on such extension. In this context, we investigate a Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) extended by a complex scalar singlet and a vector-like lepton (VLL). This framework successfully accommodates the Higgs decay signal strengths \(\mu_{{}_{W \,W^\star}}\), \( \mu_{Z\gamma}\,\), and \(\, \mu_{\gamma\gamma}\) while also satisfying precision electroweak constraints, the observed experimental value of muon \(g-2\), and bounds from LEP II data. We identify a viable region of parameter space that is consistent with all low energy data and current experimental limits on the Higgs decay signal strengths.</description>

      <title>Physics with high-luminosity proton-nucleus collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics case for the operation of high-luminosity proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions during Run 3 and 4 at the LHC is reviewed. The collection of $\mathcal{O}$(1-10 pb$^{-1}$) of proton-lead ($p$Pb) collisions at the LHC will provide unique physics opportunities in a broad range of topics including proton and nuclear parton distribution functions (PDFs and nPDFs), generalised parton distributions (GPDs), transverse momentum dependent PDFs (TMDs), low-$x$ QCD and parton saturation, hadron spectroscopy, baseline studies for quark-gluon plasma and parton collectivity, double and triple parton scatterings (DPS/TPS), photon-photon collisions, and physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM); which are not otherwise as clearly accessible by exploiting data from any other colliding system at the LHC. This report summarises the accelerator aspects of high-luminosity $pA$ operation at the LHC, as well as each of the physics topics outlined above, including the relevant experimental measurements that motivate -- much -- larger $pA$ datasets.</description>

      <title>Study of Nucleon and $\Delta$ resonances from a Systematic Analysis of $K^\ast\Sigma$ Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic analysis of the $K^\ast\Sigma$ photoproduction off proton is performed with all the available differential cross section data. We carry out a strategy different from the previous studies of these reactions, that instead of fixing the parameters of the added resonances from PDG or pentaquark models, we add the resonance with a specific $J^P$ and leave its parameters to be determined from the experimental data. When adding only one resonance, the best result is to add one $N(3/2^-)$ resonance around $2097$ MeV, which substantially reduce the $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom to $1.35$. There are two best solutions when adding two resonances, one is to add one $N^\ast(3/2^-)$ and one $N^\ast(7/2^-)$, the other is to add one $N^\ast(3/2^-)$ and one $\Delta^\ast(7/2^-)$, leading the $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom to be $1.10$ and $1.09$, respectively. The mass values of the $N^\ast(3/2^-)$ in the two-resonance solutions are both near $2070$ MeV. Our solutions indicate that the $N(3/2^-)$ resonance around $2080$ MeV is strongly coupled with the $K^\ast\Sigma$ final state and support the molecular picture of $N(2080, 3/2^-)$.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Dark Matter in the Sun: A Multicomponent Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel concept of enhanced asymmetric dark matter annihilation in astrophysical bodies like the Sun in the presence of multiple dark matter candidates based on hidden annihilation mechanisms. We consider hidden sector annihilation of a heavy dark matter into an asymmetric dark matter, resulting in a significant change in the dark matter annihilation flux and the muon flux at neutrino detectors. We quantify expected changes in the muon flux with scaling parameters for the symmetric or asymmetric nature of the heavier dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Low scale leptogenesis and $TM_1$ mixing in neutrinophillic two Higgs doublet model($\nu$2HDM) with S4 flavor symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a modified version of the Standard Model that includes a scalar doublet and two right-handed neutrinos, forming the neutrinophillic two higgs doublet ($\nu\text{2HDM}$) framework. For $v_2 &lt;&lt; v_1$, this model operates at a TeV scale, bringing the RHNs within experimental reach. To further enhance its predictive power, we introduce an $S_4 \times Z_4$ flavor symmetry with five flavons, resulting in mass matrices that realize $\text{TM}_1$ mixing. The model effectively explains lepton masses and flavor mixing under the normal ordering of neutrino masses, predicting that the effective neutrino mass in 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay lies between [4 - 5] meV, significantly lower than the sensitivity limits of current experiments. We also investigate how this framework could support low-scale leptogenesis as a natural way to explain the observed imbalance between matter and antimatter in the Universe. This work explores how neutrino physics, flavor symmetry, and baryon asymmetry are connected, providing a clear framework that links theoretical predictions with experimental possibilities.</description>

      <title>All-vortex nonlinear Compton scattering in a polarized laser field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process of all-vortex nonlinear Compton scattering in an intense and polarized laser field, in which the initial and final electrons and the emitted $\gamma$ photon are all in vortex states, is studied theoretically. We develop a formalism for the process, which allows us to study the exchanges of the orbital angular momentum (OAM) and spin angular momentum among the electron, $\gamma$ photon, and laser. A wave packet of the Bessel-Gaussian type is adopted to describe the initial vortex electron for the purpose of normalization. Both circularly and linearly polarized lasers are examined. Substantial numerical calculations are performed to reveal the physics of the exchanges of the OAM and spin angular momentum. The strong impact of the laser intensity and the opening angle of the initial vortex electron is demonstrated. Our results also suggest possible scenarios for the separation of the emitted $\gamma$ photons with different OAMs, as well as a possible way which could help to distinguish the OAM and spin of the vortex particle by the multi-peak structure in the spectrum of the emitted photon.</description>

      <title>Challenges in locating the QCD critical point via constant entropy density contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method was proposed recently to investigate the location of the putative critical point of strongly interacting matter, governed by quantum chromodynamics. By approximating contours of constant entropy density at finite baryon chemical potential, the conditions for the existence of a critical point are solved. In this work, we analyze this method in the hadron resonance gas and Nambu--Jona-Lasinio models. We demonstrate that the prediction of the critical point in the HRG model is solely due to mesonic and baryonic degrees of freedom, and thus is not necessarily a signal of a critical point. We argue that such an expansion leads to a physically meaningful prediction only when applied near the critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of exotic multi-quark states has garnered significant attention recently, particularly in heavy-quark dynamics within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). We perform a comprehensive spectroscopic analysis of fully heavy pentaquark states with quark configurations $cccc\bar{c}$ and $bbbb\bar{b}$, considering spin-parity quantum numbers $J^P = 1/2^-$, $3/2^-$, and $5/2^-$. We construct the color-spin wavefunctions to explore the internal structure and mixing effects in these exotic states. Using an extended form of the Gursey-Radicati mass formula by incorporating spin-dependent interactions, we calculated their mass spectra. The modification incorporates effective mass contributions and hyperfine interactions to improve the predictive power for these hadronic states. We systematically analyze their quantum numbers, including spin parity, isospin, and the eigenvalues of the quadratic Casimir operator, which characterize their symmetry properties. The calculated mass spectra are compared with existing theoretical predictions to assess the stability and possible decay channels of these states. The calculated mass spectra exhibit a strong dependence on the interplay between spin interactions and color configurations, shedding light on the binding mechanism within these fully heavy multiquark systems. To gain further insights into their stability and decay properties, we investigated their potential production modes from $b$-hadron decays. Our analysis identifies dominant strong decay channels, providing critical theoretical benchmarks for distinguishing these states in future LHCb or EIC experiments. This study offers new insights into the role of heavy-quark dynamics in exotic hadron spectroscopy, serving as a stringent test for effective QCD-based models and lattice QCD predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scattering lengths on the interactions between the spin-$1/2$ doubly charmed baryons and Nambu-Goldstone bosons are of great importance for the investigation of the spectroscopy of heavy flavored baryons. To that end, we have conducted a systematic analysis of the low-energy dynamics of doubly charmed baryons within the frameworks of chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) and lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD). On the one hand, the S- and P-wave scattering lengths are predicted in a manifestly relativistic baryon ChPT at leading one-loop order. On the other hand, results of the S-wave scattering lengths for four elastic scattering single channels are obtained in lattice QCD for the first time.</description>

      <title>Dark energy under a gauge symmetry: A review of gauged quintessence and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the gauged quintessence scenario, wherein the quintessence scalar field responsible for dark energy is promoted to a complex field charged under a dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. This construction leads to new and potentially rich cosmological phenomenology. After a concise recap of the standard quintessence scenario, we highlight how a $U(1)$ gauge invariance alters the dynamics of the scalar and the associated dark gauge boson. We survey the evolution of both fields across cosmic history, discuss their possible production via a misalignment mechanism, and examine implications for the Hubble tension. We also comment on potential non-gravitational signals of gauged quintessence through kinetic mixing (the dark photon vector portal).</description>

      <title>Charmonium-nucleon femtoscopic correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the femtoscopic correlation functions of charmonium-nucleon pairs, utilizing the lattice QCD phase shifts provided by the HAL QCD Collaboration. A model-independent formalism is employed to transform scattering phase shifts directly into momentum correlation functions, thereby circumventing the approximations inherent in traditional methods, such as the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshits model. The $J/\psi$-$p$ correlation functions, including spin-averaged and partial-wave results, are predicted using near-physical pion mass lattice results. The $\eta_c$-$p$ correlation function is calculated for the first time. The derived correlation functions provide critical references for future experiments, such as those at the LHC, where high-precision measurements of charmonium-nucleon correlations could unveil valuable insights into non-perturbative QCD dynamics.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the baryon time-like electromagnetic form factors in the electron-positron annihilation reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the experimental measurements of the electron-positron annihilation reactions into a baryon ($B$) and anti-baryon ($\bar{B}$) pair, the electromagnetic form factors of hyperons in the time-like region can be investigated within the vector meson dominance model. The theoretical model parameters are determined by fitting them to the total cross sections of the process $e^+e^-\to B \bar{B}$, and it is found that the current experimental data on the baryon electromagnetic form factors in the time-like region can be well reproduced. In addition to the total cross sections, the electromagnetic form factors $G_E$ and $G_M$, and the charge radii of those baryons are also estimated, which are in agreement with the experimental data. On the other hand, we have also investigated the nonmonotonic behavior of the time-like baryon electromagnetic form factors, and it is found that the previously proposed periodic behaviour of the nucleon time-like electromagnetic form factor is not confirmed. However, we do observe the nonmonotonic structures in the line shape of the baryon effective form factors or the ratio $|G_E/G_M|$ for the charmed baryon $\Lambda^+_c$. These features can be naturally explained by incorporating contributions from excited vector states. More precise measurements of the $e^+e^-\to B \bar{B}$ reaction offer a valuable opportunity to probe the properties of excited vector states, which are at present poorly known. Additionally, comprehensive theoretical and experimental studies of baryon timelike electromagnetic form factors can provide critical insights into the underlying mechanisms of electron-positron annihilation processes.</description>

      <title>Light quark energy loss in the flavor-dependent systems from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the holographic model of finite-endpoint-momentum shooting string approach, we study the instantaneous energy loss of light quarks for the flavor-dependent systems with $N_f = 0$, $N_f = 2$, and $N_f = 2+1$ in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton (EMD) framework. In particular, we investigate for the first time the impact of the flavor content of the strongly coupled QGP medium on the instantaneous energy loss of light quarks. It turns out that the instantaneous energy loss of light quarks is smallest for $N_f = 0$, and adding $u(d)$ quarks and $s$ quark in the system increases this energy loss. In addition, we found that the instantaneous energy loss in the strongly coupled plasma is minimal near the critical temperature, but it increases as the system moves away from the critical endpoint due to rising temperature or chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Experimental Constraints on Seesaw Parameters in the Wigner-like Parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By introducing three right-handed neutrino singlets, the popular canonical seesaw mechanism is able to simultaneously explain the tiny masses of Majorana neutrinos and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In this paper, we provide an explicit calculation in this model with the help of the Wigner-like parametrization, working in the flavor basis that both the Dirac and Majorana mass matrices are chosen to be diagonal. Physical observables can be exactly calculated without any approximation, where three light Majorana neutrino masses $m_i^{}$, leptonic mixing angles $\theta_{ij}^{}$, CP-violating phases $\{\delta,\rho,\sigma\}$, and three rotation angles $\vartheta_i^{}$ describing the hierarchy between electroweak and seesaw scales are chosen as input parameters. For demonstration, we evaluate the branching fractions of the lepton-flavor-violating decays of charged leptons and the CP-violating asymmetries in the resonant thermal leptogenesis. The model parameters are constrained by the latest experimental limits.</description>

      <title>Finite density signatures of confining and chiral dynamics in QCD thermodynamics and fluctuations of conserved charges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate thermodynamic observables such as pressure, baryon number, entropy and energy density, as well as the second and fourth order baryon number cumulants in the phase structure of QCD. The intertwined confinement and chiral dynamics is resolved within functional QCD, aiming for quantitative accuracy at larger densities. Specifically it is shown that the self-consistent resolution of the confining gluonic background is crucial in particular for even the qualitative properties of the cumulants. Our results are in quantitative agreement with lattice and functional QCD benchmarks at vanishing and small chemical potentials. Moreover, they offer novel insights in the dynamics at larger chemical potentials including the regime of the critical end point. A welcome by-product of this analysis is the computation of the Polyakov loop potential in finite density QCD, which, alongside the aforementioned observables, can be used as input and benchmark for effective theory computations at finite density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) soft function for a generic hadroproduction process involving massive colored particles is analytically calculated at the one-loop level, extended to higher orders in the dimensional regulator $\epsilon$. We present both the azimuthal-angle-averaged and azimuthal-angle-dependent soft functions in impact-parameter space, making them suitable for small $q_T$ resummation calculations. Their analytic expressions are provided in terms of multiple polylogarithms. Our results offer essential ingredients for a complete higher-order perturbative calculation of the TMD soft function.</description>

      <title>Detailed $SU(3)$ Flavour Symmetry Analysis of Charmless Two-Body $B$-Meson Decays Including Factorizable Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decays of $B_{(s)}$ mesons into light pseudoscalar mesons under the $SU(3)$ flavour symmetry. Assuming exact $SU(3)$ symmetry at the level of the amplitudes leads to a simple parameterization. Using the available experimental data and, for the first time, mixing effects in the $B_s^0$ decays, we find that the data cannot be described with this assumption. We improve this parametrization by including {\it factorizable} $SU(3)_\mathrm{F}$-breaking effects. This new approach allows for an excellent description of the data, with a fit $p$ value of $32.3\%$. We provide posterior predictions for all observables and identify several decay channels that would significantly impact our analysis. Finally, we briefly compare our results with the predictions of QCD factorization, paving the way to a more detailed analysis which could provide insights into QCD effects at low energy scales.</description>

      <title>Precision DIS thrust predictions for HERA and EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present predictions for the DIS 1-jettiness event shape $\tau_1^b$, or DIS thrust, using the framework of Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) for factorization, resummation of large logarithms, and rigorous treatment of nonperturbative power corrections, matched to fixed-order QCD away from the resummation region. Our predictions reach next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (N$^3$LL) accuracy in resummed perturbation theory, matched to $O(\alpha_s^2)$ fixed-order QCD calculations obtained using the program NLOJet++. We include a rigorous treatment of hadronization corrections, which are universal across different event shapes and kinematic variables $x$ and $Q$ at leading power, and supplement them with a systematic scheme to remove $O(\Lambda_\textrm{QCD})$ renormalon ambiguities in their definition. The framework of SCET allows us to connect smoothly the nonperturbative, resummation, and fixed-order regions, whose relative importance varies with $x$ and $Q$, and to rigorously estimate theoretical uncertainties, across a broad range of $x$ and $Q$ covering existing experimental results from HERA as well as expected new measurements from the upcoming Electron-Ion-Collider (EIC). Our predictions will serve as an important benchmark for the EIC program, enabling the precise determination of the QCD strong coupling $\alpha_s$ and the universal nonperturbative first moment parameter $\Omega_1$.</description>

      <title>The Standard Model tested with neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics effectively explains most observed phenomena, though some anomalies, especially in the neutrino sector, suggest the need for extensions. In this work, we perform the first global fit of elastic neutrino-nucleus and neutrino-electron scattering data to further test the SM within a consistent framework. Our results on the neutrino charge radius, the only non-zero electromagnetic property of neutrinos in the SM, show no significant deviation, indicating no large beyond the SM flavor-dependent effects for electron and muon neutrinos. By incorporating solar neutrino data from dark matter direct detection experiments, we also place the most stringent constraints on the tau neutrino charge radius obtained from neutrino scattering experiments. Additionally, we determine updated constraints on the vector and axial-vector neutrino-electron neutral current couplings, adjusting for flavor-dependent effects and for the different experimental momentum transfers. The global analysis reveals two allowed solutions: one close to the SM prediction, and a degenerate solution that is favored. We show that future dark matter detectors could achieve sufficient precision to resolve the degeneracy. As we move toward the precision era, this work demonstrates the crucial need to properly account for flavor- and momentum-dependent effects to avoid misinterpretations of the data.</description>

      <title>The ISW-Lensing Bispectrum &amp; Trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations are correlated with the gravitational lensing potential. Famously, this induces a CMB three-point function, whose shape can be used to constrain dark energy and modifications to gravity. An analogous effect occurs at higher-order, producing an ISW-lensing trispectrum whose amplitude is hitherto unconstrained. We present a detailed discussion of this effect, and define minimum-variance estimators for the ISW-lensing three- and four-point functions. These are implemented within the PolySpec code, and bear strong similarities to the quadratic estimators used in lensing analyses. Applying these tools to Planck, we obtain strong detections of the bispectrum amplitude (consistent with previous works), but find only weak constraints on the trispectrum, due to a strong cancellation between the various ISW-induced contributions. We additionally forecast the constraints from future datasets, finding that (a) simple estimators for the ISW-lensing bispectrum will be severely limited by non-Gaussian modifications to the covariance, and (b) the ISW-lensing trispectrum will be very challenging to detect even with high-resolution future experiments. We finally consider the induced bias on primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes (and lensing itself), which we show to be large for the bispectrum (as expected) but negligible for the trispectrum.</description>

      <title>High-energy gamma-ray emission from memory-burdened primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical studies on the memory-burden effect suggest that Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) with masses smaller than $10^{15}$ grams may be viable dark matter candidates and, consequently, be potential sources of high-energy particles in the present Universe. In this paper, we investigate the evaporation of memory-burdened PBHs into high-energy gamma-rays. Differently from previous analyses, we account for the attenuation of gamma-rays caused by their interaction with background radiation at energies above $10^5~{\rm GeV}$, as well as the secondary emission from the electromagnetic cascades generated during the propagation through extragalactic space. Performing a likelihood analysis with current gamma-ray data, we place new constraints on the parameter space of memory-burdened PBHs. Our results show that ultra-high-energy diffuse gamma-ray observations set more restrictive bounds than high-energy neutrino data, particularly in scenarios with a strong memory-burden suppression of the PBH evaporation.</description>

      <title>Simple third order operator-splitting schemes for stochastic mechanics and field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for constructing numerical schemes with up to 3rd strong convergence order for solution of a class of stochastic differential equations, including equations of the Langevin type. The construction proceeds in two stages. In the first stage one approximates the stochastic equation by a differential equation with smooth coefficients randomly sampled at each time step. In the second stage the resulting regular equation is solved with the conventional operator-splitting techniques. This separation renders the approach flexible, allowing one to freely combine the numerical techniques most suitable to the problem at hand. The approach applies to ordinary and partial stochastic differential equations. In the latter case, it naturally gives rise to pseudo-spectral algorithms. We numerically test the strong convergence of several schemes obtained with this method in mechanical examples. Application to partial differential equations is illustrated by real-time simulations of a scalar field with quartic self-interaction coupled to a heat bath. The simulations accurately reproduce the thermodynamic properties of the field and are used to explore dynamics of thermal false vacuum decay in the case of negative quartic coupling.</description>

Abstract: Accurate modeling of the inflationary gravitational waves (GWs) requires time-consuming, iterative numerical integrations of differential equations to take into account their backreaction on the expansion history. To improve computational efficiency while preserving accuracy, we present SageNet (Stiff-Amplified Gravitational-wave Emulator Network), a deep learning framework designed to replace conventional numerical solvers. SageNet employs a Long Short-Term Memory architecture to emulate the present-day energy density spectrum of the inflationary GWs with possible stiff amplification, $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(f)$. Trained on a data set of 25,689 numerically generated solutions, SageNet allows accurate reconstructions of $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(f)$ and generalizes well to a wide range of cosmological parameters; 89.3% of the test emulations with randomly distributed parameters exhibit errors of under 4%. In addition, SageNet demonstrates its ability to learn and reproduce the artificial, adaptive sampling patterns in numerical calculations, which implement denser sampling of frequencies around changes of spectral indices in $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(f)$. The dual capability of learning both physical and artificial features of the numerical GW spectra establishes SageNet as a robust alternative to exact numerical methods. Finally, our benchmark tests show that SageNet reduces the computation time from tens of seconds to milliseconds, achieving a speed-up of ~$10^4$ times over standard CPU-based numerical solvers with the potential for further acceleration on GPU hardware. These capabilities make SageNet a powerful tool for accelerating Bayesian inference procedures for extended cosmological models. In a broad sense, the SageNet framework offers a fast, accurate, and generalizable solution to modeling cosmological observables whose theoretical predictions demand costly differential equation solvers.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Coma Cluster Structure: From the Core to the Hubble Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Coma cluster, embedded in a cosmic filament, is a complex and dynamically active structure in the local Universe. Applying a density-based member selection (dbscan) to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we identify its virilised core and zero-velocity boundary. Cross-correlating with the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalogue enables a velocity-distance analysis, incorporating radial infall models and redshift-independent distance estimators. This reveals, for the first time, the Hubble flow surrounding Coma, a first step to investigate the entanglement between the dark matter in bound objects and the dark energy driving the expansion of their surroundings. The distance to the Coma centre is determined as $69.959 \pm 0.012 \, h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$. From dbscan, we infer a virial radius of $r_{\rm vir} = \left(1.95 \pm 0.12\right)\,h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$ and a turnaround of $r_{\rm ta} \geq 4.87~{h}^{-1}~\mbox{Mpc}$. Combining the SDSS redshifts with the CF4 distances, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = (73.10 \pm 0.92)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}/\mbox{Mpc}$. However, with different calibrations for the distance moduli, $H_0$ varies between $[72, 80]$ km/s/Mpc. Mass estimates via caustics, the virial theorem, and the Hubble-flow method yield $M = [0.77, 2.0] \times 10^{15}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$, consistent with prior studies. Our systematic approach maps the structure of Coma into the local Hubble flow and shows the degeneracies between dynamical parameters such as the Hubble constant, the virial radius, and the total mass.</description>

      <title>Gravitational dark matter production from fermionic spectator fields during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational particle production from vacuum for a minimally coupled fermionic spectator field during a single-field inflationary phase. We observe that metric perturbations arising from the quantum fluctuations of a scalar inflaton field enhance gravitational production, showing that such a perturbative contribution becomes dominant if the field mass is sufficiently smaller than the inflationary Hubble rate. We focus on modes that leave the Hubble horizon during the latest stages of slow-roll and we numerically compute the total number of particles obtained from perturbations, providing a lower bound on the amount of such \enquote{geometric} particles for the case of Starobinsky inflation and a quadratic hilltop scenario. Our outcomes are compatible with the net observational cold dark matter abundance as experimentally measured, whose dark matter candidate exhibits mass in the range $10^5 \lesssim m \lesssim 10^7$ GeV, excluded by previous non-perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Has DESI detected exponential quintessence?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 results have strengthened the possibility that dark energy is dynamical, i.e., it has evolved over the history of the Universe. One simple, but theoretically well motivated and widely studied, physical model of dynamical dark energy is minimally coupled, single-field quintessence $\phi$ with an exponential potential $V(\phi)=V_0\,e^{-\lambda\phi}$. We perform a full Bayesian statistical analysis of the model using the DESI DR2 data, in combination with other cosmological observations, to constrain the model's parameters and compare its goodness of fit to that of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We find that the quintessence model provides a significantly better fit to the data, both when the spatial curvature of the Universe is fixed to zero and when it is allowed to vary. The significance of the preference varies between $\sim3.3\sigma$ and $\sim3.8\sigma$, depending on whether the curvature density parameter $\Omega_K$ is fixed or varied. We obtain the values $0.698^{+0.173}_{-0.202}$ and $0.722^{+0.182}_{-0.208}$ at the $68.3\%$ (i.e., $1\sigma$) confidence level for the parameter $\lambda$ in the absence and the presence of $\Omega_K$, respectively, which imply $\sim3.5\sigma$ preference for a nonzero $\lambda$. We also obtain $\Omega_K=0.003\pm 0.001$, which implies $\sim3\sigma$ preference for a positive $\Omega_K$, i.e., a negative curvature. Finally, we discuss the differences between quintessence and phenomenological parametrizations of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, in particular the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization.</description>

      <title>How much has DESI dark energy evolved since DR1?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DESI has reported a dynamical dark energy (DE) signal based on the $w_0 w_a$CDM model that is in conflict with Hubble tension. Recalling that the combination of DESI DR1 BAO and DR1 full-shape (FS) modeling are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, in this letter we comment on the status of fluctuations in DR1 BAO documented in \cite{DESI:2024mwx, Colgain:2024xqj} in the DR2 update. In particular, we note that neither DR1 BAO nor DR2 BAO nor DR2 BAO+CMB confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model with relaxed model parameter priors confirm late-time accelerated expansion today. Translating DESI BAO constraints into flat $\Lambda$CDM constraints, we observe that the DESI LRG1 constraint remains the most prominent outlier preferring larger $\Omega_m$ values, LRG2 switches from smaller to larger $\Omega_m$ values relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM, and ELG data drive the relatively low $\Omega_m$ in the full DR2 BAO. We observe that one cannot restore $w_0 = -1$ within one $1 \sigma$ by removing either LRG1 or LRG2, but LRG2 in DR2, in contrast to LRG1 in DR1, now has a greater bearing on $w_0 &gt; -1$. We conclude that the BAO has yet to stabilise, but the general trend is towards greater consistency with DESI DR1 FS modeling results, where there may be no dynamical DE signal in DESI data alone.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>

      <title>Identifying $\alpha$-cluster configurations in $^{20}$Ne via ultracentral Ne+Ne Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial-state geometry in relativistic heavy-ion collisions provides a unique probe to nuclear cluster structure $-$ a long-standing challenge in nuclear structure physics. Through the microscopic Brink model, we establish a quantitative framework to decode complicated cluster structures encoded in the cluster wave function, revealing non-negligible cluster components stemming from the rich structural degrees of freedom for the ground state of $^{20}$Ne. By combining this approach with advanced analytical calculation techniques, we demonstrate that the normalized symmetric cumulant NSC(3, 2) and Pearson coefficient $\rho (\varepsilon_{3}^{2},\ \delta d_{\perp})$ serve as robust discriminators between $5\alpha$ and $\alpha$+$^{16}$O cluster configurations in $^{20}$Ne. Our findings suggest that ultracentral Ne+Ne collisions at the LHC can experimentally isolate $\alpha$-clustering configurations via flow correlations, opening a new paradigm for probing clustering in light nuclei.</description>

      <title>Novel Polarimetric Analysis of Near Horizon Flaring Episodes in M87* in Millimeter Wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent multi-wavelength observations of M87* \citep{2024A&amp;A...692A.140A} revealed a high-energy $\gamma$-ray flare without a corresponding millimeter counterpart. We present a theoretical polarimetric study to evaluate the presence and nature of a potential millimeter flare in M87*, using a suite of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations with varying black hole (BH) spins and magnetic field configurations. We find that the emergence of a millimeter flare is strongly influenced by both spin and magnetic structure, with limited sensitivity to the electron distribution (thermal vs. non-thermal). We model the intensity light curve with a damped random walk (DRW) and compare the characteristic timescale ($\tau$) with recent SMA observations, finding that the simulated $\tau$ exceeds observed values by over an order of magnitude. In a flaring case with BH spin a=+0.5, we identify a distinct millimeter flare followed by an order-of-magnitude flux drop. All Stokes parameters show variability near the flare, including a sign reversal in the electric vector position angle. While most $\beta_m$ modes remain stable, the $EB$-correlation phase is highly sensitive to both the flare peak and decay. We examine polarimetric signatures in photon sub-rings, focusing on modes ns=0 and ns=1. The ns=0 signal closely matches the full image, while ns=1 reveals distinct behaviors, highlighting the potential of space VLBI to isolate sub-ring features. Finally, we analyze the magnetic and velocity field evolution during the flare, finding that magnetic reconnection weakens during the flux decay, and the clockwise velocity flow transitions into an outflow-dominated regime. These results suggest that transient radio variability near flares encodes key information about black hole spin and magnetic field structure, offering a novel probe into the physics of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the finite-temperature perturbation theory of interacting scalar fields under external rotation. Because of the translational non-invariance in the radial direction, Green's functions are described using the Fourier-Bessel basis, instead of the conventional Fourier basis. We derive the leading order correction to the partition function and the one-loop self-energy, which involve an analytically intractable integral with Bessel functions. The Feynman rules obtained in our perturbation theory suggest that the zero-temperature thermodynamics of the perturbatively interacting theory is unaffected by rotation, similarly to that of the noninteracting theory.</description>

      <title>The universal crossover from thermodynamics and dynamics of supercritical RN-AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of supercritical Reissner-Nordstr\"om Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black holes in the extended phase space with the pressure defines as the cosmological constant. Supercritical black holes exist in the region where both temperature and pressure exceed the critical point, known as the supercritical region. The conventional view states that black holes in this regime are indistinguishable between large and small phases. However, recent research reveals that the supercritical regime exhibits universal gas-like and liquid-like phase separation, which shed light on the study on the supercritical region of RN-AdS black holes in the extended phase space. In this work, we calculate the thermodynamic potential and quasinormal modes (QNMs) of RN-AdS black holes, and identify transition curves between two different states in supercritical region using thermodynamic and dynamic methods. On one hand, we find the thermodynamic crossover curve (Widom line) by defining the scaled variance $\Omega$ (a higher-order derivative of Gibbs free energy). On the other hand, we identify the dynamic crossover curve (Frenkel line) by analyzing transitions between distinct QNM decay modes.</description>

      <title>Learning symmetries in datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how symmetries present in datasets affect the structure of the latent space learned by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). By training VAEs on data originating from simple mechanical systems and particle collisions, we analyze the organization of the latent space through a relevance measure that identifies the most meaningful latent directions. We show that when symmetries or approximate symmetries are present, the VAE self-organizes its latent space, effectively compressing the data along a reduced number of latent variables. This behavior captures the intrinsic dimensionality determined by the symmetry constraints and reveals hidden relations among the features. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of a simple toy model, demonstrating how, under idealized conditions, the latent space aligns with the symmetry directions of the data manifold. We illustrate these findings with examples ranging from two-dimensional datasets with $O(2)$ symmetry to realistic datasets from electron-positron and proton-proton collisions. Our results highlight the potential of unsupervised generative models to expose underlying structures in data and offer a novel approach to symmetry discovery without explicit supervision.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes as a Factory of Axions: Extragalactic Photons from Axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are significant sources of axions and axion-like particles (ALPs), provided their Hawking temperature exceeds the particles' masses. Given the predominant decay of axions into photons, the enhanced photon spectrum they generate can be feasibly detected using sensitive detectors. This paper introduces a novel methodology that elucidates the decay process for particles to traverse and decay over cosmological timescales. Specifically, we derive estimations for the photon spectrum and flux, assuming a monochromatic mass spectrum and isotropic distribution for PBHs. Encouragingly, forthcoming detectors like e-ASTROGAM are well positioned to capture this signal.</description>

      <title>Naturalness in Soft Leptogenesis and Gravitino Mass Bound due to Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02604v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If sneutrinos are produced through primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation, then some interesting features of soft leptogenesis in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with heavy right-handed neutrinos, are found. The required baryonic asymmetry could be possible from the decays of sneutrinos, for the soft SUSY breaking trilinear $A$ and bilinear $B$ parameters around the electroweak scale. The resonance condition in soft leptogenesis is not required. The allowed regions of different relevant parameters are discussed in detail. Using experimental constraints from collider searches on heavy leptons, the lower bound on the right-handed neutrino mass is found to be around $300$ GeV with Yukawa coupling lesser than about $0.4$. The allowed region of the typical mass scale of some supersymmetric particles and the $|A|$ parameter is also shown from the experimental constraint on the branching ratio for $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ in MEG-II search. Depending on PBH mass, bounds on the mass of gravitinos, produced from PBH evaporation, is discussed and gravitino mass around the electroweak scale is found to be possible only for unstable gravitino.</description>

      <title>Optimizing The Cut And Count Method In Phenomenological Studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an optimization technique to discriminate signal and background in any phenomenological study based on the cut and count-based method. The core ideas behind this technique are the introduction of a ranking scheme that can quantitatively assess the relative importance of various observables involved in a new physics process, and a more methodical way of choosing what cuts to impose. The technique is an iterative process that works with the help of the MadAnalysis5 interface. Working in the context of a BSM (Beyond Standard Model) scenario where we carry out a signal search of singly charged Higgs in the context of the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), we demonstrate how automating the cut and count process in this specific way results in an enhanced discovery potential compared with the more traditional way of imposing cuts.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Supernovae Bounds on Sterile Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos can be produced through mixing with active neutrinos in the hot, dense core of a core-collapse supernova (SN). The standard bounds on the active-sterile mixing ($\sin^2 \theta$) from SN arise from SN1987A energy-loss, requiring $E_{\text{loss}}&lt;10^{52}~{\rm erg}$. In this work, we discuss a novel bound on sterile neutrino parameter space arising from the energy deposition through its decays inside the SN envelope. Using the observed underluminous SN IIP population, this energy deposition is constrained to be below $\sim 10^{50}~{\rm erg}$. Focusing on sterile neutrino mixing only with tau neutrino, for heavy sterile masses $m_s$ in the range $100$-$500$ MeV, we find stringent constraints on $\sin^2 \theta_\tau$ reaching two orders of magnitude lower than those from the SN1987A energy loss argument, {thereby probing the mixing angles required for Type-I seesaw mechanism}. Similar bounds will also be applicable to sterile mixing only with muons ($\sin^2 \theta_\mu$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central question in heavy-ion collisions is how the initial far-from-equilibrium medium evolves and thermalizes while it undergoes a rapid longitudinal expansion. In this work we use the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action for the first time to consider this question, focusing on $\phi^4$ scalar theory truncated at three loops. We calculate the momentum distribution of quasiparticles in the medium and show that isotropization takes place. We furthermore consider the thermal mass of quasiparticles and the importance of number-changing processes.</description>

      <title>Constraints on evaporating primordial black holes from the AMS-02 positron data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray (CR) positrons are relatively rare due to their secondary origin and thus sensitive to exotic contributions. Primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses above $\sim 5\times10^{14}\,\mathrm{g}$ can be stable sources of CR positrons due to Hawking radiation. The energies of the evaporated positrons can increase significantly through scattering with the Galactic random magnetic fields during the propagation in the Galaxy, which is a generic feature in diffusive re-acceleration CR propagation models. We show that in well-constrained diffusive re-acceleration models, a significant portion of CR positron flux can enter the energy region of $\mathcal{O}(\text{GeV})$, and can be constrained by the current AMS-02 data. As an example, we show that in the Galprop+Helmod model for CR propagation in the Galaxy and heliosphere, an upper limit of $f_{\text{PBH}}\lesssim2.15\times 10^{-4}$ at PBH mass $2\times 10^{16}$~g can be obtained, which improve the previous constraints from the Voyager CR all-electron data by around an order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: We consider Thomson-like processes between dark matter dark photons and free electrons in the Milky Way. The result is a radio signal background that can be detectable with current or future radio telescope arrays. In particular, we computed sensitivity prospects for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope and for the future Square Kilometer Array (SKA), concluding that unconstrained parameter space in a wide range of dark photon masses can be probed.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars as a Probe of Cosmic Neutrino Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) constitutes the last observable prediction of the standard cosmological model, which has yet to be detected directly. In this work, we show how the coherent scattering of neutrinos off dense neutron matter can lead to an additional cooling channel in neutron stars (NSs). We also include the effects of gravitational capture and boosting, but find that the cooling is efficient only in the presence of large overdensities. We further discuss the prediction of a boosted C$\nu$B flux on Earth from nearby NSs and the potential detection prospects in the case of a future nearby galactic supernova. Although currently these ideas do not offer any detection prospects, they can be used to constrain overdensities $\eta \lesssim 10^{11}\textrm{-}10^{14}$ on short length scales $\mathcal{O}(10\text{ km})$. We also discuss the impact of new physics scenarios, such as long-range forces, on NS cooling through the C$\nu$B.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-body strong decays of the $f_0(1500)$, $f_0(1710)$, $a_0(1710)$, $f_2(1270)$, $f_2'(1525)$, and $K_2^*(1430)$ resonances are investigated, assuming them as dynamically generated states of two vector mesons via $s$-wave interactions. The partial decay widths of all the possible two-body pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson final states are calculated considering the triangular diagrams. It is found that the ratios of branching fractions are similar to the previous results for most channels, which were obtained by using the real-axis method and considering the box diagrams. However, there are also differences. In addition, our focus is on the partial decay widths. More precise experimental measurements are needed to test the model calculations and determine the nature of these scalar and tensor mesons. It is anticipated that the BES\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral3}, Belle\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2} and LHCb collaborations will conduct these measurements in the future.</description>

      <title>Probing strangeness with event topology classifiers in pp collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider with the rope hadronization mechanism in PYTHIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the formation of a deconfined and thermalized state of partons, known as quark-gluon plasma (QGP), leads to enhanced production of strange hadrons in contrast to proton-proton (pp) collisions, which are taken as baseline. This observation is known as strangeness enhancement in heavy-ion collisions and is considered one of the important signatures that can signify the formation of QGP. However, in addition to strangeness enhancement, recent measurements hint at observing several heavy-ion-like features in high multiplicity pp collisions at energies available at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. Alternatively, event shape observables, such as transverse spherocity, transverse sphericity, charged particle flattenicity, and relative transverse activity classifiers, can fundamentally separate hard interaction-dominated jetty events from soft isotropic events. These features of event shape observables can probe the observed heavy-ion-like features in pp collisions with significantly reduced selection bias and can bring all collision systems on equal footing. In this article, we present an extensive summary of the strange particle ratios to pions as a function of different event classifiers using the PYTHIA~8 model with color reconnection and rope hadronization mechanisms to understand the microscopic origin of strangeness enhancement in pp collisions and also prescribe the applicability of these event classifiers in the context of strangeness enhancement. Charged particle flattenicity is found to be most suited for the study of strangeness enhancement, and it shows a quantitative enhancement similar to that seen for the analysis based on the number of multi-parton interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the recent data from the BESIII collaboration on the $X(3872)$ state in the $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ decay channels. The quantum number and mass of the $X(3872)$ state allow us to exploit the universal feature of the very near-threshold $D\bar D^*$ scattering in the $S$ wave. The analysis of $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ data and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ data separately as well as the combined analysis of these data together, all support the conclusion that $X(3872)$ is an extremely weakly bound charm meson molecule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the $e^+ e^- \to \gamma^* \to J/\psi \, \pi \, \pi \, (K \bar{K})$ and $e^+ e^- \to \gamma^* \to h_c \, \pi \, \pi$ processes employing the recently proposed Dalitz-plot decomposition approach, which is based on the helicity formalism for three-body decays. For the above reactions, we validate the factorization of the overall rotation for all decay chains and spin alignments, along with the crossing symmetry between final states, using a Lagrangian-based toy model. For the model-dependent factors that describe the subchannel dynamics, we employ the dispersive treatment of the $\pi \, \pi \, (K \bar{K})$ final state interaction, which accurately reproduces pole positions and couplings of the $f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ resonances. The constructed amplitudes serve as an essential framework to further constrain the properties of the charged exotic states $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_c(4020)$, produced in these reactions.</description>

      <title>SIGMA: Single Interpolated Generative Model for Anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key step in any resonant anomaly detection search is accurate modeling of the background distribution in each signal region. Data-driven methods like CATHODE accomplish this by training separate generative models on the complement of each signal region, and interpolating them into their corresponding signal regions. Having to re-train the generative model on essentially the entire dataset for each signal region is a major computational cost in a typical sliding window search with many signal regions. Here, we present SIGMA, a new, fully data-driven, computationally-efficient method for estimating background distributions. The idea is to train a single generative model on all of the data and interpolate its parameters in sideband regions in order to obtain a model for the background in the signal region. The SIGMA method significantly reduces the computational cost compared to previous approaches, while retaining a similar high quality of background modeling and sensitivity to anomalous signals.</description>

      <title>Large neutrino mass in cosmology and keV sterile neutrino dark matter from a dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an extended seesaw model which generates active neutrino masses via the usual type-I seesaw and leads to a large number of massless fermions as well as a sterile neutrino dark matter (DM) candidate in the $\mathcal{O}(10-100) {\rm~keV}$ mass range. The dark sector comes into thermal equilibrium with Standard Model neutrinos after neutrino decoupling and before recombination via a U(1) gauge interaction in the dark sector. This suppresses the abundance of active neutrinos and therefore reconciles sizeable neutrino masses with cosmology. The DM abundance is determined by freeze-out in the dark sector, which allows avoiding bounds from X-ray searches. Our scenario predicts a slight increase in the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ at recombination, potentially detectable by future CMB missions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09994v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present analytical and numerical calculations for the photon polarization tensor at finite temperature and density in a constant magnetic field. We first discuss the tensor decomposition in the presence of the magnetic field, which breaks rotational symmetry. Then, we analytically perform all the momentum integrations and numerically take the Landau level sum. We confirm that the imaginary part of the photon polarization tensor correctly reproduces the known result from the independent calculation. We utilize the Kramers-Kronig relation to estimate the real part numerically as a function of the momenta, the chemical potential, and the finite temperature. As an application, we consider the real photon limit and estimate the photon decay rate and the Stokes parameter in the hot and dense medium. We specifically quantify the difference between the X-mode and the O-mode with the polarization orthogonal and parallel to the magnetic field. As long as the magnetic field is weak, the decay rate of the X-mode photon is larger than that of the O-mode photon, while the O-mode becomes dominant due to the Landau level suppression of the X-mode at a strong magnetic field. We also find that the eigenmodes of the propagating photon change their polarization state with increasing density.</description>

Abstract: In the present work we investigate the mass spectrum and semileptonic decays of double charm and bottom baryon states using the hypercentral quark model. We solve the six-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation via deep learning and particle swarm optimization techniques to improve the speed and accuracy. Then, we predict the masses of the ground and excited states of single and doubly heavy baryons. Working close to the zero recoil point, we also study the semileptonic decay widths and branching ratios of doubly heavy $\Xi$ and $\Omega$ baryons for the $b\rightarrow c$ transitions. A comparison between our results and the evaluations of other theoretical models is also presented. Our predictions of mass spectrum and decay widths provide valuable information for the experiment searching for undiscovered heavy baryon states.</description>

      <title>Blue Loops, Cepheids, and Forays into Axions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The blue loop stage of intermediate mass stars has been called a "magnifying glass", where even seemingly small effects in prior stages of evolution, as well as assumptions about stellar composition, rotation, and convection, produce discernible changes. As such, blue loops, and especially the existence and properties of Cepheids, can serve as a laboratory where feebly connected Beyond Standard Model particles such as axions can be gainfully studied. We undertake a careful study of the effects of these putative particles on the blue loop, paying close attention to the evolution of the core potential and the hydrogen profile. Our simulations, performed with MESA, place bounds on the axion-photon coupling using the galactic Cepheid S Mus, with dynamically-determined mass of $6 M_\odot$, as a benchmark. The effects of varying convective overshoot on the core potential and hydrogen profile, and the ensuing changes in the axion constraints, are carefully studied. Along the way, we explore the "mirror principle" induced by the hydrogen burning shell and contrast our results with those existing in the literature. Less conservative (but more stringent) bounds on the axion-photon coupling are given for a $9 M_\odot$ model, which is the heaviest that can be simulated if overshoot is incorporated, and tentative projections are given for a $12 M_\odot$ model, which is approximately the heaviest tail of the mass distribution of galactic Cepheids determined by pulsation models using Gaia DR2. Our main message is that the reliable simulation and observation (ideally, through dynamical mass determination) of massive Cepheids constitutes an important frontier in axion searches, challenges in modeling uncertainties in the microphysics of the blue loop stage notwithstanding.</description>

      <title>Stepping Up Superradiance Constraints on Axions</title>

Abstract: Light feebly-coupled bosonic particles can efficiently extract the rotational energy of rapidly spinning black holes on sub-astrophysical timescales via a phenomenon known as black hole superradiance. In the case of light axions, the feeble self-interactions of these particles can lead to a non-linear coupled evolution of many superradiant quasi-bound states, dramatically altering the rate at which the black hole is spun down. In this work, we extend the study of axion superradiance to higher order states, solving for the first time the coupled evolution of all states with $n \leq 5$ in the fully relativistic limit (with $n$ being the principle quantum number). Using a Bayesian framework, we re-derive constraints on axions using the inferred spins of solar mass black holes, demonstrating that previously adopted limit-setting procedures have underestimated current sensitivity to the axion decay constant $f_a$ by around one order of magnitude, and that the inclusion to higher order states allows one to reasonably capture the evolution of typical high-spin black holes across a much wider range of parameter space, thereby allowing constraints to be extended to more massive axions. We conclude with an extensive discussion on the systematics associated with spin inference from x-ray observations.</description>

      <title>Three-loop jet function for boosted heavy quarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the inclusive jet function for boosted heavy quarks to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$. The jet function is defined and calculated in the framework of boosted Heavy-Quark Effective Theory (bHQET). It describes the effect of radiation collimated in narrow jets arising from energetic heavy quarks on observables probing the jet invariant mass $M$ in the region where $M^2 - m^2 \ll m^2$, with $m$ the heavy quark mass. This kinematic situation is relevant e.g. in boosted top (pair) production at high-energy colliders. We have verified that our result satisfies non-Abelian exponentiation and checked that our calculation reproduces the known cusp and non-cusp anomalous dimensions of the jet function to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$. We also confirmed that the $n_\ell^2\alpha_s^3$ contribution, where $n_\ell$ is the number of massless quark flavors, agrees with the prediction from renormalon calculus. Our computation provides the last missing piece to obtain the N$^3$LL$^\prime$ resummed (self-normalized) thrust distribution used for the calibration of the top quark mass parameter in parton-shower Monte Carlo generators. Our result also contributes to the invariant mass distribution of reconstructed top quarks at N$^3$LL$^\prime$, which can be employed for a precise top mass determination at future lepton colliders. As a by-product, we obtain the relation between the pole and short-distance jet-mass schemes at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$. Finally, we estimate the non-logarithmic contribution to the four-loop jet function based on renormalon dominance.</description>

      <title>Searches for Power-Law Warped Extra Dimensions</title>

Abstract: Extra dimensions with a bulk dilaton field can be power-law warped, unlike the exponential warping in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We show that this mildly warped extra dimension can address the hierarchy problem with a novel Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum characterized by lighter feebly coupled KK modes compared to the KK modes in the RS model. We investigate the prospects of searching for signatures of such KK modes at current and future colliders, such as the LHC, CLIC, and FCC-ee using visible decays of KK gravitons. We also update the current bounds and projected limits for the RS model and the linear dilaton (LD) model. Furthermore, we explore the long-lived regime of KK gravitons at beam dump experiments, e.g., FASER2, MATHUSLA, and SHiP, as well as constraints from astrophysical and cosmological observations. We find that combining both kinds of searches will enable comprehensive coverage of the model parameter space relevant to the electroweak hierarchy problem.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the two-zero texture Majorana neutrino mass matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been pointed out that there are seven different two-zero texture neutrino mass matrices compatible with neutrino oscillation data. We perform an updated analysis with the recently published Nu-Fit 6.0 results. We also subject the seven two-zero textures to constraints on neutrino mass from cosmology, end point of beta decay spectrum, and neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. We find that all seven textures are compatible with the new oscillation parameters. However, we find five textures, whose 1-1 entry is nonvanishing, are in severe tension with the constraints from cosmology and neutrinoless double beta decay. With the next generation experiments, these five textures could be decisively ruled out. For the remaining two textures, one of them could be ruled out, or severely constrained, if the octant of $\theta_{23}$ is determined.</description>

      <title>Boosted dark matter from semi-annihilations in the galactic center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In some scenarios, the dark matter relic abundance is set by the semi-annihilation of two dark matter particles into one dark matter particle and one Standard Model particle. These semi-annihilations might still be occurring today in the Galactic Center at a significant rate, generating a flux of boosted dark matter particles. We investigate the possible signals of this flux component in direct detection and neutrino experiments for sub-GeV dark matter masses. We show that for typical values of the semi-annihilation cross-section, the sensitivity of current experiments to the spin-independent dark matter-proton scattering cross-section can be several orders of magnitude larger than current constraints from cosmic-ray boosted dark matter. We also argue that the upcoming DARWIN and DUNE experiments may probe scattering cross-sections as low as $10^{-37}\,{\rm cm}^2$ for masses between 30 MeV and 1 GeV.</description>

      <title>Feasibility study of true muonium observation in Belle-II existing dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17753v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: True muonium ($\mu^+\mu^-$) is one of the cleanest bound states, being composed only of leptons, along with true tauonium and positronium. Unlike the latter, true muonium and true tauonium have not been observed so far. This article shows that the spin-0 state of true muonium (para-TM), decaying into two photons, can be observed at a discovery level of significance in the dataset already collected by the Belle-II experiment at the $\Upsilon (4S)$ peak, with certain assumptions on systematic uncertainties. Para-TM is produced via photon-photon fusion, and its observation is based on the detection of the photon pair resulting from its decay, on top of the continuum background due predominantly to light-by-light scattering. Trigger, acceptance and isolation cuts, along with calorimeter resolution and reconstruction efficiency, are taken into account during the Monte Carlo simulation of both signal and background. In order to separate signal and background, a machine learning method, based on extremely randomized trees, is trained on simulated events. Finally, the expected statistical significance of TM observation is evaluated, taking into account systematic uncertainties in a parametric fashion.</description>

      <title>One-loop matching for leading-twist generalised transverse-momentum-dependent distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the one-loop matching coefficients necessary to match all of the leading-twist generalised transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (GTMDs) onto generalised parton distributions (GPDs). Matching functions are extracted by computing the first radiative corrections to partonic bilocal correlators with staple-like Wilson lines, as appropriate for high-energy collisions. These correlators are characterised by a transverse displacement and skewed kinematics of external states. Using the proton helicity basis, they are parametrised in terms of GTMDs, which are subsequently related to leading-twist GPDs. Our results provide new insights into the complex dynamics of GTMDs generated by radiative corrections. In particular, we show that time-reversal even and odd contributions to GTMDs in the so-called ERBL region mix both under matching and evolution. Finally, we present a selection of numerical results and comment on the quantitative behaviour of GTMDs.</description>

      <title>Mono-lepton Signature of a Neutrino-philic Dark Fermion at Hadron Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searching for dark matter at high-energy colliders and direct detection experiments can effectively cover nearly the entire mass range from the MeV to the TeV scale. In this paper, we focus on four-fermion contact interactions formulated within the framework of Effective Field Theory. Specifically, we present a detailed analysis of mono-lepton production at the LHC. Our results demonstrate that tensor operators exhibit superior sensitivity in the mono-lepton channel, constraining energy scales up to 3\,TeV for a nearly massless dark fermion using current LHC data. Moreover, these operators mediate both spin-independent and spin-dependent absorption processes in nuclear targets. A systematic comparison of constraints between direct detection experiments and collider measurements reveals the LHC's distinct advantage in exploring sub-GeV dark matter candidates while maintaining competitive sensitivity at the TeV scale. Notably, direct detection experiments such as Super-Kamiokande and Borexino achieve complementary constraints in the 10-100\,TeV mass range through their unique capabilities: utilization of light nuclei targets, large exposure volumes, and distinctive features of the recoil energy spectra.</description>

      <title>On new physics off the Z peak in $H \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^- \gamma$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a small but intriguing excess observed in the decay mode $ H\rightarrow \ell^+\ell^- \gamma$ reported by both the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, we explore the possibility that new physics contributes directly to the effective $ H \ell \overline{\ell} \gamma $ coupling rather than modifying the $ Z $ peak. Concretely, we consider a dimension-8 operator that could arise from new particles via box diagrams. Such non-resonant contribution may provide an alternative origin for current or future excesses. We examine how experimental cuts may distinguish between possible modifications of the $ Z $ peak and non-resonant contributions. The currently measured excess requires that the new physics scale is relatively low $( \Lambda_R \sim v $). However, we show that it may remain within current experimental bounds. In particular, we illustrate this using a simplified model, motivated by the dark matter problem, and discuss its other experimental constraints.</description>

      <title>Hidden heavy flavor tetraquarks in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Born-Oppenheimer approximation is one of the very successful tools for solving the hydrogen atom problem. The experimental discovery of hidden heavy flavor tetraquarks, $Q\bar{Q}q \bar{q}$ ($Q=c,b$ and $q=u,d,s$), provides great possibilities for the hydrogen-bond-like structure of the Quantum Chromodynamics version. In this work, considering that the colors of $Q\bar{Q}$ and $q\bar{q}$ are both $8$, the tetraquark $Q\bar{Q}q \bar{q}$ system is formed by color coupling $8\otimes8 \rightarrow 1$. In order to study the mass splitting caused by the color-spin hyperfine interaction, the color-spin basis vectors of the $S$-wave tetraquark states are appropriately constructed. Then we use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to calculate the mass spectra of the $S$-wave hidden heavy flavor tetraquark states. The results show that some of the hidden heavy flavor exotic hadrons discovered experimentally can be well explained as this type of hydrogen-bond-like tetraquark structure. In addition, some candidates for tetraquark bound states are predicted and may be compact tetraquark states.</description>

      <title>Tomography of the Rho meson in the QCD Instanton Vacuum: Transverse Momentum Dependent Parton Distribution Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the rho meson unpolarized and polarized transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs) in the instanton liquid model (ILM). The corresponding TMDs in ILM are approximated by a constituent quark beam function in the leading Fock state multiplied by a rapidity-dependent factor resulting from the staple-shaped Wilson lines, for fixed longitudinal momentum, transverse separation, and rapidity. At the resolution of the ILM, all of the rho meson TMDs are symmetric in parton x for fixed transverse momentum, and Gaussian-like in the transverse momentum for fixed parton x. The latter is a direct consequence of the profiling of the quark zero modes in the ILM. The evolved TMDs at higher rapidity using the Collins-Soper kernel, and higher resolution using the renormalization group (RG), show substantial skewness towards low parton x.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flows of identified hadrons in the equal-velocity quark combination model at RHIC energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ an equal-velocity quark combination model to study anisotropic flows $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons at mid-rapidity in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC energies. Under the equal-velocity combination mechanism of constituent quarks at hadronization, we build analytical formulas of anisotropic flows of hadrons in terms of those of quarks just before hadronization. We systematically analyze the contribution of higher order flows of quarks, and show how simple formulas of $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons with the desired precision can be obtained by neglecting the small contribution of higher order flows of quarks. We systematically test these simple formulas of hadronic flows by the experimental data of $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons $\phi$, $\Lambda$, $\Xi^{-}$, $\Omega^{-}$, $\bar{\Lambda}$, $\bar{\Xi}^{+}$, $\bar{\Omega}^{+}$, $p$ and $\bar{p}$ in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 19.6, 54.4 and 200 GeV, and we find that the equal-velocity quark combination model can well describe the measured $v_{2}$, $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ of identified hadrons in Au+Au collisions at those collision energies. We further study the obtained anisotropic flows of quarks and find two scaling properties\textcolor{red}{{} }which can be qualitatively understood by the hydrodynamic evolution of thermal quark medium produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.11518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the power spectrum and the bispectrum of BOSS galaxy-clustering data using the prediction from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure at one-loop order for $\textit{both}$ the power spectrum $\textit{and}$ the bispectrum. With $\Lambda$CDM parameters fixed to Planck preferred values, we set limits on three templates of non-Gaussianities predicted by many inflationary models: the equilateral, the orthogonal, and the local shapes. After validating our analysis against simulations, we find $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil.}= 207 \pm 292\, , f_{\rm NL}^{\rm orth.}= -68 \pm 73\, , f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc.}= 52 \pm 34$, at $68\%$ confidence level. These bispectrum-based constraints from Large-Scale Structure, not far from the ones of WMAP, suggest promising results from upcoming surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we evaluate whether the gravitational wave background recently observed by a number of different pulsar timing arrays could be due to merging primordial supermassive black hole binaries. We find that for homogeneously distributed primordial black holes this possibility is inconsistent with strong cosmological and astrophysical constraints on their total abundance. If the distribution exhibits some clustering, however, the merger rate will, in general, be enhanced, opening the window for a consistent interpretation of the pulsar timing array data in terms of merging primordial black holes, if $\mu$-distortion constraints associated with the formation mechanism can be evaded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the gauge-gravity duality, we investigate the fermionic spectroscopy in the D(-1)-D3 brane system. The background geometry of this system described by IIB supergravity includes a black (deconfined) and bubble (confined) D3-brane which corresponds respectively to a deconfined and a confined gauge theory in holography. The charge of the D(-1) brane as the D-instanton gives the gluon condensate in this model. To simplify the holographic setup, we first reduce briefly the ten-dimensional supergravity background produced by D(-1)-D3-branes to an equivalently five-dimensional background. Then the fermionic spectrum in the confined case is obtained by decomposing the fermion with dimensional reduction. In addition, by using the standard method for computing the Green function in the AdS/CFT dictionary, we derive the equations for the fermionic correlation functions and solve them numerically with the infalling boundary condition. Our numerical results in the deconfined case illustrate that the fermionic correlation function as spectral function includes two branches of the dispersion curves whose behavior is very close to the results obtained from the method of hard thermal loop. And the effective mass generated by the medium effect of fermion splits into two values due to the spin-dependent interactions induced by instantons. In the confined case, the holographic correlation function indicates several separated dispersion curves which illustrates consistently the onset mass in the fermionic spectrum we obtained. Therefore, this work in holography demonstrates the instantonic configuration is very influential to the fermion in QCD.</description>

      <title>Systematic integral evaluation for spin-resummed binary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computation of spin-resummed observables in post-Minkowskian dynamics typically involve evaluation of Feynman integrals deformed by an exponential factor, where the exponent is a linear sum of the momenta being integrated. Such integrals can be viewed as tensor integral generating functions, which provide alternative approaches to tensor reduction of Feynman integrals. We develop a systematic method to evaluate tensor integral generating functions using conventional multiloop integration techniques. The spin-resummed aligned-spin eikonal at second post-Minkowskian order is considered as a phenomenologically relevant example where evaluation of tensor integral generating functions is necessary.</description>

      <title>Physical-mass calculation of $\rho(770)$ and $K^*(892)$ resonance parameters via $\pi \pi$ and $K \pi$ scattering amplitudes from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present our study of the $\rho(770)$ and $K^*(892)$ resonances from lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) employing domain-wall fermions at physical quark masses. We determine the finite-volume energy spectrum in various momentum frames and obtain phase-shift parameterizations via the L\"uscher formalism, and as a final step the complex resonance poles of the $\pi \pi$ and $K \pi$ elastic scattering amplitudes via an analytical continuation of the models. By sampling a large number of representative sets of underlying energy-level fits, we also assign a systematic uncertainty to our final results. This is a significant extension to data-driven analysis methods that have been used in lattice QCD to date, due to the two-step nature of the formalism. Our final pole positions, $M+i\Gamma/2$, with all statistical and systematic errors exposed, are $M_{K^{*}} = 893(2)(8)(54)(2)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_{K^{*}} = 51(2)(11)(3)(0)~\mathrm{MeV}$ for the $K^*(892)$ resonance and $M_{\rho} = 796(5)(15)(48)(2)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_{\rho} = 192(10)(28)(12)(0)~\mathrm{MeV}$ for the $\rho(770)$ resonance. The four differently grouped sources of uncertainties are, in the order of occurrence: statistical, data-driven systematic, an estimation of systematic effects beyond our computation (dominated by the fact that we employ a single lattice spacing), and the error from the scale-setting uncertainty on our ensemble.</description>

      <title>Light and strange vector resonances from lattice QCD at physical quark masses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first ab initio calculation at physical quark masses of scattering amplitudes describing the lightest pseudoscalar mesons interacting via the strong force in the vector channel. Using lattice quantum chromodynamics, we postdict the defining parameters for two short-lived resonances, the $\rho(770)$ and $K^*(892)$, which manifest as complex energy poles in $\pi \pi$ and $K \pi$ scattering amplitudes, respectively. The calculation proceeds by first computing the finite-volume energy spectrum of the two-hadron systems, and then determining the amplitudes from the energies using the L\"uscher formalism. The error budget includes a data-driven systematic error, obtained by scanning possible fit ranges and fit models to extract the spectrum from Euclidean correlators, as well as the scattering amplitudes from the latter. The final results, obtained by analytically continuing multiple parameterizations into the complex energy plane, are $M_\rho = 796(5)(50)~\mathrm{MeV}$, $\Gamma_\rho = 192(10)(31)~\mathrm{MeV}$, $M_{K^*} = 893(2)(54)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_{K^*} = 51(2)(11)~\mathrm{MeV}$, where the subscript indicates the resonance and $M$ and $\Gamma$ stand for the mass and width, respectively, and where the first bracket indicates the statistical and the second bracket the systematic uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Nuclear transparency and shadowing of the two-step process in the $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05129v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate nuclear transparency induced by pion electroproduction on nuclei $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ with our interest in the role of the two-step process in the Glauber multiple scattering theory. Based on the framework in which the quantum diffusion model is incorporated into the Glauber theory, the experimental data in the range of photon virtuality $0.5&lt; Q^2&lt; 10$ GeV$^2/c^2$ are analyzed, including the recent JLab data at the 6 GeV electron beam together with the proposal for the 12 GeV upgrade. Application of the quantum diffusion model during the formation length of the quark/antiquark $(q\bar{q})$ structure of a pion reproduces the increase in the nuclear transparency up to high $Q^2$, showing evidence for color transparency. In contrast, through the coherent length of the $\gamma^*$ fluctuation into $\rho^0$, the two-step process with the $\rho N$ scattering cross section chosen to be $\sigma_{\rho N}=\sigma_{\pi N}$ contributes to a reduction of the nuclear transparency in the whole range of $Q^2$. Combined with the one-step process (direct photon coupling) usually adopted in the original formulation of the Glauber theory, this reaction mechanism provides another source of the $Q^2$ dependence of the transparency at low virtualities through the shadowing in the initial state interaction. By the further absorption due to the shadowing, a better agreement is obtained with the pion transparency measured in the $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ reaction for $^{12}$C, $^{27}$Al, $^{63}$Cu, and $^{197}$Au nuclei.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino nucleus elastic scattering ({\nu}Ael) with reactor neutrinos is an interaction under full quantum-mechanical coherence. It has not yet been experimentally observed. We present new results on the studies of {\nu}Ael cross section with an electro-cooled p-type point-contact germanium detector at the Kuo-Sheng Reactor Neutrino laboratory. A total of (242)357 kg-days of Reactor ON(OFF) data at a detector threshold of 200 eVee in electron equivalent unit are analyzed. The Lindhard model parametrized by a single variable k which characterizes the quenching function was used. Limits at 90% confidence level are derived on the ratio {\rho} relative to standard model (SM) cross section of {\rho}&lt;4.7 at the predicted value of k=0.162, while k&lt;0.285 at the SM-value of {\rho}=1. Prospects on future positive measurements are discussed.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau Feynman integrals in gravity: $\varepsilon$-factorized form for apparent singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a recently identified four-loop Feynman integral that contains a three-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometry and contributes to the scattering of black holes in classical gravity at fifth post-Minkowskian and second self-force order (5PM 2SF) in the conservative sector. In contrast to previously studied Calabi-Yau Feynman integrals, the higher-order differential equation that this integral satisfies in dimensional regularization exhibits $\varepsilon$-dependent apparent singularities. We introduce an appropriate ansatz which allows us to bring such cases into an $\varepsilon$-factorized form. As a proof of principle, we apply it to the integral at hand.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory on curved manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses how particle production from the vacuum can be explained by local analysis when the field theory is defined by differential geometry on curved manifolds. We have performed the local analysis in a mathematically rigorous way, respecting the Markov property. The exact WKB is used as a tool for extracting non-perturbative effect from the local system. After a serious application of the differential geometry and the exact WKB to particle production, we show that entanglement does not appear in the Unruh effect as far as the standard formulation by the differential geometry is valid. This result should not be attributed to a consistency problem between the ``entanglement state'' and the ``standard field theory by differential geometry'', but to the fact that the conventional calculation of the Unruh effect is done by extrapolation which is not consistent with the differential geometry. The situation is similar to that of the Dirac monopole, but topology is not relevant and the basis for building field theories in differential geometry is strongly involved.</description>

      <title>Greybody factors, reflectionless scattering modes, and echoes of ultracompact horizonless objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recently discovered connection between the greybody factors of black holes and the ringdown signal, we investigate the greybody factors of ultracompact horizonless objects, also elucidating their connection to echoes. The greybody factor of ultracompact objects features both low-frequency resonances and high-frequency, quasi-reflectionless scattering modes, which become purely reflectionless in the presence of symmetric cavity potentials, as it might be the case for a wormhole. We show that it is these high-frequency (quasi-)reflectionless scattering modes, rather than low-frequency resonances, to be directly responsible for the echoes in the time-domain response of ultracompact objects or of black holes surrounded by matter fields localized at large distances.</description>

      <title>Inequivalence between the Euclidean and Lorentzian versions of the type IIB matrix model from Lefschetz thimble calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is conjectured to describe superstring theory nonperturbatively in terms of ten $N \times N$ bosonic traceless Hermitian matrices $A_\mu$ ($\mu=0, \ldots , 9$), whose eigenvalues correspond to $(9+1)$-dimensional space-time. Quite often, this model has been investigated in its Euclidean version, which is well defined although the ${\rm SO}(9,1)$ Lorentz symmetry of the original model is replaced by the ${\rm SO}(10)$ rotational symmetry. Recently, a well-defined model respecting the Lorentz symmetry has been proposed by gauge-fixing the Lorentz symmetry nonperturbatively using the Faddeev-Popov procedure. Here we investigate the two models by Monte Carlo simulations, overcoming the severe sign problem by the Lefschetz thimble method, in the case of matrix size $N=2$ omitting fermionic contributions. We add a quadratic term $\gamma \, \mathrm{tr} (A_\mu A^\mu)$ in the action and calculate the expectation values of rotationally symmetric (or Lorentz symmetric) observables as a function of the coefficient $\gamma$. Our results exhibit striking differences between the two models around $\gamma=0$ and in the $\gamma&gt;0$ region, associated with the appearance of different saddle points, clearly demonstrating their inequivalence against naive expectations from quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find empirically that the value of Feynman integrals follows a $\log$-$\Gamma$ distribution at large loop order. This result opens up a new avenue towards the large-order behavior in perturbative quantum field theory. Our study of the primitive contribution to the scalar $\phi^4$ beta function in four dimensions up to 17 loops provides accompanying evidence. Guided by instanton considerations, we discuss the extrapolation of this contribution to all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Improved Lattice QCD $B_c\to J/\psi$ Vector, Axial-Vector, and Tensor Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an update of HPQCD's lattice QCD determination of the $B_c\to J/\psi$ vector and axial-vector form factors, and provide new results for the tensor form factors. We use the Highly Improved Staggered Quark action for all valence quarks, together with the second generation MILC $n_f=2+1+1$ HISQ gluon field configurations. This calculation includes two additional ensembles, one with physically light up and down quarks and $a\approx 0.06 \mathrm{fm}$ and one with $a\approx 0.03\mathrm{fm}$ on which we are able to reach the physical bottom quark mass. Our calculation uses nonperturbatively renormalised current operators and covers the full kinematical range of the decay. We use our recent results for the heavy-charm susceptibilities, as a function of $u=m_c/m_h$, in order to employ the full dispersive parameterisation for $B_c\to J/\psi$ in our physical-continuum extrapolation. We give updated SM predictions $R(J/\psi)=0.2597(27)$, $A_{\lambda_\tau}=0.5093(42)$, $F_L^{J/\psi}=0.4421(55)$, and $\mathcal{A}_\mathrm{FB}=-0.0567(61)$, reducing uncertainties by $29\%$, $45\%$, $40\%$ and $50\%$ respectively. Since our lattice form factors cover the full kinematic range we can use them to test extrapolations using data in a truncated range, at low-recoil. We investigate different physical continuum parameterisation schemes, with lattice results in the first $1/3$ of the kinematic range near $q^2_\mathrm{max}$. We find that unexpectedly large systematic uncertainties near $q^2=0$ can emerge when extrapolating synthetic data in the high-$q^2$ region if higher order kinematical terms are omitted from the physical continuum extrapolation. This suggests a potentially underestimated systematic uncerainty entering extrapolations of synthetic lattice QCD data for the related $B\to D^*\ell\bar{\nu}$ decay from the high-$q^2$ region into the low-$q^2$ region.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields -- ``unparticles" -- during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Cosmic Birefringence and DESI Data with Evolving Axion in $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations have revealed growing tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including indications of isotropic cosmic birefringence and deviations from $w = -1$ in the dark energy equation of state, as suggested by DESI and supernova measurements. In this paper, we point out that such deviations can arise even from a subdominant energy density component. We then propose a unified framework based on a dynamical axion field that simultaneously accounts for both anomalies, providing a simple and natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In our scenario, the axion field with $2H_0\lesssim m\lesssim 6H_0$, where $H_0$ is the current Hubble constant, induces a nonzero rotation of the CMB polarization plane and modifies the present-day dark energy equation of state. This framework accommodates recent observational data with natural parameter choices, even for a string axion with a decay constant of order $10^{17}\,$GeV.</description>

      <title>Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry</title>

Abstract: Long-baseline atom interferometry is a promising technique for probing various aspects of fundamental physics, astrophysics and cosmology, including searches for ultralight dark matter (ULDM) and for gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range around 1~Hz that is not covered by present and planned detectors using laser interferometry. The MAGIS detector is under construction at Fermilab, as is the MIGA detector in France. The PX46 access shaft to the LHC has been identified as a very suitable site for an atom interferometer of height $\sim 100$m, sites at the Boulby mine in the UK and the Canfranc Laboratory are also under investigation, and possible sites for km-class detectors have been suggested. The Terrestrial Very-Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration proposes a coordinated programme of interferometers of increasing baselines.</description>

      <title>Worldvolume fermion as baryon with homogeneous instantons in holographic $\mathrm{QCD}_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate holographically the effective theory of the worldvolume fermion on the flavor branes in the D3/D7 model with homogeneously smeared D(-1)-branes. As a top-down approach in gauge-gravity duality, the D(-1)-branes are instantons and violate the CP symmetry in the dual theory. The background geometry of this model contains black brane (deconfined geometry) and bubble D3-brane solutions (confined geometry), all with a non-zero Romand-Romand zero form as axion. The dual theories to the backgrounds are respectively the Super Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature and three-dimensional confining Yang-Mills theory, all with a Chern-Simons term induced by instantons. In the confined geometry, we introduce a baryon vertex as a D5-brane wrapped on $S^{5}$, then identify the fermionic flux on the D7-brane as a baryonic operator. Afterwards, we study the spectrum and the holographic correlation function of the flavored fermion on the D7-branes. Remarkably, the fermionic spectrum is in agreement with the dispersion curves obtained from the confined correlation function, and the mass ratio of the lowest baryon and meson in our model is close to the associated experimental data. Moreover, the effective interaction terms of the holographic baryon and meson are derived and all the coupling constants take order of $N_{c}^{1/2}$ agreeing with the evaluation from the large N field theory. In the deconfined geometry, the holographic correlation function is also evaluated numerically while the fermion on D7-brane is identified to plasmino instead of baryon. The dispersion curves from the deconfined correlation function basically covers the results from the hard thermal loop approximation and may imply the instanton-induced interaction with spin. Overall, this work constructs a holographic theory about baryonic fermion and mesonic boson with instantons or CP violation.</description>

      <title>The Short-Baseline Near Detector at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SBND is a 112 ton liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC) neutrino detector located 110 meters from the Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) target at Fermilab. Its main goals include searches for eV-scale sterile neutrinos as part of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program, other searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, and precision studies of neutrino-argon interactions. In addition, SBND is providing a platform for LArTPC neutrino detector technology development and is an excellent training ground for the international group of scientists and engineers working towards the upcoming flagship Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). SBND began operation in July 2024, and started collecting stable neutrino beam data in December 2024 with an unprecedented rate of ~7,000 neutrino events per day. During its currently approved operation plans (2024-2027), SBND is expected to accumulate nearly 10 million neutrino interactions. The near detector dataset will be instrumental in testing the sterile neutrino hypothesis with unprecedented sensitivity in SBN and in probing signals of beyond the Standard Model physics. It will also be used to significantly advance our understanding of the physics of neutrino-argon interactions ahead of DUNE. After the planned accelerator restart at Fermilab (2029+), opportunities are being explored to operate SBND in antineutrino mode in order to address the scarcity of antineutrino-argon scattering data, or in a dedicated beam-dump mode to significantly enhance sensitivity to searches for new physics. SBND is an international effort, with approximately 40% of institutions from Europe, contributing to detector construction, commissioning, software development, and data analysis. Continued European involvement and leadership are essential during SBND's operations and analysis phase for both the success of SBND, SBN and its role leading up to DUNE.</description>
