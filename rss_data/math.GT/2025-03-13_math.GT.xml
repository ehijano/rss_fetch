      <title>Slice disks modulo local knotting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second author and Powell asked whether there exist knots bounding infinitely many slice disks that remain pairwise nonisotopic, even after local knotting. We answer this question in the affirmative, giving many classes of examples distinguished by the kernels of the inclusion-induced maps on the fundamental group. Along the way, we give a classification of fibered, homotopy-ribbon disks bounded by generalized square knots up to isotopy modulo local knotting, extending work of the first author and Zupan. We conclude with a discussion of how invertible concordances and satellite operations can produce new examples of knots bounding many inequivalent slice disks. In particular, we give examples of fibered, hyperbolic knots bounding infinitely many fibered, ribbon disks that are pairwise nonisotopic modulo local knotting. The closed monodromies of these knots are pseudo-Anosov mapping classes that have infinitely many distinct handlebody extensions, a curiosity that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Plane curve singularities via divides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generic relative immersions of compact one-manifolds in the closed unit disk, i.e. divides, provide a powerful combinatorial framework, and allow a topological construction of fibered classical links, for which the monodromy diffeomorphism is explicitly given as a product of Dehn twists. Complex isolated plane curve singularities provide a classical fibered link, the Milnor fibration, with its Milnor monodromy, monodromy group, and vanishing cycles. This surveys puts together much of the work done on divides and their role in the topology of isolated plane curve singularities.</description>

      <title>Flux homomorphism and bilinear form constructed from Shelukhin's quasimorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a closed connected symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$, we construct an alternating $\mathbb{R}$-bilinear form $\mathfrak{b}=\mathfrak{b}_{\mu_{\mathrm{Sh}}}$ on the real first cohomology of $M$ from Shelukhin's quasimorphism $\mu_{\mathrm{Sh}}$. Here $\mu_{\mathrm{Sh}}$ is defined on the universal cover of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on $(M,\omega)$. This bilinear form is invariant under the symplectic mapping class group action, and $\mathfrak{b}$ yields a constraint on the fluxes of commuting two elements in the group of symplectomorphisms on $(M,\omega)$. These results might be seen as an analog of Rousseau's result for an open connected symplectic manifold, where he recovered the symplectic pairing from the Calabi homomorphism. Furthermore, $\mathfrak{b}$ controls the extendability of Shelukhin's quasimorphisms, as well as the triviality of a characteristic class of Reznikov. To construct $\mathfrak{b}$, we build general machinery for a group $G$ of producing a real-valued $\mathbb{Z}$-bilinear form $\mathfrak{b}_{\mu}$ from a $G$-invariant quasimorphism $\mu$ on the commutator subgroup of $G$.</description>

      <title>Exotic families of embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a number of topologically trivial but smoothly non-trivial families of embeddings of 3-manifolds in 4-manifolds. These include embeddings of homology spheres in $S^4$ that are not isotopic but have diffeomorphic complements, and families (parameterized by high-dimensional spheres) of embeddings of any 3-manifold that embeds in a blown-up K3 surface. In each case, the families are constructed so as to be topologically trivial in an appropriate sense. We also illustrate a general technique for converting a non-trivial family of embeddings into a non-trivial family of submanifolds.</description>

      <title>Curvature, macroscopic dimensions, and symmetric products of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the curvature and symplectic asphericity properties of symmetric products of surfaces. We show that these spaces can be used to answer nuanced questions arising in the study of closed Riemannian manifolds with positive scalar curvature. For example, we prove that symmetric products of surfaces sharply distinguish between two distinct notions of macroscopic dimension introduced by Gromov and the second-named author. As a natural generalization of this circle of ideas, we address the Gromov--Lawson and Gromov conjectures in the Kaehler projective setting and draw new connections between the theories of the minimal model, positivity in algebraic geometry, and macroscopic dimensions.</description>

      <title>Topological normal generation of big mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A topological group $G$ is \emph{topologically normally generated} if there exists $g \in G$ such that the normal closure of $g$ is dense in $G$. Let $S$ be a tame, infinite type surface whose mapping class group $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ is generated by a coarsely bounded set (CB generated). We prove that if the end space of $S$ is countable, then $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ is topologically normally generated if and only if $S$ is uniquely self-similar. Moreover, when the end space of $S$ is uncountable, we provide a sufficient condition under which $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ is topologically normally generated. As a consequence, we construct uncountably many examples of surfaces that are not telescoping yet have topologically normally generated mapping class groups. Additionally, we establish the semidirect product structure of $\mathrm{FMap}(S)$, the subgroup of $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ that pointwisely fixes all maximal ends that each is isolated in the set of maximal ends of $S$. This result leads to a proof that the minimum number of topological normal generators of $\mathrm{Map}(S)$ is bounded both above and below by constants that depend only on the topology of $S$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the upper bound grows quadratically with respect to this constant.</description>
