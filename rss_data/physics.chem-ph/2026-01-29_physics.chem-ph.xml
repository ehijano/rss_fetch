      <title>Advances in ion-doping of Ca-Mg silicate bioceramics for bone tissue engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of bioceramics as hard tissue substitutes is extensive due to their excellent biocompatible and osteogenic behaviors. Among various bioceramics, Ca-Mg silicates are unique from the viewpoints of osteoinductive and mechanical properties, as well as their outstanding osteoconductive and angiogenic behaviors owing to the release of Si, Ca and Mg. Despite these distinct advantages, different compositions of these bioceramics still require mechanical and biological enhancements for further applications. For this purpose, doping with some ions like F-, Sr2+, Cu2+, Eu2+, Ba+, Ce3+ and some alkali cations has been proved to be a valued approach. This review attempts to bring together areas for the performance improvement of the further researched Ca-Mg silicates (i.e., diopside, akermanite, bredigite and monticellite) and the alteration of these compositions via ion-doping. It is concluded that a correct choice of dopants incorporated at the optimal concentration makes these silicates ideal bone substitutes competing or even superior to calcium phosphates (apatites) and bioglasses which are known as the most prominent bioceramics.</description>

      <title>Aufbau Suppressed Coupled Cluster Theory for Doubly Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the Aufbau suppressed coupled cluster formalism into the realm of doubly excited states by deriving, implementing, and testing a wave function initialization strategy that allows the zeroth order wave function to match the largest configurations of a doubly excited reference wave function while maintaining the method's overall asymptotic cost parity with ground state singles and doubles theory. Starting from state-averaged complete active space self consistent field references, this approach produces highly accurate excitation energies for states dominated by a single doubly excited determinant, as well as states in glyoxal and similar molecules where two different doubly excited determinants have large weights. Typical excitation energy errors in both types of states are on the order of 0.15 eV, with the largest observed error being 0.3 eV. These errors stand in stark contrast to equation of motion methods, where typical errors are 4 to 6 eV at the singles and doubles level and 0.4 to 0.8 eV at the full triples level. It remains an open question how best to generalize the Aufbau suppression approach into an even wider variety of multi-configurational double excitations, but these early results offer strong motivation for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Quantum statistics from classical simulations via generative Gibbs sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of nuclear quantum effects is essential for molecular modeling but expensive using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). We present GG-PI, a ring-polymer-based framework that combines generative modeling of the single-bead conditional density with Gibbs sampling to recover quantum statistics from classical simulation data. GG-PI uses inexpensive standard classical simulations or existing data for training and allows transfer across temperatures without retraining. On standard test systems, GG-PI significantly reduces wall clock time compared to PIMD. Our approach extends easily to a wide range of problems with similar Markov structure.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Detection and Characterization of Cyanooxomethylium, NCCO$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyanooxomethylium, NCCO$^+$, a fundamental linear acylium ion, has been observed spectroscopically for the first time using action spectroscopy in ion trap apparatuses. A first low-resolution infrared spectrum was obtained between 500 to 1400 cm$^{-1}$ and 2000 to 2500 cm$^{-1}$ using the Free Electron Laser for Infrared eXperiments (FELIX) and the FELion apparatus, employing infrared predissociation of the weakly bound NCCO$^+$-Ne complex. Subsequently, high-resolution studies of the bare ion were performed with the COLtrap II setup, one targeted at the CN-stretching mode $\nu_2$ around 2150 cm$^{-1}$ using leak-out spectroscopy and one at the pure rotational spectrum employing a leak-out infrared/millimeter-wave double resonance approach covering transition frequencies as high as 246 GHz. Spectroscopic detection and analysis were guided by high-level quantum-chemical calculations performed at the CCSD(T) level of theory. The collected data permit accurate frequency predictions to support future astronomical searches with sensitive radio telescopes.</description>

      <title>SITH: A Quantum-Chemical Framework for Predicting Bond Destabilization in Stretched Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical forces can selectively destabilize chemical bonds of molecular systems, particularly in biological and synthetic polymers. While experimental and theoretical methods have advanced our understanding of mechanochemical processes, predicting where energy concentrates within a molecule remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce SITH (Splitting Intramolecular Tension due to stretcHing), a novel method that decomposes the total electronic energy change of a stretched molecule into contributions from individual degrees of freedom -- such as bond lengths, angles, and dihedrals -- using numerical integration of the work-energy theorem. Unlike previous approaches that rely on harmonic approximations, SITH provides high accuracy and robustness to study the distribution of energies of stretched molecules up to a first bond cleavage. Although SITH uses 3N-6 degrees of freedom for the energy decomposition, we show that it can work even for ring structures like prolines. We apply SITH to a dataset of tripeptides and demonstrate that glycine and proline exhibit significantly different energy distributions in their Ca-C backbone bonds under tension: glycine stores more energy, making it more prone to rupture, while proline has the opposite behaviour. These findings reveal intrinsic differences in mechanochemical susceptibility across amino acids, offering more accurate predictions of bond rupture in proteins, and similarly in other (bio)polymers. SITH thus provides a powerful, interpretable tool for understanding energy distribution at the quantum level, with possible implications in mechanochemistry and force field validation.</description>

      <title>HEOM-Based Numerical Framework for Quantum Simulation of Two-Dimensional Vibrational Spectra in Molecular Liquids (HEOM-2DVS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-mode anharmonic Brownian motion model offers a universal framework for simulating molecular vibrations in condensed phases. When vibrational energy surpasses thermal excitation, quantum effects become significant, necessitating a rigorous treatment of system-bath entanglement. The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) provide a powerful methodology for simulating such open quantum systems. In this context, two-dimensional vibrational spectroscopy (2DVS) constitutes a powerful probe for elucidating the complex dynamics of molecular processes, both experimentally and theoretically. This work introduces a computational implementation, HEOM-2DVS, for treating non-Markovian open quantum dynamics that encompass energy relaxation, dephasing, thermal excitation, and related processes arising from non-perturbative and nonlinear interactions between selected vibrational modes and their thermal environments. To validate the theoretical framework, we computed</description>

      <title>First-Principle-Inspired Reduced-Order Models of Chemical-Kinetics in $\text{H}_2\left(\text{X}^1\Sigma_g^+\right)$+$\text{H}\left({}^2\text{S}\right)$ System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, two-different reduced-order models are proposed for $\text{H}_2\left(\text{X}^1\Sigma_g^+\right)$+$\text{H}\left({}^2\text{S}\right)$ system by leveraging first-principle quasi-classical trajectory simulations and in-depth master equation analyses. The most recent available ab-initio potential energy surface is adopted to construct a new set of rovibrational state-to-state kinetic database valid over a wide range of temperatures. Firstly, a modified two-temperature model is proposed by incorporating the master equation-informed model parameters, enabling the advanced treatment of the internal energy coupling and the nonequilibrium dissociation predictions. Secondly, a hybrid coarse-graining model is proposed by combining a graph-based approach optimized globally for a wide range of temperatures with a centrifugal-barrier-based coarse-graining method. The proposed reduced-order models offer significantly improved accuracy in predicting the nonequilibrium energy transfer and dissociation dynamics compared to the existing coarse-graining and 2T models in previous studies. In addition, aerothermal heating prediction relevant to Uranus planetary entry reveals 16.5% of convective heat flux discrepancy compared to the present modified 2T approach with the existing 2T, demonstrating the importance of accurate modeling of the chemical-kinetics in the $\text{H}_2\left(\text{X}^1\Sigma_g^+\right)$+$\text{H}\left({}^2\text{S}\right)$ system.</description>

      <title>Controlled drug delivery from chitosan-coated heparin-loaded nanopores anodically grown on nitinol shape-memory alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitinol (NiTi shape-memory alloy) is an interesting candidate in various medical applications like dental, orthopedic, and cardiovascular devices, owing to its unique mechanical behaviors and proper biocompatibility. The aim of this work is the local controlled delivery of a cardiovascular drug, heparin, loaded onto nitinol treated by electrochemical anodizing and chitosan coating. In this regard, the structure, wettability, drug release kinetics, and cell cytocompatibility of the specimens were analyzed in vitro. The two-stage anodizing process successfully developed a regular nanoporous layer of Ni-Ti-O on nitinol, which considerably decreased the sessile water contact angle and induced hydrophilicity. The application of the chitosan coatings controlled the release of heparin mainly by a diffusional mechanism, where the drug release mechanisms were evaluated by the Higuchi, first-order, zero-order, and Korsmeyer-Pepass models. Human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs) viability assay also showed the non-cytotoxicity of the samples, so that the best performance was found for the chitosan-coated samples. It is concluded that the designed drug delivery systems are promising for cardiovascular, particularly stent applications.</description>

      <title>Global Plane Waves From Local Gaussians: Periodic Charge Densities in a Blink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ELECTRAFI, a fast, end-to-end differentiable model for predicting periodic charge densities in crystalline materials. ELECTRAFI constructs anisotropic Gaussians in real space and exploits their closed-form Fourier transforms to analytically evaluate plane-wave coefficients via the Poisson summation formula. This formulation delegates non-local and periodic behavior to analytic transforms, enabling reconstruction of the full periodic charge density with a single inverse FFT. By avoiding explicit real-space grid probing, periodic image summation, and spherical harmonic expansions, ELECTRAFI matches or exceeds state-of-the-art accuracy across periodic benchmarks while being up to $633 \times$ faster than the strongest competing method, reconstructing crystal charge densities in a fraction of a second. When used to initialize DFT calculations, ELECTRAFI reduces total DFT compute cost by up to ~20%, whereas slower charge density models negate savings due to high inference times. Our results show that accuracy and inference cost jointly determine end-to-end DFT speedups, and motivate our focus on efficiency.</description>

      <title>Roles of pigment arrangement in light-harvesting phycobiliproteins revealed by recombinant techniques combined with two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed methods for protein synthesis and performed two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D-ES) to examine the influence of pigment arrangement on the photoexcitation dynamics of light-harvesting proteins in phycobilisome. We synthesized allophycocyanin (APC), C-phycocyanin (CPC), and mutant CPC lacking the \b{eta}153 phycocyanobilin (PCB) pigment by an Escherichia coli expression system. The number of pigments in the mutant CPC is identical to that in the wild-type APC, and their spatial arrangements are similar. The absorption and fluorescence spectra of the mutant CPC closely resemble those of the wild-type CPC rather than the wild-type APC, indicating that pigment spatial arrangement is not a primary factor in determining the excited-state energy structure. The 2D-ES measurements show that the wild-type CPC retains broad positive signals at 1 ps, signifying incomplete relaxation and persistence of excited vibronic states, unlike APC, which vibrationally relaxes to the bottom of the potential energy surface within the same timeframe. The mutant CPC behaves similarly to the wild-type CPC in the 2D-ES, reinforcing that the pigment number or arrangement is not a dominant factor. Instead, the local pigment-protein interaction governs the electronic structure and relaxation dynamics. Structural analysis reveals that the bent structure of PCB in CPC's {\alpha}-chain versus the planar structure of PCB in APC. The bent PCB in CPC reduces the degree of {\pi}-conjugation, and exhibits excited-state properties distinct from those of the planar structure of PCB in APC. This finding highlights a critical role of the electronic structure governed by the local interaction in ultrafast energy relaxation.</description>

      <title>Photoelectron Circular Dichroism of Aqueous-Phase Alanine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amino acids and other small chiral molecules play key roles in biochemistry. However, in order to understand how these molecules behave in vivo, it is necessary to study them under aqueous-phase conditions. Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) has emerged as an extremely sensitive probe of chiral molecules, but its suitability for application to aqueous solutions had not yet been proven. Here, we report on our PECD measurements of aqueous-phase alanine, the simplest chiral amino acid. We demonstrate that the PECD response of alanine in water is different for each of alanine's carbon atoms, and is sensitive to molecular structure changes (protonation states) related to the solution pH. For C~1s photoionization of alanine's carboxylic acid group, we report PECD of comparable magnitude to that observed in valence-band photoelectron spectroscopy of gas-phase alanine. We identify key differences between PECD experiments from liquids and gases, discuss how PECD may provide information regarding solution-specific phenomena -- for example the nature and chirality of the solvation shell surrounding chiral molecules in water -- and highlight liquid-phase PECD as a powerful new tool for the study of aqueous-phase chiral molecules of biological relevance.</description>

      <title>Optimized tandem catalyst patterning for CO$_2$ reduction flow reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tandem catalysis involves two or more catalysts arranged in proximity within a single reaction vessel, with the aim of synergistically aligning the catalysts' reaction pathways to maximize overall system performance. This study presents a proof of concept showing the integration of continuum transport modeling with design optimization in a simplified two-dimensional flow reactor setup for electrochemical CO$_2$ reduction. Ag catalysts provide the CO$_2$ $\rightarrow$ CO reaction capability, and Cu catalysts provide the CO $\rightarrow$ high-value products reaction capability. Given a set of input parameters, the optimization algorithm uses adjoint methods to modify the Ag/Cu surface patterning in order to maximize the current density toward high-value products, such as ethylene. The optimized designs yield significant performance enhancement especially at more negative applied voltages (i.e., stronger surface reactions) and for larger numbers of patterning sections. For an applied voltage of $-1.7$ V vs. SHE, the $12$-section optimized design increases the current density towards ethylene by up to $65$% compared to the unoptimized $2$-section design. For the optimized cases, observed differences in the production and consumption of CO (the key intermediate species) and minimized zones of low CO reactant surface concentration on Cu sections explain the improved reactor performance.</description>

Conventionally, the kinetics of these processes are described by the law of mass action. However, there are various cases where these equations are insufficient. A fundamental challenge lies in accurately accounting for the microscopic correlations that inevitably arise in bimolecular reactions. While approaches to describe microscopic correlations in many specific cases exist, no general theory for multistage reactions has been established. In this article, we apply the quantum field theory approach to derive kinetic equations for general multistage reactive systems termed CMET (complete modified encounter theory). CMET can be formulated as a set of coupled partial differential equations that can be easily integrated numerically, thereby serving as a versatile tool for investigating reaction-diffusion processes. Across multiple case studies, we demonstrated that CMET reproduces the kinetics predicted by many other theories within their respective scopes of applicability.</description>
