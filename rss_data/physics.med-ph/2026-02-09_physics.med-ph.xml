      <title>Age-Dependent Causal Effects of Mandibular Dose on Osteoradionecrosis Risk After Head and Neck Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishing causal relationships from statistical correlations remains a fundamental challenge in clinical research, limiting the translation of observational findings into interventional treatment guidelines. Here we apply causal machine learning to establish causal effects of radiation dose parameters on mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) in 931 head and neck cancer patients treated with volumetric-modulated arc therapy. Using generalized random forests, we demonstrate that all examined dosimetric factors exhibit significant positive causal effects on ORN development (average treatment effects: 0.092-0.141). Integration with explainable machine learning reveals substantial treatment effect heterogeneity, with patients aged 50-60 years showing the strongest causal dose-response relationships (conditional average treatment effects up to 0.229), while patients over 70 years demonstrate minimal effects. These results suggest that age-stratified treatment optimization and personalized treatment planning for the dosimetric factors could reduce ORN risk. Our findings demonstrate that causal inference methods can transform clinical retrospective radiotherapy data into personalized treatment recommendations, providing a methodological framework applicable to toxicity prediction across oncology and other clinical domains where treatment decisions depend on complex dose-response relationships.</description>

      <title>A tissue-informed deep learning-based method for positron range correction in preclinical 68Ga PET imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positron range (PR) limits spatial resolution and quantitative accuracy in PET imaging, particularly for high-energy positron-emitting radionuclides like 68Ga. We propose a deep learning method using 3D residual encoder-decoder convolutional neural networks (3D RED-CNNs), incorporating tissue-dependent anatomical information through a u-map-dependent loss function. Models were trained with realistic simulations and, using initial PET and CT data, generated positron range corrected images. We validated the models in simulations and real acquisitions. Three 3D RED-CNN architectures, Single-channel, Two-channel, and DualEncoder, were trained on simulated PET datasets and evaluated on synthetic and real PET acquisitions from 68Ga-FH and 68Ga-PSMA-617 mouse studies. Performance was compared to a standard Richardson-Lucy-based positron range correction (RL-PRC) method using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), structural similarity index (SSIM), contrast recovery (CR), and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). CNN-based methods achieved up to 19 percent SSIM improvement and 13 percent MAE reduction compared to RL-PRC. The Two-Channel model achieved the highest CR and CNR, recovering lung activity with 97 percent agreement to ground truth versus 77 percent for RL-PRC. Noise levels remained stable for CNN models (approximately 5.9 percent), while RL-PRC increased noise by 5.8 percent. In preclinical acquisitions, the Two-Channel model achieved the highest CNR across tissues while maintaining the lowest noise level (9.6 percent). Although no ground truth was available for real data, tumor delineation and spillover artifacts improved with the Two-Channel model. These findings highlight the potential of CNN-based PRC to enhance quantitative PET imaging, particularly for 68Ga. Future work will improve model generalization through domain adaptation and hybrid training strategies.</description>

      <title>Collagen and myocyte interplay in cardiac volume overload: a multi-constituent growth and remodeling framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hearts subjected to volume overload (VO) are prone to detrimental anatomical and functional changes in response to elevated mechanical loading, ultimately leading to heart failure. Experimental findings now emphasize that organ-scale changes following VO cannot be explained by myocyte growth alone, as traditionally proposed in the literature. Collagen degradation, in particular, has been associated with VO and assumed to play a central role in both its acute and chronic stages. This hypothesis, however, remains to be substantiated by comprehensive mechanistic evidence, and each constituent contribution to myocardial growth and remodeling (G&amp;R) processes is yet to be quantified. In this work, we present a multi-constituent G&amp;R framework that integrates a mixture-based constitutive model within the kinematic growth formulation. This framework enables us to mechanistically assess the relative contributions of collagen and myocyte changes to alterations in tissue properties, ventricular dimensions, and growth phenotype. Our numerical results confirm that collagen remodeling affects the passive mechanical response of the myocardium, whereas myocytes predominantly influence the extent and phenotype of VO-induced growth. Importantly, collagen degradation exacerbates myocyte hypertrophy, revealing a synergistic interplay that accelerates the left ventricular eccentric growth and thereby promotes systolic dysfunction. This work constitutes an important step towards an integrated characterization of the early compensatory stages of VO-induced cardiac G&amp;R.</description>
