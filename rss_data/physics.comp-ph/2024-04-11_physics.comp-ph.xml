      <title>Overcoming the chemical complexity bottleneck in on-the-fly machine learned molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for on-the-fly machine learned force field molecular dynamics simulations based on the multipole featurization scheme that overcomes the bottleneck with the number of chemical elements. Considering bulk systems with up to 6 elements, we demonstrate that the number of density functional theory calls remains approximately independent of the number of chemical elements, in contrast to the increase in the smooth overlap of atomic positions scheme.</description>

      <title>Generating Reservoir State Descriptions with Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to reservoir computer measurements through the use of a simple quantum system and random matrices to motivate how atomic-scale devices might be used for real-world computing applications. In our approach, random matrices are used to construct reservoir measurements, introducing a simple, scalable means for producing state descriptions. In our studies, systems as simple as a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain are used to perform several tasks, including time series prediction and data interpolation. The performance of the measurement technique as well as their current limitations are discussed in detail alongside an exploration of the diversity of measurements yielded by the random matrices. Additionally, we explore the role of the parameters of the spin chain, adjusting coupling strength and the measurement dimension, yielding insights into how these learning machines might be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights the use of random matrices as measurements of simple quantum systems for natural learning devices and outlines a path forward for improving their performance and experimental realisation.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of the quantum inverse algorithm on small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the accuracy of the quantum inverse (Q-Inv) algorithm in which the multiplication of $\hat{H}^{-k}$ to the reference wavefunction is replaced by the Fourier Transformed multiplication of $e^{-i\lambda \hat{H}}$, as a function of the integration parameters ($\lambda$) and the power $k$ for various systems, including H$_2$, LiH, BeH$_2$ and the notorious H$_4$ molecule at single point. We further consider the possibility of employing the Gaussian-quadrature rule as an alternate integration method and compared it to the results employing trapezoidal integration. The Q-Inv algorithm is compared to the inverse iteration method using the $\hat{H}^{-1}$ inverse (I-Iter) and the exact inverse by lower-upper decomposition (LU). Energy values are evaluated as the expectation values of the Hamiltonian. Results suggest that the Q-Inv method provides lower energy results than the I-Iter method up to a certain $k$, after which the energy increases due to errors in the numerical integration that are dependent of the integration interval. A combined Gaussian-quadrature and trapezoidal integration method proved to be more effective at reaching convergence while decreasing the number of operations. For systems like H$_4$, in which the Q-Inv can not reach the expected error threshold, we propose a combination of Q-Inv and I-Iter methods to further decrease the error with $k$ at lower computational cost. Finally, we summarize the recommended procedure when treating unknown systems.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Secondary and Backscattered Electron Energy Spectra and Yields Analysis: from Theory to Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, experimental microscopy and spectroscopy have made significant progress in the study of the morphological, optical, electronic and transport properties of materials. These developments include higher spatial resolution, shorter acquisition times, more efficient monochromators and electron analysers, improved contrast imaging and advancements in sample preparation techniques. These advances have driven the need for more accurate theoretical descriptions and predictions of material properties. Computer simulations based on first principles and Monte Carlo methods have emerged as a rapidly growing field for modeling the interaction of charged particles, such as electron, proton and ion beams, with various systems, such as slabs, nanostructures and crystals. This report delves into the theoretical and computational approaches to modeling the physico-chemical mechanisms that occur when charged beams interact with a medium. These mechanisms encompass single and collective electronic excitation, ionization of the target atoms and the generation of a secondary electron cascade that deposits energy into the irradiated material. We show that the combined application of ab initio methods, which are able to model the dynamics of interacting many-fermion systems, and Monte Carlo methods, which capture statistical fluctuations in energy loss mechanisms by random sampling, proves to be an optimal strategy for the accurate description of charge transport in solids. This joint quantitative approach enables the theoretical interpretation of excitation, loss and secondary electron spectra, the analysis of the chemical composition and dielectric properties of solids and contributes to our understanding of irradiation-induced damage in materials, including those of biological significance.</description>

      <title>PINNACLE: PINN Adaptive ColLocation and Experimental points selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which incorporate PDEs as soft constraints, train with a composite loss function that contains multiple training point types: different types of collocation points chosen during training to enforce each PDE and initial/boundary conditions, and experimental points which are usually costly to obtain via experiments or simulations. Training PINNs using this loss function is challenging as it typically requires selecting large numbers of points of different types, each with different training dynamics. Unlike past works that focused on the selection of either collocation or experimental points, this work introduces PINN Adaptive ColLocation and Experimental points selection (PINNACLE), the first algorithm that jointly optimizes the selection of all training point types, while automatically adjusting the proportion of collocation point types as training progresses. PINNACLE uses information on the interaction among training point types, which had not been considered before, based on an analysis of PINN training dynamics via the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). We theoretically show that the criterion used by PINNACLE is related to the PINN generalization error, and empirically demonstrate that PINNACLE is able to outperform existing point selection methods for forward, inverse, and transfer learning problems.</description>

      <title>The photoinduced hidden metallic phase of monoclinic VO2 driven by local nucleation via a self-amplification process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) in vanadium dioxide (VO2) has garnered extensive attention for its potential applications in ultrafast switches, neuronal network architectures, and storage technologies. However, a significant controversy persists regarding the formation of the IMT, specifically concerning whether a complete structural phase transition from monoclinic (M1) to rutile (R) phase is necessary. Here we employ the real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) to track the dynamic evolution of atomic and electronic structures in photoexcited VO2, revealing the emergence of a long-lived monoclinic metal phase (MM) under low electronic excitation. The emergence of the metal phase in the monoclinic structure originates from the dissociation of the local V-V dimer, driven by the self-trapped and self-amplified dynamics of photoexcited holes, rather than by a pure electron-electron correction. On the other hand, the M1-to-R phase transition does appear at higher electronic excitation. Our findings validate the existence of MM phase and provide a comprehensive picture of the IMT in photoexcited VO2.</description>

      <title>Optical and Transport Properties of Plasma Mixtures from Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the charged particle transport properties of warm dense matter / hot dense plasma mixtures is a challenge for analytical models. High accuracy ab initio methods are more computationally expensive, but can provide critical insight by explicitly simulating mixtures. In this work, we investigate the transport properties and optical response of warm dense carbon-hydrogen mixtures at varying concentrations under either conserved electronic pressure or mass density at a constant temperature. We compare options for mixing the calculated pure species properties to estimate the results of the mixtures. We find that a combination of the Drude model with the Matthiessen's rule works well for DC electron transport and low frequency optical response. This breaks down at higher frequencies, where a volumetric mix of pure-species AC conductivities works better.</description>

      <title>Accurate neural quantum states for interacting lattice bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, neural quantum states have emerged as a powerful variational approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy when representing the ground-state wave function of a great variety of quantum many-body systems, including spin lattices, interacting fermions or continuous-variable systems. However, accurate neural representations of the ground state of interacting bosons on a lattice have remained elusive. We introduce a neural backflow Jastrow Ansatz, in which occupation factors are dressed with translationally equivariant many-body features generated by a deep neural network. We show that this neural quantum state is able to faithfully represent the ground state of the 2D Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian across all values of the interaction strength. We scale our simulations to lattices of dimension up to $20{\times}20$ while achieving the best variational energies reported for this model. This enables us to investigate the scaling of the entanglement entropy across the superfluid-to-Mott quantum phase transition, a quantity hard to extract with non-variational approaches.</description>

Abstract: Fluid flow simulations marshal our most powerful computational resources. In many cases, even this is not enough. Quantum computers provide an opportunity to speedup traditional algorithms for flow simulations. We show that lattice-based mesoscale numerical methods can be executed as efficient quantum algorithms due to their statistical features. This approach revises a quantum algorithm for lattice gas automata to eliminate classical computations and measurements at every time step. For this, the algorithm approximates the qubit relative phases and subtracts them at the end of each time step, removing a need for repeated measurements and state preparation (encoding). Phases are evaluated using the iterative phase estimation algorithm and subtracted using single-qubit rotation phase gates. This method delays the need for measurement to the end of the computation, so the algorithm is better suited for modern quantum hardware. We also demonstrate how the checker-board deficiency that the D1Q2 scheme presents can be resolved using the D1Q3 scheme. The algorithm is validated by simulating two canonical PDEs: the diffusion and Burgers' equations on different quantum simulators. We find good agreement between quantum simulations and classical solutions of the presented algorithm.</description>

Abstract: We employ constrained path Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) in the pursuit of studying physical nuclear systems using a lattice formalism. Since AFQMC has been widely used in the study of condensed-matter systems such as the Hubbard model, we benchmark our method against published results for both one- and two-dimensional Hubbard model calculations. We then turn our attention to cold-atomic and nuclear systems. We use an onsite contact interaction that can be tuned in order to reproduce the known scattering length and effective range of a given interaction. Developing this machinery allows us to extend our calculations to study nuclear systems within a lattice formalism. We perform initial calculations for a range of nuclear systems from two- to few-body neutron systems.</description>

      <title>Robust and conservative dynamical low-rank methods for the Vlasov equation via a novel macro-micro decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation has gained interest in recent years as a viable solution to the curse of dimensionality in the numerical solution of kinetic equations including the Boltzmann and Vlasov equations. These methods include the projector-splitting and Basis-update &amp; Galerkin (BUG) DLR integrators, and have shown promise at greatly improving the computational efficiency of kinetic solutions. However, this often comes at the cost of conservation of charge, current and energy. In this work we show how a novel macro-micro decomposition may be used to separate the distribution function into two components, one of which carries the conserved quantities, and the other of which is orthogonal to them. We apply DLR approximation to the latter, and thereby achieve a clean and extensible approach to a conservative DLR scheme which retains the computational advantages of the base scheme. Moreover, our approach requires no change to the mechanics of the DLR approximation, so it is compatible with both the BUG family of integrators and the projector-splitting integrator which we use here. We describe a first-order integrator which can exactly conserve charge and either current or energy, as well as an integrator which exactly conserves charge and energy and exhibits second-order accuracy on our test problems. To highlight the flexibility of the proposed macro-micro decomposition, we implement a pair of velocity space discretizations, and verify the claimed accuracy and conservation properties on a suite of plasma benchmark problems.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport in thermoelectric materials of SnSSe and SnS$_2$: a non-equilibrium Monte-Carlo simulation of Boltzmann transport equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, thermal transport and energy conversation in two thermoelectrically efficient candidates of Janus SnSSe and SnS$_2$ are investigated within the non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulation of phonon Boltzmann equation. The phonon analysis is performed to determine the contributed phonons in heat transport. The results present that the dominant participating phonons are longitudinal acoustic ones while the least belongs to the transverse acoustic (TA) mode. Both materials reached the very high maximum temperature in response to the implied wasted heat. This is attributed to the low presence of the critical TA phonons. Also, the temperature profile achieved during the heating and cooling of the materials is studied. It is obtained that the heat propagation through the SnS$_2$ is, at first, swifter, which results in a temperature gradient through the whole material which is less than that of the SnSSe. As the time passes, the heat transfer that is directly related to the material thermal conductivity, slows down. So, the behavior of the SnS$_2$ and SnSSe, in case of the heat propagation status, becomes similar. More, the behavior of the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT), the efficiency ($\eta$), and the generated voltage have been figured out. It is stated that the higher zT and $\eta$ do not guarantee a larger generated Seebeck voltage. This is true, while the generated Seebeck voltage is related to the temperature difference between the heated and the cold junction. Accordingly, how far the temperature of matter rises in response to the implied wasted heat is related to the obtained voltage. Mainly, it is presented that the maximum temperature that a material achieves, alongside the temperature gradient and material property Seebeck coefficient, are essential in introducing thermoelectrically efficient materials with reasonable thermal to electrical energy conversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For finite element approximations of transport phenomena, it is often necessary to apply a form of limiting to ensure that the discrete solution remains well-behaved and satisfies physical constraints. However, these limiting procedures are typically performed at discrete nodal locations, which is not sufficient to ensure the robustness of the scheme when the solution must be evaluated at arbitrary locations (e.g., for adaptive mesh refinement, remapping in arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian solvers, overset meshes, etc.). In this work, a novel limiting approach for discontinuous Galerkin methods is presented which ensures that the solution is continuously bounds-preserving (i.e., across the entire solution polynomial) for any arbitrary choice of basis, approximation order, and mesh element type. Through a modified formulation for the constraint functionals, the proposed approach requires only the solution of a single spatial scalar minimization problem per element for which a highly efficient numerical optimization procedure is presented. The efficacy of this approach is shown in numerical experiments by enforcing continuous constraints in high-order unstructured discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of hyperbolic conservation laws, ranging from scalar transport with maximum principle preserving constraints to compressible gas dynamics with positivity-preserving constraints.</description>

      <title>A two-circuit approach to reducing quantum resources for the quantum lattice Boltzmann method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations often entail a large computational burden on classical computers. At present, these simulations can require up to trillions of grid points and millions of time steps. To reduce costs, novel architectures like quantum computers may be intrinsically more efficient at the appropriate computation. Current quantum algorithms for solving CFD problems use a single quantum circuit and, in some cases, lattice-based methods. We introduce the a novel multiple circuits algorithm that makes use of a quantum lattice Boltzmann method (QLBM). The two-circuit algorithm we form solves the Navier-Stokes equations with a marked reduction in CNOT gates compared to existing QLBM circuits. The problem is cast as a stream function--vorticity formulation of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations and verified and tested on a 2D lid-driven cavity flow. We show that using separate circuits for the stream function and vorticity lead to a marked CNOT reduction: 35% in total CNOT count and 16% in combined gate depth. This strategy has the additional benefit of the circuits being able to run concurrently, further halving the seen gate depth. This work is intended as a step towards practical quantum circuits for solving differential equation-based problems of scientific interest.</description>

      <title>AdvNF: Reducing Mode Collapse in Conditional Normalising Flows using Adversarial Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models complement Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo methods for efficiently sampling from high-dimensional distributions. Among these methods, explicit generators, such as Normalising Flows (NFs), in combination with the Metropolis Hastings algorithm have been extensively applied to get unbiased samples from target distributions. We systematically study central problems in conditional NFs, such as high variance, mode collapse and data efficiency. We propose adversarial training for NFs to ameliorate these problems. Experiments are conducted with low-dimensional synthetic datasets and XY spin models in two spatial dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Despite the widespread applications of machine learning force field (MLFF) on solids and small molecules, there is a notable gap in applying MLFF to complex liquid electrolytes. In this work, we introduce BAMBOO (ByteDance AI Molecular Simulation Booster), a novel framework for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, with a demonstration of its capabilities in the context of liquid electrolytes for lithium batteries. We design a physics-inspired graph equivariant transformer architecture as the backbone of BAMBOO to learn from quantum mechanical simulations. Additionally, we pioneer an ensemble knowledge distillation approach and apply it on MLFFs to improve the stability of MD simulations. Finally, we propose the density alignment algorithm to align BAMBOO with experimental measurements. BAMBOO demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting key electrolyte properties such as density, viscosity, and ionic conductivity across various solvents and salt combinations. Our current model, trained on more than 15 chemical species, achieves the average density error of 0.01 g/cm$^3$ on various compositions compared with experimental data. Moreover, our model demonstrates transferability to molecules not included in the quantum mechanical dataset. We envision this work as paving the way to a "universal MLFF" capable of simulating properties of common organic liquids.</description>
