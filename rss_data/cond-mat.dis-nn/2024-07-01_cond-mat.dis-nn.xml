      <title>Monte Carlo simulations of glass-forming liquids beyond Metropolis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are widely employed to measure the physical properties of glass-forming liquids in thermal equilibrium. Combined with local Monte Carlo moves, the Metropolis algorithm can also be used to simulate the relaxation dynamics, thus offering an efficient alternative to molecular dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations are however more versatile, because carefully designed Monte Carlo algorithms can more efficiently sample the rugged free energy landscape characteristic of glassy systems. After a brief overview of Monte Carlo studies of glass-formers, we define and implement a series of Monte Carlo algorithms in a three-dimensional model of polydisperse hard spheres. We show that the standard local Metropolis algorithm is the slowest, and that implementing collective moves or breaking detailed balance enhances the efficiency of the Monte Carlo sampling. We use time correlation functions to provide a microscopic interpretation of these observations. Seventy years after its invention, the Monte Carlo method remains the most efficient and versatile tool to compute low-temperatures properties in supercooled liquids.</description>

      <title>Entanglement signatures of a percolating quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement measures have emerged as one of the versatile probes to diagnose quantum phases and their transitions. Universal features in them expand their applicability to a range of systems, including those with quenched disorder. In this work, we show that when the underlying lattice has percolation disorder, free fermions at a finite density show interesting entanglement properties due to massively degenerate ground states. We define and calculate appropriate entanglement measures such as typical, annealed, and quenched entanglement entropy in both one and two dimensions, showing they can capture both geometrical aspects and electronic correlations of the percolated quantum system. In particular, while typical and annealed entanglement show volume law character directly dependent on the number of zero modes in the system, quenched entanglement is generally area law albeit showing characteristic signatures of the classical percolation transition. Our work presents an exotic interplay between the geometrical properties of a lattice and quantum entanglement in a many-body quantum system.</description>

      <title>On the Atypical Solutions of the Symmetric Binary Perceptron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the random binary symmetric perceptron problem, focusing on the behavior of rare high-margin solutions. While most solutions are isolated, we demonstrate that these rare solutions are part of clusters of extensive entropy, heuristically corresponding to non-trivial fixed points of an approximate message-passing algorithm. We enumerate these clusters via a local entropy, defined as a Franz-Parisi potential, which we rigorously evaluate using the first and second moment methods in the limit of a small constraint density $\alpha$ (corresponding to vanishing margin $\kappa$) under a certain assumption on the concentration of the entropy. This examination unveils several intriguing phenomena: i) We demonstrate that these clusters have an entropic barrier in the sense that the entropy as a function of the distance from the reference high-margin solution is non-monotone when $\kappa \le 1.429 \sqrt{-\alpha/\log{\alpha}}$, while it is monotone otherwise, and that they have an energetic barrier in the sense that there are no solutions at an intermediate distance from the reference solution when $\kappa \le 1.239 \sqrt{-\alpha/ \log{\alpha}}$. The critical scaling of the margin $\kappa$ in $\sqrt{-\alpha/\log\alpha}$ corresponds to the one obtained from the earlier work of Gamarnik et al. (2022) for the overlap-gap property, a phenomenon known to present a barrier to certain efficient algorithms. ii) We establish using the replica method that the complexity (the logarithm of the number of clusters of such solutions) versus entropy (the logarithm of the number of solutions in the clusters) curves are partly non-concave and correspond to very large values of the Parisi parameter, with the equilibrium being reached when the Parisi parameter diverges.</description>

      <title>Markovian to non-Markovian phase transition in the operator dynamics of a mobile impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random unitary circuit model of an impurity moving through a chaotic medium. The exchange of information between the medium and impurity is controlled by varying the velocity of the impurity, $v_d$, relative to the speed of information propagation within the medium, $v_B$. Above supersonic velocities, $v_d&gt; v_B$, information cannot flow back to the impurity after it has moved into the medium, and the resulting dynamics are Markovian. Below supersonic velocities, $v_d&lt; v_B$, the dynamics of the impurity and medium are non-Markovian, and information is able to flow back onto the impurity. We show the two regimes are separated by a continuous phase transition with exponents directly related to the diffusive spreading of operators in the medium. This is demonstrated by monitoring an out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) in a scenario where the impurity is substituted at an intermediate time. During the Markovian phase, information from the medium cannot transfer onto the replaced impurity, manifesting in no significant operator development. Conversely, in the non-Markovian phase, we observe that operators acquire support on the newly introduced impurity. We also characterize the dynamics using the coherent information and provide two decoders which can efficiently probe the transition between Markovian and non-Markovian information flow. Our work demonstrates that Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics can be separated by a phase transition, and we propose an efficient protocol for observing this transition.</description>

      <title>Tessellated phase diagram and extended criticality in driven quasicrystals and quantum Hall matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known mapping between 1D quasiperiodic systems and 2D integer quantum Hall matter can also be applied in the presence of driving. Here we explore the effect of time-varying electric fields on the transport properties and phase diagram of Harper-Hofstadter materials. We consider light of arbitrary polarization illuminating a 2D electron gas at high magnetic field; this system maps to a 1D quasicrystal subjected to simultaneous phasonic and dipolar driving. We show that this generalized driving generates a tessellated phase diagram featuring a nested duality-protected pattern of metal-insulator transitions. Circularly or elliptically polarized light can create an extended critical phase, opening up a new route to achieving wavefunction multifractality without fine-tuning to a critical point, as well as induce Floquet topological insulators. We describe in detail a path to experimental realization of these phenomena using lattice-trapped ultracold atoms.</description>
