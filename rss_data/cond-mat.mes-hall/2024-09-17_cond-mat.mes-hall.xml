      <title>Cavity-Enhanced Optical Manipulation of Antiferromagnetic Magnon-Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical manipulation of magnon states in antiferromagnets (AFMs) holds significant potential for advancing AFM-based computing devices. In particular, two-magnon Raman scattering processes are known to generate entangled magnon-pairs with opposite momenta. We propose to harness the dynamical backaction of a driven optical cavity coupled to these processes, to obtain steady states of squeezed magnon-pairs, represented by squeezed Perelomov coherent states. The system's dynamics can be controlled by the strength and detuning of the optical drive and by the cavity losses. In the limit of a fast (or lossy) cavity, we obtain an effective equation of motion in the Perelomov representation, in terms of a light-induced frequency shift and a collective induced dissipation which sign can be controlled by the detuning of the drive. In the red-detuned regime, a critical power threshold defines a region where magnon-pair operators exhibit squeezing, a resource for quantum information, marked by distinct attractor points. Beyond this threshold, the system evolves to limit cycles of magnon-pairs. In contrast, for resonant and blue detuning regimes, the magnon-pair dynamics exhibit limit cycles and chaotic phases, respectively, for low and high pump powers. Observing strongly squeezed states, auto-oscillating limit cycles, and chaos in this platform presents promising opportunities for future quantum information processing, communication developments, and materials studies.</description>

      <title>Direct Visualization of Relativistic Quantum Scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum scars refer to eigenstates with enhanced probability density along unstable classical periodic orbits (POs). First predicted 40 years ago, scars are special eigenstates that counterintuitively defy ergodicity in quantum systems whose classical counterpart is chaotic. Despite the importance and long history of scars, their direct visualization in quantum systems remains an open field. Here we demonstrate that, by using an in-situ graphene quantum dot (GQD) creation and wavefunction mapping technique, quantum scars are imaged for Dirac electrons with nanometer spatial resolution and meV energy resolution with a scanning tunneling microscope. Specifically, we find enhanced probability densities in the form of lemniscate-shaped and streak-like patterns within our stadium-shaped GQDs. Both features show equal energy interval recurrence, consistent with predictions for relativistic quantum scars. By combining classical and quantum simulations, we demonstrate that the observed patterns correspond to two unstable POs that exist in our stadium-shaped GQD, thus proving they are both quantum scars. In addition to providing the first unequivocal visual evidence of quantum scarring, our work offers insight into the quantum-classical correspondence in relativistic chaotic quantum systems and paves the way to experimental investigation of other recently proposed scarring species such as perturbation-induced scars, chiral scars, and antiscarring.</description>

      <title>Ideal flat and resolved SU(3) Landau levels in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau levels (LLs) are of great importance for understanding the quantum Hall effect and associated many-body physics. Recently, their three-dimensional (3D) counterparts, i.e., dispersionless 3D LLs with well-defined quantum numbers, have attracted significant attention but have not yet been reported. Here we theoretically propose and experimentally observe 3D LLs with a sharply quantized spectrum in a diamond acoustic lattice, where the eigenstates are characterized by SU(3) quantum numbers. The engineered inhomogeneous hopping strengths not only introduce pseudomagnetic fields that quantize the nodal lines into LLs but also provide three bosonic degrees of freedom, embedding a generic SU(3) symmetry into the LLs. Using a phased array of acoustic sources, we selectively excite distinct eigenstates within the degenerate LL multiplets and visualize their 3D eigenmodes. Importantly, our approach enables the precise reconstruction of SU(3) quantum numbers directly from eigenmode correlations. Our results establish SU(3) LLs as a tractable model in artificial platforms, and pave the way for synthesizing LLs with zero dispersion and countable quantum numbers in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Coherent Dipolar Coupling between Magnetoelastic Waves and Nitrogen Vacancy Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate coherent Rabi oscillations of Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers by magnetoelastic waves. The coupling is consistent with dipolar stray field drive from spin-wave modes in a ferromagnetic film, and displays a significant improvement in Radio Frequency power efficiency relative to other methods of microwave excitation. Further, it demonstrates coherent coupling with NV centers over mm-scale distances from the microwave excitation source. By utilizing a piezoelectric-magnetostrictive heterostucture, where magnetoelastic waves can be launched by an applied voltage, a pure voltage driven coherent drive of the NV centers is achieved. This voltage driven, magnetoelastic excitation enables a new approach to couple with two level quantum states that is not reliant on long spin-wave coherence lengths.</description>

      <title>Pauli spin blockade at room temperature in S/Zn-codoped silicon tunnel field effect transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pauli spin blockade (PSB) has been used in fundamental studies on spins in quantum dots (QDs) and qubit readouts. The operating temperature of PSB is limited by that of QDs and remains below 10 K, limiting wide application development. Herein, we confirm that a single deep dopant in the channel of a field effect transistor functions as a room-temperature QD; consequently, transport through two different deep dopants exhibits PSB up to room temperature. The characteristic magnetoconductance provides a means to identify PSB and enables the PSB device to function as a magnetic sensor with a sensitivity of &lt;20 uT. Liftings of PSB by magnetic resonance are also observed at low temperatures. This unique system is expected to realize room-temperature quantum technologies based on silicon technology.</description>

      <title>Probing band topology in ABAB and ABBA stacked twisted double bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted graphene moire superlattice has been demonstrated as an exotic platform for investigating correlated states and nontrivial topology. Among the moire family, twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) is a tunable flat band system expected to show stacking-dependent topological properties. However, electron correlations and the band topology are usually intertwined in the flat band limit, rendering the unique topological property due to stacking still elusive. Focusing on a large-angle TDBG with weak electron correlations, here we probe the Landau level (LL) spectra in two differently stacked TDBG, i.e. ABBA- and ABAB-TDBG, to unveil their distinct topological properties. For ABBA-TDBG, we observe non-trivial topology at zero electric displacement filed, evident from both the emergence of Chern bands from half fillings and the closure of gap at CNP above a critical magnetic field. For ABAB-TDBG, by contrast, we find that the moire band is topologically trivial, supported by the absence of LLs from half fillings and the persistence of the gap at CNP above the critical magnetic fields. In addition, we also observe an evolution of the trivial-to-nontrivial topological transition at finite D fields, confirmed by the emerged Landau fans originating from quarter filling v = 1. Our result demonstrates, for the first time, the unique stacking-dependent topology in TDBG, offering a promising avenue for future investigations on topological states in correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral propagation of plasmons due to competing anisotropies in a twisted photonic heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate chiral propagation of plasmon polaritons and show it is more efficient and easier to control than the recently observed chiral shear phonon polaritons. We consider plasmon polaritons created in an anisotropic two-dimensional (2D) material, twisted with respect to an anisotropic substrate, to best exploit the competition between anisotropic electron-electron interactions and the anisotropic electronic structure of the host material. Gate voltage and twist angle are then used for precise control of the chiral plasmon polaritons, overcoming the existing restrictions with chiral phonon polaritons. These findings open up feasible opportunities for efficient and tunable plasmon-based nanophotonics and compact high-performance on-chip optical devices.</description>

      <title>A group-IV double heterostructure light emitting diode for room temperature gain in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of straightforward epitaxial integration of useful telecom lasers on silicon remains the major bottleneck for bringing optical interconnect technology down to the on-chip level. Crystalline silicon itself, an indirect semiconductor, is a poor light emitter. Here, we identify conceptionally simple Si/Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$/Si double heterostructures (DHS) with large Ge content ($x \gtrsim 0.4$) as auspicious gain material suitable for Si-based integrated optics. In particular, using self-consistent Poisson-current transport calculations, we show that Si diodes containing a 16 nm thick Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ layer of high crystalline quality, centered at the p-n junction, results in efficient carrier accumulation in the DHS and gain if the diode is driven in forward direction. Despite the high strain, we unambiguously demonstrate that such prior unattainable defect-free DHS can be fabricated using ultra-low temperature epitaxy at pristine growth pressures. Telecom light emission is persistent up to 360 K, and directly linked to a ~160 meV high conduction band barrier for minority electron injection. This epitaxy approach allows further increasing the Ge content in the DHS and creating dot-in-well heterostructures for which even higher gains are predicted. Thus, the surprisingly facile DHS presented here can be an essential step toward novel classes of group-IV optoelectronic devices for silicon photonics.</description>

      <title>Electron-beam-induced adatom-vacancy-complexes in mono- and bilayer phosphorene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phosphorene, a puckered two-dimensional allotrope of phosphorus, has sparked considerable interest in recent years due to its potential especially for optoelectronic applications with its layer-number-dependant direct band gap and strongly bound excitons. However, detailed experimental characterization of its intrinsic defects as well as its defect creation characteristics under electron irradiation are scarce. Here, we report on the creation and stability of a variety of defect configurations under 60 kV electron irradiation in mono- and bilayer phosphorene including the first experimental reports of stable adatom-vacancy-complexes. Displacement cross section measurements in bilayer phosphorene yield a value of 7.7 +- 1.4 barn with an estimated lifetime of adatom-vacancy-complexes of 19.9 +- 0.7 s, while some are stable for up to 68 s under continuous electron irradiation. Surprisingly, ab initio-based simulations indicate that the complexes should readily recombine, even in structures strained by up to 3 %. The presented results will help to improve the understanding of the wide variety of defects in phosphorene, their creation, and their stability, which may enable new pathways for defect engineered phosphorene devices.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic nonlinear Nernst and Seebeck effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nernst and Seebeck effects are crucial for thermoelectric energy harvesting. However, the linear anomalous Nernst effect requires magnetic materials with intrinsically broken time-reversal symmetry. In non-magnetic systems, the dominant transverse thermoelectric response is the nonlinear Nernst current. Here, we investigate nonlinear Nernst and Seebeck effects to reveal intrinsic scattering-free Seebeck and Nernst currents arising from band geometric effects in bipartite antiferromagnets (parity-time-reversal symmetric systems). We show that these contributions, independent of scattering time, originate from the Berry connection polarizability tensor which depends on the quantum metric. Using CuMnAs as a model system, we demonstrate the dominance of intrinsic nonlinear Seebeck and Nernst currents over other scattering-dependent contributions. Our findings deepen the fundamental understanding of nonlinear thermoelectric phenomena and provide the foundation for using them to develop more efficient, next-generation energy harvesting devices.</description>

      <title>Phonon Thermal Transport between Two in-Plane, Two-Dimensional Nanoribbons in the Extreme Near-Field Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phonon thermal conductance of sub-nanometric vacuum gaps between two in-plane nanoribbons of two-dimensional materials (graphene and silicene) is analyzed using the atomistic Green's function method and by employing the Tersoff and Lennard-Jones potentials for describing the interatomic interactions. It is found that the phonon conductance decays exponentially with the size of the gap. Three exponential regimes have been identified. In the regime where the Lennard-Jones (L-J) potential is driven by the repulsive interatomic forces, caused by the overlap of electronic orbits, there is a sharp exponential decay in conductance as the gap increases (exp(-10.0d) for graphene). When both the repulsive and attractive (van der Waals) interatomic forces contribute to the L-J potential, the decay rate of the conductance significantly reduces to exp(-2.0d) for graphene and exp(-2.5d) for silicene. In the regime where attractive van der Waals forces dominate the L-J potential, phonon conductance has the slowest exponential decay as exp(-1.3d) for both silicene and graphene. It is also found that the contribution from the optical phonons to the conductance is non-negligible only for very small gaps between graphene nanoribbons (d &lt; 1.6 \AA). The phonon conductance of the gap is shown to vary with the width of the nanoribbon very modestly, such that the thermal conductivity of the gap linearly increases with the nanoribbon widths. The results of this study are of significance for fundamental understanding of heat transfer in the extreme near-field regime and for predicting the effect of interfaces and defects on heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Observation of Interface Piezoelectricity in Superconducting Devices on Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of superconducting quantum processors is driven by the need to reduce errors and scale for fault-tolerant computation. Reducing physical qubit error rates requires further advances in the microscopic modeling and control of decoherence mechanisms in superconducting qubits. Piezoelectric interactions contribute to decoherence by mediating energy exchange between microwave photons and acoustic phonons. Centrosymmetric materials like silicon and sapphire do not display piezoelectricity and are the preferred substrates for superconducting qubits. However, the broken centrosymmetry at material interfaces may lead to piezoelectric losses in qubits. While this loss mechanism was predicted two decades ago, interface piezoelectricity has not been experimentally observed in superconducting devices. Here, we report the observation of interface piezoelectricity at an aluminum-silicon junction and show that it constitutes an important loss channel for superconducting devices. We fabricate aluminum interdigital surface acoustic wave transducers on silicon and demonstrate piezoelectric transduction from room temperature to millikelvin temperatures. We find an effective electromechanical coupling factor of $K^2\approx 2 \times 10^{-5}\%$ comparable to weakly piezoelectric substrates. We model the impact of the measured interface piezoelectric response on superconducting qubits and find that the piezoelectric surface loss channel limits qubit quality factors to $Q\sim10^4-10^8$ for designs with different surface participation ratios and electromechanical mode matching. These results identify electromechanical surface losses as a significant dissipation channel for superconducting qubits, and show the need for heterostructure and phononic engineering to minimize errors in next-generation superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Shot Noise near Quantum-Criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shot-noise measures the correlations of fluctuations of current for a voltage applied much larger than the temperature and reveals aspects of correlations in fermions beyond those revealed in the conductivity. Recent measurements of shot-noise in the quantum-critical region of the heavy-fermion compound YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ (YRS) have presented a conceptual challenge to old theory and those devised following the experiments. Since the measured resistivity and the specific heat in YRS follow the predictions of marginal Fermi liquid (MFL) theory, we use it to calculate noise using the method developed by Nagaev. We get fair agreement with the magnitude and temperature dependence in the experiments using parameters from resistivity measurements. To achieve this, we find it necessary that the collisions between fermions by exchanging the MFL fluctuations conserve energy but lose momentum through Umklapp scattering and that the fermions and their fluctuations are locally in mutual equilibrium. %and that the self-energy rides the local chemical potential. At low temperatures, impurity scattering determines the noise and at high temperatures the MFL scattering. We show that the noise for MFL scattering for high T alone is the same as the Johnson-Nyquist noise, which in this case is temperature independent. Therefore the Fano factor crosses over to $0$ at high temperatures independent of the voltage applied.</description>

Abstract: Time crystals, a unique non-equilibrium quantum phenomenon with promising applications in current quantum technologies, mark a significant advance in quantum mechanics. Although traditionally studied in atom-cavity and optical lattice systems, pursuing alternative nanoscale platforms for time crystals is crucial. Here we theoretically predict discrete time-crystals in a periodically driven molecular magnet array, modeled by a spin-S Heisenberg Hamiltonian with significant quadratic anisotropy, taken with realistic and experimentally relevant physical parameters. Surprisingly, we find that the time-crystal response frequency correlates with the energy levels of the individual magnets and is essentially independent of the exchange coupling. The latter is unexpectedly manifested through a pulse-like oscillation in the magnetization envelope, signaling a many-body response. These results show that molecular magnets can be a rich platform for studying time-crystalline behavior and possibly other out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal phase-change metaoptics for reconfigurable nonvolatile image processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of smart imaging and vision systems will require compact and tunable optical computing hardware to perform high-speed and low-power image processing. These requirements are driving the development of computing metasurfaces to realize efficient front-end analog optical pre-processors, especially for edge-detection capability. Yet, there is still a lack of reconfigurable or programmable schemes, which may drastically enhance the impact of these devices at the system level. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a reconfigurable flat optical image processor using low-loss phase-change nonlocal metasurfaces. The metasurface is configured to realize different transfer functions in spatial frequency space, when transitioning the phase-change material between its amorphous and crystalline phases. This enables edge detection and bright-field imaging modes on the same device. The metasurface is compatible with a large numerical aperture of ~0.5, making it suitable for high resolution coherent optical imaging microscopy. The concept of phase-change reconfigurable nonlocal metasurfaces may enable emerging applications of artificial intelligence-assisted imaging and vision devices with switchable multitasking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently introduced recurrence-relation ansatz applied to the Fermi-Hubbard model gives rise to a soluble model and here is used to calculate several thermodynamic observables. The constraint of unit density per site, density = 1, is applied and some of the results are compared to cases where the constraint is not imposed. The modified model exhibits a continuous phase transition (second order) reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall resistance and a ground state, first-order phase transition.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</description>

      <title>Quantum-limited optical lever measurement of a torsion oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical lever is a precision displacement sensor with broad applications. In principle, it can track the motion of a mechanical oscillator with added noise at the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL); however, demonstrating this performance requires an oscillator with an exceptionally high torque sensitivity, or, equivalently, zero-point angular displacement spectral density. Here, we describe optical lever measurements on Si$_3$N$_4$ nanoribbons possessing $Q&gt;3\times 10^7$ torsion modes with torque sensitivities of $10^{-20}\,\text{N m}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ and zero-point displacement spectral densities of $10^{-10}\,\text{rad}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. Compensating aberrations and leveraging immunity to classical intensity noise, we realize angular displacement measurements with imprecisions 20 dB below the SQL and demonstrate feedback cooling, using a position modulated laser beam as a torque actuator, from room temperature to $\sim5000$ phonons. Our study signals the potential for a new class of torsional quantum optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Competing topological phases in a non-Hermitian time-reversal symmetry-broken Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ) model, which serves as a cornerstone in the study of the quantum spin Hall insulators, showcases robust spin-filtered helical edge states in a nanoribbon geometry. In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, these (first-order) helical states gap out to be replaced by second-order corner states under suitable open-boundary conditions. Here, we show that the inclusion of a spin-dependent non-Hermitian balanced gain/loss potential induces a competition between these first and second-order topological phases. Surprisingly, the previously dormant first-order helical edge states in the nanoribbon resurface as the non-Hermitian effect intensifies, effectively neutralizing the role played by the magnetic field. By employing the projected spin spectra and the spin Chern number, we conclusively explain the resurgence of the first-order topological properties in the time-reversal symmetry-broken BHZ model in presence of non-Hermiticity. Finally, the biorthogonal spin-resolved Berry phase, exhibiting a non-trivial winding, definitively establishes the topological nature of these revived edge states, emphasizing the dominance of non-Hermiticity over the magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient machine learning based automated framework for the fast tuning of single-electron pump devices into current quantization regimes. It uses a sparse measurement approach based on an iterative active learning algorithm to take targeted measurements in the gate voltage parameter space. When compared to conventional parameter scans, our automated framework allows us to decrease the number of measurement points by about an order of magnitude. This corresponds to an eight-fold decrease in the time required to determine quantization errors, which are estimated via an exponential extrapolation of the first current plateau embedded into the algorithm. We show the robustness of the framework by characterizing 28 individual devices arranged in a GaAs/AlGaAs multiplexer array, which we use to identify a subset of devices suitable for parallel operation at communal gate voltages. The method opens up the possibility to efficiently scale the characterization of such multiplexed devices to a large number of pumps.</description>

      <title>Corner Charge Fluctuation as an Observable for Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, is a powerful approach to understanding quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit a universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that, for generic lattice systems of interacting particles, the corner charge fluctuation is directly related to quantum geometry. We first provide a practical scheme to isolate the corner contribution on lattices, and analytically prove that its angle-dependence in the small-angle limit measures exclusively the integrated quantum metric. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically, while numerical verification for various Chern insulator models further demonstrate the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, for free fermions, we unveil an intimate connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>Hall Coulomb drag induced by electron-electron skew scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the influence of spin-orbit interaction on electron-electron scattering in the Coulomb drag setup. We study a setup made of a time-reversal-symmetry-broken Weyl semimetal (WSM) layer and a normal metal layer. The interlayer drag force consists of two components. The first one is conventional and is parallel to the relative electronic boost velocity between the layers. This part of the drag tends to equilibrate the momentum distribution in the two layers, analogous to shear viscosity in hydrodynamics. In the WSM layer, the shift of the Fermi surface is not parallel to the electric field, due to skew scattering in the WSM. This induces a Hall current in the normal metal via the conventional component of the drag force. The second component of the drag force is perpendicular to the boost velocity in the Weyl semimetal and arises from interlayer e-e skew scattering, which results from two types of processes. The first process is an interference between electron-electron and electron-disorder scattering. The second process is due to the side jumps in electron-electron collisions in an external electric field. Both the parallel and perpendicular components of the drag are important for the anomalous Hall drag conductivity. On the other hand, for the Hall drag resistivity, the contribution from the parallel friction is partially cancelled in a broad temperature regime. This work provides insight into the microscopic mechanisms of Hall-like friction in electronic fluids.</description>

Abstract: Topological insulators are quantum materials involving Time-reversal protected surface states(TSS) making them appealing candidates for the design of next generation of highly efficient spintronic devices. The very recent observation of large transient spin-charge conversion (SCC) and subsequent powerful THz emission from Co|Bi_{1-x}Sb_x bilayers clearly demonstrates such potentiality and feasibility for the near future. Amongst the exotic properties appearing in and at the surface of such quantum materials, spin-momentum locking (SML) and Rashba-Edelstein effects remain as key ingredients to effectively convert the spin degree of freedom into a charge or a voltage signal. In this work, we extend our analyses to the quantification of orbital momentum-locking and related orbital charge conversion effects in Bi_{0.85}Sb_{0.15} via orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects. In that sense, we will provide some clear theoretical and numerical insights implemented by multi-orbital and multi-layered tight-binding methods (TB) to clarify our recent experimental results obtained by THz-TDS spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driving coherent lattice motion with THz pulses has emerged as a novel pathway for achieving dynamic stabilization of exotic phases that are inaccessible in equilibrium quantum materials. In this work, we present a previously unexplored mechanism for THz excitation of Raman-active phonons in semimetals. We show that intense THz pulses centered at 1 THz can excite the Raman-active $A_{1g}$ phonon mode at 2.9 THz in a bismuth film. We rule out the possibilities of the phonon being excited through conventional anharmonic coupling to other modes or via a THz sum frequency process. Instead, we demonstrate that the THz-driven tunnel ionization provides a plausible means of creating a displacive driving force to initiate the phonon oscillations. Our work highlights a new mechanism for exciting coherent phonons, offering potential for dynamic control over the electronic and structural properties of semimetals and narrow-band semiconductors on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structural and chemical properties of metal nanoparticles are often dictated by their interactions with molecular ligand shells. These interactions are highly material-specific and can vary significantly even among elements within the same group or materials with similar crystal structure. Precise characterization of ligand-metal interactions is crucial for the rational design of ligands and the functionalization of nanoparticles. In this study, we found that the ligation behavior with m-terphenyl isocyanide molecule differs significantly between Au and Ag nanoparticles, with distinct ligand extraction efficiencies and size dependencies. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy measurements revealed unique enhancement factors for two molecular vibrational modes between two metal surfaces, indicating different ligand binding geometries. Molecular-level characterization using scanning tunneling microscopy allowed us to directly visualize these variations between Ag and Au surfaces, which we assign as two distinct binding mechanisms. This molecular-scale visualization provides clear insights into the different ligand-metal interactions, as well as the chemical behavior and spectroscopic characteristics of isocyanide-functionalized nanoparticles.</description>

Abstract: We analyze a quantum heat engine described by the full Dicke model. The system exhibit quantum phase transitions under certain conditions. We consider the system performing a Stirling thermodynamic cycle. We obtain an enhancement of efficiency when during the cycle the coupling parameter cross a critical value. We analyze the effect of unbalance between rotating and counter-rotating terms in the model. The maximum efficiency is obtained when the contributions of the counter-rotating and rotating terms are equal. The relation between ground state degeneracy, related to the quantum phase transition, and maximum efficiency is investigated.</description>

Abstract: Chiral state transfer along closed loops in the vicinity of an exceptional point is one of the many counter-intuitive observations in non-Hermitian physics. The application of this property beyond proof-of-principle in quantum physics, is an open question. In this work, we demonstrate chiral state conversion between singlet and triplet Bell states through fully-quantum Liouvillian dynamics. Crucially, we demonstrate that this property can be used for the chiral production of Bell states from separable states with a high fidelity and for a large range of parameters. Additionally, we show that the removal of quantum jumps from the dynamics through postselection can result in near-perfect Bell states from initially separable states. Our work presents the first application of chiral state transfer in quantum information processing and demonstrates a novel way to control entangled states by means of dissipation engineering.</description>

      <title>Deformation Dynamics of Nanopores upon Water Imbibition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capillarity-driven transport in nanoporous solids is widespread in nature and crucial for modern liquid-infused engineering materials. During imbibition, curved menisci driven by high negative Laplace pressures exert an enormous contractile load on the porous matrix. Due to the challenge of simultaneously monitoring imbibition and deformation with high spatial resolution, the resulting coupling of solid elasticity to liquid capillarity has remained largely unexplored. Here, we study water imbibition in mesoporous silica using optical imaging, gravimetry, and high-resolution dilatometry. In contrast to an expected Laplace pressure-induced contraction, we find a square-root-of-time expansion and an additional abrupt length increase when the menisci reach the top surface. The final expansion is absent when we stop the imbibition front inside the porous medium in a dynamic imbibition-evaporation equilibrium, as is typical for transpiration-driven hydraulic transport in plants, especially in trees. These peculiar deformation behaviors are validated by single-nanopore molecular dynamics simulations and described by a continuum model that highlights the importance of expansive surface stresses at the pore walls (Bangham effect) and the buildup or release of contractile Laplace pressures as menisci collectively advance, arrest, or disappear. Our model suggests that these observations apply to any imbibition process in nanopores, regardless of the liquid/solid combination, and that the Laplace contribution upon imbibition is precisely half that of vapor sorption, due to the linear pressure drop associated with viscous flow. Thus, simple deformation measurements can be used to quantify surface stresses and Laplace pressures or transport in a wide variety of natural and artificial porous media.</description>

      <title>Super-dephasing in Collective Atom-Atom Interactions Mediated by Near-Field Electromagnetic Fluctuations</title>

Abstract: Pure dephasing and spontaneous emission are two non-unitary processes of atoms or spins interacting with fluctuating electromagnetic (EM) modes. The dissipative collective emission processes (e.g., superradiance) originate from interactions with EM modes in resonance with atoms and have received considerable attention. Meanwhile, the analogous non-dissipative collective dephasing phenomena mediated by EM environments remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce the nano-EM super-dephasing phenomenon arising in the photonic environments near materials. We show that collective dephasing in this nano-EM environment is enhanced by over 10 orders of magnitude compared to free space or cavities. This giant enhancement originates from long-range correlations in off-resonant, low-frequency evanescent EM fluctuations, which lead to collectively accelerated (super-) or suppressed (sub-) dephasing in many-body entangled states. We further unravel that nano-EM collective dephasing exhibits universal interaction ranges near materials with different anisotropy that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. This nano-EM interaction range, which is not present in free-space and cavities, leads to unique scaling laws of super-dephasing in GHZ states different from the conventional $N^2$ scaling of superradiance. Finally, we discuss how to experimentally isolate and control super-dephasing to open interesting frontiers for scalable quantum systems.</description>
