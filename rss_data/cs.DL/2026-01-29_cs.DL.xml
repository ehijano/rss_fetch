      <title>How Disciplinary Partnerships Shape Research Landscape in U.S. Library and Information Science Schools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides the first comprehensive empirical mapping of how organizational structures and research portfolios co-occur across U.S. Library and Information Science (LIS) schools. Analyzing 14,705 publications from 1,264 faculty members across 44 institutions (2013--2024), we employ computational methods including word embeddings and topic modeling to identify 16 distinct research themes organized into three foundational dimensions: Library and Knowledge Organization (LKO), Human-Centered Technology (HCT), and Computing Systems (CS). Our mixed-method analysis reveals significant differences in research composition across organizational types: Computer-affiliated schools cluster tightly in computationally-intensive research and differ significantly from all other school types, while independent Information schools demonstrate the greatest research diversity. Temporal analysis of LIS schools reveals complex evolutionary dynamics: 51.4% are moving toward HCT, 37.8% toward CS, and 37.8% toward LKO, with many schools simultaneously shifting along multiple dimensions. Contrary to narratives of computational dominance, HCT emerged as LIS's primary growth vector. These patterns challenge assumptions about field fragmentation, revealing structured diversification shaped by but not determined by organizational positioning. The study provides empirical foundations for institutional strategic planning, accreditation policy, and understanding LIS's evolving disciplinary identity amid computational transformation.</description>

      <title>An Automated Grey Literature Extraction Tool for Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grey literature is essential to software engineering research as it captures practices and decisions that rarely appear in academic venues. However, collecting and assessing it at scale remains difficult because of their heterogeneous sources, formats, and APIs that impede reproducible, large-scale synthesis. To address this issue, we present GLiSE, a prompt-driven tool that turns a research topic prompt into platform-specific queries, gathers results from common software-engineering web sources (GitHub, Stack Overflow) and Google Search, and uses embedding-based semantic classifiers to filter and rank results according to their relevance. GLiSE is designed for reproducibility with all settings being configuration-based, and every generated query being accessible. In this paper, (i) we present the GLiSE tool, (ii) provide a curated dataset of software engineering grey-literature search results classified by semantic relevance to their originating search intent, and (iii) conduct an empirical study on the usability of our tool.</description>
