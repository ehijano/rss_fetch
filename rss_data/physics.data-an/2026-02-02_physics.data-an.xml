      <title>Physically-motivated priors in the local distance ladder significantly reduce the Hubble tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determinations of the Hubble constant based on the local distance ladder remain in significant tension with early-Universe inferences from the cosmic microwave background. While this tension is often discussed in terms of new physics or unmodeled systematics, the role of the assumed priors on the model parameters has received comparatively little attention. Recently, Desmond et al. (2025) pointed out that the commonly adopted flat prior on distance moduli upweights smaller distances and systematically favors high inferred values of the Hubble constant. Motivated by this observation, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian recalibration of the distance ladder, applying physically motivated priors uniformly to all distances, including the Milky Way Cepheids, which are incorporated directly into the joint fit. Together with a conservative treatment of the Gaia EDR3 residual parallax offset, the Hubble constant shifts from $H_0 = 73.0 \pm 1.0 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ to $H_0 = 70.6 \pm 1.0 \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, reducing the Hubble tension from $5 \, \sigma$ to $2 \, \sigma$. Our results show that the assumed priors -- often treated as innocuous defaults -- may play a central role in the Hubble tension. Because all local distance ladders rely on the calibration of distances, similar prior-driven effects are expected to arise across distance-ladder methods.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Interactions for Efficient Swarm-Based Brownian Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from swarm intelligence, we show that short-range attractive interactions between thermally driven Brownian quasiparticles enable energy-efficient optimization. As quasiparticles can be generated directly within a material, the swarm size can be adjusted with minimal energy overhead. Using an optimization task defined by a spatially varying temperature landscape, we quantitatively show that interacting swarms reliably identify global optima and significantly outperform non-interacting searchers within a well-defined regime of interaction strength and swarm size. This improvement arises from emergent cooperative behavior, where local interactions guide the swarm toward high-quality solutions without central coordination. To link our physical model to experimental realizations, we coarse-grain the quasiparticle dynamics onto a sensor lattice and generate trajectories emulating particle-tracking measurements. We further show that the interacting swarm adapts robustly to landscapes that evolve over time. These findings establish interacting Brownian quasiparticles as a physical platform for scalable and energy-efficient unconventional computing.</description>

      <title>Missing links prediction: comparing machine learning with physics-rooted approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An active research line within the broader field of network science is the one concerning link prediction. Close in scope to network reconstruction, link prediction targets specific connections with the aim of uncovering the missing ones, as well as predicting those most likely to emerge in the future, from the available information. In this paper, we consider two families of methods, i.e. those rooted in statistical physics and those based upon machine learning: the members of the first family identify missing links as the most probable non-observed ones, the probability coefficients being determined by solving maximum-entropy benchmarks over the accessible network structure; the members of the second family, instead, associate the presence of single edges to explanatory node-specific variables. Running likelihood-based models such as the Configuration Model, or one of its many fitness-based variants, in parallel with the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree algorithm reveals that the former's accuracy is comparable to (and sometimes slightly higher than) the latter's. Such a result confirms that white-box algorithms are viable competitors to the currently available black-box ones, being computationally faster and more interpretable than the latter.</description>

      <title>On the statistical analysis of grouped data: when Pearson $\chi^2$ and other divisible statistics are not goodness-of-fit tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09195v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thousands of experiments are analyzed and papers are published each year involving the statistical analysis of grouped data. While this area of statistics is often perceived -- somewhat naively -- as saturated, several misconceptions still affect everyday practice, and new frontiers have so far remained unexplored. Researchers must be aware of the limitations affecting their analyses and what are the new possibilities in their hands.
  Motivated by this need, the article introduces a unifying approach to the analysis of grouped data, which allows us to study the class of divisible statistics -- that includes Pearson's $\chi^2$, the likelihood ratio as special cases -- with a fresh perspective. The contributions collected in this manuscript span from modeling and estimation to distribution-free goodness-of-fit tests.
  Perhaps the most surprising result presented here is that, in a sparse regime, all tests proposed in the literature are dominated by members of the class of weighted linear statistics.</description>

      <title>CaloHadronic: a diffusion model for the generation of hadronic showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating showers of particles in highly-granular calorimeters is a key frontier in the application of machine learning to particle physics. Achieving high accuracy and speed with generative machine learning models can enable them to augment traditional simulations and alleviate a major computing constraint. Recent developments have shown how diffusion based generative shower simulation approaches that do not rely on a fixed structure, but instead generate geometry-independent point clouds, are very efficient. We present a transformer-based extension to previous architectures which were developed for simulating electromagnetic showers in the highly granular electromagnetic calorimeter of the International Large Detector, ILD. The attention mechanism now allows us to generate complex hadronic showers with more pronounced substructure across both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This is the first time that machine learning methods are used to holistically generate showers across the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter in highly granular imaging calorimeter systems.</description>

      <title>Conformal prediction for uncertainties in nucleon-nucleon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction is a distribution-free and model-agnostic uncertainty-quantification method that provides finite-sample prediction intervals with guaranteed coverage. In this work, for the first time, we apply conformal-prediction to generate uncertainty bands for physical observables in nuclear physics, such as the total cross section and nucleon-nucleon phase shifts. We demonstrate the method's flexibility by considering three scenarios: (i) a pointwise model, where expansion coefficients in chiral effective field theory are treated as random variables; (ii) a Gaussian-process model for the coefficients; and (iii) phase shifts at various energies and partial waves calculated using local interactions from chiral effective field theory. In each case, conformal-prediction intervals are constructed and validated empirically. Our results show that conformal prediction provides reliable and adaptive uncertainty bands even in the presence of non-Gaussian behavior, such as skewness and heavy tails. These findings highlight conformal prediction as a robust and practical framework for quantifying theoretical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>PYVALE: A Fast, Scalable, Open-Source 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) Engine Capable of Handling Gigapixel Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Digital Image Correlation (DIC) is a widely used full-field measurement technique, but both open-source and commercial packages often have limitations such as operating-system restrictions, lack of support for deployment on computing clusters, and poor scalability to gigapixel-scale images common in Scanning Electron Microscopy DIC (SEM-DIC). Objective: Pyvale is an open-source software package designed for sensor simulation, uncertainty quantification, placement optimization, and calibration/validation. A key component of this is the development of a dedicated 2D DIC module intended for standalone use and integration within broader workflows. Methods: Pyvale provides a user-friendly Python interface with performant compiled routines underneath. At its core is a multithreaded, reliability-guided DIC algorithm. Its open-source MIT license enables wide deployment, including on computing clusters and in automated pipelines. Results: Benchmarking with the publicly available 2D DIC challenge 2.0 dataset shows that Pyvale achieves metrological performance comparable to existing commercial and open-source DIC codes. It can correlate gigapixel-scale image pairs in under 5 minutes on high-specification desktop workstations, with memory peaking at approximately 50 GB. Conclusions: Pyvale's strong metrological foundation, coupled with its scalability for SEM-DIC, positions it as a platform for sustained, community-driven development. Its design and licensing provide a foundation for future improvements in open-source DIC and integration into experimental design and validation workflows.</description>
