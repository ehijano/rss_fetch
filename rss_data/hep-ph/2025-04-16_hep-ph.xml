      <title>Strengthening Anomaly Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a refined version of the Anomaly Awareness framework for enhancing unsupervised anomaly detection. Our approach introduces minimal supervision into Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) through a two-stage training strategy: the model is first trained in an unsupervised manner on background data, and then fine-tuned using a small sample of labeled anomalies to encourage larger reconstruction errors for anomalous samples.
  We validate the method across diverse domains, including the MNIST dataset with synthetic anomalies, network intrusion data from the CICIDS benchmark, collider physics data from the LHCO2020 dataset, and simulated events from the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The latter provides a realistic example of subtle kinematic deviations in Higgs boson production. In all cases, the model demonstrates improved sensitivity to unseen anomalies, achieving better separation between normal and anomalous samples. These results indicate that even limited anomaly information, when incorporated through targeted fine-tuning, can substantially improve the generalization and performance of unsupervised models for anomaly detection.</description>

      <title>Detecting Ultralight Dark Matter with Matter Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight particles, with a mass below the electronvolt scale, exhibit wave-like behavior and have arisen as a compelling dark matter candidate. A particularly intriguing subclass is scalar dark matter, which induces variations in fundamental physical constants. However, detecting such particles becomes highly challenging in the mass range above $10^{-6}\,\text{eV}$, as traditional experiments face severe limitations in response time. In contrast, the matter effect becomes significant in a vast and unexplored parameter space. These effects include (i) a force arising from scattering between ordinary matter and the dark matter wind and (ii) a fifth force between ordinary matter induced by the dark matter background. Using the repulsive quadratic scalar-photon interaction as a case study, we develop a unified framework based on quantum mechanical scattering theory to systematically investigate these phenomena across both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes. Our approach not only reproduces prior results obtained through other methodologies but also covers novel regimes with nontrivial features, such as decoherence effects, screening effects, and their combinations. In particular, we highlight one finding related to both scattering and background-induced forces: the descreening effect observed in the non-perturbative region with large incident momentum, which alleviates the decoherence suppression. Furthermore, we discuss current and proposed experiments, including inverse-square-law tests, equivalence principle tests, and deep-space acceleration measurements. Notably, we go beyond the spherical approximation and revisit the MICROSCOPE constraints on the background-induced force in the large-momentum regime, where the decoherence and screening effects interplay. The ultraviolet models realizing the quadratic scalar-photon interaction are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Quasi-particle hydrodynamics with momentum-dependent relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics of a system of quasi-particles from the Boltzmann equation within the ambit of relaxation time approximation with modified collision kernels. We focus on two specific scenarios with single quasi-particle species, (i) the extended relaxation time approximation, and (ii) the novel relaxation time approximation. We find that both approaches lead to equivalent results up to first-order in spacetime gradients. We generalize the extended relaxation time approach to incorporate multiple quasi-particle species and obtain the corresponding expressions for the shear ($\eta_s$) and bulk ($\zeta_s$) viscous coefficients. As an application, we study the temperature dependence of the transport coefficients of hot QCD medium with quasi-gluon and (light and strange) quasi-quark sectors considering the power law ansatz for the momentum dependence of the relaxation time. We explore the impact of the power law exponent on the ratio $\zeta_s/\eta_s$. Our study suggests that in comparison to a constant exponent, a temperature dependent exponent in the power law ansatz is more suitable for modeling the quasi-particle dynamics in the relevant temperature regime of heavy ion collision.</description>

      <title>One-loop pseudoscalar mass in a 2HDM with a $Z_3$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-Higgs doublet model with a discrete $Z_3$ symmetry acquires, in its scalar and gauge sectors, an accidental continuous $U(1)$ symmetry. One therefore finds, after spontaneous symmetry breaking of those symmetries, that a massless pseudoscalar arises, as expected by Goldstone's theorem. In the fermion sector, however, it is possible to obtain Yukawa matrix textures which distinguish between the $Z_3$ and $U(1)$ symmetries, so one expects loop corrections to originate a non-zero pseudoscalar mass for the $Z_3$ case. We perform an explicit calculation that shows that at one-loop the pseudoscalar remains massless for all but one tested $Z_3$ Yukawa matrices. The pseudoscalar mass thus found is highly suppressed by the hierarchy of fermion masses.</description>

      <title>An Application of Diagrammatic Renormalization to $2^{++}$ Tensor Di-Gluonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the diagrammatic renormalization method to the NLO analysis of the $2^{++}$ tensor di-gluonium channel within the QCD sum-rules approach. Diagrammatic renormalization eliminates non-local divergences directly, avoiding the construction of renormalization factors and complications arising from operator mixing in the conventional renormalization method. The local divergences in QCD correlation functions contribute only to subtraction terms in dispersion relations in QCD sum-rules, making it particularly well-suited for diagrammatic renormalization as the local divergences do not enter sum-rules analysis. We provide a detailed example of renormalizing a representative NLO diagram and perform a comprehensive comparison of all non-zero NLO diagrams for $2^{++}$ tensor di-gluonium treated with both diagrammatic and conventional operator-mixing methods. The results from both approaches are in agreement, confirming the validity of diagrammatic renormalization. By simplifying the renormalization process, the diagrammatic renormalization method offers a practical alternative for higher-loop analysis of gluonium states and extensions to multi-quark systems.</description>

      <title>$D^0-\bar{D}^0$ mixing in the Dyson-Schwinger approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of difficulty to reproduce observables in the $D^0-\bar{D}^0$ mixing via the operator product expansion, we discuss the Dyson-Schwinger approach to this process. Formulated by the parameterization of quark propagators, SU(3) breaking relevant to charm mixing is evaluated in such a way that properly takes account of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. The $\bar{D}^0\to D^0$ transition is discussed in the vacuum-insertion approximation with locality of the light valence-quark field, represented by the decay constant of $D^0$ meson as well as relevant momentum integrals. It is found that dimensionless mass-difference observable in this approach leads to $|x|=(1.3-2.9)\times 10^{-3}$, the order of magnitude comparable to the HFLAV data, and thereby offering a certain improvement as a theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Progress in ${\cal CP}$ violating top-Higgs coupling at the LHC with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise measurement of the top-Higgs coupling is essential in particle physics, as it offers a powerful probe of potential new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), particularly scenarios involving ${\cal CP}$ violation, which is a key condition in addressing the problem of baryon asymmetry of the universe. In this article, we review the recent progress in the studies of the the top-Higgs coupling at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We briefly highlight the recent Machine Learning (ML) algorithms being used and their role in constraining the ${\cal CP}$ phase of the top-Higgs coupling with an emphasis on the future potential of beyond-the-traditional methods such as transformers and heterogeneous graphs in these studies.</description>

      <title>Light WIMPs and MeV Gamma-ray Detection with COSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), whose masses are in the sub-GeV scale, have been attracting more attention due to the negative results searching for traditional WIMPs. The light WIMPs are expected to produce gamma rays from annihilation in the MeV energy region. Advancements in technology have opened up possibilities to precisely detect MeV gamma rays, leading to the upcoming space-based mission of the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). We comprehensively and quantitatively study the phenomenology of light WIMPs to determine if the COSI observations will probe their viable model parameter regions. We first construct models to describe light WIMPs based on the minimality and renormalizability of quantum field theory. Next, we impose various constraints on the models obtained from cosmological observations (CMB, BBN) and dark matter searches (accelerator, underground, astrophysical experiments, etc.). Finally, we identify viable parameter regions in each model and discuss whether or not COSI will be sensitive to the parameter regions. We find that a velocity-dependent annihilation cross-section is predicted in some regions, enabling COSI to detect the dark matter signal while avoiding severe constraints from cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Towards a Refined Understanding of Non-holomorphic Soft SUSY-Breaking Effects on the Higgs Boson Mass Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of the non-holomorphic (NH) soft supersymmetry-breaking terms $ T_{33}^{\prime D} $ and $ \mu^\prime $, which introduce additional SUSY-breaking effects beyond the holomorphic structure of the superpotential, on the Higgs boson mass spectrum in the NH Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NHSSM). The term $ T_{33}^{\prime D} $ modifies the scalar bottom-quark mass matrix and Higgs couplings, while $ \mu^\prime $ affects the mass matrices of charginos and neutralinos. In our analysis, we incorporate constraints from charge- and color-breaking (CCB) minima where we find that a portion of the parameter space is excluded by these constraints. Focusing on the allowed parameter space, the NH contributions to the light $\cal CP$-even Higgs boson mass, $ M_h $, from $ \mu^\prime $ and $ T_{33}^{\prime D} $ can reach up to $ 1.4 \,\, \mathrm{GeV} $ and $ 90 \,\, \mathrm{MeV} $, respectively. For the heavy $\cal CP$-even Higgs boson mass, $ M_H $, and the charged Higgs boson mass, $ M_{H^{\pm}} $, these contributions can be substantially larger in certain regions of the parameter space, reaching up to $ 44 \,\, \mathrm{GeV} $ for $ M_H $ and $ 42 \,\, \mathrm{GeV} $ for $ M_{H^{\pm}} $ due to $ \mu^\prime $, and up to $ 60 \,\, \mathrm{GeV} $ due to $ T_{33}^{\prime D} $ for both $ M_H $ and $ M_{H^{\pm}} $. These corrections are significantly larger than the expected future experimental precision for Higgs boson masses and should therefore be considered in precision analyses for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Predictions for neutron star mergers from the gauge/gravity duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gauge/gravity duality, combined with information from lattice QCD, nuclear theory, and perturbative QCD, can be used to constrain the equation of state of hot and dense QCD. I discuss an approach based on the holographic V-QCD model, which includes both nuclear and quark matter phases, separated by a first order phase transition. By using this model in state-of-the-art simulations of neutron star binaries, I study the formation of quark matter during the merger process, and its effect on the threshold mass for prompt collapse into a black hole.</description>

      <title>A Light Lepton-flavor-violating Flavon: the Messenger of Neutrino Mixing and Muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In neutrino physics, a class of models with local or global family symmetries may be invoked, and then a flavon field is needed to realize the full neutrino mixing. This flavon may shed light on the long-standing muon $g-2$ puzzle. In this work, we explore this idea in the $({B-L})_{13}$ gauge extension to the standard model (SM), in which realistic neutrino mixing requires both a SM singlet flavon $s$ and a vector-like lepton (VLL) doublet. The dominant coupling between the flavon and leptons is in the manner of lepton-flavor-violation (LFV). Through an analytical analysis of the SM lepton-VLL mixing matrix, we find that the parameter space of the $s\bar\mu e$-type flavon to explain the muon $g-2$ has been completely excluded by the specific LFV process, muonium-antimuonium oscillation. But the $s\bar\mu \tau$-type flavon still has the opportunity; however, it confronts the strong constraint from $\tau\to \mu$ conservation and, in particular, the lepton flavor universality test of $Z$ boson decay, which arises due to our way to realize the LFV flavon. The surviving flavon is highly predictable, with mass in the narrow window $m_\tau\lesssim m_s\lesssim 1.5~ m_\tau$ and LFV coupling strength $\sim 10^{-2}$. Besides, it leaves a TeV scale VLL with a multi-lepton signature at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Heavy neutrino mixing prospects at hadron colliders: a machine learning study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply machine learning to the searches of heavy neutrino mixing in the inverse seesaw in the framework of left-right symmetric model at the high-energy hadron colliders. The Majorana nature of heavy neutrinos can induce the processes $pp \to W_R^\pm \to \ell_\alpha^\pm N \to \ell_\alpha^\pm \ell_\beta^{\mp,\,\pm} jj$, with opposite-sign (OS) and same-sign (SS) dilepton and two jets in the final state. The distributions of the charged leptons $\ell = e ,\, \mu$ and jets and their correlations are utilized as input for machine learning analysis. It is found that for both the OS and SS processes, XGBoost can efficiently distinguish signals from the standard model backgrounds. We estimate the sensitivities of heavy neutrino mass $m_N$ and their mixing in the OS and SS $ee$, $\mu\mu$ and $e\mu$ final states at $\sqrt{s} = 14$ TeV, 27 TeV and 100 TeV. It turns out that the heavy neutrinos can be probed up to 17.1 TeV and 19.5 TeV in the OS and SS channels, respectively. The sine of the mixing angle of heavy neutrinos can be probed up to the maximal value of $\sqrt2/2$ and 0.69 in the OS and SS channels, respectively.</description>

      <title>Study on charmonium(-like) mesons within a diabatic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the charmonium(-like) spectrum below 4.1 GeV using the diabatic approach, which offers a unified description of conventional and unconventional heavy meson states. Compared to previous studies, we consider a more realistic $c\bar c$ potential with including the spin-dependent interactions, which allows us to obtain more states and get more insights on the charmonium spectrum. Based on our calculation, we obtain the masses of the charmonium spectrum which align with the experimental data well. We also present the probabilities of finding various components, i.e. $c\bar c$ or meson-meson pair, in those states. Our results support the arguments that the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, $\psi(4040)$ and $\chi_{c2}(3930)$ have significant molecular components. In addition, our calculations show that the $\chi_{c0}(3860)$ and $\psi(3770)$ can be looked as the candidates for the charmonium states $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ and $\psi(1D)$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Search for additional scalar bosons within the Inert Doublet Model in a final state with two leptons at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the discovery reach of a new physics model, the Inert Doublet Model, at an $e^+e^-$ machine with centre-of-mass energies $\sqrt{s}$ of 240 and 365 GeV. Within this model, four additional scalar bosons ($H$, $A$, $H^+$ and $H^-$) are predicted. Due to an additional symmetry, the lightest new scalar, here chosen to be $H$, is stable and provides an adequate dark matter candidate. The search for pair production of the new scalars is investigated in final states with two electrons or two muons, in the context of the future circular collider proposal, FCC-ee. Building on previous studies in the context of the CLIC proposal, this analysis extends the search to detector-level objects, using a parametric neural network to enhance the signal contributions over the Standard Model backgrounds, and sets limits in the $m_A-m_H$ vs $m_H$ plane. With a total integrated luminosity of 10.8 (2.7) ab$^{-1}$ for $\sqrt{s}=240$ (365) GeV, almost the entire phase-space available in the $m_A-m_H$ vs $m_H$ plane is expected to be excluded at 95% CL, reaching up to $m_H=110$ (165) GeV. The discovery reach is also explored, reaching $m_H= 108$ (157) GeV for $m_A-m_H=15$ GeV at $\sqrt{s}=240$ (365) GeV.</description>

      <title>How Accidental was Inflation?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are discriminating between different models of inflation, disfavoring simple monomial potentials whilst being consistent with models whose predictions resemble those of the Starobinsky $R + R^2$ cosmological model. However, this model may suffer from theoretical problems, since it requires a large initial field value, threatening the validity of the effective field theory. This is quantified by the Swampland Distance Conjecture, which predicts the appearance of a tower of light states associated with an effective ultra-violet cutoff. This could be lower than the inflation scale for cases with an extended period of inflation, leading to an additional problem of initial conditions. No-scale supergravity models can reproduce the predictions of the Starobinsky model and accommodate the CMB data at the expense of fine-tuning of parameters at the level of $10^{-5}$. Here, we propose a solution to this problem based on an explicit realisation of the Starobinsky model in string theory, where this `deformation' parameter is calculable and takes a value of order of the one corresponding to the Starobinsky inflaton potential. Within this range, there are parameter values that accommodate more easily the combination of Planck, ACT and DESI BAO data, while also restricting the range of possible inflaton field values, thereby avoiding the swampland problem and predicting that the initial conditions for inflation compatible with the CMB data are generic.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures of non-singular matter bouncing cosmology in NANOGrav and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-singular matter bouncing cosmological setups are of particular interest since apart from adressing the initial singularity problem they can give rise as well to a nearly scale-invariant curvature power spectrum on scales $k&lt;10^{4}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, favored by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. Interestingly enough, one can find that within such non-singular bouncing cosmological setups, curvature perturbations grow on super-horizon scales during the matter contracting phase. In this work, we account for the evolution of cosmological perturbations during the transition to the Hot Big Bang expanding Universe, finding at the end naturally enhanced curvature perturbations on very small scales at horizon-crossing time during the expanding phase. These enhanced cosmological perturbations can induce gravitational waves (GWs) due to second order gravitational interactions and collapse as well to form primordial black holes (PBHs), with the latter acting as one of the most viable dark matter candidates. Remarkably, we find an induced GW background with a universal infrared (IR) frequency scaling of $f^2$, in excellent agreement with the recently released $\mathrm{nHz}$ GW data by the NANOGrav collaboration, being potentially detectable as well by other GW observatories such as LISA and ET, depending on the values of the bouncing cosmological parameters at hand.</description>

      <title>Low-energy neutrino responses for 71Ga by electron capture rates, charge exchange reactions and shell model calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak Gamow-Teller (GT) responses for low-lying states in ${}^{71}\mathrm{Ga}$ are crucial for studying low-energy solar neutrinos and the Ga anomaly, i.e., the possible transition to the sterile state. The responses for the ground state, the first excited state, and the second excited state are evaluated for the first time using the experimental electron capture rates, the experimental charge exchange reaction (CER) rates corrected for the tensor-interaction effect and the theoretical interacting shell model (ISM) calculations. The contributions from the two excited states to the solar and ${}^{51}\mathrm{Cr}$ neutrinos are found to be $4.2 \pm 1.2\%$ of that for the ground state. This is slightly larger than the ISM values but little smaller than the CER values without corrections for the tensor interaction effect. The Ga anomaly is far beyond the uncertainty of the obtained nuclear responses.</description>

      <title>Entropy bounds from quantum thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within an inherently classical perspective, there is always an unavoidable energy cost associated with the information deletion and this common lore is at the heart of the Landauer's conjecture that does not impose, per se, any relevant limit on the information acquisition. Although such a mindset should generally apply to systems of any size, its quantum mechanical implications are particularly intriguing and, for this reason, we examine here a minimal physical structure where the system and the environment are described, respectively, by a pair of quantum oscillators coupled by an appropriate Hermitian interaction able to amplify the entropy of the initial state. Since at the onset of the dynamical evolution the system is originally in a pure state, its entropy variation is always positive semidefinite and the Landauer's conjecture should not impose any constraint. Nonetheless, provided the quantum amplification is effective, it turns out that the entropy variation of the system always undershoots the heat transferred to the environment. When the initial thermal state of the environment is characterized by a chemical potential, the entropy growth is bounded both by the particles and by the heat flowing to the environment. The limits deduced in the quantum thermodynamical framework are also scrutinized from a field theory standpoint where species of different spins are copiously produced (especially in a cosmological context) thanks to the rapid variation of the space-time curvature.</description>

      <title>The axial-vector form factor of the nucleon in a finite box</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the axial-vector form factor of the nucleon in a finite box. Starting from the chiral Lagrangian with nucleon and Delta-isobar degrees of freedom, we address, at the one-loop level, the impact of two types of finite-volume effects. On the one hand, there are the implicit effects from the in-box values of the nucleon and Delta-isobar masses. On the other hand, there are the explicit effects caused by computing the in-box loop integrals with the values of the nucleon and Delta-isobar masses obtained in the infinite-volume limit. Selected numerical results are shown for three lattice ensembles. We show that the implicit effects dominate the in-box form factor. Our results are presented in terms of a set of basis functions that generalize the Passarino-Veltman reduction scheme to the finite-box case, such that only scalar loop integrals have to be performed. The techniques we developed are more generally relevant for lattice studies of hadronic quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic study of the Starobinsky-Higgs inflation model in the presence of an additional cubic term of the Ricci scalar. We investigate, in particular, the effects of the cubic term on the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. Through both analytical and numerical analyses, we show that the $R^3$-corrected Starobinsky-Higgs model can achieve compatibility with cosmic microwave background observations while producing distinct observational signatures with different frequency ranges. In addition, we discuss the complementarity between different observational probes, including the scalar-induced gravitational waves and spectral distortions, offering an independent probe of the enhanced curvature perturbations. Detection prospects are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: We continue analytical study of the meson mass spectrum in the large-$N_c$ two-dimensional QCD, known as the 't Hooft model, by addressing the most general case of quarks with unequal masses. Based on our previous work, we develop non-perturbative methods to compute spectral sums and systematically derive large-$n$ WKB expansion of the spectrum. Furthermore, we examine the behavior of these results in various asymptotic regimes, including the chiral, heavy quark, and heavy-light limits, and establish a precise coincidence with known analytical and numerical results obtained through alternative approaches.</description>

      <title>Can asteroid-mass PBHDM be compatible with catalyzed phase transition interpretation of PTA?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) can catalyze first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in their vicinity, potentially modifying the gravitational wave (GW) signals from PTs. In this study, we present the first comprehensive analysis of this catalytic effect during supercooled PTs within the high PBH number density regime. Applying the analytical model with envelope approximation, we derive the general expressions of GW spectrum in the presence of PBHs. We find that at relatively small PBH number densities, the GW signals are amplified due to the large-size bubbles. While higher PBH number densities suppress GW signals, since the accelerated PT progresses too rapidly. We further extend our findings to the bulk flow model and to scalar-induced GWs (SIGWs) generated during PTs. By conducting data fitting with the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we find that the PBH catalytic effect significantly alters the estimation of PT parameters. Notably, our analysis of the bubble collision GWs reveals that, the asteroid-mass PBHs ($10^{-16} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$) as the whole dark matter is incompatible with the PT interpretation of pulsar timing array signals. However, incorporating SIGWs can reduce this incompatibility for PBHs in the mass range $10^{-14} - 10^{-12} M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Global $\Lambda$ polarization in heavy-ion collisions at high baryon density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the model of three-fluid dynamics (3FD), the global $\Lambda$ polarization ($P_\Lambda$) is calculated in Au+Au collisions at 3 $\leq\sqrt{s_{NN}}\leq$ 9 GeV, in which high baryon density is achieved. Various contributions to $P_\Lambda$ are considered: those from the thermal vorticity, meson field, thermal shear and spin-Hall effect. Feed-down from higher-lying resonances is also taken into account. The results are compared with available data. Special attention is payed to the collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3, 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, and 4.5 GeV, for which a thorough scan of the energy, rapidity, and centrality dependence of $P_\Lambda$ is performed. The results for 3 GeV reasonably well reproduce the corresponding STAR data. While the results at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3.2, 3.5, 3.9, and 4.5 GeV can be considered as predictions for results of measurements within the STAR fixed-target (STAR-FXT) programthat are expected in the nearest future. It is predicted that a broad maximum of $P_\Lambda$ is reached at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\approx$ 3--3.9 GeV, exact position of which depends on the centrality and width of the midrapidity range of observation. Impact of the meson-field, thermal-shear and spin-Hall-effect contributions to $P_\Lambda$ is also studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical investigation of primordial black hole (PBH) formation from super-horizon curvature perturbations and the subsequent generation and propagation of sound waves, which can serve as a new source of stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds presented in a companion letter. Using the Misner-Sharp formalism with an excision technique, our simulations extend to significantly later times than previous work and indicate that the near-critical perturbations produce a distinct compression wave featuring both overdense and underdense shells, while significantly supercritical perturbations yield only an underdense shell. We also show that a softer equation of state suppresses the formation of compression waves. Furthermore, the comoving thickness of sound shells remains nearly constant during propagation and scales with the Hubble radius at horizon re-entry, thereby serving as a key link between the gravitational-wave peak frequency and PBH mass in the companion letter. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of PBH formation and suggest potential observational signatures of PBHs in the gravitational wave spectrum from associated sound waves.</description>

      <title>Long-time soliton dynamics via a coarse-grained space-time method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time dynamics of the Sine-Gordon (SG) model under a class of perturbations whose quantum field theoretic analog - via bosonization - corresponds to the massive Schwinger model describing 1+1D relativistic QED of Dirac fermions. Classical SG solutions offer critical insight into non-perturbative effects in this quantum theory, but capturing their long-time behavior poses significant numerical challenges. To address this, we extend a coarse-graining method to spacetime using a dual-mesh construction based on the Minkowski-metric. We first validate the approach against the well-studied variant of the SG model describing magnetic fluxon dynamics in Josephson transmission lines (JTLs), where analytical and numerical benchmarks exist. We then apply the method to the Schwinger-inspired SG model and uncover long-lived bound states - "Schwinger atoms" - in which a soliton is trapped by a fixed central charge. In certain regimes, the system exhibits limit cycles that give rise to positronium-like states of oppositely charged solitons, while in others such formation is suppressed. Accessing such long-time solutions requires a rigorous implementation of outgoing boundary conditions on a finite computational domain that provide radiative dissipation to allow relaxation toward states that exist only in an infinite domain. Here we provide such a construction. Our results also suggest the possibility of analog quantum simulation of relativistic quantum field theories with JTLs. These results demonstrate the utility of spatio-temporal coarse-graining methodology for probing non-perturbative structure formation in non-linear field theories.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we present several improvements of the non-relativistic Friedrichs-Lee model with multiple discrete and continuous states and still retain its solvability. Our findings establish a solid theoretical basis for the exploration of resonance phenomena in scenarios involving multiple interfering states across various channels. The scattering amplitudes associated with the continuum states naturally adhere to coupled-channel unitarity, rendering this framework particularly valuable for investigating hadronic resonant states appearing in multiple coupled channels. Moreover, this generalized framework exhibits a wide-range applicability, enabling investigations into resonance phenomena across diverse physical domains, including hadron physics, nuclear physics, optics, and cold atom physics, among others.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological study of the angle between jet axes in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a phenomenological study on the angle between the Standard and the Winner-Take-All (WTA) jet axes ($\Delta R_{{\rm axis}}^{{\rm WTA-Std}}$) in high-energy nuclear collisions. The $p$+$p$ baseline is provided by the Pythia8 event generator. The in-medium jet propagation is simulated by the linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model, which considers both the elastic and inelastic jet-medium interactions. Our theoretical results calculated by the LBT model show that the $\Delta R_{{\rm axis}}^{{\rm WTA-Std}}$ distribution in Pb+Pb at $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV is narrower than that in $p$+$p$, which agrees well with the recent ALICE measurements. The narrowing of $\Delta R_{{\rm axis}}^{{\rm WTA-Std}}$ seems to violate the $p_T$-broadening nature of the jet quenching effect, usually explained by the influence of "selection bias". However, the physical details still need to be fully understood. Utilizing a matching-jet method to track the jet evolution in the QGP to remove the selection bias in the Monte Carlo simulations, we observe that the $\Delta R_{{\rm axis}}^{{\rm WTA-Std}}$ distribution becomes broader due to the jet-medium interactions. At the same time, by rescaling the quark/gluon-jet fractions in Pb+Pb collisions to be the same as that in $p$+$p$, we find that the fraction change may not significantly influence the modification pattern of jet $\Delta R_{{\rm axis}}^{{\rm WTA-Std}}$. On the other hand, the selected jet sample in A+A collisions has a significantly narrower initial $\Delta R_{{\rm axis}}^{{\rm WTA-Std}}$ distribution than the $p$+$p$ baseline, and such a biased comparison between $p$+$p$ and A+A conceals the actual jet-broadening effect in the experimental measurements. The investigations presented in this paper will deepen our understanding of the relationship between the actual intra-jet modifications in the QGP and the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Lam-Tung relation breaking in $Z$ boson production as a probe of SMEFT effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The violation of Lam-Tung relation in the high-$p_T^{\ell\ell}$ region of the Drell-Yan process at the LHC presents a long-standing discrepancy with the standard model prediction at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ accuracy. In this Letter, we employed a model-independent analysis to investigate this phenomenon within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Our findings revealed that the leading contributions from SMEFT to this violation appear at the $1/\Lambda^4$ order with $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ accuracy in QCD interaction. Notably, we demonstrated that the quadratic effect of dimension-6 dipole operators, associated with the $Z$ boson, dominates the breaking effects induced by various dimension-6 and dimension-8 operators. This provides a possible explanation for the observed discrepancy with the Standard Model predictions at the LHC. Furthermore, the breaking effects could also serve as a powerful tool for constraining $Z$-boson dipole interactions, highlighting their importance among potential sources of new physics in the Drell-Yan process.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Evidence for Planck Transformation of Temperature: Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis Blast-Wave Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In physics, thermodynamic quantities are governed by two mutually exclusive relativistic transformations: the Planck and Ott transformations. This study derives both transformations from the fundamental principles of relativistic mechanics and equilibrium thermodynamics, treating the fundamental thermodynamic potential as a Lagrangian or Hamiltonian function for a moving system. We show that the Planck transformations align with the core principles of both Hamiltonian and Lagrangian mechanics, whereas the Ott transformations deviate from the foundational principles of Hamiltonian mechanics. These findings are supported by analysis of an ultrarelativistic ideal gas of quarks and gluons in the Stefan-Boltzmann limit. Additionally, we develop Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis blast-wave models for finite-volume systems. By comparing local equilibrium transverse momentum distributions of hadrons -- derived from these models using the Planck and Ott transformations -- with global equilibrium distributions from Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis formalisms, using identical parameters in the laboratory reference frame, we find that only the Planck transformations yield accurate results, while the Ott transformations produce significant discrepancies.</description>

      <title>The Fox-Wolfram Moment of Jet Production in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20680v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first theoretical investigation of Fox-Wolfram moments (FWMs) for multi-jet production in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this work, jet productions in p+p collisions are computed with a Monte Carlo event generator SHERPA, while the Linear Boltzmann Transport model is utilized to simulate the multiple scattering of energetic partons in the hot and dense QCD matter. The event-normalized distributions of the lower-order FWM, $H_1^T$ in p+p and Pb+Pb collisions are calculated. It is found that for events with jet number $n_\text{jet} = 2$ the $H_1^T$ distribution in Pb+Pb is suppressed at small $H_1^T$ while enhanced at large $H_1^T$ region as compared to p+p. For events with $n_\text{jet}&gt;2$, the jet number reduction effect due to jet quenching in the QGP decreases the $H_1^T$ distribution at large $H_1^T$ in Pb+Pb relative to p+p. The medium modification of the Fox-Wolfram moment $H_1^T$ for events with $n_\text{jet}\ge 2$ are also presented, which resemble those of events with $n_\text{jet} = 2$. Its reason is revealed through the relative contribution fractions of events with different final-state jet numbers to $H_1^T$.</description>

      <title>The next frontiers for magnetic monopole searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles (MMs) are well-motivated hypothetical particles whose discovery would symmetrize Maxwell equations, explain quantization of electric charge, and probe the gauge structure of the unified theory. Recent models predict MMs with low masses, reinvigorating searches at colliders. However, most theories predict composite MMs, whose production in parton-parton collisions is expected to be suppressed. The Schwinger process, whereby MM pairs tunnel through the vacuum barrier in the presence of a strong magnetic field, is not subject to this limitation. Additionally, the Schwinger cross section can be calculated nonperturbatively. Together, these make it a golden channel for low-mass MM searches. We investigate the Schwinger production of MMs in heavy-ion collisions at future colliders, in collisions of cosmic rays with the atmosphere, and in decay of magnetic fields of cosmic origin. We find that a next-generation collider would provide the best sensitivity, allowing one to discover or exclude MMs with TeV-scale masses. At the same time, exploiting the infrastructure of industrial ore extraction and Antarctic ice drilling could advance the field at a faster timescale and with only a modest investment. In particular, we show with detailed calculations that the proposed experiments will be sensitive to fluxes of low-mass MMs as low as a few units of 10^{-22} cm^{-2} s^{-1} sr^{-1} in a wide range of Lorentz factors. We also propose deploying dedicated MM detectors in conjunction with cosmic ray observatories to directly investigate if the unexplained, highest energy cosmic rays are MMs. Together, the proposed efforts would define the field of MM searches in the next decades.</description>

      <title>Universal Mass Equation for Equal-Quantum Excited-States Sets I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11196v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The masses of fifteen baryon sets and twenty-four meson sets of three or more equal-quantum excited states, using Breit-Wigner PDG masses and their uncertainties at fixed $J^P$ for baryons and $J^{PC}$ for mesons, are fitted by a simple two-parameter logarithmic function, $M_n = \alpha Ln(n) + \beta$, where $n$ is the level of radial excitation. The conjecture is made that accurately measured masses of all equal-quantum baryons (including LHCb exotic $P_{c\bar{c}}^+$s) and meson excited states (including $s\bar{s}$, $s\bar{c}$, $c\bar{c}$, $c\bar{b}$, and $b\bar{b}$ states) are related by the logarithmic function used here; at least for the mass range of currently known excited states. The baryon ``star'' rating case is evaluated. The Cornell potential is an example of how a logarithmic behavior can be explained by an appropriate potential. Thus, a ``universal mass equation'' (UME) for equal-quantum excited-state sets is presented.</description>

      <title>Constraining low scale dark hypercharge symmetry at spallation, reactor and Dark Matter direct detection experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus (CE$\nu$NS) and elastic neutrino-electron scattering (E$\nu$ES) data are exploited to constrain ``chiral'' $U(1)_{X}$ gauged models with light vector mediator mass. These models fall under a distinct class of new symmetries called dark hypercharge symmetries. A key feature is the fact that the $Z'$ boson can couple to all Standard Model fermions at tree level, with the $U(1)_X$ charges determined by the requirement of anomaly cancellation. Notably, the charges of leptons and quarks can differ significantly depending on the specific anomaly cancellation solution. As a result, different models exhibit distinct phenomenological signatures and can be constrained through various experiments. In this work, we analyze the recent data from the COHERENT experiment, along with results from dark matter (DM) direct detection experiments such as XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN, and PandaX-4T, and place new constraints on three benchmark models. Additionally, we set constraints from a performed analysis of TEXONO data and discuss the prospects of improvement in view of the next-generation DM direct detection DARWIN experiment.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the nature of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ pentaquark state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To shed light on the properties of states whose nature, internal structure, and spin-parity quantum numbers are not fully elucidated, we systematically study their electromagnetic properties. In light of this concept, we present a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic dipole moment of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ pentaquark within the context of QCD light-cone sum rules, utilizing three distinct interpolating currents in the form of diquark-diquark-antiquark configurations that are likely to couple this pentaquark with $J^P =\frac{3}{2}^-$ quantum numbers. The numerical analysis yielded the following results: $\mu_{{J_\mu^1}}= -0.60 \pm 0.15~\mu_N$, $\mu_{{J_\mu^2}}=1.60 \pm 0.30~\mu_N$ , and $\mu_{{J_\mu^3}}= 0.99 \pm 0.20~\mu_N$. The numerical results obtained have led to the conclusion that the magnetic dipole moments of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ state are capable of projecting its inner structure. As is seen, the different diquark-diquark-antiquark configurations of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ pentaquark state contain important information about its internal structure. Thus, this study will provide prominent data to investigate the inner structure of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ pentaquark state. We compared our results with other theoretical predictions that could be a useful complementary tool for interpreting the nature of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ state. A thorough examination reveals that the results obtained by employing disparate theoretical approaches and different internal structure models are not consistent with each other. It is recommended that further studies be conducted using alternative non-perturbative techniques to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the observed results.</description>

      <title>Minimal Electroweak Baryogenesis via Domain Walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Standard Model extended by a real scalar singlet $S$ with an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry offers a minimal framework for realizing electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) during a first-order electroweak phase transition. In this work, we explore a novel mechanism where spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ breaking enables EWBG via domain walls separating two distinct phases of the $S$ field. These domain walls feature restored (or weakly broken) EW symmetry in their cores and sweep through space, generating the baryon asymmetry below the temperature of EW symmetry breaking. We identify the key conditions for the existence of EW-symmetric domain wall cores and analyze the dynamics required for wall propagation over sufficient spatial volumes. Additionally, we outline the CP-violating sources necessary for baryogenesis under different regimes of domain wall evolution. The parameter space accommodating this mechanism spans singlet masses from sub-eV to 15 GeV, accompanied by a non-vanishing mixing with the Higgs boson. Unlike the standard realization of EWBG in the minimal singlet-extended SM, which is notoriously difficult to test, our scenario can be probed by a wide range of existing and upcoming experiments, including fifth force searches, rare meson decays, and EDM measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the diabatic formalism, a rigorous generalization of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we study the effects of introducing simple meson-meson molecular potentials to an established diquark model for tetraquark states, and calculate mixed bound states composed of both diquark-antidiquark and meson-meson molecular components. We examine the behavior of properties of the states as one varies the parameters of the di-meson potential, and find that significant regions of parameter space occur in which one may produce mass eigenstates exactly matching the specific examples of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ and $\chi_{c0}(3915)$. We also find regions in which a pure di-meson molecular state emerges, and study the same state properties in such cases.</description>

      <title>Combined study of the isospin-violating decay $D^{*}_{s}\to D_{s} \pi^0$ and radiative decay $D^*_s\to D_s\gamma$ with intermediate meson loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out a combined study of the isospin-violating decay $D_{s}^{*} \to D_{s} \pi^{0}$ and radiative decay $D^*_s\to D_s\gamma$ in an effective Lagrangian approach by taking into account the corrections from the one-loop transitions. By distinguishing the transition mechanisms of the long-distance interactions through the intermediate meson loops from the short-distance interactions through the $\eta-\pi^{0}$ mixing at the tree level the isospin-violating decay $D_{s}^{*} \to D_{s} \pi^{0}$ can be well constrained. In our approach the higher order corrections to the isospin-violating effects can involve the intermediate $D^{(*)}$ and $K^{(*)}$ scatterings. We find that the contributions from the destructive interference of intermediate meson loops via $D^{(*)0}(c\bar{u}){K}^{(*)+}(u\bar{s})$ and $D^{(*)+}(c\bar{d}){K}^{(*)0}(d\bar{s})$ rescatterings are significant. Within the commonly accepted ultra-violet (UV) cutoff range we obtain the partial decay width $\Gamma[D_{s}^{*} \to D_{s} \pi^{0}] = 9.92^{+0.76}_{-0.66}\,\mathrm{eV}$. This approach allows us to describe the $D_s^*$ radiative decay in the same framework via the vector meson dominance (VMD) model. We demonstrate that both the tree-level and one-loop transitions can be self-consistently determined if we adopt the experimental data for the branching ratio fraction of $D_{s}^{*} \to D_{s} \pi^{0}$ to $D^*_s\to D_s\gamma$. It then leads to a reliable estimate of the total decay width of $D_s^*$, i.e. $\Gamma_{\text{total}}(D_s^{*+})=170^{+ 13}_{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13719v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single Higgs production at FCC-ee probes the Higgs self-coupling at next-to-leading order (NLO). Extracting a bound requires a global analysis accounting for other possible new physics contributions up to NLO. We determine the FCC-ee sensitivity to Higgs self-coupling modifications $\delta\kappa_\lambda$ within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework, including for the first time flavour, LEP, LHC, and FCC-ee observables in a global analysis with all leading NLO effects via one-loop renormalisation group evolution, as well as incorporating finite NLO contributions to electroweak precision and $ZH$ observables. The global sensitivity to $\delta\kappa_\lambda$ is estimated by marginalising over the effects of all other operators, bringing flavour considerations to the fore. We find that, under reasonable assumptions, FCC-ee sensitivity to $\delta\kappa_\lambda$ can exceed that of the HL-LHC.</description>

Abstract: Grand unification possibilities in Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like models are studied. To address the problem of vector boson masses and nonrenormalizability of the theory, algebraic formalism encompassing the effective action, Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, and Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmerman renormalization is constructed. A new NJL-like model: the theory of current metric field interacting with fermions is proposed. Bosonization in this model can produce massless vector bosons under certain conditions which makes it a candidate grand unified theory. Both Higgs and non-Higgs effects can contribute to particle masses.</description>

      <title>Unravelling the role of merger histories in the population of In~situ stars: linking IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation to H3 survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We undertake a comprehensive investigation into the distribution of in~situ stars within Milky Way-like galaxies, leveraging TNG50 simulations and comparing their predictions with data from the H3 survey. Our analysis reveals that 28\% of galaxies demonstrate reasonable agreement with H3, while only 12\% exhibit excellent alignment in their profiles, regardless of the specific spatial cut employed to define in~situ stars. To uncover the underlying factors contributing to deviations between TNG50 and H3 distributions, we scrutinise correlation coefficients among internal drivers(e.g., virial radius, star formation rate [SFR]) and merger-related parameters (such as the effective mass-ratio, mean distance, average redshift, total number of mergers, average spin-ratio and maximum spin alignment between merging galaxies). Notably, we identify significant correlations between deviations from observational data and key parameters such as the median slope of virial radius, mean SFR values, and the rate of SFR change across different redshift scans. Furthermore, positive correlations emerge between deviations from observational data and parameters related to galaxy mergers. We validate these correlations using the Random Forest Regression method. Our findings underscore the invaluable insights provided by the H3 survey in unravelling the cosmic history of galaxies akin to the Milky Way, thereby advancing our understanding of galactic evolution and shedding light on the formation and evolution of Milky Way-like galaxies in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Meson mass spectrum in QCD$_2$ 't Hooft's model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of meson masses in large $N_c$ QCD$_2$ governed by celebrated 't Hooft's integral equation. We generalize analytical methods proposed by Fateev, Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov to the case of arbitrary, but equal quark masses $m_1=m_2.$ Our results include analytical expressions for spectral sums and systematic large-$n$ expansion. We also study the spectral sums in the chiral limit and the heavy quark limit and find a complete agreement with known results.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Reformation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) can arise in a wide range of scenarios, from inflation to first-order phase transitions. Light PBHs, such as those produced during preheating, in bounce cosmologies, or at the GUT scale, could induce an early matter-dominated phase given a moderate initial abundance. During the early matter domination, the growth of initial PBH density perturbations can trigger collapse on horizon scales, producing much heavier PBHs. While the remaining original PBHs evaporate and reheat the Universe, these massive reformed PBHs survive for an extended period of time, producing potentially observable signatures at the present. We study this PBH reformation scenario and show that those reformed PBHs can emit significant quantities of gamma rays detectable by the next generation of experiments. The rapid reheating after matter domination generates a coincident stochastic gravitational wave background, which could be within the range of the upcoming CMB-S4 experiment. The PBH reformation scenario provides an intriguing possibility of decoupling the current PBH population and the initial formation mechanism from early Universe physics, while providing opportunities for observation through multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Rational QCD loop amplitudes and quantum theories on twistor space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how curing an anomaly of the twistor uplift of self-dual Yang-Mills theory implies linear relations among one-loop, $n$-gluon, color-ordered subamplitudes in QCD, when all $n$ gluon helicities are positive, or when exactly one is negative. We compute the number of linearly independent subamplitudes as determined by these relations, in terms of unsigned Stirling numbers. Then we use a momentum-twistor parametrization to show that there are no further linear dependencies.</description>

      <title>Dark Universe inspired by the Kaluza-Klein gravity and impact on Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential implications of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravity in unifying the dark sector of the Universe. Through dimensional reduction in KK gravity, the 5D spacetime framework can be reformulated in terms of a 4D spacetime metric, along with additional scalar and vector fields. From the 4D perspective, this suggests the existence of a tower of particle states, including KK gravitons with spin-0 and spin-1 states, in addition to the massless spin-2 gravitons of general relativity (GR). The key idea in the present paper is the analogy with superconductivity theory. By assuming a minimal coupling between an additional complex scalar field and the gauge field, a "mass" term emerges for the spin-1 gravitons. This, in turn, leads to long-range gravitational effects that could modify Newton's law of gravity through Yukawa-type corrections. Assuming an environment-dependent mass for the spin-1 graviton, near the galactic center the repulsive force from this spin-1 graviton is suppressed by an additional attractive component from Newton's constant corrections, resulting in a Newtonian-like, attraction-dominated effect. In the galaxy's outer regions, the repulsive force fades due to its short range, making dark matter appear only as an effective outcome of the dominant attractive corrections. This approach also explains dark matter's emergence as an apparent effects on cosmological scales while our model is equivalent to the scalar-vector-tensor gravity theory. Finally, we examine the impact of dark matter on the primordial gravitational wave (PGW) spectrum and show that it is sensitive to dark matter effects, providing an opportunity to test this theory through future GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Features of Amplitudes in Planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The planar three-gluon form factor for the chiral stress tensor operator in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory is an analog of the Higgs-to-three-gluon scattering amplitude in QCD. The amplitude (symbol) bootstrap program has provided a wealth of high-loop perturbative data about this form factor, with results up to eight loops available. The symbol of the form factor at $L$ loops is given by words of length $2L$ in six letters with associated integer coefficients. In this paper, we analyze this data, describing patterns of zero coefficients and relations between coefficients. We find many sequences of words whose coefficients are given by closed-form expressions which we expect to be valid at any loop order. Moreover, motivated by our previous machine-learning analysis, we identify simple recursion relations that relate the coefficient of a word to the coefficients of particular lower-loop words. These results open an exciting door for understanding scattering amplitudes at all loop orders.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Equation of State from Neutron Star Observables via Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have conducted an extensive study using a diverse set of equations of state (EoSs) to uncover strong relationships between neutron star (NS) observables and the underlying EoS parameters using symbolic regression method. These EoS models, derived from a mix of agnostic and physics-based approaches, considered neutron stars composed of nucleons, hyperons, and other exotic degrees of freedom in beta equilibrium. The maximum mass of a NS is found to be strongly correlated with the pressure and baryon density at an energy density of approximately 800 MeV.fm$^{-3}$. We have also demonstrated that the EoS can be expressed as a function of radius and tidal deformability within the NS mass range 1-2$M_\odot$. These insights offer a promising and efficient framework to decode the dense matter EoS directly from the accurate knowledge of NS observables.</description>

      <title>The stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic superstrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic gravitational wave background sourced by a network of cosmic superstrings and demonstrate that incorporating higher-mass string species, beyond the fundamental string, is crucial for accurately modelling the resulting gravitational wave spectrum across frequencies ranging from nanohertz to kilohertz. Using the multi-tension velocity-dependent one-scale model to evolve the cosmic superstring network, we perform several fits to the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension, string coupling and effective size of compact extra dimensions. We find that the cosmic superstring best-fits are comparable in likelihood to Supermassive Black Hole models, thought by many to be the leading candidate explanation of the signal. The implications of the best-fit spectra are discussed within the context of future gravitational wave experiments. We obtain expectation values for the fundamental string tension of $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-11.4^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$($-11.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$) for gravitational waves originating from large cuspy (kinky) cosmic superstring loops and $\log_{10}(G\mu_1)=-9.7^{+0.7}_{-0.7}$($-9.9^{+1.0}_{-0.5}$) for small cuspy (kinky) loops. We also place $2\sigma$ upper bounds on the string coupling, finding $g_s&lt;0.7$ in all cases, and comment on the implication of our results for the effective size of the compact extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>First Measurement of Entanglement Dynamics in the SYK Model using Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, fundamental to quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, exhibits both maximal chaos and exact solvability, yet its entanglement entropy has never been measured experimentally. Here, we present the first measurement of entanglement entropy growth under the SYK Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum computer as a programmable quantum platform. We implement an optimized swap-based many-body interference protocol tailored for limited qubit connectivity to measure entanglement entropy. Additionally, we enhance the randomized measurement protocol for entropy measurement by expanding the unitary ensemble, which increases the circuit volume and pushes the capability of the near-term devices. However, we tackle this challenge by employing a quantum multi-programming strategy that parallelizes circuit execution. This work paves the way for exploring chaotic quantum dynamics and establishes scalable methods for investigating complex entanglement growth on current quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>A Prototype Atom Interferometer to Detect Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The AION project has built a tabletop prototype of a single-photon long-baseline atom interferometer using the 87Sr clock transition - a type of quantum sensor designed to search for dark matter and gravitational waves. Our prototype detector operates at the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), producing a signal with no unexpected noise beyond atom shot noise. Importantly, the detector remains at the SQL even when additional laser phase noise is introduced, emulating conditions in a long-baseline detector such as AION or AEDGE where significant laser phase deviations will accumulate during long atom interrogation times. Our results mark a key milestone in extending atom interferometers to long baselines. Such interferometers can complement laser-interferometer gravitational wave detectors by accessing the mid-frequency gravitational wave band around 1 Hz, and can search for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>
