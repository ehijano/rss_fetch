      <title>De-Risking Development in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Qualitative Study of Investment Dynamics in Angola</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) contribute to de-risking development in Sub-Saharan Africa by shaping Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows and supporting sustainable economic transformation. Focusing on Angola as a representative case, the research draws on qualitative interviews with international development advisors, foreign affairs professionals, and senior public sector stakeholders. The study explores how DFIs mitigate investment risk, enhance project credibility, and promote diversification beyond extractive sectors. While DFIs are widely recognized as catalysts for private sector engagement, particularly in infrastructure, agriculture, and manufacturing, their effectiveness is often constrained by institutional weaknesses and misalignment with national development priorities. The findings suggest that DFIs play a crucial enabling role in fragile and resource-dependent settings, but their long-term impact depends on complementary domestic reforms, improved governance, and strategic coordination. This research contributes to the literature on development finance by offering grounded empirical insights from an under examined Sub-Saharan context.</description>

      <title>Government Transparency Affects Innovation: Evidence from Wireless Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does government transparency affect innovation? I evaluate the launch of a government database with detailed technical information on the universe of wireless-enabled products on the U.S. market (N 347 thousand). The results show the launch approximately doubled the use of new technologies in the following ten years, an indicator of follow-on innovation. The increase affected both products in the same and new product classes, suggesting novelty; waned over several years, potentially due to an increase in secrecy and patenting; and boosted foreign more than U.S. domestic competitors. These results highlight the importance of information for private sector innovation.</description>

      <title>Topology of Currencies: Persistent Homology for FX Co-movements: A Comparative Clustering Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates whether Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can provide additional insights beyond traditional statistical methods in clustering currency behaviours. We focus on the foreign exchange (FX) market, which is a complex system often exhibiting non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics that classical techniques may not fully capture. We compare clustering results based on TDA-derived features versus classical statistical features using monthly logarithmic returns of 13 major currency exchange rates (all against the euro). Two widely-used clustering algorithms, \(k\)-means and Hierarchical clustering, are applied on both types of features, and cluster quality is evaluated via the Silhouette score and the Calinski-Harabasz index. Our findings show that TDA-based feature clustering produces more compact and well-separated clusters than clustering on traditional statistical features, particularly achieving substantially higher Calinski-Harabasz scores. However, all clustering approaches yield modest Silhouette scores, underscoring the inherent difficulty of grouping FX time series. The differing cluster compositions under TDA vs. classical features suggest that TDA captures structural patterns in currency co-movements that conventional methods might overlook. These results highlight TDA as a valuable complementary tool for analysing financial time series, with potential applications in risk management where understanding structural co-movements is crucial.</description>

      <title>Towards a feminist understanding of digital platform work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of the digital platform economy is transforming labor markets, offering new employment opportunities with promises of flexibility and accessibility. However, these benefits often come at the expense of increased economic exploitation, occupational segregation, and deteriorating working conditions. Research highlights that algorithmic management disproportionately impacts marginalized groups, reinforcing gendered and racial inequalities while deepening power imbalances within capitalist systems. This study seeks to elucidate the complex nature of digital platform work by drawing on feminist theories that have historically scrutinized and contested the structures of power within society, especially in the workplace. It presents a framework focused on four key dimensions to lay a foundation for future research: (i) precarity and exploitation, (ii) surveillance and control, (iii) blurring employment boundaries, and (iv) colonial legacies. It advocates for participatory research, transparency in platform governance, and structural changes to promote more equitable conditions for digital platform workers.</description>

      <title>Compensation-based risk-sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the mathematical problem of allocating payouts (compensations) in an endowment contingency fund using a risk-sharing rule that satisfies full allocation. Besides the participants, an administrator manages the fund by collecting ex-ante contributions to establish the fund and distributing ex-post payouts to members. Two types of administrators are considered. An 'active' administrator both invests in the fund and receives the payout of the fund when no participant receives a payout. A 'passive' administrator performs only administrative tasks and neither invests in nor receives a payout from the fund. We analyze the actuarial fairness of both compensation-based risk-sharing schemes and provide general conditions under which fairness is achieved. The results extend earlier work by Denuit and Robert (2025) and Dhaene and Milevsky (2024), who focused on payouts based on Bernoulli distributions, by allowing for general non-negative loss distributions.</description>

      <title>Integrating Transparent Models, LLMs, and Practitioner-in-the-Loop: A Case of Nonprofit Program Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public and nonprofit organizations often hesitate to adopt AI tools because most models are opaque even though standard approaches typically analyze aggregate patterns rather than offering actionable, case-level guidance. This study tests a practitioner-in-the-loop workflow that pairs transparent decision-tree models with large language models (LLMs) to improve predictive accuracy, interpretability, and the generation of practical insights. Using data from an ongoing college-success program, we build interpretable decision trees to surface key predictors. We then provide each tree's structure to an LLM, enabling it to reproduce case-level predictions grounded in the transparent models. Practitioners participate throughout feature engineering, model design, explanation review, and usability assessment, ensuring that field expertise informs the analysis at every stage. Results show that integrating transparent models, LLMs, and practitioner input yields accurate, trustworthy, and actionable case-level evaluations, offering a viable pathway for responsible AI adoption in the public and nonprofit sectors.</description>

      <title>Market Definition: A Sensitivity Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Market definition holds significant importance in antitrust cases, yet achieving consensus on the correct approach remains elusive. As a result, analysts routinely entertain multiple market definitions to ensure the resilience of their conclusions. I propose a simple framework for conducting organized sensitivity analysis with respect to market definition. I model candidate market definitions as partially ordered and use a Hasse diagram, a directed acyclic graph representing a finite partial order, to summarize the sensitivity analysis. I use the Shapley value and the Shapley-Shubik power index to quantify the average marginal contribution of each firm in driving the conclusion. I illustrate the method's usefulness with an application to the Albertsons/Safeway (2015) merger.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of Strategic Reasoning of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13013v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities in structured tasks (e.g., coding and mathematics), we explore whether these abilities extend to strategic multi-agent environments. We investigate strategic reasoning capabilities -- the process of choosing an optimal course of action by predicting and adapting to others' actions -- of LLMs by analyzing their performance in three classical games from behavioral economics. Using hierarchical models of bounded rationality, we evaluate three standard LLMs (ChatGPT-4, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Gemini 1.5) and three reasoning LLMs (OpenAI-o1, Claude-4-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini Flash Thinking 2.0). Our results show that reasoning LLMs exhibit superior strategic reasoning compared to standard LLMs (which do not demonstrate substantial capabilities) and often match or exceed human performance; this represents the first and thus most fundamental transition in strategic reasoning capabilities documented in LLMs. Since strategic reasoning is fundamental to future AI systems (including Agentic AI), our findings demonstrate the importance of dedicated reasoning capabilities in achieving effective strategic reasoning.</description>

      <title>Strategizing with AI: Insights from a Beauty Contest Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $p$-beauty contest is a wide class of games of guessing the most popular strategy among other players. In particular, guessing a fraction of a mean of numbers chosen by all players is a classic behavioral experiment designed to test iterative reasoning patterns among various groups of people. The previous literature reveals that the level of sophistication of the opponents is an important factor affecting the outcome of the game. Smarter decision makers choose strategies that are closer to theoretical Nash equilibrium and demonstrate faster convergence to equilibrium in iterated contests with information revelation. We replicate a series of classic experiments by running virtual experiments with large language models (LLMs) who play against various groups of virtual players. Our results show that LLMs recognize strategic context of the game and demonstrate expected adaptability to the changing set of parameters. LLMs systematically behave in a more sophisticated way compared to the participants of the original experiments. All LLMs still fail to identify dominant strategies in a two-player game. Our results contribute to the discussion on the accuracy of modeling human economic agents by artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Becoming Immutable: How Ethereum is Made</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We collect and study 15,097 blocks proposed for inclusion in the Ethereum blockchain during 8 minutes on December 3rd, 2024, corresponding to 39 added blocks. These proposed blocks contain 10,793 unique transactions, and 2,380,014 transaction-block pairings, our primary unit of analysis. We find that 20% of user transactions are delayed: although proposed during a bidding cycle, they are not included in the corresponding winning block. Approximately 30% of such delayed transactions are exclusive to a losing builder. We also identify two arbitrage bots trading between decentralized (DEX) and centralized exchanges (CEX), which are responsible for a significant fraction of the value of proposed blocks. By examining their bidding dynamics, we estimate that the implied price at which these bots trade USDC/WETH and USDT/WETH on CEXes is approximately 2.8 basis points better than the contemporaneous Binance price.</description>

      <title>The Promise and Peril of Generative AI: Evidence from GPT as Sell-Side Analysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to democratize financial analysis by reducing information-processing costs. Yet equal access does not ensure equal outcomes, as the locus of friction may shift from processing information to evaluating model outputs. We study GPT's earnings forecasts following corporate earnings releases and document two patterns. First, GPT's narrative attention is consistent and human-like but not always associated with higher forecast accuracy. Second, its quantitative reasoning varies substantially across contexts, challenging the view that LLMs are uniformly weak at numerical tasks. Building on these insights, we propose a diagnostic framework that links forecast accuracy to observable processing features (i.e., narrative focus, numerical reasoning, and self-assessed confidence). These indicators serve as proxies for this new form of information friction and alert investors when to exercise caution. Our study has implications for information frictions, regulatory oversight, and the economics of AI-mediated financial markets.</description>

      <title>How Exclusive are Ethereum Transactions? Evidence from non-winning blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze 15,097 blocks proposed for inclusion in Ethereum's blockchain over an eight-minute window on December 3, 2024, during which 38 blocks were added to the chain. We classify transactions as exclusive - appearing only in blocks from a single builder - or private - absent from the public mempool but included in blocks from multiple builders. We find that exclusive transactions account for between 77.2% and 84% of the total fees paid by transactions in winning blocks. Moreover, we show that exclusivity cannot be fully attributed to persistent relationships between senders and builders: only about 7% of all on-chain exclusive transaction value originates from senders who route exclusively to one builder. Finally, we observe that transaction exclusivity is dynamic. Some transactions are exclusive at the start of a bidding cycle but later appear in blocks from multiple builders. Other transactions remain exclusive to a losing builder for two or three cycles before appearing in the public mempool. These transactions are therefore delayed and then exposed to potential attacks.</description>

      <title>Feature-driven reinforcement learning for photovoltaic in continuous intraday trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) operators face substantial uncertainty in generation and short-term electricity prices. Continuous intraday markets enable producers to adjust their positions in real time, potentially improving revenues and reducing imbalance costs. We propose a feature-driven reinforcement learning (RL) approach for PV intraday trading that integrates data-driven features into the state and learns bidding policies in a sequential decision framework. The problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process with a reward that balances trading profit and imbalance penalties and is solved with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using a predominantly linear, interpretable policy. Trained on historical market data and evaluated out-of-sample, the strategy consistently outperforms benchmark baselines across diverse scenarios. Extensive validation shows rapid convergence, real-time inference, and transparent decision rules. Learned weights highlight the central role of market microstructure and historical features. Taken together, these results indicate that feature-driven RL offers a practical, data-efficient, and operationally deployable pathway for active intraday participation by PV producers.</description>
