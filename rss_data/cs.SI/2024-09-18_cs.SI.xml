      <title>Impact Of Emotions on Information Seeking And Sharing Behaviors During Pandemic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to assess the public's coping behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak by examining the emotions. Specifically, we explore (1) changes in the public's emotions with the COVID-19 crisis progression and (2) the impacts of the public's emotions on their information-seeking, information-sharing behaviors, and compliance with stay-at-home policies. We base the study on the appraisal tendency framework, detect the public's emotions by fine-tuning a pre-trained RoBERTa model, and cross-analyze third-party behavioral data. We demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of our proposed approach in providing a large-scale examination of the publi's emotions and coping behaviors in a real-world crisis: COVID-19. The approach complements prior crisis communication research, mainly based on self-reported, small-scale experiments and survey data. Our results show that anger and fear are more prominent than other emotions experienced by the public at the pandemic's outbreak stage. Results also show that the extent of low certainty and passive emotions (e.g., sadness, fear) was related to increased information-seeking and information-sharing behaviors. Additionally, high-certainty (e.g., anger) and low-certainty (e.g., sadness, fear) emotions during the outbreak correlated to the public's compliance with stay-at-home orders.</description>

      <title>Consensus in Models for Opinion Dynamics with Generalized-Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest is growing in social learning models where users share opinions and adjust their beliefs in response to others. This paper introduces generalized-bias opinion models, an extension of the DeGroot model, that captures a broader range of cognitive biases. These models can capture, among others, dynamic (changing) influences as well as ingroup favoritism and out-group hostility, a bias where agents may react differently to opinions from members of their own group compared to those from outside. The reactions are formalized as arbitrary functions that depend, not only on opinion difference, but also on the particular opinions of the individuals interacting. Under certain reasonable conditions, all agents (despite their biases) will converge to a consensus if the influence graph is strongly connected, as in the original DeGroot model. The proposed approach combines different biases, providing deeper insights into the mechanics of opinion dynamics and influence within social networks.</description>

      <title>Inside Alameda Research: A Multi-Token Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the token transfer network on Ethereum, focusing on accounts associated with Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency trading firm implicated in the misuse of FTX customer funds. Using a multi-token network representation, we examine node centralities and the network backbone to identify critical accounts, tokens, and activity groups. The temporal evolution of Alameda accounts reveals shifts in token accumulation and distribution patterns leading up to its bankruptcy in November 2022. Through network analysis, our work offers insights into the activities and dynamics that shape the DeFi ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Social Fabric: A Temporal, Nation-Scale Social Network and its Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social networks shape individuals' lives, influencing everything from career paths to health. This paper presents a registry-based, multi-layer and temporal network of the entire Danish population in the years 2008-2021 (roughly 7.2 mill. individuals). Our network maps the relationships formed through family, households, neighborhoods, colleagues and classmates. We outline key properties of this multiplex network, introducing both an individual-focused perspective as well as a bipartite representation. We show how to aggregate and combine the layers, and how to efficiently compute network measures such as shortest paths in large administrative networks. Our analysis reveals how past connections reappear later in other layers, that the number of relationships aggregated over time reflects the position in the income distribution, and that we can recover canonical shortest path length distributions when appropriately weighting connections. Along with the network data, we release a Python package that uses the bipartite network representation for efficient analysis.</description>

      <title>Let's Influence Algorithms Together: How Millions of Fans Build Collective Understanding of Algorithms and Organize Coordinated Algorithmic Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous research pays attention to how users strategically understand and consciously interact with algorithms but mainly focuses on an individual level, making it difficult to explore how users within communities could develop a collective understanding of algorithms and organize collective algorithmic actions. Through a two-year ethnography of online fan activities, this study investigates 43 core fans who always organize large-scale fans' collective actions and their corresponding general fan groups. This study aims to reveal how these core fans mobilize millions of general fans through collective algorithmic actions. These core fans reported the rhetorical strategies used to persuade general fans, the steps taken to build a collective understanding of algorithms, and the collaborative processes that adapt collective actions across platforms and cultures. Our findings highlight the key factors that enable computer-supported collective algorithmic actions and extend collective action research into large-scale domain targeting algorithms.</description>

      <title>Semantics Preserving Emoji Recommendation with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emojis have become an integral part of digital communication, enriching text by conveying emotions, tone, and intent. Existing emoji recommendation methods are primarily evaluated based on their ability to match the exact emoji a user chooses in the original text. However, they ignore the essence of users' behavior on social media in that each text can correspond to multiple reasonable emojis. To better assess a model's ability to align with such real-world emoji usage, we propose a new semantics preserving evaluation framework for emoji recommendation, which measures a model's ability to recommend emojis that maintain the semantic consistency with the user's text. To evaluate how well a model preserves semantics, we assess whether the predicted affective state, demographic profile, and attitudinal stance of the user remain unchanged. If these attributes are preserved, we consider the recommended emojis to have maintained the original semantics. The advanced abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and generating nuanced, contextually relevant output make them well-suited for handling the complexities of semantics preserving emoji recommendation. To this end, we construct a comprehensive benchmark to systematically assess the performance of six proprietary and open-source LLMs using different prompting techniques on our task. Our experiments demonstrate that GPT-4o outperforms other LLMs, achieving a semantics preservation score of 79.23%. Additionally, we conduct case studies to analyze model biases in downstream classification tasks and evaluate the diversity of the recommended emojis.</description>

      <title>Capturing Differences in Character Representations Between Communities: An Initial Study with Fandom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sociolinguistic theories have highlighted how narratives are often retold, co-constructed and reconceptualized in collaborative settings. This working paper focuses on the re-interpretation of characters, an integral part of the narrative story-world, and attempts to study how this may be computationally compared between online communities. Using online fandom - a highly communal phenomenon that has been largely studied qualitatively - as data, computational methods were applied to explore shifts in character representations between two communities and the original text. Specifically, text from the Harry Potter novels, r/HarryPotter subreddit, and fanfiction on Archive of Our Own were analyzed for changes in character mentions, centrality measures from co-occurrence networks, and semantic associations. While fandom elevates secondary characters as found in past work, the two fan communities prioritize different subsets of characters. Word embedding tests reveal starkly different associations of the same characters between communities on the gendered concepts of femininity/masculinity, cruelty, and beauty. Furthermore, fanfiction descriptions of a male character analyzed between romance pairings scored higher for feminine-coded characteristics in male-male romance, matching past qualitative theorizing. The results high-light the potential for computational methods to assist in capturing the re-conceptualization of narrative elements across communities and in supporting qualitative research on fandom.</description>

      <title>Popularity Ratio Maximization: Surpassing Competitors through Influence Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an algorithmic study on how to surpass competitors in popularity by strategic promotions in social networks. We first propose a novel model, in which we integrate the Preferential Attachment (PA) model for popularity growth with the Independent Cascade (IC) model for influence propagation in social networks called PA-IC model. In PA-IC, a popular item and a novice item grab shares of popularity from the natural popularity growth via the PA model, while the novice item tries to gain extra popularity via influence cascade in a social network. The popularity ratio is defined as the ratio of the popularity measure between the novice item and the popular item. We formulate Popularity Ratio Maximization (PRM) as the problem of selecting seeds in multiple rounds to maximize the popularity ratio in the end. We analyze the popularity ratio and show that it is monotone but not submodular. To provide an effective solution, we devise a surrogate objective function and show that empirically it is very close to the original objective function while theoretically, it is monotone and submodular. We design two efficient algorithms, one for the overlapping influence and non-overlapping seeds (across rounds) setting and the other for the non-overlapping influence and overlapping seed setting, and further discuss how to deal with other models and problem variants. Our empirical evaluation further demonstrates that the proposed PRM-IMM method consistently achieves the best popularity promotion compared to other methods. Our theoretical and empirical analyses shed light on the interplay between influence maximization and preferential attachment in social networks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the Greek wiretappings scandal, which has been revealed in 2022 and attracted a lot of attention by press and citizens. Specifically, we propose a methodology for collecting data and analyzing patterns of online public discussions on Twitter. We apply our methodology to the Greek wiretappings use case, and present findings related to the evolution of the discussion over time, its polarization, and the role of the media. The methodology can be of wider use and replicated to other topics. Finally, we provide publicly an open dataset, and online resources with the results.</description>

      <title>Statistical Complexity of Heterogeneous Geometric Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20354v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Degree heterogeneity and latent geometry, also referred to as popularity and similarity, are key explanatory components underlying the structure of real-world networks. The relationship between these components and the statistical complexity of networks is not well understood. We introduce a parsimonious normalised measure of statistical complexity for networks. The measure is trivially 0 in regular graphs and we prove that this measure tends to 0 in Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs in the thermodynamic limit. We go on to demonstrate that greater complexity arises from the combination of heterogeneous and geometric components to the network structure than either on their own. Further, the levels of complexity achieved are similar to those found in many real-world networks. However, we also find that real-world networks establish connections in a way which increases complexity and which our null models fail to explain. We study this using ten link growth mechanisms and find that only one mechanism successfully and consistently replicates this phenomenon -- probabilities proportional to the exponential of the number of common neighbours between two nodes. Common neighbours is a mechanism which implicitly accounts for degree heterogeneity and latent geometry. This explains how a simple mechanism facilitates the growth of statistical complexity in real-world networks.</description>

Abstract: In today's digital age, social media platforms play a crucial role in shaping public opinion. This study explores how discussions led by influencers on Twitter, now known as 'X', affect public sentiment and contribute to online polarization. We developed a counterfactual framework to analyze the polarization scores of conversations in scenarios both with and without the presence of an influential figure. Two case studies, centered on the polarizing issues of climate change and gun control, were examined. Our research highlights the significant impact these figures have on public discourse, providing valuable insights into how online discussions can influence societal divisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proactive content moderation requires platforms to rapidly and continuously evaluate the credibility of websites. Leveraging the direct and indirect paths users follow to unreliable websites, we develop a website credibility classification and discovery system that integrates both webgraph and large-scale social media contexts. We additionally introduce the concept of dredge words, terms or phrases for which unreliable domains rank highly on search engines, and provide the first exploration of their usage on social media. Our graph neural networks that combine webgraph and social media contexts generate to state-of-the-art results in website credibility classification and significantly improves the top-k identification of unreliable domains. Additionally, we release a novel dataset of dredge words, highlighting their strong connections to both social media and online commerce platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two ways to measure the simplicial nature of a hypergraph: the simplicial ratio and the simplicial matrix. We show that the simplicial ratio captures the frequency, as well as the rarity, of simplicial interactions in a hypergraph while the simplicial matrix provides more fine-grained details. We then compute the simplicial ratio, as well as the simplicial matrix, for 10 real-world hypergraphs and, from the data collected, hypothesize that simplicial interactions are more and more deliberate as edge size increases. We then present a new Chung-Lu model that includes a parameter controlling (in expectation) the frequency of simplicial interactions. We use this new model, as well as the real-world hypergraphs, to show that multiple stochastic processes exhibit different behaviour when performed on simplicial hypergraphs vs. non-simplicial hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Graph Features Based on Random Walks Using Neighbors' Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using random walks for sampling has proven advantageous in assessing the characteristics of large and unknown social networks. Several algorithms based on random walks have been introduced in recent years. In the practical application of social network sampling, there is a recurrent reliance on an application programming interface (API) for obtaining adjacent nodes. However, owing to constraints related to query frequency and associated API expenses, it is preferable to minimize API calls during the feature estimation process. In this study, considering the acquisition of neighboring nodes as a cost factor, we introduce a feature estimation algorithm that outperforms existing algorithms in terms of accuracy. Through experiments that simulate sampling on known graphs, we demonstrate the superior accuracy of our proposed algorithm when compared to existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>A new mapping of technological interdependence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How does technological interdependence affect innovation? We address this question by examining the influence of neighbors' innovativeness and the structure of the innovators' network on a sector's capacity to develop new technologies. We study these two dimensions of technological interdependence by applying novel methods of text mining and network analysis to the documents of 6.5 million patents granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) between 1976 and 2021. We find that, in the long run, the influence of network linkages is as important as that of neighbor innovativeness. In the short run, however, positive shocks to neighbor innovativeness yield relatively rapid effects, while the impact of shocks strengthening network linkages manifests with delay, even though lasts longer. Our analysis also highlights that patent text contains a wealth of information often not captured by traditional innovation metrics, such as patent citations.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the problem of estimating the order of arrival of the vertices in a random recursive tree. Specifically, we study two fundamental models: the uniform attachment model and the linear preferential attachment model. We propose an order estimator based on the Jordan centrality measure and define a family of risk measures to quantify the quality of the ordering procedure. Moreover, we establish a minimax lower bound for this problem, and prove that the proposed estimator is nearly optimal. Finally, we numerically demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms degree-based and spectral ordering procedures.</description>
