      <title>On periodic solutions of the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16162v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we would establish the existence and stability of periodic solutions to the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-Burgers (BBM-Burgers) equation in $H^1_0([0, 1])$, whose medium interior is applied with time-periodic force $f(x, t)$ with period $\theta$. High regularity analysis has been conducted in Hilbert spaces $H^\ell, \ell&gt;1$. We also consider periodic solution to same IBVP scenario of a pseudo-parabolic-regularized equation as an extension of the BBM-Burgers in $\mathcal{H}^{\ell}, \ell=\{1, 2\}$.</description>

      <title>Propagation of singularities for equations with $C^{r}$ coefficients for $r&gt;1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe that, for $r&gt;1$, $s$ in an $r$-dependent interval, $p$ a homogeneous pseudodifferential symbol of order $m$ having $C^{r}$ regularity in space, and $u\in H^{s+m-r}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ such that $p(x,D)u\in H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$, each point in the $H^{s+m-1}$ wavefront set of $u$ lies on a maximally extended bicharacteristic of $p$ which is contained in the $H^{s+m-1}$ wavefront set of $u$. In fact, for $r=2$ slightly less than $C^{1,1}$ regularity suffices, and here the results apply to manifolds with bounded Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>Weakly localized states of one dimensional Schrodinger equations have localized energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotics of the Schr\"odinger equation with time-dependent potential in dimension one. Assuming that the potential decays sufficiently rapidly as $|x| \to \infty$, we prove that the solution can be written as the sum of a free wave $e^{-it\Delta} u_+$ and a weakly bound component $u_{\text{wb}}(t)$. Moreover, we show that the weakly bound part decomposes as $u_{\text{wb}}(t) = u_{\text{loc}}(t) + o_{\dot{H}^1}(1)$, where $\partial_x u_\text{loc}(t)$ is localized near the origin uniformly in time. Since decay conditions on the potential do not preclude resonances unless $d \geq 5$, our results can be seen as a natural extension of [Terence Tao. Dynamics of Partial Differential Equations, 5(2), 2008] and [Avy Soffer, Xiaoxu Wu. arXiv:2304.04245] to the lower-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>A study of general reaction-advection-diffusion equations describing dynamics between target, partaker, and guardian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a reaction-advection-diffusion system that models interactions among three actors: a target, a partaker, and a guardian. The framework is versatile, capturing phenomena ranging from the emergence and movement of crime hotspots in urban areas to shifts in public attitudes during critical events as individuals and control units move through space. We prove local and global existence of solutions under realistic assumptions and showcase the model through two applications: protest dynamics driven by new demonstrators joining and escalating hostility in enclosed environments such as classrooms or offices. Numerical simulations highlight the resulting complex spatial patterns and temporal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Parameter Identifiability of RNA Dynamics in PDE Transport Models of Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport and localization of RNA molecules, crucial for cellular function and development, involve a combination of diffusion and active transport mechanisms. Here, we are motivated by understanding the dynamics of RNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) is an experimental technique that is widely used to investigate the dynamics of molecular movement within cells by observing the recovery of fluorescence intensity in a photobleached region over time. To advance the understanding of RNA dynamics, we develop a reaction-diffusion-advection partial differential equation (PDE) model integrating both transport and diffusion mechanisms. We propose a pipeline for identifiability analysis to assess the model's ability to uniquely determine parameter values from observed FRAP data. Based on profile likelihood analysis and reparametrization, we examine the relationship between non- identifiable parameters, which improves the robustness of parameter estimation. We find out that the identifiability of the four parameters of interest is not exactly the same in different regions of the cell. Specifically, transport velocity and diffusion coefficient are identifiable in all regions of the cell, while some combinations of binding rate and unbinding rate are found to be identifiable near the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Hele-Shaw flow with surface tension and kinetic undercooling as a sharp interface limit of a fully parabolic Patlak-Keller-Segel system with nonlinear diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large population limit of the parabolic-parabolic Patlak-Keller-Segel (PKS) system with degenerate, nonlinear diffusion, e.g., of porous medium-type $-\frac{m}{m-1}\mathrm{div}(\rho \nabla \rho^{m-1})$, is studied. We show, asymptotically, a sharp interface develops separating a region containing organisms arranged in a constant-in-time, uniform density from a region without organisms. Under an energy convergence hypothesis, we prove the emergent interface evolves according to a Hele-Shaw free boundary problem with surface tension and kinetic undercooling, and the free boundary satisfies a contact angle-type condition with the fixed boundary.
  Further, we show that, for well-prepared initial data, phase separation in these systems is, roughly, the result of some compatibility between an antiderivative for the population pressure and the convex conjugate of an antiderivative of the chemical destruction kinetics. When compatible, an energy for which the parabolic-parabolic PKS system is a gradient flow is a penalized Modica-Mortola functional.</description>

      <title>Elliptic and Pseudo-Parabolic Gradient System Arising from Anisotropic Image-Denoising with Orientation Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a coupled system of nonlinear elliptic and pseudo-parabolic PDEs arising in anisotropic monochrome image-denoising with an orientation adaptation. This system is motivated by the minimization of a nonconvex energy functional. This study focuses on the treatment of the initial data for the orientation variable. Previous models have not provided explicit procedures or clarified a natural and convincing method for its determination. To resolve this issue, we propose a formulation in which the time derivative of the orientation variable is removed. This enables the initial value to be computed automatically within the equation. This formulation weakens the energy-dissipation property and introduces new challenges in constructing a stable minimization process. Consequently, a different approach from previous works is required. In light of the above, this paper aims to establish the well-posedness and energy-dissipation for our system. The proofs are based on a time-discretization method. The proposed time-discrete scheme determines the initial orientation data and ensures consistency with the continuous model. These results guarantee the stability and effectiveness of the proposed method for numerical implementation and provide a method for determining the initial data of orientation in the time-discretization scheme.</description>

      <title>Stability threshold of close-to-Couette shear flows with no-slip boundary conditions in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a stability threshold theorem for the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the channel, supplemented with the no-slip boundary condition. The initial datum is close to the Couette flow in the following sense: the shear component of the perturbation is small, but independent of the viscosity $\nu$. On the other hand, the $x$-dependent fluctuation is assumed small in a viscosity-dependent sense, namely, $O(\nu^{\frac12}|\log \nu|^{-2})$. Under this setup, we prove nonlinear enhanced dissipation of the vorticity and a time-integrated inviscid damping for the velocity. These stabilizing phenomena guarantee that the Navier-Stokes solution stays close to an evolving shear flow for all time. The analytical challenge stems from a time-dependent nonlocal term that appears in the associated linearized Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of weak solution concepts for mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a connection between weak solution concepts of mean curvature flow. On the one side we have the viscosity solution which is based on the comparison principle. On the other, variational solutions, which are combined Brakke flows and distributional solutions. We prove that if one has a foliation by variational solutions, then the resulting function is the unique viscosity solution.
  This answers an open question suggested by the work of Evans and Spruck [J. Geom. Anal., 5(1), 1995] and the authors [J. Geom. Anal., 34(12), 2024]. These results show that almost every level set of the viscosity solution is a variational solution. Thus, we establish the equivalence of these solution concepts. Moreover, we show the generic uniqueness of variational solutions.</description>

      <title>Intermittent Solutions of the Stationary 2D Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct non-trivial solutions to the stationary dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic equation on the two dimensional torus which lie in $\dot{H}^{-1-\epsilon}(\mathbb{T}^2)$ for every $\epsilon &gt; 0$. Due to the fact that our solutions do not lie in $\dot{H}^{-1/2}(\mathbb{T}^2)$, we must redefine the notion of solution. The main new ingredient is the incorporation of intermittency into the construction of the solutions, which allows for the exponent in the dissipation term to take any value in the interval $(0,2]$ and also ensures that $\Lambda^{-1}\theta \in L^p(\mathbb{T}^2)$ for all $1 \leq p &lt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Fredholm Theory of Non-Elliptic Operators in the Presence of Normally Hyperbolic Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improved Fredholm theory of non-elliptic operators for when the corresponding classical dynamical system exhibits normally hyperbolic trapping with smooth backward and forward trapped sets. It takes place on coisotropic Sobolev spaces with weak regularity at the backward trapped set $\Gamma_u$, which are roughly speaking made of distributions $v \in H^s$ satisfying $\Phi_u v \in H^{s+1}$ for some quantization $\Phi_u$ of the defining function $\phi_u$ of $\Gamma_u$. We then apply it to the case of wave operators on spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet eigenvalue problems for some concave elliptic Hessian operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16748v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate a priori estimates for the solution to the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem for a broad class of concave elliptic Hessian operators of the form \[ F(D^2u)=-\Lambda u \quad \textrm{in} \, \Omega, \qquad u=0 \quad \textrm{on} \, \partial \Omega. \] These operators encompass the Monge-Amp\`ere operator, the $k$-Hessian operators, and the $p$-Monge-Amp\`ere operators. We impose a fairly mild constraint on the operator $F$, allowing us to demonstrate the existence of the first nonzero eigenvalue and its corresponding $\Gamma$-admissible eigenfunction on the smooth, strictly $\Gamma$-convex domain $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$. Furthermore, we prove that the eigenfunction $u_{1}$ belongs to $C^{\infty}(\Omega) \cap C^{1,1}(\overline{\Omega})$. As an application, we prove that every invariant G\r{a}rding-Dirichlet operator admits a unique first nonzero eigenvalue.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a scalar conservation law on the torus in which the flux $\mathbf{j}$ is composed of a Coulomb interaction and a nonlinear mobility: $\mathbf{j} = -u^m\nabla\mathsf{g}\ast u$. We prove existence of entropy solutions and a weak-strong uniqueness principle. We also prove several properties shared among entropy solutions, in particular a lower barrier in the fast diffusion regime $m\lt 1$. In the porous media regime $m\ge 1$, we study the decreasing rearrangement of solutions, which allows to prove an instantaneous growth of the support and a waiting time phenomenon. We also show exponential convergence of the solutions towards the spatial average in several topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To empower the mathematical hitchhiker wishing to use operator methods in geometry and topology, we present this user's guide to first-order elliptic boundary value problems. Existence, regularity, and Fredholmness are discussed for general first-order elliptic operators on manifolds with compact boundary. The focus is on a very general class of elliptic boundary conditions, which contain those that are pseudo-local as a special case, yielding the relative index theorem. A new characterisation of a subclass of elliptic boundary conditions is also given.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet eigenfunction and heat kernel estimates on annular domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by Euclidean boxes, we consider "thin" annular domains of the form $U=(a,b)\times U_0\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ in polar coordinates, where the spherical base $U_0\subseteq \mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ is an inner uniform domain. We show that, with respect to the measure $\varphi_U^2$ determined by the principal Dirichlet Laplacian eigenfunction $\varphi_U$, such annular domains satisfy volume doubling and Poincar\'e inequalities uniformly over all locations and scales. This implies sharp Dirichlet heat kernel estimates expressed in terms of $\varphi_U$. Our results hold uniformly over the collection of all annuli in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We also give matching two-sided bounds for the first Dirichlet Laplacian eigenfunction and eigenvalue for some annular domains including annuli in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Moreover, we prove eigenfunction inequalities for $\varphi_U$ under domain perturbations of $U$. The proofs of our main results utilize eigenfunction comparison techniques due to Lierl and the authors (arXiv:1210.4586, arXiv:2504.18783), small scale $\varphi_U^2$-Poincar\'e inequalities, as well as a discretization technique of Coulhon and Saloff-Coste. Finally, our methods also imply uniform Neumann heat kernel estimates for thin annular domains.</description>

      <title>A unified theory of existence of suitable weak solutions to the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for non-decaying initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider any cover $\mathscr{C}$ of $\mathbb{R}^3$ by balls of radius bigger or equal $1$ satisfying two conditions: (i) any ball intersects at most $\sigma&gt;0$ other balls, and (ii) intersecting balls have comparable sizes. We consider a natural Morrey-type space such that the $L^2_{\mathrm{uloc}}$ setting of Lemari\'e-Rieusset (Recent Developments in the Navier-Stokes Problem, 2002) and the dyadic-type space considered by Bradshaw and Kukavica (J. Math. Fluid Mech., 22(1), 2020) are particular cases. We provide a priori estimates and prove local existence of weak solutions in two cases; first, when there exists $\epsilon&gt;0$ such that $|B|^{1/3} \lesssim |x_B|^{1-\epsilon}$ for all $B\in \mathscr{C}$, where $x_B$ denotes the center of~$B$, or when $|B|^{1/3} \gtrsim 1+ |x_B|$ for all $B\in\mathscr{C}$. In particular, we introduce a new non-divergence-free approach to the construction of weak solutions, which simplifies the existence proof in the $L^2_{\mathrm{uloc}}$ setting. In addition, for the dyadic setting, we do not require vanishing at the spatial infinity. The constructed solutions are suitable in the sense of Caffarelli, Kohn, and Nirenberg, thus allowing an application of the partial regularity theory.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce and study nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations (NLS) with anisotropic dispersion, where the standard Laplacian acts on the Euclidean variable \(x \in \mathbb{R}^d\), and an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck ($\mathcal{OU}$) operator governs the confined direction \(\alpha \in \mathbb{R}\). We consider models with two natural variants of $\mathcal{OU}$-induced confinement: (Model Div) based on the divergence form \(\nabla_\alpha \cdot (e^{-\frac{\alpha^2}{2}} \nabla_\alpha)\), and (Model Non-Div) based on the non-divergence form \(\Delta_\alpha - \alpha \cdot \nabla_\alpha\). For both models, we establish the Strichartz estimates and Gaussian-weighted Morawetz estimates. In addition, for (Model Div), we prove a virial-type finite-time blow-up result; for (Model Non-Div), we establish global well-posedness and small data scattering in the 2D quintic and 3D cubic cases. The primary motivation of this work is to capture waveguide-type dispersive behavior in a Euclidean setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous analysis of NLS with $\mathcal{OU}$ operators in both divergence and non-divergence forms.</description>

      <title>A Morawetz type energy estimate for wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and application to elastic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a modified scaling Morawetz multiplier, which produces a weighted Morawetz type energy (non-negative) estimate for the inhomogeneous wave equation in $\mathbb{R}^2$. With this estimate in hand, an alternative proof of global existence for the Cauchy problem of quasilinear wave equation with small and compactly supported data is given. What is more, such weighted Morawetz type energy estimate also works for certain wave system with multiple speeds, which can be used to prove global existence of some admissible harmonic elastic wave system in $\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove smoothness and interior derivative estimates for viscosity solutions to the special Lagrangian equation with almost negative phases and small enough semi-convexity. We show by example that the range of phases we consider and the semi-convexity condition are sharp. As an application, we find a new Liouville theorem for entire such solutions of the special Lagrangian equation with subcritical phase. We also find effective Hessian estimates with exponential dependence, which we show to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Blow-up rate for the subcritical semilinear heat equation in non-convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the semilinear heat equation $u_t=\Delta u+|u|^{p-1} u$ in possibly non-convex and unbounded domains. Our main result shows the nonexistence of type II blow-up for possibly sign-changing solutions in the energy subcritical range $(n-2)p&lt;n+2$. This resolves a long-standing open question dating back to the 1980s and also deduces the blow-up of the scaling critical norm.</description>

      <title>Energy minimizers in a periodic phase transition model of light-matter interaction in nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we complete the study of global minimizers of a forced, non autonomous, one dimensional, phase transition model, initiated in [8]. Motivated by the recent findings in [9], revealing new configurations of topological structures in light, we consider a forcing term having two periods. We show that depending on the strength of the forcing, at most two thresholds that determine the structure of the minimizers (kinks) are attained. These kinks are now a combination of the previous types encountered in [8], and they may have at most three zeros. The existence of these complex types of phase transition follows from a periodic one dimensional model of matter-light interaction in nematic liquid crystal based on a thin sample limit of the Oseen-Frank energy. We show that the qualitative behaviour of global minimizers is consistent with the original model.</description>

      <title>On the {$L^\infty $} norms of spectral projectors on shrinking intervals: the cases of some spheres of revolution and of the Euclidean disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact Riemannian surface $M$, with Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta$, for $\lambda &gt; 0$, let $P\_{\lambda,\lambda^{-\frac{1}{3}}}$ be the spectral projector on the bandwidth $[\lambda-\lambda^{-\frac{1}{3}}, \lambda + \lambda^{\frac{1}{3}}]$ associated to $\sqrt{-\Delta}$. We prove a polynomial improvement on the $L^2 \to L^{\infty}$ norm of $P\_{\lambda,\lambda^{-\frac{1}{3}}}$ for generic simple spheres of revolution (away from the poles and the equator) and for the Euclidean disk away from its center but up to the boundary. We use the Quantum Integrability of those surfaces to express the norm in terms of a joint basis of eigenfunctions for $\left(\sqrt{-\Delta}, \frac{1}{i}\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta}\right)$. Then, we use that those eigenfunctions are asymptotically Lagrangian oscillatory functions, each supported on a Lagrangian torus with fold-type caustic. Thus, studying the distribution of the caustics, and using BKW decay away from the caustics, we are able to reduce the problem to counting estimates.</description>

      <title>Convergence to equilibrium of weak solutions to the Cahn--Hilliard equation with non-degenerate mobility and singular potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the classical initial and boundary value problem for the Cahn--Hilliard equation with non-degenerate mobility and singular (e.g., logarithmic) potential. We prove that any weak solution converges to a single equilibrium using only minimal assumptions, that is, the existence of a global weak solution which satisfies an energy inequality. This result appears to be new in the literature and also holds in the three-dimensional case, which was an open problem due to the lack of regularity results, especially when the mobility is just a continuous function. We then prove the same result for a Cahn--Hilliard-Navier--Stokes type system with unmatched densities and viscosities proposed by Abels, Garcke, and Gr\"un (Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci. 22, 2012), always assuming a non-degenerate mobility. We expect that this novel method can be used to analyze the same issue for other models where the regularization properties of the solutions are unknown or unlikely.</description>

      <title>Sobolev instability for perturbations of periodic transport equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider linear and time-dependent perturbations of periodic transport equations on the two-dimensional torus. For generic perturbations, we prove the existence of a large class of initial data whose Sobolev norms diverge exponentially fast. In higher dimensions, this remains true under a Morse-Smale assumption on the resonant part of the perturbation. In both cases, this is achieved by a normal form procedure and by studying Sobolev instabilities for time-dependent perturbations of Morse-Smale transport equations. The latter are analyzed on general compact manifolds using techniques from microlocal analysis and hyperbolic dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the blow-up of solutions to a Nakao-type problem with a time-dependent damping term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a semilinear weakly coupled system of wave equations with power nonlinearities. More precisely, we couple (through the nonlinear terms) a wave equation and a damped wave equation with a time-dependent coefficient for the damping term. For the coefficient of the damping term we consider two cases: the scale-invariant case and the scattering producing case. By applying an iteration argument, we get a blow-up result and upper bound estimates for the lifespan of the solutions. In the scale-invariant case, we obtain a shift of the space dimension in the blow-up region for the same weakly coupled system with a classical damping (i.e. with a constant coefficient), while for the scattering producing case we find the same blow-up region as for the classical Nakao problem.</description>

We also prove that any weak solution is bounded under a strong growth assumption.</description>

      <title>A unified relative entropy framework for macroscopic limits of Vlasov--Fokker--Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified relative entropy framework for macroscopic limits of kinetic equations with Riesz-type interactions and Fokker-Planck relaxation. The method combines entropy dissipation, Fisher-information control, and modulated interaction energies into a robust stability theory that yields both strong and weak convergence results. For the strong convergence, we establish quantitative relative entropy estimates toward macroscopic limits under well-prepared data, extending the scope of the method to settings where nonlocal forces and singular scalings play a decisive role. For the weak convergence, we prove that quantitative convergence propagates in bounded Lipschitz topologies, even when the initial relative entropy diverges with respect to the singular scaling parameter. This dual perspective shows that relative entropy provides not only a tool for strong convergence, but also a new mechanism to handle mildly prepared initial states. We establish quantitative convergence toward three prototypical limits: the diffusive limit leading to a drift-diffusion equation, the high-field limit yielding the aggregation equation in the repulsive regime, and the strong magnetic field limit producing a generalized surface quasi-geostrophic equation. The analysis highlights the unifying role of relative entropy in connecting microscopic dissipation with both strong and weak macroscopic convergence.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stationary hollow vortices with surface tension in two dimensions. Such objects are solutions to an overdetermined elliptic free boundary value problem in an exterior domain, where an additional condition involving the mean curvature and the Neumann trace on the boundary is imposed. We prove global rigidity of the circle for small Weber numbers, supporting a conjecture of Crowdy and Wegmann. This elliptic problem describes critical points of the sum of perimeter and the logarithmic potential energy of bounded sets. The variational problem is ill-posed in general, but we recover the global rigidity for small Weber numbers in the class of sets bounded by a Jordan curve. A linear analysis gives precise insights into close-to-circular solutions for both problems.</description>

  We prove that, if $f$ is superlinear and satisfies very weak assumptions, then the Lavrentiev phenomenon does not occur. We underline that our assumptions include the case of non continuous, non convex, and unbounded Lagrangians.</description>

      <title>Formation of clusters and coarsening in weakly interacting diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the clustering behavior of weakly interacting diffusions under the influence of sufficiently localized attractive interaction potentials on the one-dimensional torus. We describe how this clustering behavior is closely related to the presence of discontinuous phase transitions in the mean-field PDE. For local attractive interactions, we employ a new variant of the strict Riesz rearrangement inequality to prove that all global minimizers of the free energy are either uniform or single-cluster states, in the sense that they are symmetrically decreasing.
  We analyze different timescales for the particle system and the mean-field (McKean-Vlasov) PDE, arguing that while the particle system can exhibit coarsening by both coalescence and diffusive mass exchange between clusters, the clusters in the mean-field PDE are unable to move and coarsening occurs via the mass exchange of clusters. By introducing a new model for this mass exchange, we argue that the PDE exhibits dynamical metastability. We conclude by presenting careful numerical experiments that demonstrate the validity of our model.</description>

      <title>The complex Ginzburg-Landau equation on a finite interval and chaos suppression via a finite-dimensional boundary feedback stabilizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness and boundary stabilization of the initial-boundary value problem for the complex Ginzburg-Landau (CGL) equation on a finite interval. First, we establish a local well-posedness theory for the open loop model in $L^2$-based fractional Sobolev spaces in the case of Dirichlet-Neumann type inhomogeneous mixed boundary conditions. This local well-posedness result is based on linear estimates derived by using the weak solution formula obtained via the unified transform (also known as the Fokas method). Next, we study the global well-posedness properties of the open loop model in presence of inhomogeneous boundary conditions. Then, we turn our attention to the rapid boundary feedback stabilization problem and design a nonlocal controller which uses a finite number of Fourier modes of the state of solution. This design relies on the fact that solutions of the CGL equation can be separated into a slow, finite-dimensional component and a rapidly decaying tail, with the former primarily governing long-term behavior. We determine the necessary number of modes required to stabilize the system at a specified rate. Additionally, we identify the minimum number of modes that ensure stabilization at an unspecified decay rate. These theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations. The spatiotemporal estimates established in the first part of the paper are also employed to obtain local solutions of the controlled system. The existence of global energy solutions follows from stabilization estimates, while uniqueness follows from the uniqueness of an associated initial-boundary value problem with homogeneous boundary conditions whose solutions are in correspondence with the solutions of the original system through a bounded invertible Volterra-type integral transform on Sobolev spaces.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, we prove the existence of a positive and essentially bounded solution to a Lichnerowicz equation in the Einstein-scalar field theory on a closed manifold with non-constant mean curvature. In particular, the non-constant mean curvature gives rise to supercritical terms in the equation, on top of singular ones. We employ a recent fixed-point argument, which involves sub- and supersolutions. Additionally, we provide several conditions on the coefficients in the equation that prevent the existence of positive classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Flat Standing Sphere Blow-up Solutions for the Nonlinear Heat Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence of a singular standing sphere blow-up solution for the nonlinear heat equation with radial symmetry. This solution develops a finite-time singularity on a fixed-radius sphere and exhibits a flat blow-up profile. Our construction refines the method developed by Merle and Zaag \cite{MZJEMS24} which reduces the infinite-dimensional dynamics to a finite-dimensional problem in radial case.

      <title>Asymptotic stability of solitary waves for the 1D focusing cubic Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17763v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the full asymptotic stability of solitary wave solutions for the 1D focusing cubic Schr\"odinger equation on the line under small perturbations in weighted Sobolev spaces, building upon our results in [58]. The proof integrates the space-time resonances approach, based on the distorted Fourier transform, with modulation techniques to show modified scattering for the radiation term and convergence for the modulation parameters. A key challenge throughout the nonlinear analysis is the slow local decay of the radiation term, caused by threshold resonances in the linearized operator. The presence of favorable null structures in the quadratic nonlinearities mitigates this problem through the use of normal form transformations. Another essential step in the proof involves developing a variant of the local smoothing estimate that incorporates a moving center.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \Subset \C^n$ be a bounded strongly pseudoconvex domain. For any concave increasing weight $\chi : \R^- \longrightarrow \R^-$ such that $\chi(0) = 0$, we introduce and study finite energy classes $\mathcal E_\chi(\Omega)$ of plurisubharmonic functions, using the Orlicz space formalism. We investigate the range of the Monge-Amp\`ere operator on these classes, and conjecture that this should lead to an integral characterization of the image of bounded plurisubharmonic functions, an open problem since the birth of Pluripotential Theory more than forty years ago.</description>

      <title>Free energy Wasserstein gradient flow and their particle counterparts: toy model, (degenerate) PL inequalities and exit times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In finite dimension, the long-time and metastable behavior of a gradient flow perturbated by a small Brownian noise is well understood. A similar situation arises when a Wasserstein gradient flow over a space of probability measure is approximated by a system of mean-field interacting particles, but classical results do not apply in these infinite-dimensional settings. This work is concerned with the situation where the objective function of the optimization problem contains an entropic penalization, so that the particle system is a Langevin diffusion process. We consider a very simple class of models, for which the infinite-dimensional behavior is fully characterized by a finite-dimensional process. The goal is to have a flexible class of benchmarks to fix some objectives, conjectures and (counter-)examples for the general situation. Inspired by the systematic study of these toy models, one application is presented on the continuous Curie-Weiss model in a symmetric double-well potential. We show that, at the critical temperature, although the $N$-particle Gibbs measure does not satisfy a uniform-in-$N$ standard log-Sobolev inequality (the optimal constant growing like $\sqrt{N}$), it does satisfy a more general Lojasiewicz inequality uniformly in $N$, inducing uniform polynomial long-time convergence rates, propagation of chaos at stationarity and uniformly in time, and creation of chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In terms of initial data, a sufficient condition for the smoothness of the solution to the Cauchy problem for one-dimensional relativistic cold plasma equations over any given time interval is found. Unlike the non-relativistic case, such sufficient conditions take into account the smallness properties of not only the derivatives of the initial data but also the initial data themselves. The accuracy of the obtained initial condition is investigated using a numerical experiment. The structure of the emerging singularities is also studied.</description>

      <title>Trace Regularity PINNs: Enforcing $\mathrm{H}^{\frac{1}{2}}(\partial \Omega)$ for Boundary Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an enhanced physics-informed neural network (PINN), the Trace Regularity Physics-Informed Neural Network (TRPINN), which enforces the boundary loss in the Sobolev-Slobodeckij norm $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$, the correct trace space associated with $H^1(\Omega)$. We reduce computational cost by computing only the theoretically essential portion of the semi-norm and enhance convergence stability by avoiding denominator evaluations in the discretization. By incorporating the exact $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$ norm, we show that the approximation converges to the true solution in the $H^{1}(\Omega)$ sense, and, through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we demonstrate that TRPINN can converge faster than standard PINNs. Numerical experiments on the Laplace equation with highly oscillatory Dirichlet boundary conditions exhibit cases where TRPINN succeeds even when standard PINNs fail, and show performance improvements of one to three decimal digits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the asymptotic properties of non-autonomous Lagrangian systems, assuming that the associated Tonelli Lagrangian converges to a time-periodic function. Specifically, given a continuous initial condition, we provide a suitable construction of a Lax-Oleinik semigroup such that it converges toward a periodic solution of the equation. Moreover, the graph of its gradient converges as time tends to infinity to the graph of the gradient of the periodic limit function with respect to the Hausdorff distance. Finally, we apply this result to a Kuramoto-type model, proving the existence of an invariant torus given by the graph of the gradient of the limiting periodic solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a spectral and semigroup theory for Laplacians on directed hypergraphs, a setting where classical Markovian and symmetry principles of graph Laplacians break down. This framework reveals new phenomena: the heat flow may lose positivity, stochasticity, or diagonal dominance, yet regain them asymptotically under precise combinatorial conditions. We derive spectral bounds, characterize eventual positivity and contractivity in $\infty$-norm, and identify the rare cases where the flow remains Markovian. Several examples -- culminating in hypergraphs that are dual of oriented graphs as well as directed realizations of the Fano plane - highlight the genuinely higher-order nature of these dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Cauchy problem associated with the stochastic hyperbolic Keller-Segel (SHKS) equation featuring multiplicative noises on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$. First, we establish the local existence and uniqueness of pathwise solutions to the SHKS equation within Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{T}^d)$ for $s&gt;\frac{d}{2}+1$, under appropriate regularity conditions imposed on the nonlinear multiplicative noises. Subsequently, we explore two global results pertaining to noise-induced regularization: (1) The first result demonstrates that for polynomial-type nonlinear noises, when the noise intensity parameters meet specific threshold conditions, the SHKS equation possesses a unique pathwise solution for large initial data with probability one. This finding provides a partial answer to a question that has remained unresolved in the deterministic setting; (2) The second result reveals that, for small initial data, or equivalently when dealing with linear multiplicative noises with sufficiently large intensity (allowed to be negative), the SHKS equation admits a unique pathwise solution with high probability.</description>

Abstract: We show the validity of Nachman's procedure (Ann.

We also obtain a log-type stability estimate for the inverse problem when $\gamma$ has slightly higher regularity, i.e., $\gamma \in W^{2-s,n/s}(\Omega)$ for $0 &lt; s &lt;1/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a Riemannian manifold with or without boundary, and whether bounded or unbounded, we consider a semilinear wave (or Klein-Gordon) equation with a subcritical nonlinearity (either defocusing or focusing). We establish local controllability around a partially analytic solution, under the Geometric Control Condition. Specifically, some blow-up solutions can be controlled. In the case of a Klein-Gordon equation on a non-trapping exterior domain of small dimension, we prove the null-controllability of scattering solutions. The proof is based on local energy decay and global-in-time Strichartz estimates. Several consequences are presented, including the null-controllability of a solution initiated near the ground state in some focusing cases, and exact controllability in some defocusing cases.</description>

Abstract: Generalized Wasserstein distances allow to quantitatively compare two continuous or atomic mass distributions with equal or different total mass. In this paper, we propose four numerical methods for the approximation of three different generalized Wasserstein distances introduced in the last years, giving some insights about their physical meaning. After that, we explore their usage in the context of the sensitivity analysis of differential models for traffic flow. The quantification of models sensitivity is obtained by computing the generalized Wasserstein distances between two (numerical) solutions corresponding to different inputs, including different boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Global Hypoellipticity and Solvability with Loss of Derivatives on the Torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17466v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete characterization of global hypoellipticity and solvability with loss of derivatives for Fourier multiplier operators on the $n$-dimensional torus. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for these properties and examine their connections with classical notions of global hypoellipticity and solvability, particularly in relation to the closedness of the operator's range.
  As an application, we explore the interplay between these properties and number theory in the context of differential operators on the two-torus. Specifically, we prove that the loss of derivatives in the solvability of the vector field $\partial_{x_1} - \alpha \partial_{x_2}$ is precisely determined by the well-known irrationality measure $\mu(\alpha)$ of its coefficient $\alpha$. Furthermore, we analyze the wave operator $\partial_{x_1}^2 - \eta^2 \Delta_{\mathbb{T}^n}$ and show how the loss of derivatives depends explicitly on the parameter $\eta &gt; 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The solution of constrained linear partial-differential equations can be described via parametric representations of linear relations. To study these representations, we provide a novel definition of boundary triplets for linear relations in range representations where the associated boundary map is defined on the domain of the parameterizing operators rather than the relation itself. This allows us to characterize all boundary conditions such that the underlying dynamics is represented by a self-adjoint, skew-adjoint or maximally dissipative relation. The theoretical results are applied to a class of implicit port-Hamiltonian systems on one-dimensional spatial domains. More precisely, we explicitly construct a boundary triplet which solely depends on the coefficient matrices of the involved matrix differential operators and we derive the associated Lagrangian subspace. We exemplify our approach by means of the Dzektser equation, the biharmonic wave equation, and an elastic rod with non-local elasticity condition.</description>

      <title>Regularity of the global attractor for the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on channel-like domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The regularity of the global attractor of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations for flows on two-dimensional domains is considered. It is assumed that domain $\Omega$ is a channel-like domain, i.e an arbitrary bounded or unbounded domain, at first without any regularity assumption on its boundary, with the only assumption that the Poincar\'e inequality holds on it. The phase space $H$ for the system is the usual closure in the $L^2(\Omega)^2$ norm of the space of smooth divergent-free vector-fields with compact support in $\Omega.$ The corresponding space obtained as the closure with respect to the $H^1(\Omega)^2$ norm is denoted by $V.$ The forcing term is assumed to belong to dual space $V'.$ It is known in this case that the global attractor exists in the phase space $H.$ It is shown in this work that the global attractor is also a compact set in $V$, and that due to the regularization effect of the equations, the solutions converge to the attractor in the norm of $V$, uniformly for initial conditions bounded in $H$. Moreover, it is shown that if the forcing term belongs to $D(A^{-s})$, for some $0&lt;s\leq 1/2$, where $A$ is the Stokes operator, then the global attractor is compact in $D(A^{-s+1})$. If the forcing term is in $H,$ corresponding to the limit case $s=0,$ then it is further assumed that the domain is either a uniformly $\Ccal^{1,1}$ smooth domain or a bounded Lipschitz domain in order to obtain that the global attractor is compact in $D(A).$</description>

Abstract: Let $G(z)=G(z;\tau)$ be the Green function on the flat torus $E_{\tau}=\mathbb{C}/(\mathbb{Z}+\mathbb{Z}\tau)$ with the singularity at $0$. Lin and Wang (Ann. Math. 2010) proved that $G(z)$ has either $3$ or $5$ critical points (depending on the choice of $\tau$). Later, Bergweiler and Eremenko (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 2016) gave a new proof of this remarkable result by using anti-holomorphic dynamics.
  In this paper, firstly, we prove that once $G(z)$ has $5$ critical points, then these $5$ critical points are all non-degenerate. Secondly, we study the sum of two Green functions which can be reduced to $G_p(z):=\frac12(G(z+p)+G(z-p))$. We prove that for any $p$ satisfying $p\neq -p$ in $E_{\tau}$, the number of critical points of $G_p(z)$ belongs to $\{4,6,8,10\}$ (depending on the choice of $(\tau, p)$) and each number really occurs. We apply Hitchin's formula (J. Differ. Geom. 1995) in a surprising way to prove the generic non-degeneracy of critical points. This allows us to study the distribution of the numbers of critical points of $G_p(z)$ as $p$ varies. Applications to the curvature equation $\Delta u+e^{u}=4\pi(\delta_{p}+\delta_{-p})$ on $E_{\tau}$ are also given, and how the geometry of the torus affects the solution structure is studied.</description>

      <title>Blow-up criteria for the semilinear parabolic equations driven by mixed local-nonlocal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to establish \emph{necessary and sufficient conditions} for the nonexistence of a global solution to the semilinear heat equation with a mixed local--nonlocal operator $ -\Delta + (-\Delta)^\sigma$, under a general time-dependent nonlinearity. Our results complement the recent work of Carhuas-Torre et al. [ArXiv, (2025), arXiv:2505.20401], in which the authors provide sufficient conditions for the existence and nonexistence of global solutions. In particular, our results recover the critical Fujita exponent for time-independent power-type nonlinearities, as obtained by Biagi et al. [Bull. London Math. Soc. (2024), 1--20] and Del Pezzo et al. [Nonlinear Anal. 255 (2025), 113761].</description>

      <title>Accelerated and fast magnetic reconnection through enhanced resistive dissipation for MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the phenomenon of magnetic reconnection, namely a change in the topology of magnetic lines, for sufficiently regular solutions of the three-dimensional periodic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. We provide examples where magnetic reconnection occurs on time scales shorter than the resistive one, due to enhanced dissipation emerging from advective effects. This is the first analytical result where the advection term plays an active role in the reconnection process. A key aspect of our approach is a new estimate for enhanced diffusion of high Sobolev norms, which is of independent interest beyond its application to the MHD equations.</description>

      <title>Swarming models with specular boundary condition and environmental noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a general class of models for swarming/self-collective behaviour in domains with boundaries. The model is expressed as a stochastic system of interacting particles subject to both reflecting boundary condition and common environmental noise. We rigorously derive its corresponding macroscopic mean-field equation, which is a new type of stochastic partial differential equation due to the presence of common noise. The approach relies on a compactness argument, in which we first establish the tightness of the empirical measures associated with the particle system and then demonstrate that the time marginal of the limit measure is a solution to the mean-field equation.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal approximation of minimal surfaces: optimal estimates from stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimal surfaces in closed 3-manifolds are classically constructed via the Almgren-Pitts approach. The Allen-Cahn approximation has proved to be a powerful alternative, and Chodosh and Mantoulidis (in Ann. Math. 2020) used it to give a new proof of Yau's conjecture for generic metrics and establish the multiplicity one conjecture. The primary goal of this paper is to set the ground for a new approximation based on nonlocal minimal surfaces. More precisely, we prove that if $\partial E$ is a stable $s$-minimal surface in $B_1\subset \mathbb R^3$ then:
  - $\partial E\cap B_{1/2}$ enjoys a $C^{2,\alpha}$ estimate that is robust as $s\uparrow 1$ (i.e. uniform in $s$);
  - the distance between different connected components of~$\partial E\cap B_{1/2}$ must be at least of order~$(1-s)^{\frac 1 2}$ (optimal sheet separation estimate);
  - interactions between multiple sheets at distances of order $(1-s)^{\frac 1 2}$ are described by the D\'avila--del Pino--Wei system. A second important goal of the paper is to establish that hyperplanes are the only stable $s$-minimal hypersurfaces in $\mathbb R^4$, for $s\in(0,1)$ sufficiently close to $1$. This is done by exploiting suitable modifications of the results described above. In this application, it is crucially used that our curvature and separations estimates hold without any assumption on area bounds (in contrast to the analogous estimates for Allen-Cahn).</description>

      <title>Frozen Gaussian approximation for the fractional Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18287v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a refined Frozen Gaussian approximation (FGA) for the fractional Schr\"odinger equation in the semi-classical regime, where the solution exhibits rapid oscillations as the scaled Planck constant $\varepsilon$ becomes small. Our approach utilizes an integral representation based on asymptotic analysis, offering a highly efficient computational framework for high-frequency wave function evolution. Crucially, we introduce the momentum space representation of the FGA and a regularization parameter $\delta$ to address singularities in the higher-order derivatives of the Hamiltonian flow coefficients, which are typically assumed to be second-order differentiable or smooth in conventional analysis. We rigorously prove convergence of the method to the true solution and provide numerical experiments that demonstrate its precision and robust convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>Many facets of cohomology: Differential complexes and structure-aware formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22813v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexes and cohomology, traditionally central to topology, have emerged as fundamental tools across applied mathematics and the sciences. This survey explores their roles in diverse areas, from partial differential equations and continuum mechanics to reformulations of the Einstein equations and network theory. Motivated by advances in compatible and structure-preserving discretisation such as Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC), we examine how differential complexes encode critical properties such as existence, uniqueness, stability and rigidity of solutions to differential equations. We demonstrate that various fundamental concepts and models in solid and fluid mechanics are essentially formulated in terms of differential complexes.</description>

      <title>Barron Space Representations for Elliptic PDEs with Homogeneous Boundary Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the approximation complexity of high-dimensional second-order elliptic PDEs with homogeneous boundary conditions on the unit hypercube, within the framework of Barron spaces. Under the assumption that the coefficients belong to suitably defined Barron spaces, we prove that the solution can be efficiently approximated by two-layer neural networks, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. Our results demonstrate the expressive power of shallow networks in capturing high-dimensional PDE solutions under appropriate structural assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the CR Yamabe type equation \begin{align}
  \Delta_b u+F(u)=0 \nonumber
  \end{align} on complete noncompact $(2n+1)$-dimensional Sasakian manifolds with nonnegative curvature. Under some assumptions, we prove a rigidity result, that is, the manifold is CR isometric to Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^n$. The proofs are based on the Jerison-Lee's differential identity combining with integral estimates.</description>
