      <title>Multi-block chemometric approaches to the unsupervised spectral classification of geological samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the potential use of multi-block chemometric methods to provide improved unsupervised classification of compositionally complex materials through the integration of multi-modal spectrometric data sets (one XRF, two NIR, and two FT-Raman) was tested. We concluded that multi-block HPLS models are effective at combining multi-modal spectrometric data to provide a more comprehensive classification of compositionally complex samples, and VIP can reduce HPLS model complexity, while increasing its data interpretability.</description>

      <title>A foundation model enpowered by a multi-modal prompt engine for universal seismic geobody interpretation across surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic geobody interpretation is crucial for structural geology studies and various engineering applications. Existing deep learning methods show promise but lack support for multi-modal inputs and struggle to generalize to different geobody types or surveys. We introduce a promptable foundation model for interpreting any geobodies across seismic surveys. This model integrates a pre-trained vision foundation model (VFM) with a sophisticated multi-modal prompt engine. The VFM, pre-trained on massive natural images and fine-tuned on seismic data, provides robust feature extraction for cross-survey generalization. The prompt engine incorporates multi-modal prior information to iteratively refine geobody delineation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's superior accuracy, scalability from 2D to 3D, and generalizability to various geobody types, including those unseen during training. To our knowledge, this is the first highly scalable and versatile multi-modal foundation model capable of interpreting any geobodies across surveys while supporting real-time interactions. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for geoscientific data interpretation, with broad potential for transfer to other tasks.</description>

      <title>Seismic monitoring of CO2 plume dynamics using ensemble Kalman filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring carbon dioxide (CO2) injected and stored in subsurface reservoirs is critical for avoiding failure scenarios and enables real-time optimization of CO2 injection rates. Sequential Bayesian data assimilation (DA) is a statistical method for combining information over time from multiple sources to estimate a hidden state, such as the spread of the subsurface CO2 plume. An example of scalable and efficient sequential Bayesian DA is the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF). We improve upon existing DA literature in the seismic-CO2 monitoring domain by applying this scalable DA algorithm to a high-dimensional CO2 reservoir using two-phase flow dynamics and time-lapse full waveform seismic data with a realistic surface-seismic survey design. We show more accurate estimates of the CO2 saturation field using the EnKF compared to using either the seismic data or the fluid physics alone. Furthermore, we test a range of values for the EnKF hyperparameters and give guidance on their selection for seismic CO2 reservoir monitoring.</description>

      <title>Seven decades of exploring planetary interiors with rotating convection experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interiors of many planets consist mostly of fluid layers. When these layers are subject to superadiabatic temperature or compositional gradients, turbulent convection transports heat and momentum. In addition, planets are fast rotators. Thus, the key process that underpins planetary evolution, the dynamo action, flow patterns and more, is rotating convection. Because planetary interiors are inaccessible to direct observation, experiments offer physically consistent models that are crucial to guide our understanding. If we can fully understand the laboratory model, we may eventually fully understand the original. Experimentally reproducing rotating thermal convection relevant to planetary interiors comes with specific challenges, e.g. modelling the central gravity field of a planet that is parallel to the temperature gradient. Three classes of experiments tackle this challenge. One approach consists of using an alternative central force field, such as the electric force. These are, however, weaker than gravity and require going to space. Another method entails rotating the device fast enough so that the centrifugal force supersedes Earth's gravity. This mimics the equatorial regions of a planet. Lastly, by using the actual lab gravity aligned with the rotation axis, insight into the polar regions is gained. These experiments have been continuously refined during the past seven decades. We review their evolution, from the early days of visualising the onset patterns of convection, over central force field experiments in spacecrafts, liquid metal experiments, to the latest optical velocity mapping of rotating magnetoconvection in sulfuric acid inside high-field magnets. We show how innovative experimental design and emerging experimental techniques advanced our understanding and painted a more realistic picture of planetary interiors, including Earth's liquid metal outer core.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation of Structural Orientation Parameters and 2D/3D Local Anisotropic Tikhonov Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the orientation of geological structures is crucial for analyzing the complexity of the Earths' subsurface. For instance, information about geological structure orientation can be incorporated into local anisotropic regularization methods as a valuable tool to stabilize the solution of inverse problems and produce geologically plausible solutions. We introduce a new variational method that employs the alternating direction method of multipliers within an alternating minimization scheme to jointly estimate orientation and model parameters in both 2D and 3D inverse problems. Specifically, the proposed approach adaptively integrates recovered information about structural orientation, enhancing the effectiveness of anisotropic Tikhonov regularization in recovering geophysical parameters. The paper also discusses the automatic tuning of algorithmic parameters to maximize the new method's performance. The proposed algorithm is tested across diverse 2D and 3D examples, including structure-oriented denoising and trace interpolation. The results show that the algorithm is robust in solving the considered large and challenging problems, alongside efficiently estimating the associated tilt field in 2D cases and the dip, strike, and tilt fields in 3D cases. Synthetic and field examples show that the proposed anisotropic regularization method produces a model with enhanced resolution and provides a more accurate representation of the true structures.</description>

      <title>Urban Sensing Using Existing Fiber-Optic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of urban seismic sources offers valuable insights into urban environments, including seismic hazards, infrastructure conditions, human mobility, and cultural life. Yet, accurate detection and localization of seismic sources at the urban scale with conventional seismic sensing networks is unavailable due to the prohibitive costs of ultra-dense seismic arrays required for imaging high-frequency anthropogenic seismic sources. Here, we leverage existing fiber-optic networks as a distributed acoustic sensing system to accurately locate urban seismic sources and estimate how their intensity varies with time. By repurposing a 50-kilometer telecommunication fiber into an ultra-dense seismic array with 50,000 channels, we generate high-resolution spatiotemporal maps of seismic source power (SSP) across San Jose, California. Our approach overcomes the proximity limitations of urban seismic sensing, enabling accurate localization of remote seismic sources generated by urban activities. Examples of detected activities are vehicle movements and operations at construction sites and schools. We also show strong correlations between SSP values and noise level measurements, as well as various persistent urban features, including point of interest density, land use patterns, and demographics. Our study shows how spatiotemporal SSP maps can be turned into novel urban data that effectively captures urban dynamics across multiple features, thus opening the way towards the use of fiber-optic networks as a ubiquitous and general-purpose urban sensing platform, with wide-ranging applications in urban and environmental studies.</description>

      <title>Statistical Characteristics of the Proton Isotropy Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using particle data from the ELFIN satellites, we present a statistical study of 284 proton isotropy boundary events on the nightside magnetosphere, characterizing their occurrence and distribution in local time, latitude (L-shell), energy, and precipitating energy flux, as a function of geomagnetic activity. For a given charged particle species and energy, its isotropy boundary (IB) is the magnetic latitude poleward of which persistently isotropic pitch-angle distributions ($J_{prec}/J_{perp}\sim 1$) are first observed to occur. This isotropization is interpreted as resulting from magnetic field-line curvature (FLC) scattering in the equatorial magnetosphere. We find that proton IBs are observed under all observed activity levels, spanning 16 to 05 MLT with $\sim$100% occurrence between 19 and 03 MLT, trending toward 60% at dawn/dusk. These results are also compared with electron IB properties observed using ELFIN, where we find similar trends across local time and activity, with the onset in $\geq$50 keV proton IB occurring on average 2 L-shells lower, and providing between 3 and 10 times as much precipitating power. Proton IBs typically span $64^\circ$-$66^\circ$ in magnetic latitude (5-6 in L-shell), corresponding to the outer edge of the ring current, tending toward lower IGRF latitudes as geomagnetic activity increases. The IBs were found to commonly occur 0.3-2.1 Re beyond the plasmapause. Proton IBs typically span $&lt;$50 keV to $\sim$1 MeV in energy, maximizing near 22 MLT, and decreasing to a typical upper limit of 300-400 keV toward dawn and dusk, with peak observed isotropic energy increasing by $\sim$500 keV during active intervals. These results suggest that FLC in the vicinity of IBs can provide a substantial depletion mechanism for energetic protons, with the total nightside precipitating power from FLC-scattering found to be on the order of 100 MW, at times $\geq$10 GW.</description>

      <title>Online learning of eddy-viscosity and backscattering closures for geophysical turbulence using ensemble Kalman inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different approaches to using data-driven methods for subgrid-scale closure modeling have emerged recently. Most of these approaches are data-hungry, and lack interpretability and out-of-distribution generalizability. Here, we use {online} learning to address parametric uncertainty of well-known physics-based large-eddy simulation (LES) closures: the Smagorinsky (Smag) and Leith eddy-viscosity models (1 free parameter) and the Jansen-Held (JH) backscattering model (2 free parameters). For 8 cases of 2D geophysical turbulence, optimal parameters are estimated, using ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI), such that for each case, the LES' energy spectrum matches that of direct numerical simulation (DNS). Only a small training dataset is needed to calculate the DNS spectra (i.e., the approach is {data-efficient}). We find the optimized parameter(s) of each closure to be constant across broad flow regimes that differ in dominant length scales, eddy/jet structures, and dynamics, suggesting that these closures are {generalizable}. In a-posteriori tests based on the enstrophy spectra and probability density functions (PDFs) of vorticity, LES with optimized closures outperform the baselines (LES with standard Smag, dynamic Smag or Leith), particularly at the tails of the PDFs (extreme events). In a-priori tests, the optimized JH significantly outperforms the baselines and optimized Smag and Leith in terms of interscale enstrophy and energy transfers (still, optimized Smag noticeably outperforms standard Smag). The results show the promise of combining advances in physics-based modeling (e.g., JH) and data-driven modeling (e.g., {online} learning with EKI) to develop data-efficient frameworks for accurate, interpretable, and generalizable closures.</description>

      <title>Vortex structures under dimples and scars in turbulent free-surface flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence beneath a free surface leaves characteristic long-lived signatures on the surface, such as upwelling 'boils', near-circular 'dimples' and elongated 'scars', easily identifiable by eye, e.g., in riverine flows. In this paper, we use Direct Numerical Simulations to explore the connection between these surface signatures and the underlying vortical structures. We investigate dimples, known to be imprints of surface-attached vortices, and scars, which have yet to be extensively studied, by analysing the conditional probabilities that a point beneath a signature is within a vortex core as well as the inclination angles of sub-signature vorticity. The analysis shows that the likelihood of vortex presence beneath a dimple decreases from the surface down through the viscous and blockage layers in a near-Gaussian manner, influenced by the dimple's size and the bulk turbulence. When expressed as a function of depth over the Taylor microscale $\lambda_T$, this probability is independent of Reynolds and Weber number. Conversely, the probability of finding a vortex beneath a scar increases sharply from the surface to a peak at the edge of the viscous layer, at a depth of approximately $\lambda_T/4$. Distributions of vortical orientation also show a clear pattern: a strong preference for vertical alignment below dimples and an equally strong preference for horizontal alignment below scars. Our findings suggest that scars can be defined as imprints of horizontal vortices approximately a quarter of the Taylor microscale beneath the surface, analogous to how dimples can be defined as imprints of surface-attached vertical vortex tubes.</description>

      <title>Ice viscosity governs hydraulic fracture that causes rapid drainage of supraglacial lakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full thickness crevasses can transport water from the glacier surface to the bedrock where high water pressures can open kilometre-long cracks along the basal interface, which can accelerate glacier flow. We present a first computational modelling study that describes time-dependent fracture propagation in an idealised glacier causing rapid supraglacial lake drainage. A novel two-scale numerical method is developed to capture the elastic and viscoelastic deformations of ice along with crevasse propagation. The fluid-conserving thermo-hydro-mechanical model incorporates turbulent fluid flow and accounts for melting/refreezing in fractures. Applying this model to observational data from a 2008 rapid lake drainage event indicates that viscous deformation exerts a much stronger control on hydrofracture propagation compared to thermal effects. This finding contradicts the conventional assumption that elastic deformation is adequate to describe fracture propagation in glaciers over short timescales (minutes to several hours) and instead demonstrates that viscous deformation must be considered to reproduce observations of lake drainage rate and local ice surface elevation change. As supraglacial lakes continue expanding inland and as Greenland Ice Sheet temperatures become warmer than -8 degree C, our results suggest rapid lake drainages are likely to occur without refreezing, which has implications for the rate of sea level rise.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic solutions for self-similar fault slip induced by fluid injection at constant rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the circular, self-similar expansion of frictional rupture due to fluid injected at a constant volumetric rate. Fluid injection occurs at a point on the fault and fluid migration occurs within a thin, relatively permeable layer containing and parallel to the fault plane. For the particular case when the Poisson ratio $\nu=0$, self-similarity of the fluid pressure profile implies that fault slip will also evolve in an axisymmetric, self-similar manner, reducing the three-dimensional problem for the spatiotemporal evolution of fault slip to a single self-similar dimension. The rupture radius grows as $\lambda \sqrt{4\alpha_{hy} t}$ , where $t$ is time since the start of injection, $\alpha_{hy}$ is the hydraulic diffusivity of the pore fluid pressure, and $\lambda$ is a prefactor determined by a single parameter, $T$, which depends on the pre-injection stress state and injection conditions. The prefactor has the range $0&lt;\lambda&lt;\infty$, where the lower and upper limits of $\lambda$ correspond to, respectively marginal pressurization of the fault and critically stressed conditions, in which the fault-resolved shear stress is close to the pre-injection fault strength. In both limits of $\lambda$, we derive solutions for the slip by perturbation expansion, to arbitrary order. In the marginally pressurized limit, the perturbation is regular and the series expansion is convergent. For the critically stressed limit, the perturbation is singular, the solution for slip contains a boundary layer and an outer solution, and the series expansion is divergent. In the critically stressed case, we perform a matched asymptotic expansion to provide a composite solution with uniform convergence over the entire rupture. The leading order of these solutions was recently used by S\'aez et al. [2022] to verify three-dimensional boundary-element solutions in the limit $\nu=0$.</description>
