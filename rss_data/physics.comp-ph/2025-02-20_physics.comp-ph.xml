      <title>Probing the ideal limit of interfacial thermal conductance in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing the ideal limit of interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) in two-dimensional (2D) heterointerfaces is of paramount importance for assessing heat dissipation in 2D-based nanoelectronics. Using graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (Gr/$h$-BN), a structurally isomorphous heterostructure with minimal mass contrast, as a prototype, we develop an accurate yet highly efficient machine-learned potential (MLP) model, which drives nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations on a realistically large system with over 300,000 atoms, enabling us to report the ideal limit range of ITC for 2D heterostructures at room temperature. We further unveil an intriguing stacking-sequence-dependent ITC hierarchy in the Gr/$h$-BN heterostructure, which can be connected to moir\'e patterns and is likely universal in van der Waals layered materials. The underlying atomic-level mechanisms can be succinctly summarized as energy-favorable stacking sequences facilitating out-of-plane phonon energy transmission. This work demonstrates that MLP-driven MD simulations can serve as a new paradigm for probing and understanding thermal transport mechanisms in 2D heterostructures and other layered materials.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the Woodcock Particle Tracking Method Using Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The acceptance rate in Woodcock tracking algorithm is generalized to an arbitrary position-dependent variable $q(x)$. A neural network is used to optimize $q(x)$, and the FOM value is used as the loss function. This idea comes from physics informed neural network(PINN), where a neural network is used to represent the solution of differential equations. Here the neural network $q(x)$ should solve the functional equations that optimize FOM. For a 1d transmission problem with Gaussian absorption cross section, we observe a significant improvement of the FOM value compared to the constant $q$ case and the original Woodcock method. Generalizations of the neural network Woodcock(NNW) method to 3d voxel models are waiting to be explored.</description>

      <title>Extending the RANGE of Graph Neural Networks: Relaying Attention Nodes for Global Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are routinely used in molecular physics, social sciences, and economics to model many-body interactions in graph-like systems. However, GNNs are inherently local and can suffer from information flow bottlenecks. This is particularly problematic when modeling large molecular systems, where dispersion forces and local electric field variations drive collective structural changes. Existing solutions face challenges related to computational cost and scalability. We introduce RANGE, a model-agnostic framework that employs an attention-based aggregation-broadcast mechanism that significantly reduces oversquashing effects, and achieves remarkable accuracy in capturing long-range interactions at a negligible computational cost. Notably, RANGE is the first virtual-node message-passing implementation to integrate attention with positional encodings and regularization to dynamically expand virtual representations. This work lays the foundation for next-generation of machine-learned force fields, offering accurate and efficient modeling of long-range interactions for simulating large molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Based Optimization of Core-Shell Particles with Discrete Materials for Directional Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing nanophotonic structures traditionally grapples with the complexities of discrete parameters, such as real materials, often resorting to costly global optimization methods. This paper introduces an approach that leverages generative deep learning to map discrete parameter sets into a continuous latent space, enabling direct gradient-based optimization. For scenarios with non-differentiable physics evaluation functions, a neural network is employed as a differentiable surrogate model. The efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated by optimizing the directional scattering properties of core-shell nanoparticles composed of a selection of realistic materials. We derive suggestions for core-shell geometries with strong forward scattering and minimized backscattering. Our findings reveal significant improvements in computational efficiency and performance when compared to global optimization techniques. Beyond nanophotonics design problems, this framework holds promise for broad applications across all types of inverse problems constrained by discrete variables.</description>

      <title>A Graph Neural Network Simulation of Dispersed Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that accurately simulates a multidisperse suspension of interacting spherical particles. Our machine learning framework is built upon the recent work of Sanchez-Gonzalez et al. ICML, PMLR, 119, 8459-8468 (2020) on graph network simulators, and efficiently learns the intricate dynamics of the interacting particles. Nodes and edges of the GNN correspond, respectively, to the particles with their individual properties/data (e.g., radius, position, velocity) and the pairwise interactions between the particles (e.g., electrostatics, hydrodynamics). A key contribution of our work is to account for the finite dimensions of the particles and their impact on the system dynamics. We test our GNN against a representative case study of a multidisperse mixture of two-dimensional spheres sedimenting under gravity in a liquid and interacting with each other by a Lennard-Jones potential. The present GNN framework offers a fast and accurate method for the theoretical study of complex physical systems such as field-induced behavior of colloidal suspensions and ionic liquids. Our implementation of the GNN is available on GitHub at github.com/rfjd/GNS-DispersedSystems.</description>

      <title>Forward and Inverse Simulation of Pseudo-Two-Dimensional Model of Lithium-Ion Batteries Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenges posed by the high nonlinearity of the Butler-Volmer (BV) equation in forward and inverse simulations of the pseudo-two-dimensional (P2D) model using the physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework. The BV equation presents significant challenges for PINNs, primarily due to the hyperbolic sine term, which renders the Hessian of the PINN loss function highly ill-conditioned. To address this issue, we introduce a bypassing term that improves numerical stability by substantially reducing the condition number of the Hessian matrix. Furthermore, the small magnitude of the ionic flux \( j \) often leads to a common failure mode where PINNs converge to incorrect solutions. We demonstrate that incorporating a secondary conservation law for the solid-phase potential \( \psi \) effectively prevents such convergence issues and ensures solution accuracy. The proposed methods prove effective for solving both forward and inverse problems involving the BV equation. Specifically, we achieve precise parameter estimation in inverse scenarios and reliable solution predictions for forward simulations.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Micro-Void Development within Large Scale Additively Manufactured Polymer Composite Deposition Beads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the growing level of technology advancement that characterizes extrusion-deposition additive manufacturing technology, there remains a significant knowledge gap in fully understanding the process-structure-property relationship involved in this technology. The ability to effectively and efficiently control the manufacturing process provides an opportunity for optimizing the complex microstructure of the polymer composite prints which can lead to significant improvement of the associated print properties and in-service part performance. Modeling the polymer melt flow extrusion-deposition process is important in understanding the development of the inherent microstructural formation. The current research presents a computational-based approach for investigating process-induced micro-voids and their impact on print properties. We develop a multiscale FEA simulation tool to predict the global and local flow-fields during the polymer-melt flow process to investigate underlying mechanisms that may promote the micro-void development within the bead microstructure and determine potential process related factors that can be controlled to mitigate micro-void formation and growth. The research also presents a computational based method for assessing the impact of micro-voids on the effective print properties. The direct implication of reduced part voidage levels is the development of high-quality functional components for specialized applications such as light weight &amp; high strength integrity composites widely used in a variety of industries particularly the automobile, aerospace, renewable energy and defense industries.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Operator Network for Solving Elliptic-type parametric PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underlie our understanding and prediction of natural phenomena across numerous fields, including physics, engineering, and finance. However, solving parametric PDEs is a complex task that necessitates efficient numerical methods. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for solving parametric PDEs using a Finite Element Operator Network (FEONet). Our proposed method leverages the power of deep learning in conjunction with traditional numerical methods, specifically the finite element method, to solve parametric PDEs in the absence of any paired input-output training data. We performed various experiments on several benchmark problems and confirmed that our approach has demonstrated excellent performance across various settings and environments, proving its versatility in terms of accuracy, generalization, and computational flexibility. While our method is not meshless, the FEONet framework shows potential for application in various fields where PDEs play a crucial role in modeling complex domains with diverse boundary conditions and singular behavior. Furthermore, we provide theoretical convergence analysis to support our approach, utilizing finite element approximation in numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Generalization of composite dynamics for the lattice Boltzmann method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A generalized composite dynamics framework is presented for the lattice Boltzmann method. It leverages synergies of various simple collision operators to model intertwined physical processes, capturing complex behavior. The framework is validated by recovering partial bounceback fluid flow methods. Systematic derivation in our framework provides mathematical justification for the incorporation of forces, addressing a gap in the literature. The versatility of this framework is demonstrated by analyzing a robin boundary condition. Moreover, two new dynamics are proposed using our generalized framework, namely the partial robin boundary condition, and transfer partial bounceback. The generalized composite dynamics framework opens innovative possibilities for simulating complex phenomena using lattice Boltzmann methods, demonstrated here with sub-grid wall reactions and reactive porous media.</description>

      <title>Mesh-based Super-Resolution of Fluid Flows with Multiscale Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex and backward-facing step flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations. Reconstruction errors for fixed architectures were found to increase in proportion to the Reynolds number. Geometry extrapolation studies on a separate cavity flow configuration show promising cross-mesh capabilities of the super-resolution strategy.</description>

      <title>Learning stochastic dynamics from snapshots through regularized unbalanced optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamics using samples from sparsely time-resolved snapshots is an important problem in both natural sciences and machine learning. Here, we introduce a new deep learning approach for solving regularized unbalanced optimal transport (RUOT) and inferring continuous unbalanced stochastic dynamics from observed snapshots. Based on the RUOT form, our method models these dynamics without requiring prior knowledge of growth and death processes or additional information, allowing them to be learned directly from data. Theoretically, we explore the connections between the RUOT and Schr\"odinger bridge problem and discuss the key challenges and potential solutions. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated with a synthetic gene regulatory network, high-dimensional Gaussian Mixture Model, and single-cell RNA-seq data from blood development. Compared with other methods, our approach accurately identifies growth and transition patterns, eliminates false transitions, and constructs the Waddington developmental landscape. Our code is available at: https://github.com/zhenyiizhang/DeepRUOT.</description>
