      <title>Viscous flow model of ion-induced pattern formation: consistency between theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that ion-irradiation can lead surfaces to spontaneously develop patterns with characteristic length scales on the order of only a few nanometers. Pattern formation typically occurs only for irradiation angles beyond a critical angle, which varies with projectile, target, and irradiation energy. To date, there is no completely unifying physical theory. However, since predictions of the critical angle can be extracted from linear stability analysis of a given model, the ability to explain critical angle selection is a simple but important test of model validity. In this paper, we survey all existing critical angle, wavelength, and in-plane stress data for noble gas broad beam ion-irradiation of silicon and germanium by argon, krypton and xenon at energies from 250eV to 2keV. While neglecting the effects of erosion and redistribution, which are widely regarded as key contributors to ion-induced pattern formation, we find that a viscous flow model is capable of explaining these three types of experimental data simultaneously using only parameters within a physically-reasonable range, and in a manner consistent with the defect kinetics of the amorphous layer. This bolsters the case for viscous flow and stress-driven instabilities as important components of an eventual, unifying model of nanoscale pattern formation under ion bombardment.</description>

      <title>Magnetothermal Properties with Sampled Effective Local Field Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a first-principles method for predicting the magnetothermal properties of solid-state materials, which we call Sampled Effective Local Field Estimation. This approach achieves over two orders of magnitude improvement in sample efficiency compared to current state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated on representative material systems. We validate our predictions against experimental data for well-characterized magnetic materials, showing excellent agreement. The method is fully automated and requires minimal computational resources, making it well suited for integration into high-throughput materials discovery workflows. Our method offers a scalable and accurate predictive framework that can accelerate the design of next-generation materials for magnetic refrigeration, cryogenic cooling, and magnetic memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Multiple Scattering of Elastic Waves in Polycrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elastic waves that propagate in polycrystalline materials attenuate due to scattering of energy out of the primary propagation direction in addition to becoming dispersive in their group and phase velocities. Attenuation and dispersion are modeled through multiple scattering theory to describe the mean displacement field or the mean elastodynamic Green's function. The Green's function is governed by the Dyson equation and was solved previously (Weaver, 1990) by truncating the multiple scattering series at first-order, which is known as the first-order smoothing approximation (FOSA). FOSA allows for multiple scattering but places a restriction on the scattering events such that a scatterer can only be visited once during a particular multiple scattering process. In other words, recurrent scattering between two scatterers is not permitted. In this article, the Dyson equation is solved using the second-order smoothing approximation (SOSA). The SOSA permits scatterers to be visited twice during the multiple scattering process and, thus, provides a more complete picture of the multiple scattering effects on elastic waves. The derivation is valid at all frequencies spanning the Rayleigh, stochastic, and geometric scattering regimes without additional approximations that limit applicability in strongly scattering cases (like the Born approximation). The importance of SOSA is exemplified through analyzing specific weak and strongly scattering polycrystals. Multiple scattering effects contained in SOSA are shown to be important at the beginning of the stochastic scattering regime and are particularly important for transverse (shear) waves. This step forward opens the door for a deeper fundamental understanding of multiple scattering phenomena in polycrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>General First-Principles Approach to Crystals in Finite Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general first-principles methodology for computing electronic structure in a finite uniform magnetic field which allows for an arbitrary rational magnetic flux and nonlocal pseudopotentials, at a comparable time complexity of conventional plane-wave pseudopotential approaches in zero-field conditions. The versatility of this method is demonstrated through comprehensive applications to both molecular and crystalline systems, including calculations of magnetizabilities, magnetically induced currents, and magnetic energy bands. Furthermore, we provide rigorous proofs of two fundamental properties for crystals in uniform magnetic fields: the "strong translational symmetry" and "magnetic bands shift" phenomena.</description>

      <title>Doping Topological Dirac Semimetal with magnetic impurities: electronic structure of Mn-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prospect of transforming a Dirac topological semimetal (TSM) into a Weyl TSM phase, following doping by magnetic impurities, is central to TSM applications. The magnetic field from polarized $d$ levels of magnetic impurities produces a field with a sharp local structure. To what extent magnetic impurities act in the same manner as an applied field and what are the effects of such a field on the electronic structure of a Dirac TSM is the subject of this paper. We present electronic structure calculations of bulk Cd$_3$As$_2$ with substitutional doping of Mn impurities in the dilute alloy range. Quasi-particle $GW$ (QS$GW$) ab-initio electronic structure calculations are used in conjunction with $k \cdot p$ model Hamiltonian calculations. As expected, we observe the splitting of the Dirac points into pairs of Weyl points following the doping with Mn. We also show that the electronic structure of Mn-doped Cd$_3$As$_2$ can be emulated by the electronic structure of pristine Cd$_3$As$_2$ with an appropriate external magnetic field. Some properties of the conductivity of bulk Cd$_3$As$_2$ for different magnetic field orientations are also investigated. Our results inform future opportunities for unique device functionality based on band structure tuning not found in conventional magnetic Weyl TSM.</description>

      <title>Electroforming Kinetics in HfOx/Ti RRAM: Mechanisms Behind Compositional and Thermal Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical issue affecting filamentary resistive random access memory (RRAM) cells is the requirement of high voltages during electroforming. Reducing the magnitude of these voltages is of significant interest, as it ensures compatibility with Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technologies. Previous studies have identified that changing the initial stoichiometry of the switching layer and/or implementing thermal engineering approaches has an influence over the electroforming voltage magnitude, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we develop an understanding of how these mechanisms work within a standard a-HfO$_x$/Ti RRAM stack through combining atomistic driven-Kinetic Monte Carlo (d-KMC) simulations with experimental data. By performing device-scale simulations at atomistic resolution, we can precisely model the movements of point defects under applied biases in structurally inhomogeneous materials, which allows us to not only capture finite-size effects but also to understand how conductive filaments grow under different electroforming conditions. Doing atomistic simulations at the device-level also enables us to link simulations of the mechanisms behind conductive filament formation with trends in experimental data with the same material stack. We identify a transition from primarily vertical to lateral ion movement dominating the filamentary growth process in sub-stoichiometric oxides, and differentiate the influence of global and local heating on the morphology of the formed filaments. These different filamentary structures have implications for the dynamic range exhibited by formed devices in subsequent SET/RESET operations. Overall, our results unify the complex ion dynamics in technologically relevant HfO$_x$/Ti-based stacks, and provide guidelines that can be leveraged when fabricating devices.</description>

      <title>Determining Linker Ratios of Mixed Metal-Organic Frameworks via Magnetic Susceptibility Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial replacement of the organic linkers of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) often optimizes their functionalities, however, accurate characterization of their molar ratios in many cases is challenging. This work presents a method of determining such linker ratios via measurements of the magnetic susceptibility of small quantities of powdered samples. The main presumption is taking the diamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions to the molar magnetic susceptibility of the two parent MOFs to be additive. To verify this, four examples are provided with commonly used MOFs to represent the cases when both parent MOFs are either paramagnetic or diamagnetic but with different linkers with the following systems: [MIL-101(Cr)-SO$_3$H]$_{(1-\delta)}$[MIL-101(Cr)-NO$_2$]$_{\delta}$, [EuMOF]$_{(1-\delta)}$[EuPDCA]$_{\delta}$, [UiO-66-COOH]$_{(1-\delta)}$[UiO-66]$_{\delta}$ and [MIL-101(Cr) F Free]$_{(1-\delta)}$[MIL-53(Al)]$_{\delta}$, where 1-$\delta$ : $\delta$ are the ratios to be determined. Depending on whether the systems were strictly paramagnetic, strictly diamagnetic or mixed, the experimental error of $\delta$ ranged between 0.00002 and 0.012, respectively. We expect the presented method to be widely employed since samples only need to be in powdered form and because there is a lack of characterization tools in the area of MOF linker ratios. The presented method is also applicable to resolving the ratios of mixed ordinary paramagnetic systems as well as other types of non-magnetic composite materials such as tapes, zeolites and thin films.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Enhancement of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction via Field-Cooling-Induced Interface Engineering in 2D van der Waals Ferromagnetic ternary Tellurides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets has opened new avenues for exploring topological spin textures and their applications in next-generation spintronics. Among these materials, Fe3GaTe2 (FGaT) emerges as a model system due to its room-temperature skyrmion phases, which are stabilized by strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). However, the atomistic origins of DMI in centrosymmetric vdW lattices remain elusive. Here, we report a spontaneous DMI enhancement mechanism driven by FC in FGaT and its analog Fe3GeTe2 (FGeT). Combining Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we have observed the irreversible precipitation of FeTe2 in annealed FGaT. The resulting FeTe2/FGaT heterostructure is considered to break the symmetry and significantly enhance the DMI. Furthermore, similar phenomenon has been observed in the family ferromagnetic material FGeT as well. Additionally, the precipitation of FeTe2 varies significantly with different thicknesses of FGaT, aligning closely with the reported behavior of skyrmions. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms behind the origin of the DMI in ternary tellurides, paving the way for advanced spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Strong Crystalline Thermal Insulating Induced by Extended Antibonding States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline solids with extreme insulation often exhibit a plateau or even an upward-sloping tail in thermal conductivity above room temperature. Herein, we synthesized a crystalline material AgTl$_2$I$_3$ with an exceptionally low thermal conductivity of 0.21 $\rm W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 300 K, which continues to decrease to 0.17 $\rm W m^{-1} K^{-1}$ at 523 K. We adopted an integrated experimental and theoretical approach to reveal the lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties of AgTl$_2$I$_3$. Our results suggest that the Ag-I polyhedron enables extended antibonding states to weaken the chemical bonding, fostering strong lattice anharmonicity driven by the rattling vibrations of Ag atoms and causing lattice softening. Experimental measurements further corroborate the large atomic thermal motions and low sound velocity. These features impede particle-like phonon propagation, and significantly diminish the contribution of wave-like phonon tunneling. This work highlights a strategy for designing thermal insulating materials by leveraging crystal structure and chemical bonding, providing a pathway for advancing the development of thermal insulators.</description>

      <title>Surface hopping simulations show valley depolarization driven by exciton-phonon resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer MoS$_2$ has long served as a prototypical material exhibiting valleytronic behavior, yet it remains unclear exactly how phonons induce a valley depolarization of its excitonic states. Here, we apply a mixed quantum--classical simulation framework to study the phonon-induced mechanisms affecting valley polarization at short times. Our framework combines reciprocal-space surface hopping with microscopic models of the quasiparticle band structure as well as the electron-hole and carrier-phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations, while retaining explicit information on transient phonon occupancies. By means of such occupancies, our simulations show a resonance between the lowest exciton band and the dominant optical phonon branch to largely drive valley depolarization, by activating a Maialle-Silva-Sham mechanism. Resulting valley polarization times are consistent with experimental measurements across temperatures.</description>

      <title>Excitons in fractionally-filled moir\'{e} superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range Coulomb forces give rise to correlated insulating states when charge particles populate a moir\'{e} superlattice at certain fractional filling factors. Such behavior is characterized by a broken translation symmetry wherein particles spontaneously form a Wigner crystal. Focusing on the experimental findings of Xu et al. [Nature \textbf{587}, 214 (2020)], we present a theory that captures the correlated insulating state of a fractionally-filled moir\'{e} superlattice through the energy shift and change in oscillator strength of the exciton absorption resonance. The theory shows that the experimental findings can only be supported if the electrons reside in a charge-ordered state (i.e., electrons are not randomly distributed among the sites of the moir\'{e} superlattice). Furthermore, we explain why the energy shifts of exciton resonances are qualitatively different in cases that the superlattice is nearly empty compared with a superlattice whose sites are doubly occupied.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio density-matrix approach to exciton coherence: phonon scattering, Coulomb interactions and radiative recombination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relaxation processes following light excitation in semiconductors are key in materials-based quantum technology applications. These processes are broadly studied in atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), quasi-two-dimensional excitonic semiconductors in which atomistic design allows for tunable excited-state properties, such as relaxation lifetimes and photo-induced coherence. In this work, we present a density-matrix-based approach to compute exciton relaxation within a many-body ab initio perspective. We expand our previously developed Lindblad density-matrix formalism to capture multi-channel electron-hole pair relaxation processes, including phonon and Coulomb scattering as well as radiative recombination, and study their effect on the time-resolved excited-state propagation. Using monolayer MoSe$_2$ as a prototypical example, we examine many-body effects on the time-dependent dynamics of photoactive excitations, exploring how the electron-hole pair interactions are reflected in variations of the excitation energy, spectral signature, and state coherence. Our method supplies a detailed understanding of exciton relaxation mechanisms in realistic materials, offering a previously unexplored pathway to study excited-state dynamics in semiconductors from first principles.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-rich hydrate at high pressures up to 104 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas hydrates are considered fundamental building blocks of giant icy planets like Neptune and similar exoplanets. The existence of these materials in the interiors of giant icy planets, which are subject to high pressures and temperatures, depends on their stability relative to their constituent components. In this study, we reexamine the structural stability and hydrogen content of hydrogen hydrates, (H2O)(H2)n, up to 104 GPa, focusing on hydrogen-rich materials. Using synchrotron single-crystal X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and first-principles theoretical calculations, we find that the C2-filled ice phase undergoes a transformation to C3-filled ice phase over a broad pressure range of 47 - 104 GPa at room temperature. The C3 phase contains twice as much molecular H2 as the C2 phase. Heating the C2-filled ice above approximately 1500 K induces the transition to the C3 phase at pressures as low as 47 GPa. Upon decompression, this phase remains metastable down to 40 GPa. These findings establish new stability limits for hydrates, with implications for hydrogen storage and the interiors of planetary bodies.</description>

      <title>Regimes of optical transparency and instabilities of collinear dielectric ferromagnetic materials in the presence of the dynamic magnetoelectric effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contribution of the polarization associated with the noncollinear parts of spins in the dielectric permeability tensor of multiferroic materials is considered. As the equilibrium state, we consider the systems of parallel spins, so we have zero equilibrium polarization. Dynamical polarization appears due to the spin evolution via the magnetoelectric coupling. The regime of frequencies, where the refractive index goes to 1 is found for the high (in comparison with the characteristic frequency of the anisotropic energy or the cyclotron frequency) left/right circularly polarized electromagnetic wave propagating parallel to the equilibrium spin direction. Moreover, the signs of the imaginary part of the dielectric permeability, the refractive index, and the frequency show the instability of the parallel spin configuration at the propagation of the linearly polarized electromagnetic wave due to the effective magnetoelectric interaction.</description>

      <title>Unified theory of photovoltaic Hall effect by field- and light-induced Berry curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photovoltaic Hall effect is an interesting platform of Berry curvature engineering by external fields. Floquet engineering aims at generation of light-induced Berry curvature associated with topological phase transition in solids, which may manifest itself as a light-induced anomalous Hall effect. However, recent studies have pointed out an important role of the bias electric field, which adds a field-induced circular photogalvanic effect to the photovoltaic Hall effect. Except for numerical studies, the two mechanisms have been described by different theoretical frameworks, hindering a coherent understanding. Here, we develop a unified theory of the photovoltaic Hall effect capable of describing both mechanisms on an equal footing. We reveal that the bias electric field alters the interband transition dipole moment, transition energy, and intraband velocity, all contributing to the field-induced circular photogalvanic effect in nonmagnetic materials. The first process can be expressed as a manifestation of the electric field-induced Berry curvature. Shift vector plays an essential role in determining the transition energy shift. We also clearly distinguish the anomalous Hall effect by light-dressed states within the density matrix calculation using the length gauge. Our theory unifies a number of nonlinear optical processes in a physically transparent way and reveals their geometric aspect.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin excitations in a dual-core magnetic molecule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic excitations are important quantum phenomena in magnetic systems and have been widely studied in individual magnetic atoms and molecules as well as their assembled structures over the past few decades. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) combined with density functional theory (DFT) and the state-of-the-art ab initio wavefunction calculations, we investigated the properties of a novel dual-core Cr2Br6 molecule, which consists of two Cr ions coupled via superexchange through a single near-90{\deg} Cr-Br-Cr scissors bond. Under zero magnetic field, we observed a Fano peak with multi-steps through STS. When an external magnetic field is applied, some steps exhibit additional splitting, while others change little. We find that the Cr2Br6, exhibits a spin-degenerate ground state, and the complex peak splitting arises from the coexistence of vibrational and magnetic excitations in the molecule. Our results reveal rich quantum spin behavior in a well-defined two-core magnetic trihalide complex at the atomic scale, offering not only a minimal model for superexchange-coupled multi-spin quantum excitations but also a possible foundational unit for future molecule-based quantum functionalities.</description>

      <title>Topological surface states induced by magnetic proximity effect in narrow-gap semiconductor alpha-Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of magnetism and topological properties in one material platform is attracting significant attention due to the potential of realizing low power consumption and error-robust electronic devices. Common practice is to start from a topological material with band inversion and incorporates ferromagnetism via chemical doping or magnetic proximity effect (MPE). In this work, we show that a topological material is not necessary and that both ferromagnetism and band inversion can be established simultaneously in a trivial insulating material by MPE from a neighbouring ferromagnetic layer. This novel route is demonstrated using quantum transport measurements and first principles calculations in a heterostructure consisting of 5 nm thick FeOx/1 monolayer of FeAs/ 3 nm thick alpha Sn. The Shubnikov de Haas oscillations show that there is linear band dispersion with high mobility in the heterostructure even though a 3 nm thick alpha Sn single layer is a trivial semiconductor. Furthermore, first principles calculations reveal that band inversion indeed occurs in this heterostructure, suggesting that the observed linear band is a topological surface state within this inverted gap. This work significantly expands the foundation for realizing magnetic topological materials in a myriad of trivial narrow gap semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Crossed pseudopotential$-$functional calculations made simple: An extended Kohn-Sham framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations rely heavily on pseudopotentials, yet their impact on accuracy is barely addressed. In this work, we derive from the Kohn-Sham equation that the use of pseudopotentials invariably introduces a ``dropping" error, which leads to a deviation from the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem. Crossed pseudopotential-functional calculations provide a pragmatic way to balance accuracy and efficiency, enabling the right results for the right reasons. This paradigm goes beyond the (generalized) Kohn-Sham framework, which we name the extended Kohn-Sham framework. We support our assertion with a bandgap study on 54 monovalent-Cu semiconductors. The crossed calculations, compared to consistent ones, not only remove all 11 erroneous metal predictions, but also drastically reduce the mean relative error from 80\% to 20\%. The accuracy even exceeds that of the hybrid functionals and GW due to the role of pseudopotentials in modelling the external potentials of Cu-valence electrons that cannot be compensated by exchange-correlation.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen and oxygen transport and reactions during plasma nitridation of zirconium thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zirconium nitride (ZrN) is a refractory material with good mechanical and thermal properties. It is therefore a good candidate for hard surface treatment at high temperature. In this work, we report the growth and characterization of ZrN by plasma assisted thermal nitridation of zirconium films in a NH3 atmosphere. The process was monitored by in situ monochromatic ellipsometry and the nitrides grown were profiled and analyzed by Auger electron spectroscopy. By using temperatures in the 700--800___{\textdegree}C range, the material obtained is quite close to ZrN, but, depending on experimental conditions, residual oxygen (impurities) can be easily incorporated by reaction with zirconium. The analysis of the ellipsometric data has shown that the nitridation did not occur by simple growth of nitride on zirconium. Auger profiles confirmed the presence of an oxidized zirconium layer localized between the nitrided surface and the remaining metal. This oxidation was observed to occur preferentially during temperature ramping, that is, in the low temperature regime. At high temperature, nitridation is dominant and the incorporated oxygen is exchanged with nitrogen. Oxygen is then partly rejected by diffusion out of the film through the ZrN surface layer and partly by diffusion in the deep zirconium sublayer. By using these observations, a new model of growth with a layered ZrN/ZrOx/Zr film was used to describe in situ ellipsometric data. By comparing the pure thermal and the plasma treatments, the advantages of the plasma assisted treatment become clearly: complete nitridation of the zirconium layer was achieved and the oxygen amounts in the film were substantially reduced.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Reaction Mechanisms in a Chemically Amplified EUV Photoresist from a Combined Theoretical and Experimental Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has revolutionized high-volume manufacturing of nanoscale components, enabling the production of smaller, denser, and more energy efficient integrated circuit devices. Yet, the use of EUV light results in ionization driven chemistry within the imaging materials of lithography, the photoresists. The complex interplay of ionization, generation of primary and secondary electrons, and the subsequent chemical mechanisms leading to image formation in photoresists has been notoriously difficult to study. In this work, we deploy photoemission spectroscopy with a 92 eV EUV light source combined with first-principles simulations to unravel the chemical changes occurring during exposure in a model chemically amplified photoresist. The results reveal a surprising chemical reaction pathway, namely the EUV-induced breakdown of the photoacid generator (PAG), which is a critical component in the EUV mechanism. This previously unobserved reaction mechanism manifests as changes in intensity of the valence band peaks of the EUV photoemission spectrum, which are linked to degradation of the PAG via an advanced atomistic simulation framework. Our combined experimental and theoretical approach shows that EUV photoemission can simultaneously resolve chemical dynamics and the production of primary and secondary electrons, giving unique insights into the chemical transformation of photoresist materials. Our results pave the way for utilizing accessible, table-top EUV spectroscopy systems for observing EUV photoresist chemical dynamics, with the potential for time-resolved measurements of photoemission processes in the future.</description>

      <title>Role of non-reciprocity in spin-wave channeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extent to which non-reciprocal waves can be guided in arbitrary directions is an interesting question. We address one aspect of this problem by studying the propagation of acoustic spin waves in a narrow physical conduit made of a synthetic antiferromagnet. Through a combination of Brillouin Light Scattering microscopy and modeling, we demonstrate that even when attempting to guide waves in the reciprocal direction of the material, the system still exhibits strong signatures of non-reciprocity. This includes the excitation of high wavevector waves in the direction perpendicular to the intended channeling, as well as energy transfer in directions that often neither aligns with the physical conduit nor with the symmetry axes of the magnetic properties. These findings have implications for the modeling of propagating wave spectroscopy in non-reciprocal materials and their potential applications.</description>

      <title>Empirical approaches to Frohlich excitonic polarons in polar semiconductors with application to 3D halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short abstract: The paper reviews the physics of Frohlich excitonic polarons from the viewpoint of empirical approaches with some original developments. Models for excitonic polarons in ionic semiconductors in the spirit of the Lee Low and Pines (LLP) model for free polarons were initiated by Toyozawa and Hermanson and extended by Pollman and Buttner (PB). The dominant electron-hole interaction with the lattice introduced by Frohlich is represented by a long-range effective interaction with a single longitudinal optical polar mode. The properties of the excitonic polarons are characterized by various physical quantities such as effective dielectric constants, effective masses, virtual phonon populations, carrier self-energies and binding energies, and effective electron-hole interactions mediated by the lattice. In 3D perovskites, the excitonic polarons deviate from the simplified picture of weakly interacting (almost free) polarons, with sizeable effects of electron-hole correlations on all the physical properties.</description>

      <title>Integrating Machine Learning with Triboelectric Nanogenerators: Optimizing Electrode Materials and Doping Strategies for Intelligent Energy Harves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of machine learning techniques with triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) offers a transformative pathway for optimizing energy harvesting technologies. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework that utilizes graph neural networks to predict and enhance the performance of TENG electrode materials and doping strategies. By leveraging an extensive dataset of experimental and computational results, the model effectively classifies electrode materials, predicts optimal doping ratios, and establishes robust structure-property relationships. Key findings include a 65.7\% increase in energy density for aluminum-doped PTFE and an 85.7\% improvement for fluorine-doped PTFE, highlighting the critical influence of doping materials and their concentrations. The model further identifies PTFE as a highly effective negative electrode material, achieving a maximum energy density of 1.12~J/cm$^2$ with 7\% silver (Ag) doping when copper (Cu) is used as the positive electrode. This data-driven approach not only accelerates material discovery but also significantly reduces experimental costs, providing novel insights into the fundamental factors influencing TENG performance. The proposed methodology establishes a robust platform for intelligent material design, advancing the development of sustainable energy technologies and self-powered systems.</description>

      <title>Morphology and Strain Engineering of Cu-based Materials by Chemical Dealloying for Electrochemical CO Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoporous Cu (NPC), synthesized by chemical dealloying of brass, holds significant potential for catalysis of electrochemical CO2 and CO reduction, owing to the optimal binding energy of Cu with *CO and *H intermediates, and the abundance of surface under-coordinated atoms inherent to the nanoporous structure. However, further optimization of NPC morphology and chemistry for CO reduction can only be made possible by understanding the dealloying process. Hence overcoming challenges concerning the direct measurement of atomic scale chemistry and under-coordinated atoms in NPC nano-ligaments is vital. In this study, NPC with tunable ligament sizes between nanometer and micrometer range were synthesized by varying the temperature of Cu20Zn80 (atomic ratio) chemical dealloying in concentrated phosphoric acid. The evolution of chemistry and structure of nano-ligaments during dealloying were probed for the first time using in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) and cryo-atom probe tomography (APT) revealing the phase transformations and complex chemistry in nano-ligaments. A method based on the asymmetricity of synchrotron XRD peaks of NPC samples was also proposed to estimate the quantity of under-coordinated atoms on nano-ligaments, as ligament surface strain. Finally, CO reduction using electrochemistry mass spectrometry (EC-MS) demonstrated the promising performance of NPC compared to polycrystalline Cu. An optimal ligament surface strain value was also observed for the CO reduction on NPC, which provides more mechanistic insights into the complicated CO reduction process and an alternative strategy for Cu-based catalysts engineering. This work also shows how the application of synchrotron X-ray diffraction and EC-MS facilitates more efficient and accurate optimization of copper-based catalysts for electrochemical CO reduction.</description>

      <title>DiffCrysGen: A Score-Based Diffusion Model for Design of Diverse Inorganic Crystalline Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystal structure generation is a foundational challenge in materials discovery, particularly in designing functional inorganic crystalline materials with desired properties. Most existing diffusion-based generative models for crystals rely on complex, hand-crafted priors and modular architectures to separately model atom types, atomic positions, and lattice parameters. These methods often require customized diffusion processes and conditional denoising, which can introduce additional model complexities and inconsistencies. Here we introduce DiffCrysGen, a fully data-driven, score-based diffusion model that jointly learns the distribution of all structural components in crystalline materials. With crystal structure representation as unified 2D matrices, DiffCrysGen bypasses the need for task-specific priors or decoupled modules, enabling end-to-end generation of atom types, fractional coordinates, and lattice parameters within a single framework. Our model learns crystallographic symmetry and chemical validity directly from large-scale datasets, allowing it to scale to complex materials discovery tasks. As a demonstration, we applied DiffCrysGen to the design of rare-earth-free magnetic materials with high saturation magnetization, showing its effectiveness in generating stable, diverse, and property-aligned candidates for sustainable magnet applications.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Octupole Approximation in Non-Collinear Antiferromagnetic Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noncollinear antiferromagnets offer much promise for antiferromagnetic spintronics and neuromorphic applications with a plethora of functional properties surpassing many competing magnetic systems. Films grown on mismatched substrates can relieve strain by the creation of slip-plane defects - and recently we have shown that these defects can manipulate global physical properties important for application. Here we demonstrate that post growth annealing results in near-defect-free, structurally robust films that allow the magnetic order thermal evolution to change as a function of film thickness. Strong spin-lattice coupling ensures that substrate clamping limits the ability of thinner films to transform as they are cooled to low temperature. However, beyond a certain thickness, films no longer suffer this constraint, revealing the extraordinary transformations that provide the pathway for spin to reach the lowest energy state. We show that this transition cannot be explained by the previously established mechanism of spin rotations in the (111) plane, and we calculate that rotations along the chirality-inverting [1-10] direction may be preferable under certain conditions. Our work suggests that chirality inverting rotations in these materials may have been previously overlooked in studies adopting the so-called octupole approximation of the net magnetic moment. This enriches the field of antiferromagnetic spintronics, raising the possibility of device designs with thickness engineered to exploit switching of chirality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge density waves (CDWs) are collective electronic states that can reshape and melt, even while confined within a rigid atomic crystal. In two dimensions, melting is predicted to be distinct, proceeding through partially ordered nematic and hexatic states that are neither liquid nor crystal. Here we measure and explain how continuous, hexatic melting of incommensurate CDWs occurs in low-dimensional materials. As a CDW is thermally excited, disorder emerges progressively$\unicode{x2013}$initially through smooth elastic deformations that modulate the local wavelength, and subsequently via the nucleation of topological defects. Experimentally, we track three hallmark signatures of CDW melting$\unicode{x2013}$azimuthal superlattice peak broadening, wavevector contraction, and integrated intensity decay.</description>

      <title>Oxyfluoride glasses obtained through incorporation of CaF$_2$ into photovoltaic cover glass melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Phonon Contributions to Thermal Transport and the Failure of the Wiedemann-Franz Law in Ruthenium and Tungsten Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transport in nanoscale interconnects is dominated by intricate electron-phonon interactions and microstructural influences. As copper faces limitations at the nanoscale, tungsten and ruthenium have emerged as promising alternatives due to their substantial phonon contributions to thermal conductivity. Metals with stronger phonon-mediated thermal transport are particularly advantageous in nanoscale architectures, where phonons are less sensitive to size effects than electrons. Here, we show that phonons play a comparable role to electrons in the thermal transport of ruthenium and tungsten thin films, evidenced by deviations from the classical Wiedemann-Franz law. Elevated Lorenz numbers-1.9 and 2.7 times the Sommerfeld value for ruthenium and tungsten, respectively-indicate phonon contributions of 45% and 62% to total thermal conductivity. Comparisons of in-plane thermal conductivity from steady-state thermoreflectance and electron relaxation times from infrared ellipsometry reveal that phonon-mediated transport is insensitive to microstructural variations and scaling. Ultrafast infrared pump-probe measurements show that ruthenium exhibits a higher electron-phonon coupling factor than tungsten, consistent with the differing contributions of carriers to thermal transport. Molecular dynamics simulations and spectral energy density analysis confirm substantial phonon-driven thermal transport and mode-dependent phonon lifetimes. These results offer insights into phonon-driven thermal transport and provide design principles for selecting interconnects with enhanced thermal management.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis: A comparative study employing Vulcan carbon modification by different MnO2 nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrochemical performances of the {\alpha}-MnO2/Vulcan XC-72 and {\delta}-MnO2/Vulcan XC-72 nanostructures in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) electrosynthesis were compared herein. Both materials were synthesized by a simple hydrothermal route. Their structures and morphologies were analyzed by SEM, HRTEM, XPS, Raman Scattering and XRD, and their ORR electrochemical properties and H2O2 electrosynthesis efficacies were investigated in alkaline NaOH solutions applying the rotating ring-disk electrode (RRDE) technique. Gas diffusion electrode (GDE) setups in acid media aiming at H2O2 formation were also performed. The 3% {\delta}-MnO2/C and 1% {\alpha}-MnO2/C electrocatalysts were more efficient and selective than pure Vulcan XC-72 through the ORR 2-electron pathway in the RRDE essays. Concerning H2O2 electrogeneration using GDE, the 1% {\alpha}-MnO2/C electrocatalyst displayed better activity, with peroxide accumulation of 402.6 mg/L at -1.9 V (vs Ag/AgCl) after 120 min, 48 % higher than pure Vulcan XC-72 GDE. These results can be ascribed to a synergistic effect between {\alpha}-MnO2 and Vulcan XC-72, as well as oxygen functional acid species improvement, increasing electrocatalytic surface hydrophilicity and enhancing H2O2 electrosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Understanding of Exposure and Process Chemistry for Enhanced Lithography and Stability of Metal Oxide Resists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal oxide resists (MORs) have shown great promise for high resolution patterning in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, with potential for integration into high volume manufacturing. However, MORs have recently been shown to exhibit sensitivity to process conditions and environment, leading to critical dimension (CD) variation. While this variation can be reduced with proper process control, there is little knowledge on how these aspects affect the image formation mechanism. To bridge these knowledge gaps, we deploy a coordinated, fundamentals-focused approach to yield deep insights into MOR exposure and process chemistry. Our results on a model MOR, an n-butyl Sn-Oxo system, reveal how parameters such as exposure dose, post-exposure bake temperature, and atmospheric species influence the image formation mechanism. Our results, and the coordinated approach using correlative spectroscopies, provide a strong foundation for understanding the image formation mechanism in MOR materials with potential to link mechanistic aspects to CD variation.</description>

      <title>Effective bands and band-like electron transport in amorphous solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The localization of electrons caused by atomic disorder is a well-known phenomenon. However, what circumstances allow electrons to remain delocalized and retain band-like characteristics even when the crystal structure is completely absent, as found in certain amorphous solids, is less well understood. To probe this phenomenon, we developed a fully first-principles description of the electronic structure and charge transport in amorphous solids by combining a novel representation of the amorphous state with the state-of-the-art many-body (QSGW) electronic structure theory. Using amorphous In2O3 as an example, we demonstrate the accuracy of our approach in reproducing the band-like nature of the conduction electrons as well as their disorder-limited mobility. Our approach reveals the physical origins responsible for the electron delocalization and the survival of the band dispersions despite the absence of long-range order.</description>

      <title>Pyrite Bismuth Telluride Heterojunction for Hybrid Electromagnetic to Thermoelectric Energy Harvesting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of wireless networks and connected devices has led to pervasive electromagnetic (EM) energy dissipation into the environment, an underutilized resource for energy harvesting. Here, we demonstrate a pyrite (FeS$_2$)-bismuth telluride (Bi$_2$Te$_3$) heterojunction that enables hybrid electromagnetic-to-thermoelectric energy conversion. Fabricated via a simple cold-press compaction of powders, the heterojunction forms a Schottky interface at FeS$_2$, facilitating efficient RF absorption and localized heating. This heat is harvested by Bi$_2$Te$_3$ through thermoelectric conversion. Under 35~MHz RF irradiation at 1~W input power, the device achieved a local temperature rise of 46~$^\circ$C and a thermal gradient of 5.5~K across the Bi$_2$Te$_3$, resulting in a peak power density of approximately 13~mW/cm$^2$. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations further elucidate the heat transport behavior and interfacial thermoelectric performance. This work introduces a new class of heterostructures for RF-responsive energy harvesting, offering a scalable route toward self-powered IoT and wireless sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Mapping of Microstructure Transitions during Rapid Alloy Solidification Using Bayesian-Guided Phase-Field Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses microstructure selection mechanisms in rapid solidification, specifically targeting the transition from cellular/dendritic to planar interface morphologies under conditions relevant to additive manufacturing. We use a phase-field model that quantitatively captures solute trapping, kinetic undercooling, and morphological instabilities across a broad range of growth velocities ($V$) and thermal gradients ($G$), and apply it to a binary Fe-Cr alloy, as a surrogate for 316L stainless steel. By combining high-fidelity phase-field simulations with a Gaussian Process-based Bayesian active learning approach, we efficiently map the microstructure transitions in the multi-dimensional space of composition, growth velocity, and temperature gradient. We compare our PF results to classical theories for rapid solidification. The classical KGT model yields an accurate prediction of the value of $G$ above which the interface is planar for any growth velocity. Microstructures transition from dendrites to cells as the temperature gradient increases close to this value of $G$. We also identify the occurrence of unstable "intermediate" microstructures at the border between dendritic and planar at low $G$, in the absence of banding instability in this Fe-Cr alloy. Our results highlight the capabilities of Bayesian-guided PF approaches in exploring complex microstructural transitions in multidimensional parameters spaces, thereby providing a robust computational tool for designing process parameters to achieve targeted microstructures and properties in rapidly solidified metallic alloys.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Mn intercalation and diffusion in NbSe$_2$ bilayers through DFTB simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding transition metal atoms' intercalation and diffusion behavior in two-dimensional (2D) materials is essential for advancing their potential in spintronics and other emerging technologies. In this study, we used density functional tight binding (DFTB) simulations to investigate the atomic-scale mechanisms of manganese (Mn) intercalation into NbSe$_2$ bilayers. Our results show that Mn prefers intercalated and embedded positions rather than surface adsorption, as cohesive energy calculations indicate enhanced stability in these configurations. Nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations revealed an energy barrier of 0.68 eV for the migration of Mn into the interlayer, comparable to other substrates, suggesting accessible diffusion pathways. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further demonstrated an intercalation concentration-dependent behavior. Mn atoms initially adsorb on the surface and gradually diffuse inward, resulting in an effective intercalation at higher Mn densities before clustering effects emerge. These results provide helpful insights into the diffusion pathways and stability of Mn atoms within NbSe$_2$ bilayers, consistent with experimental observations and offering a deeper understanding of heteroatom intercalation mechanisms in transition metal dichalcogenides.</description>

      <title>PtyRAD: A High-performance and Flexible Ptychographic Reconstruction Framework with Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron ptychography has recently achieved unprecedented resolution, offering valuable insights across diverse material systems, including in three dimensions. However, high-quality ptychographic reconstruction is computationally expensive and time consuming, requiring a significant amount of manually tuning even for experts. Additionally, essential tools for ptychographic analysis are often scattered across multiple software packages, with some advanced features available only in costly commercial software like MATLAB. To address these challenges, we introduce PtyRAD, an open-source software framework offers a comprehensive, flexible, and computationally efficient solution for electron ptychography. PtyRAD provides seamless optimization of multiple parameters--such as sample thickness, local tilts, probe positions, and mixed probe and object modes--using gradient-based methods with automatic differentiation (AD). By utilizing PyTorch's highly optimized tensor operations, PtyRAD achieves up to a 17x speedup in reconstruction time compared to existing packages without compromising image quality. In addition, we propose a real-space depth regularization, which avoids wrap-around artifacts and can be useful for twisted two-dimensional (2D) material datasets and vertical heterostructures. Moreover, PtyRAD integrates a Bayesian optimization workflow that streamlines hyperparameter selection. We hope the open-source nature of PtyRAD will foster reproducibility and community-driven development for future advances in ptychographic imaging.</description>

      <title>RAAC panels can suddenly collapse before any warning of corrosion-induced surface cracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collapse of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) panels has attracted considerable public and academic interest. As detailed experimental data are not yet available and replicating the natural corrosion process requires years or decades, computational modelling is essential to understand under which conditions corrosion remains concealed. The very high porosity of RAAC is widely suspected to be a major contributing factor. However, current corrosion-induced cracking models are known to struggle with capturing the role of concrete porosity. To remedy this critical deficiency, we propose to enrich corrosion-induced cracking modelling with the analytical solution of reactive transport equations governing the precipitation of rust and a porosity-dependent description of diffusivity. With this, the corrosion concealment in RAAC panels is studied computationally for the first time, revealing that RAAC panels can suddenly collapse before any warning of corrosion-induced surface cracking and allowing to map the conditions most likely to result in sudden collapse.</description>

      <title>Ultrastrong Light-Matter Coupling in Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrastrong light-matter coupling has traditionally been studied in optical cavities, where it occurs when the light-matter coupling strength reaches a significant fraction of the transition frequency. This regime fundamentally alters the ground and excited states of the particle-cavity system, unlocking new ways to control its physics and chemistry. However, achieving ultrastrong coupling in engineered cavities remains a major challenge. Here, we show that ultra- and deep-strong coupling naturally occur in bulk materials without the need for external cavities. By analyzing experimental data from over 70 materials, we demonstrate that phonon-, exciton-, and plasmon-polaritons in many solids exhibit ultrastrong coupling, systematically surpassing the coupling strengths achieved in cavity-based systems. To explain this phenomenon, we introduce a dipole lattice model based on a generalized Hopfield Hamiltonian, which unifies photon-matter, matter-matter, and photon-photon interactions. The complete overlap between the photonic and collective dipole modes in the lattice enables ultrastrong coupling, leading to excited-state mixing, radiative decay suppression, and potential phase transitions into collective ground states. Applying our model to real materials, we show that it reproduces light-matter coupling across broad material classes and may underlie structural phase transitions that give rise to emergent phenomena such as ferroelectricity, insulator-to-metal transitions, and exciton condensation. Recognizing ultrastrong coupling as an intrinsic property of solids reshapes our understanding of light-matter interactions and opens new avenues for exploring quantum materials and exotic phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Efficient Long-Range Machine Learning Force Fields for Liquid and Materials Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as a sophisticated tool for cost-efficient atomistic simulations approaching DFT accuracy, with recent message passing MLFFs able to cover the entire periodic table. We present an invariant message passing MLFF architecture (MPNICE) which iteratively predicts atomic partial charges, including long-range interactions, enabling the prediction of charge-dependent properties while achieving 5-20x faster inference versus models with comparable accuracy. We train direct and delta-learned MPNICE models for organic systems, and benchmark against experimental properties of liquid and solid systems. We also benchmark the energetics of finite systems, contributing a new set of torsion scans with charged species and a new set of DLPNO-CCSD(T) references for the TorsionNet500 benchmark. We additionally train and benchmark MPNICE models for bulk inorganic crystals, focusing on structural ranking and mechanical properties. Finally, we explore multi-task models for both inorganic and organic systems, which exhibit slightly decreased performance on domain-specific tasks but surprising generalization, stably predicting the gas phase structure of $\simeq500$ Pt/Ir organometallic complexes despite never training to organometallic complexes of any kind.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a lattice model for the realization of exotic quartic semi-Dirac fermions, i.e. quasiparticles exhibiting a dispersion with quartic momentum dependence in a given direction, and a linear dependence in the perpendicular direction. A tight binding model is employed, allowing for hopping between up to fourth nearest neighbors and anisotropic hopping parameters. In addition, we introduce the effects of electron-electron interactions (both long-range Coulomb, and short range) which are necessary to stabilize the quartic semi-Dirac phase; without interactions the lattice is unstable towards formation of anisotropic Dirac cones.</description>

      <title>Interpretable SHAP-bounded Bayesian Optimization for Underwater Acoustic Metamaterial Coating Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed an interpretability informed Bayesian optimization framework to optimize underwater acoustic coatings based on polyurethane elastomers with embedded metamaterial features. A data driven model was employed to analyze the relationship between acoustic performance, specifically sound absorption and the corresponding design variables. By leveraging SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a machine learning interpretability tool, we identified the key parameters influencing the objective function and gained insights into how these parameters affect sound absorption. The insights derived from the SHAP analysis were subsequently used to automatically refine the bounds of the optimization problem automatically, enabling a more targeted and efficient exploration of the design space.
  The proposed approach was applied to two polyurethane materials with distinct hardness levels, resulting in improved optimal solutions compared to those obtained without SHAP-informed guidance. Notably, these enhancements were achieved without increasing the number of simulation iterations. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SHAP to streamline optimization processes by uncovering hidden parameter relationships and guiding the search toward promising regions of the design space. This work underscores the effectiveness of combining interpretability techniques with Bayesian optimization for the efficient and cost-effective design of underwater acoustic metamaterials under strict computational constraints and can be generalized towards other materials and engineering optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Superradiance Enhanced Light-Matter Interaction in Spatially Ordered Shape and Volume Controlled Single Quantum Dots: Enabling On-Chip Photonic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-chip photonic networks require adequately spatially ordered matter-photon interconversion qubit sources with emission figures-of-merit exceeding the requirements that would enable the desired functional response of the network. The mesa-top single quantum dots (MTSQDs) have recently been demonstrated to meet these requirements. The substrate-encoded size-reducing epitaxy (SESRE) approach underpinning the realization of these quantum emitters allows control on the shape, size, and strain (lattice-matched or mismatched) of these epitaxial single quantum dots. We have exploited this unique feature of the MTSQDs to reproducibly create arrays of quantum dots that exhibit single photon superradiance, characteristic of a delicate balance between the confinement potential volume, depth, and the resulting binding energy of the center of mass motion of the exciton and the exciton binding energy. In the exciton's weak confinement regime, direct enhancement of the quantum dot oscillator strength to ~30 is demonstrated for emitters in large arrays. Our findings provide compelling incentive for investigations of the potential of SESRE based tailored MTSQDs of lattice matched and mismatched material combinations for fabricating and studying interconnected networks enabled by these unique matter qubit-light qubit interconversion units.</description>

      <title>Magnetization Dependent In-plane Anomalous Hall Effect in a Low-dimensional System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous Hall Effect (AHE) response in magnetic systems is typically proportional to an out-of-plane magnetization component because of the restriction imposed by system symmetries, which demands that the magnetization, applied electric field, and induced Hall current are mutually orthogonal to each other. Here, we report experimental realization of an unconventional form of AHE in a low-dimensional heterostructure, wherein the Hall response is not only proportional to the out-of-plane magnetization component but also to the in-plane magnetization component. By interfacing a low-symmetry topological semimetal (TaIrTe4) with the ferromagnetic insulator (Cr2Ge2Te6), we create a low-dimensional magnetic system, where only one mirror symmetry is preserved. We show that as long as the magnetization has a finite component in the mirror plane, this last mirror symmetry is broken, allowing the emergence of an AHE signal proportional to in-plane magnetization. Our experiments, conducted on multiple devices, reveal a gate-voltage-dependent AHE response, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms responsible for the Hall effect in our system can be tuned via electrostatic gating. A minimal microscopic model constrained by the symmetry of the heterostructure shows that both interfacial spin-orbit coupling and time-reversal symmetry breaking via the exchange interaction from magnetization are responsible for the emergence of the in-plane AHE. Our work highlights the importance of system symmetries and exchange interaction in low-dimensional heterostructures for designing novel and tunable Hall effects in layered quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Surface tension estimation of bubble nuclei in magma using spinodal pressure and nonclassical nucleation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efforts to estimate the magma decompression rate from the vesicular texture of volcanic products have progressed through the development of theoretical models and laboratory experiments. The theoretical model is based on nucleation theory, with the surface tension between the melt and bubble nucleus being the parameter that most strongly governs nucleation. Since direct estimation of surface tension is difficult, it has been calculated by inverting the bubble number density (BND) from experimental samples using classical or nonclassical nucleation theory formulas. However, in the nonclassical case, which accounts for the supersaturation dependence of surface tension, the pressure at the spinodal limit (where surface tension becomes zero) was previously unknown, necessitating complex mathematical operations. In this study, the spinodal pressure determined from the Gibbs energy curve was substituted into the nonclassical formula by approximating the water-saturated silicate melt as a two-component symmetric regular solution composed of silicate and water. This approach allowed for a more straightforward estimation of surface tension using data from past decompression experiments. Nevertheless, the resulting surface tension values were more scattered than those obtained using the classical formula, suggesting that applying the nonclassical formula to magma vesiculation is not valid at present. Resolving this issue will likely require an integrated understanding of the dependence of surface tension on both supersaturation and bubble radius. Such understanding would enable more accurate estimation of surface tension and contribute to reconciling the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental BND values.</description>

      <title>Resonant Self-Diffraction of Femtosecond Extreme Ultraviolet Pulses in Cobalt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-diffraction is a non-collinear four-wave mixing technique well-known in optics. We explore self-diffraction in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) range, taking advantage of intense femtosecond EUV pulses produced by a free electron laser. Two pulses are crossed in a thin cobalt film and their interference results in a spatially periodic electronic excitation. The diffraction of one of the same pulses by the associated refractive index modulation is measured as a function of the EUV wavelength. A sharp peak in the self-diffraction efficiency is observed at the M$_{2,3}$ absorption edge of cobalt at 59 eV and a fine structure is found above the edge. The results are compared with a theoretical model assuming that the excitation results in an increase of the electronic temperature. EUV self-diffraction offers a potentially useful spectroscopy tool and will be instrumental in studying coherent effects in the EUV range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the details of the growth of ultra-clean single crystals for RuO2, a candidate material for altermagnetism. By using a crystal-growth tube with a necking structure and precisely controlling the conditions of the sublimation transport method, it is possible to control the morphology of the crystals. We obtained crystals in mainly three kinds of morphology: thick plate-like crystals typically 5 x 3 x 2mm3 and up to 10 x 5 x 2mm3 with a large (101) facet, rhombohedral columnar crystals elongating along the [001] direction, and fiber and needle crystals of length up to 8 mm and the width of 0.1-0.4 mm. These crystals show residual resistivity of about 30 nOhmcm and a residual resistivity ratio (RRR) up to 1200. The crystals do not exhibit any signs of magnetic ordering down to low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Alcohol induced surface charging of colloidal quantum dots for controllable electrophoretic deposition processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report an alcohol-induced surface charging route of colloidal QDs to achieve controllable electrophoretic deposition processing. By adding a fixed amounts of alcohols into a preformed quantum dots solution in non-polar solvents, the colloidal quantum dots can be positively charged, and then deposited on negative electrode under applied electric field. The surface charging of PbSe quantum dots was investigated by zeta potential, nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and discrete Fourier transform calculations. It was found that the zeta potential of oleate acid capped PbSe QDs increases from +1.6 mV to +13.4 mV with the amount of alcohol solvent increasing. The alcohol-induced zeta potential increasing can be explained to the electron cloud shift of active hydrogen mediated by intermolecular hydrogen bonds between carboxy acid and alcohol. Considering the influence of surface charging of quantum dots on their dispersibility, we describe the microscopic mechanism of alcohol-induced electrophoretic deposition processing. Furthermore, we developed a size-selective separation protocol by controlling alcohol-induced electrophoretic deposition processing.</description>

      <title>Analytical gradients of random-phase approximation plus corrections from renormalized single excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random-phase approximation (RPA) formulated within the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation framework is a powerful approach to compute the ground-state energies and properties of molecules and materials. Its overall underbinding behavior can be effectively mitigated by a simple correction term, called renormalized single excitation (rSE) correction. Analytical gradient calculations of the RPA energy have become increasingly available, enabling structural relaxations and even molecular dynamics at the RPA level. However, such calculations at the RPA+rSE level have not been reported, due to the lack of the rSE analytical gradient. Here, we present the first formulation and implementation of the analytical gradients of the rSE energy with respect to the nuclear coordinates within an atomic-orbital basis set framework, which allows us to assess the performance of RPA+rSE in determining the molecular geometries and energetics. It is found that the slight overestimation behavior of RPA for small covalently bonded molecules is strengthened by rSE, while such behavior for molecules bonded with purely dispersion interactions is corrected. We further applied the approach to the water clusters, and found that the energy difference between the low-energy isomers of water hexamers is almost unchanged when going from RPA to RPA+rSE geometries. For the bigger WATER27 test set, using the RPA+rSE geometries instead of the RPA ones leads to a slight reduction of the mean absolute error of RPA+rSE from 0.91 kcal/mol to 0.70 kcal/mol, at the complete basis set.</description>

      <title>Charge transfer between van der Waals coupled metallic 2D layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have become a rapidly growing field in condensed matter research, offering a platform to engineer novel quantum systems by stacking different two-dimensional (2D) materials. A diverse range of material combinations, including hexagonal boron nitride, transition metal dichalcogenides and graphene, with electronic properties spanning from insulating to semiconducting, metallic, and semimetallic, have been explored to tune the properties of these heterostacks. However, understanding the interactions and charge transfer between the stacked layers remains challenging, particularly when more than two layers are involved. In this study, we investigate the charge transfer in a potassium-adlayer/graphene/lead-monolayer heterostructure stacked on a SiC substrate. Using synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we analyze the band structure of each layer, focusing on the charge transfer from K to the underlying 2D layers. Since K forms a $(2 \times 2)$ overlayer with respect to graphene, the amount of charge carriers donated by K can be determined. Our findings reveal that adsorption of K not only leads to a significant $n$-doping of the adjacent graphene layer but also to an electron transfer into the Pb monolayer. Remarkably, $\approx 44\%$ of the electrons donated by the K adlayer are transferred into its second nearest neighbouring layer, i.e. Pb, while $\approx 56\%$ remain in the graphene.</description>

      <title>On the internal architecture of lightweight negative Poisson's ratio (auxetic) metastructures: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of lightweight materials with enhanced mechanical properties has been a long-standing challenge in science and engineering. Lightweight auxetic metastructures (AMSs) provide attractive solutions to this problem. AMSs' negative Poisson's ratio is a unique characteristic which results in very interesting practical properties such as high energy absorption and improved toughness. Different properties of metastrcutures, including anisotropy, are dependent, in addition to their original material, on the unit cell shape and geometrical features which have very high variations. Over the past few years, researchers have developed AMSs with various unit cells, either introducing new internal architecture or enhancing and optimizing the existing ones. Despite the progress made in this field, there is no comprehensive review of the AMS unit cells. This review describes the cellular AMSs associated with a classified set of metastructures, comprising more than 100 distinct auxetic repetitive unit cells. Besides, achievable range of negative Poisson's ratios are provided for different categories of AMSs. Finally, the future perspective of the research field and potential developments and applications in this field are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single crystals are essential for characterizing a wide range of magnetic states, including exotic ones such as quantum spin liquids. This study reports a flux method for growing single crystals of NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$, the first quantum spin liquid candidate on a triangular spin lattice with dominant Ising like spin correlations. Purple NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ single crystals with hexagonal morphology were successfully grown using a K$_2$Mo$_3$O$_{10}$-B$_2$O$_3$ flux. With lateral sizes up to 3.5 mm and a thickness up to 2 mm, these are the largest dimensions reported to date. The chemical composition was confirmed by powder and single-crystal X-ray diffraction along with scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Aiming for an accurate determination of the magnetic anisotropy and its effect on the magnetic properties, NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ crystals were additionally analyzed by magnetic susceptibility, revealing a substantial anisotropy without long-range magnetic ordering down to 2 K. Single crystals of two novel rare-earth heptatantalates, ErTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and GdTa$_7$O$_{19}$, were also grown and their magnetic properties investigated. The magnetic anisotropy of ErTa$_7$O$_{19}$ closely resembles that of isostructural NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$, indicating a possibility of a similar exotic magnetic ground state. In contrast, GdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ shows paramagnetic behavior, consistent with previous results obtained for polycrystalline samples.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Machine Learning Potentials for Hydroxide Transport: Surprising Efficiency of Single-Concentration Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the transferability of machine learning interatomic potentials across concentration variations in chemically similar systems, using aqueous potassium hydroxide solutions as a case study. Despite containing identical chemical species (K$^+$, OH$^-$, H$_2$O) across all concentrations, models fine-tuned on specific KOH concentrations exhibit surprisingly poor transferability to others, with force prediction errors increasing dramatically from ~30 meV/A (at training concentration) to ~90 meV/A (at very different concentrations). This reveals a critical limitation when applying such models beyond their training domain, even within chemically homogeneous systems. We demonstrate that strategic selection of training data can substantially overcome these limitations without requiring extensive computational resources. Models fine-tuned on intermediate concentrations (6.26 mol/L) exhibit remarkable transferability across the entire concentration spectrum (0.56-17.98 mol/L), often outperforming more computationally expensive models trained on multiple concentration datasets. This approach enables accurate simulation of hydroxide transport dynamics across varying electrolyte conditions while maintaining near-quantum accuracy. Our simulations further reveal the emergence of hydroxide-hydroxide hydrogen bonding at high concentrations - a phenomenon not explicitly represented in dilute training data but successfully captured by our intermediate-concentration model. This work establishes practical guidelines for developing broadly applicable machine learning force fields with optimal transferability, challenging the assumption that diverse training datasets are always necessary for robust performance in similar chemical environments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce second-gradient models for incompressible viscous fluids, building on the framework introduced by Fried and Gurtin. We propose a new and simple constitutive relation for the hyperpressure to ensure that the models are both physically meaningful and mathematically well-posed. The framework is further extended to incorporate pressure-dependent viscosities. We show that for the pressure-dependent viscosity model, the inclusion of second-gradient effects guarantees the ellipticity of the governing pressure equation, in contrast to previous models rooted in classical continuum mechanics. The constant viscosity model is applied to steady cylindrical flows, where explicit solutions are derived under both strong and weak adherence boundary conditions. In each case, we establish convergence of the velocity profiles to the classical Navier-Stokes solutions as the model's characteristic length scales tend to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computational framework for first-principles density matrix transport within the Wigner function formalism to predict transport of quantum-mechanical degrees of freedom such as spin over long time and length scales. This framework facilitates simulation of spin dynamics and transport from first principles, while accounting for electron-phonon scattering at device length scales. We demonstrate this framework to elucidate the impact of various spin-orbit field profiles, such as Rashba and persistent spin helix, on coherent spin transport in several materials. Using graphene under an electric field as an example to illustrate the impact of electron-phonon scattering on incoherent transport, we show how the transport changes with the strength of scattering. We identify three distinct regimes of incoherent spin transport corresponding to the free induction decay, Dyakonov-Perel and Elliott-Yafet regimes of spin relaxation. In particular, we show that the spin diffusion length is insensitive to the strength of scattering within the Dyakonov-Perel regime.</description>

      <title>Circulators based on Coupled Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulators and Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated plasmonics is advancing rapidly, enabling a wide range of functionalities to be incorporated onto a single chip. Applications span information processing, computation, quantum sensing, and dark-matter detection. This progress has driven the development of integrated non-reciprocal devices, which are essential for preventing unwanted feedback that can degrade system performance. While non-reciprocal devices have been realized in edge magnetoplasmon materials via classical interference effects, their operation is often complicated by a dependence on input power. Here, we demonstrate that topological circulators utilizing asymmetric coupling offer improved input power range, isolation, and insertion loss. In this configuration, non-reciprocal behavior arises from the coupling between a chiral edge magnetoplasmonic resonator and LC resonators, leading to non-Hermitian dynamics. The coherent photon-plasmon interaction enables a circulator with up to 50 dB of isolation across a broad range of excitation intensities. This is the first experimental demonstration showing that magnetic topological insulators can support the study of chiral plasmonic cavity quantum electrodynamics at radio frequencies, underscoring their potential to enable chip-scale quantum-classical interfaces in superconducting quantum information processing systems.</description>

      <title>Classical symmetry enriched topological orders and distinct monopole charges for dipole-octupole spin ices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distinct symmetry enriched topological orders often do not have classical distinctions. Motivated by the recent process on the pyrochlore spin ice materials based on the dipole-octupole doublets, we argue that dipolar spin liquid and octupolar spin liquid can be well differentiated through the magnetic charges of the magnetic monopoles in the classical spin ice regime. It is observed and predicted that, the long-range dipole-dipole interaction renders the magnetic monopole of the dipolar spin ice a finite magnetic charge via the dumbbell picture even in the classical regime. For the octupolar spin ice, however, a zero magnetic charge is expected from this mechanism in the classical regime. We expect this smoking-gun observation to resolve the debate on the nature of Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, and more broadly, this work may inspire further experiments and thoughts on the Ce-pyrochlore spin liquids, Nd-pyrochlore antiferromagnets, Er-based spinels, and the distinct properties of the emergent quasiparticles in various symmetry enriched topological phases.</description>

      <title>Ineffectiveness of Formamidine in Suppressing Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Cubic Hybrid Perovskite FAPbI3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01134v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fundamentally understanding the lattice dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites remains elusive, primarily due to their strong anharmonicity and frequent phase transitions. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the thermal transport behavior in cubic hybrid perovskite FAPbI3, integrating first principles-based anharmonic lattice dynamics with a linearized Wigner transport formula. The Temperature Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP) technique allows us to stabilize the negative soft modes, primarily dominated by organic cations, at finite temperatures in cubic FAPbI3. We then predict an ultra-low thermal conductivity of ~0.63 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) in cubic FAPbI3 at 300 K, with a temperature dependence of T^(-0.740), suggesting a good crystalline nature of phonon transport. Notably, the ultra-low thermal conductivity in cubic FAPbI3 is primarily attributed to the [PbI3]1- units, challenging the conventional focus on organic FA+ cations. This shift in focus is due to the presence of Pb(s)-I(p) anti-bonding sates within the [PbI3]1- units. Furthermore, thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 is predominantly governed by the particle-like phonon propagation channel across the entire temperature range of 300-500 K, a result of diminished suppression of low-frequency phonons by FA+ cations and large inter-branch spacings. Finally, our findings underscore that the anharmonic force constants are highly temperature-sensitive, leading to underestimations of thermal conductivity when relying on 0-K anharmonic force constants. Our study not only elucidates the microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 but also provides a crucial framework for the discovery, design, and understanding of hybrid organic-inorganic compounds with ultra-low thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Inverse Faraday effect in 3d, 4d, and 5d transition metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the spin contributions to the inverse Faraday effect (IFE) in transition metals. The IFE depends on the d-electron filling and asymmetry between excited electron and hole spin moments. Our results reveal that even elements with smaller electron magnetic moments, like Os, can exhibit higher IFE due to greater electron-hole asymmetry. Pt shows the highest IFE in the 1-2 eV frequency range, while Os dominates in the 2-4 eV range. In addition, we demonstrate that the IFE of neighboring elements with similar crystal structures (e.g., Ir, Pt, and Au) can be tuned by adjusting their Fermi levels, indicating the importance of d-electron filling on IFE. Finally, we find that the trend in electron (or hole) contributions to the IFE closely follows that of the spin Hall conductivity, however, the total IFE involves more complex interactions.</description>

Abstract: Coherent optical phonons in the degenerate inter-layer shear mode of graphite launched by femtosecond laser pulses were investigated using ultrafast electron diffraction. The collective atomic motion is shown to be polarized in a direction related to the linear polarization of the incoming laser pulse. Using a fit with a generic driven-oscillator model, the lifetime of the oscillator's driving force is determined to 37(30) fs. This is much shorter than the lifetime of excited carriers in graphite but similar to the time scale of the loss of the hot carrier's k-space anisotropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling often dominates the electron spectral functions and carrier transport properties. However, studies of this effect in real materials have largely relied on perturbative one-shot methods due to the lack of a first-principles theoretical and computational framework. Here, we present a self-consistent theory and implementation for the nonperturbative calculations of spectral functions and conductivity due to electron-phonon coupling. Applying this method to monolayer InSe, we demonstrate that self-consistency qualitatively affects the spectral function and transport properties compared to state-of-the-art one-shot calculations and allows one to reconcile calculations with angle-resolved photoemission experiments. The developed method can be widely applied to materials with dominant electron-phonon coupling at a moderate computational cost.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure of Kramers Nodal-Line Semimetal YAuGe and Anomalous Hall Effect Induced by Magnetic Rare-Earth Substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals are a class of topological materials hosting one dimensional lines of band degeneracy. Kramers nodal-line (KNL) metals/semimetals have recently been theoretically recognized as a class of topological states inherent to all non-centrosymmetric achiral crystal lattices. We investigate the electronic structure of candidate KNL semimetal YAuGe by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and quantum oscillations as well as by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. DFT has revealed that YAuGe hosts KNLs on the G-A-L-M plane of the Brillouin zone, that are protected by the time reversal and mirror-inversion symmetries. Through ARPES and quantum oscillations we identify signatures of hole bands enclosing the G point, and the observed splitting of quantum oscillation frequency with angle is attributed to spin-orbit-coupling-induced band splitting away from the KNLs. Furthermore, we show that the degeneracy of the nodal lines along the G-A line is lifted by the time-reversal-symmetry breaking when the Y is substituted by magnetic R ions (R = rare earth). This becomes a source of Berry curvature and contributes to the anomalous Hall effect in magnetic RAuGe. These findings establish RAuGe as a new class of KNL semimetals offering significant potential for engineering of anomalous magnetotransport properties via magnetic rare-earth substitution.</description>

      <title>Phase-field modeling of radiation-induced composition redistribution: An application to additively manufactured austenitic Fe-Cr-Ni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multicomponent alloys undergoing irradiation damage develop radiation-induced composition redistribution at point defect sinks such as grain boundaries (GBs) and dislocations. Such redistribution results in undesired changes to their mechanical behavior and corrosion resistance. Additively manufactured alloys proposed for future nuclear applications are expected to demonstrate a distinct response to irradiation owing to their unique microstructure with as-solidified dislocation density and chemical microsegregation. To capture the composition redistribution in such systems, we develop a mesoscale model with coupled evolution of atomic and point defect components in the presence of dislocation density, dislocation heterogeneity, and thermodynamic interactions at the GB. The model is parameterized for an FCC Fe-Cr-Ni alloy as a representative system for austenitic stainless steels, and simulations are performed in 1D and 2D as a function of irradiation temperature, dose, dislocation density, and grain size. Radiation-induced segregation (RIS) characterized by Cr depletion and Ni enrichment is predicted at both the GB and the dislocation cell wall, with RIS being lower in magnitude but wider at the cell wall. Strongly biased absorption of self-interstitials by dislocations is found to suppress Ni enrichment but slightly enhance Cr depletion under certain conditions. Thermodynamic segregation at the GB is predicted to be narrower and opposite in sign to RIS for both Cr and Ni. Importantly, non-monotonic segregation is found to occur when both thermodynamic and RIS mechanisms are considered, providing a novel physical interpretation of experimental observations. The model is expected to serve as a key tool in accelerated qualification of irradiated materials.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic exciton transport and recombination in single-crystal lead bromide perovskite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photogenerated carrier transport and recombination in metal halide perovskites are critical to device performance. Despite considerable efforts, sample quality issues and measurement techniques have limited the access to their intrinsic physics. Here, by utilizing high-purity CsPbBr3 single crystals and contact-free transient grating spectroscopy, we directly monitor exciton diffusive transport from 26 to 300 K. As the temperature (T) increases, the carrier mobility ({\mu}) decreases rapidly below 100 K wtih a {\mu}~T^{-3.0} scaling, and then follows a more gradual {\mu}~T^{-1.7} trend at higher temperatures. First-principles calculations perfectly reproduce this experimental trend and reveal that optical phonon scattering governs carrier mobility shifts over the entire temperature range, with a single longitudinal optical mode dominating room-temperature transport. Time-resolved photoluminescence further identifies a substantial increase in exciton radiative lifetime with temperature, attributed to increased exciton population in momentum-dark states caused by phonon scattering. Our findings unambiguously resolve previous theory-experiment discrepancies, providing benchmarks for future optoelectronic design.</description>

Abstract: Material systems with lone-pair electrons have long been a treasure trove in the search for large second harmonic generation effects. Revealing the origin of second harmonic generation in nonlinear optical materials can provide theoretical guidance for the design of new materials. In this work, the origin of second harmonic generation in non-centrosymmetric materials containing lone pair electrons is revealed by analyzing the orbital interactions on the sublattice. Stereochemically inactive Pb 6\textit{s} orbitals with high symmetry in CsPbCO3F contribute less to the second harmonic generation. In contrast, the contribution of stereochemically active Pb 6s orbital in PbB5O7F3 and PbB2O3F2 is more obvious. Significantly, the orbitals of the interaction between lead and oxygen make a very significant contribution because these orbitals are located at the band edge and in non-centrosymmetric sublattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The incorporation of dilute concentrations of bismuth (Bi) into traditional III V alloys leads to significant reduction in bandgap energy, making InSbBi is a promising candidate for long wavelength infrared photodetection sensors due to its small bandgap (&lt;0.17 eV). Furthermore, InSbBi could serve as a valuable platform for spin dynamics and quantum phenomena due to its strong spin-orbit coupling. Despite its potential, the material quality of InSbBi alloys lags behind that of conventional III V semiconductors, primarily due to the substantial challenges associated with incorporating Bi into InSb and producing high-quality InSbBi with varying Bi compositions. In this study, we address these issues by developing a method for growing smooth InSbBi thin films with tunable Bi incorporation up to 1.81% by the dynamic adjustment of Sb flux and careful control of the interplay between growth temperature and Bi flux using molecular beam epitaxy. This work paves the path for high-quality InSbBi thin films for applications in photodetection, spintronics, and quantum technology.</description>

Abstract: Weyl semimetals have attracted significant interest in condensed matter physics and materials science, due to their unique electronic and topological properties. These characteristics not only deepen our understanding of fundamental quantum phenomena, but also make Weyl semimetals promising candidates for advanced applications in electronics, photonics, and spintronics. This review provides a systematic overview of the field, covering theoretical foundations, material synthesis, engineering strategies, and emerging device applications. We first outline the key theoretical principles and distinctive properties of Weyl semimetals, followed by an examination of recent advancements that enhance their functional versatility. Finally, we discuss the critical challenges hindering their practical implementation and explore future development directions, along with the potential for expanding and enhancing their existing range of applications. By integrating discussions of both opportunities and obstacles, this review offers a balanced perspective on current progress and future directions in Weyl semimetal research.</description>

Abstract: We present GPR_calculator, a package based on Python and C++ programming languages to build an on-the-fly surrogate model using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to approximate expensive electronic structure calculations. The key idea is to dynamically train a GPR model during the simulation that can accurately predict energies and forces with uncertainty quantification. When the uncertainty is high, the expensive electronic structure calculation is performed to obtain the ground truth data, which is then used to update the GPR model. To illustrate the power of GPR_calculator, we demonstrate its application in Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) simulations of surface diffusion and reactions, achieving 3-10 times acceleration compared to pure ab initio calculations. The source code is available at https://github.com/MaterSim/GPR_calculator.</description>

Abstract: In situ synchrotron X-ray computed tomography enables dynamic material studies, but automated segmentation remains challenging due to complex imaging artefacts and limited training data. We present a methodology for deep learning-based segmentation by transforming high-quality ex situ laboratory data to train models for binary segmentation of in situ synchrotron data, demonstrated through copper oxide dissolution studies. Using a modified SegFormer architecture, our approach achieves high segmentation performance on unseen data while reducing processing time from hours to seconds per 3D dataset. The method maintains consistent performance over significant morphological changes during experiments, despite training only on static specimens. This methodology can be readily applied to diverse materials systems, accelerating the analysis of time-resolved tomographic data across scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic band splitting in 10 nm epitaxial CrSb thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a newly identified family of collinear antiferromagnets with momentum-dependent spin-split band structure of non-relativistic origin, derived from spin-group symmetry-protected crystal structures. Among candidate altermagnets, CrSb is attractive for potential applications because of a large spin-splitting near the Fermi level and a high Neel transition temperature of around 700 K. We use molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize CrSb (0001) thin films with thicknesses ranging from 10 nm to 100 nm. Structural characterization, using reflection high energy electron diffraction, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction, demonstrates the growth of epitaxial films with good crystallinity. Polarized neutron reflectometry shows the absence of any net magnetization, consistent with antiferromagnetic order. In vacuo angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements probe the band structure in a previously unexplored regime of film thickness, down to 10 nm. These ARPES measurements show a three-dimensional momentum-dependent band splitting of up to 0.7 eV with g-wave symmetry, consistent with that seen in prior studies of bulk single crystals.

      <title>Revisiting the Exact Dynamical Structure Factor of the Heisenberg Antiferromagnetic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3855</link>
      <description>arXiv:1402.3855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit our initial derivations of the exact 2-spinon $S_2$ and 4-spinon $S_4$ dynamical structure factors (DSF). First we show that the latter derivations had normalization factors that are twice and quadriple the correct ones respectively. This means that $S_2$ contributes not 72% as was previously thought but 36% to the total DSF. We also calculated the contribution of $S_4$ to be between 18% and 20% and not 27% as was calculated by Caux and Hagemans. In fact we show that the latter reference had also the normalization factor twice the correct value and had it done the numeric integrations correctly it would have obtained a contribution between 36% and 40% for $S_4$. Furthermore, we prove that its claim that our initial derivation of $S_4$ was also incorrect in its dependency on the spectral parameters is incorrect because fixing the momentun transfer $k$ up to $2\pi$ as the latter reference did to justify its claim only amounts to mutltiplying the overall factor by 2 because as we will prove in this paper $S_4$ is periodic in $k$ with period $2\pi$. Also in this paper we derive $S_n$ for general $n$ by following a different approach compared to our initial derivation of $S_4$. Although for $S_4$ both the new derivation and the initial one lead to equivalent formulas that are expressed differently, the new form presented in this paper is much more elegant and compact and also reveals new hidden and nontrivial symmetries which substantially simplify the numeric evaluation of $S_4$ and its sum rules. Moreover based on the results of this paper we propose a simple approximation to the total DSF of the Heisenberg model. Finally we comment on how our work might resolve the discrepancy between the exact theoretic results and experiemntal data as reported by Zaliznyak et al.</description>

      <title>New experimental evidence for Podkletnov effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the works of E. Podkletnov et al. (for example [Physica C: Superconductivity, 1992, Vol. 203, p. 441]), a unique experiment is described in which a significant reduction in the weight of various test bodies was observed when placed above a rotating disk made of the superconductor YBa2Cu3O6+delta (YBCO); the disk was in the superconducting state (at 20-70 K) and was subjected to an alternating (50 Hz-100 MHz) magnetic field. Numerous attempts to replicate this experiment in other laboratories have been unsuccessful; however, a broad discussion has been initiated regarding the possible nature of the "Podkletnov effect" - the weight loss of objects located above the superconductor. In the present experimental work, results similar to the Podkletnov effect have been obtained, which, however, occur at room temperature. During our experiments, gas-tight containers with the crystal hydrate K2CO3X1.5H2O and dispersed YBCO exhibited a sharp loss of part of their weight during and after 0.5 hours of exposure to a magnetic field with a frequency of 50 MHz. Changes in the weight of various test bodies located in close proximity to the containers were recorded. It was found that these weight changes correlate with the external surface area of the bodies and do not depend on their chemical nature. A dependence of the magnitude of weight changes on the oxygen content in YBCO was obtained, which shows a significant dip in the region where superstructural orderings of the oxygen sublattice exist in the basal plane. This dip coincides in shape with the well-known dip in the dependence of Tc on delta (the "60-K plateau"). The possible connection between these two extraordinary phenomena coexisting in YBCO compounds - inexplicable weight changes and high-temperature superconductivity - is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that in the chiral limit of the Bistritzer--MacDonald Hamiltonian, there exist magic angles at which the Hamiltonian exhibits flat bands of multiplicity four instead of two. We analyse the structure of Bloch functions associated with the bands of arbitrary multiplicity, compute the corresponding Chern number to be $ -1 $, and show that there exist infinitely many degenerate magic angles for a generic choice of tunnelling potential, including the Bistritzer--MacDonald potential. Moreover, we demonstrate for generic tunnelling potentials flat bands have only twofold or fourfold multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Double Splay Nematic Order in Confined Polar Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we demonstrate that when a ferroelectric nematic is confined between two glass plates coated with ionic polymers, a modulated phase emerges in a narrow temperature range between the nematic and ferroelectric nematic phases. This modulated phase emerges from the nematic phase in a continuous manner and then transforms into the ferroelectric nematic phase via a first-order transition upon cooling. Using optical microscopy, we provide compelling evidence that this modulated phase corresponds to the theoretically predicted double splay nematic phase. In this phase, splay deformations alternate in two orthogonal directions oriented at 45{\deg} to the substrate surfaces, creating a modulation wavelength that is twice the thickness of the cell. Our experiments with different ionic coatings reveal that only polymeric cationic coatings effectively promote the formation of this phase, highlighting the critical role of electrical screening. These findings not only confirm the existence of the double splay nematic phase but also provide insights into the distinctive topological defects of this phase in confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Dirac points and Weyl phase in a honeycomb altermagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a graphene derivative displaying novel topological phenomena without the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a collinear altermagnet. Band degeneracies in spin-split honeycomb antiferromagnets produce unique distribution patterns of Berry curvature and give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. The asymmetric Berry curvature due to spin splitting can be created by lifting the degeneracies, which concentrate intensely at Weyl points contributing to carrier dynamics with a large valley Hall effect. The altermagnetism breaks the intrinsic time-reversal symmetry, guaranteeing the formation of pairs of Weyl points associated with the internal spin structure chiralities. We investigate the evolution of Dirac and Weyl crossings, in which topological phase transitions are characterized by the high Chern numbers preserving the non-intersecting flows of Wannier centers over occupied bands. Our results yield unique degeneracy-protected states by leveraging the symmetry constraints, where corresponding experiments are illustrated to demonstrate the potential of advancing valleytronic devices via unconventional topological responses.</description>

      <title>Spin density wave and van Hove singularity in the kagome metal CeTi3Bi4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kagome metals with van Hove singularities near the Fermi level can host intriguing quantum phenomena such as chiral loop currents, electronic nematicity, and unconventional superconductivity. However, to our best knowledge, unconventional magnetic states driven by van Hove singularities--like spin-density waves--have not been observed experimentally in kagome metals. Here, we report the magnetic and electronic structure of the layered kagome metal CeTi3Bi4, where Ti kagome electronic structure interacts with a magnetic sublattice of Ce3+ Jeff = 1/2 moments. Neutron diffraction reveals an incommensurate spin-density wave ground state of the Ce3+ moments, coexisting with commensurate antiferromagnetic order across most of the temperature-field phase diagram. The commensurate component is preferentially suppressed by thermal fluctuations and magnetic field, yielding a rich phase diagram involving an intermediate single-Q spin-density wave phase. First-principles calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy identify van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, with the observed magnetic propagation vectors connecting their high density of states, strongly suggesting a van Hove singularity-assisted spin-density wave. These findings establish kagome metals LnTi3Bi4 as a model platform where the characteristic electronic structure of the kagome lattice plays a pivotal role in magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Josephson Field Effect Transistors with InAs on Insulator and High Permittivity Gate Dielectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: InAs on Insulator (InAsOI) has been recently demonstrated as a promising platform to develop hybrid semiconducting-superconducting Josephson Junctions (JJs) and Josephson Field Effect Transistors (JoFETs). The InAsOI consists of an InAs epilayer grown onto a cryogenic-electrically-insulating InAlAs metamorphic buffer, which allows the electrical decoupling of surface-exposed adjacent devices together with a high critical current density integration. The miniaturization of Si microchips has progressed significantly due to the integration of high permittivity (high-k) gate insulators, allowing an increased gate coupling with the transistor channel with consequent reduced gate operating voltages and leakages. As well as for Si-based FETs, integrating high-k gate insulators with JoFETs promises similar advantages in superconducting electronics. Here, we investigate the gate-tunable electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs featuring different high-k gate insulators, namely, HfO2 and Al2O3. We found that both the ungated and gate-tunable electrical properties of the JoFETs are strongly dependent on the insulator chosen. With both dielectrics, the JoFETs can entirely suppress the switching current and increase the normal state resistance by 10-20 times using negative gate voltages. The HfO2-JoFETs exhibit improved gate-tunable electrical performance compared to those achieved with Al2O3-JoFETs, which is related to the higher permittivity of the insulator. Gate-dependent electrical properties of InAsOI-based JoFETs were evaluated in the temperature range from 50 mK to 1 K. Moreover, under the influence of an out-of-plane magnetic field, JoFETs exhibited an unconventional Fraunhofer diffraction pattern, from which an edge-peaked supercurrent density distribution was calculated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parity-time-reversal symmetric ($\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric) magnets have garnered much attention due to their spin-charge coupled dynamics enriched by the parity-symmetry breaking. By real-time simulations, we study how localized spin dynamics can affect the nonlinear Hall effect in $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric magnets. To identify the leading-order term, we derive analytical expressions for the second-order optical response and classify the contributions by considering their transformation properties under $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry. Notably, our results reveal that the sizable contribution is attributed to the mixed dipole effect, which is analogous to the Berry curvature dipole term.</description>

      <title>Phonon-mediated electron attraction in SrTiO$_3$ via the generalized Fr\"ohlich and deformation potential mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity in doped SrTiO$_3$ was discovered in 1964, the first superconducting transition observed in a doped semiconductor. However, the mechanism of electron pairing in SrTiO$_3$ remains a subject of debate. By developing a theoretical framework to incorporate dynamical lattice screening in the electronic Coulomb interactions of semiconductors and insulators, we demonstrate analytically that linear long-range coupling of electrons to multiple longitudinal optical phonons, described by a generalized Fr\"ohlich mechanism, can result in superconductivity in SrTiO$_3$. Moreover, by combining our theory with first-principles calculations, we reveal an additional attractive interaction between electrons in SrTiO$_3$ due to the deformation potential mechanism, arising from the mixed ionic-covalent character of the Ti-O bond. Our results may have implications for the emergence of phonon-mediated electron attraction and superconductivity in a broad range of materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the local-density approximation (LDA), one of the most successful approximations in DFT. In this work, we extend the concept of UEG by introducing excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface created by the excitation of electrons near the Fermi level. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.</description>

      <title>Time-delayed Newton's law of cooling with a finite-rate thermal quench: Impact on the Mpemba and Kovacs effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba and Kovacs effects are two notable memory phenomena observed in nonequilibrium relaxation processes. In a recent study [Phys.~Rev.~E \textbf{109}, 044149 (2024)], these effects were analyzed within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling under the assumption of instantaneous temperature quenches. Here, the analysis is extended to incorporate finite-rate quenches, characterized by a nonzero quench duration $\sigma$. The results indicate that a genuine Mpemba effect is absent under finite-rate quenches if both samples experience the same thermal environment during the quenching process. However, if $\sigma$ remains sufficiently small, the deviations in the thermal environment stay within an acceptable range, allowing the Mpemba effect to persist with a slightly enhanced magnitude. In contrast, the Kovacs effect is significantly amplified, with the transient hump in the temperature evolution becoming more pronounced as both the waiting time and $\sigma$ increase. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating finite-time effects in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation models and offer a more realistic perspective for experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Universal analytical modeling of coated plasmonic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a structural point of view, plasmonic nanoparticles are always at least two-layer structures with a dielectric layer of stabilizing, targeting, fluorescent, Raman, or other functional molecules. To optimize the optical properties of such bioconjugates, one needs efficient analytical models based on simple physical ideas and with reasonable accuracy comparable to rigorous numerical methods requiring significant computer resources. Recently, we suggested an analytical approach based on a combination of the modal expansion method (MEM) and the dipole equivalence method (DEM). Here, we extend the MEM+DEM approach for particles of various shapes and orientations. To illustrate the possibilities of our method, we calculate extinction and scattering spectra of gold and silver nanorods, nanodiscs, triangle nanoprisms, bicones, and bipyramids with a dielectric coating thickness from 0 to 100 nm. For the main plasmonic peaks, we found excellent agreement between our analytical method and numerical simulations performed with COMSOL, except for some disagreement between MEM and COMSOL solutions for bicones with small rounding radii. To illustrate the application of our method, we prepared 12 AuNR samples using a chemical etching with fine tuning of the LPR over the 1020-580 nm range. By including the CTAB shell in the simulation model, we achieved excellent agreement between the calculated and measured dependence of the LPR peak position on the AuNR aspect ratio. In summary, our method uses the MEM parameters of the original metal particles and does not require additional numerical calculations to build analytical models for bilayered or multilayered conjugates. Due to the simplicity and reasonable accuracy analytical models, they can help apply machine learning to predict various plasmonic responses such as light absorption, scattering, SERS, and metal-enhanced fluorescence.</description>

While defining the correlated space is straightforward for disentangled bands, the situation is more complex for entangled bands, where different projection schemes from hybridized bands to the target space can yield varying sizes of interaction parameters. We systematically evaluated different methods for calculating the polarizability functions within the correlated space. Furthermore, we analyze how different definitions of the correlated space, often constructed through Wannierization from Kohn-Sham orbitals, defines the orbital localization and play a crucial role in determining the interaction parameter. To illustrate these effects, we consider two sets of representative correlated d-orbital oxides: LiMO$_{2}$ (M = V-Ni) as examples of isolated d-electron systems and SrMO$_{3}$ (M = Mn, Fe, and Co) as cases of entangled d-electron systems. Through this systematic comparison, we provide a detailed analysis of different cRPA methodologies for computing the Hubbard parameters.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, various nanoporous solid sorbents have drawn significant research interest as promising carbon capture materials. However, the issues of high synthesis cost, limited CO2 adsorption capacity, slow adsorption-desorption kinetics, high sorbent regeneration temperature, and poor operational stability remain challenges to overcome before their practical implementation. In contrast, natural silk-fibroin, a blend of various amino acids, could be a promising material to realize low-cost carbon capture technology due to its amine-like CO2 capture behavior, light weight, natural abundance, scalable processing, and biocompatibility. Here, we present mulberry silk-derived silk-nano-fibroin aerogel that exhibits a high specific surface area and a remarkably high CO2 adsorption capacity (~3.65+-0.18 mmol CO2/gm sorbent at 0.15 atm CO2 and 5 oC), making it competitive with state-of-the-art solid sorbents. The thermogravimetry analysis reveals that the thermal degradation temperature of silk-nano-fibroin aerogel is around 250 {\deg}C, significantly higher than conventional amines used for carbon capture. Furthermore, the silk-nano-fibroin-based sorbent demonstrates rapid adsorption-desorption kinetics, complete regeneration at a temperature as low as 60 {\deg}C, promising stability over multiple adsorption-desorption cycles, and maintains its adsorption capacity under humid conditions. Overall, this study highlights natural silk's promising carbon capture potential for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Engineering inter-band coupling in a two-band superconductor by topological defects</title>

Abstract: The vast majority of superconductors have more than one Fermi surface, on which the electrons pair below the critical temperature TC, yet their superconducting behavior can be well described by a single-band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. This is mostly due to inter-band scattering, especially in superconductors in the dirty limit, rigidly linking the pairing amplitude of the different bands. This effect has severely limited experimental studies of the complex physics of multi-band superconductivity. In this study, we utilize the fact that elementary Pb - as a clean limit system - has two Fermi surfaces that are only weakly coupled by inter-band scattering, allowing the formation of two separate condensates. By studying elementary crystal defects in the form of stacking faults with our millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope, we show how to locally tune inter-band coupling ranging from weak to strong coupling and modify the superconducting order parameters around defects. The experiments critically test the theory of multi-band superconductors and give a route to access a wide range of predicted quantum effects in these systems.</description>
