      <title>Role of stress/strain in tailoring the magnetic and transport properties of magnetic thin films and multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy is a fundamental property of magnetic materials that determines the alignment of the spins along the preferential direction, called the easy axis of magnetization. Magnetic polycrystalline thin films offer several advantages over magnetic epitaxial thin films because of fabrication flexibility, higher coercivity and improved magnetic stability, higher magnetoresistance (useful in magneto-resistive devices such as magnetic field sensors and MRAM cells), cost-effectiveness and thermal stability, etc. In the case of polycrystalline thin films or multilayers, Magneto-crystalline anisotropy (MCA) is not expected due to the random orientation of grains. Therefore, understanding the origin of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA) is generally difficult and can't be understood in terms of crystal orientation. The origin of UMA in polycrystalline films is often related to the preparation conditions and substrate properties. In the present thesis, we have provided direct in-situ real-time evidence of the stress dependence of magnetic anisotropy through the multibeam optical stress sensor (MOSS) technique. Also, we have tuned the magnetic anisotropy in strength and direction using externally applied stress. To further increase the strength of the magnetic anisotropy, we have developed a new technique that creates a multilayer using a single magnetic material through sequential oblique and normal depositions. This oblique angle deposition technique also helps reduce the penetration of the top ferromagnetic layer inside the organic semiconductor layer in organic spin valve structures. We confirm our results through various in-situ (in UHV and HV) and ex-situ temperature-dependent conventional and unconventional structural, morphological, and magnetic measurements (both lab-based and synchrotron-based) that include MOKE, KERR, GIXRD, AFM, RHEED, and GISAXS, etc. measurements.</description>

      <title>Microstructural and Transport Characteristics of Triply Periodic Bicontinuous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D bicontinuous two-phase materials are increasingly gaining interest because of their unique multifunctional characteristics and advancements in techniques to fabricate them. Due to their complex topological and structural properties, it still has been nontrivial to develop explicit microstructure-dependent formulas to predict accurately their physical properties. A primary goal of the present paper is to ascertain various microstructural and transport characteristics of five different models of triply periodic bicontinuous porous materials at a porosity $\phi_1=1/2$: those in which the two-phase interfaces are the Schwarz P, Schwarz D and Schoen G minimal surfaces as well as two different pore-channel structures. We ascertain their spectral densities, pore-size distribution functions, local volume-fraction variances, and hyperuniformity order metrics and then use this information to estimate certain effective transport properties via closed-form microstructure-property formulas. Specifically, we estimate the recently introduced time-dependent diffusion spreadability exactly from the spectral density. Moreover, we accurately estimate the fluid permeability of such porous materials from the second moment of the pore-size function and the formation factor, a measure of the tortuosity of the pore space. We also rigorously bound the permeability from above using the spectral density. For the five models with identical cubic unit cells, we find that the permeability, inverse of the specific surface, hyperuniformity order metric, pore-size second moment and long-time spreadability behavior are all positively correlated and rank order the structures in exactly the same way. We also conjecture what structures maximize the fluid permeability for arbitrary porosities and show that this conjecture must be true in the extreme porosity limits by identifying the corresponding optimal structures.</description>

      <title>Deposition of highly-crystalline AlScN thin films using synchronized HiPIMS -- from combinatorial screening to piezoelectric devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fueled by the 5G revolution, the demand for advanced radio frequency micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) based on AlScN is growing rapidly. However, synthesizing high-quality, textured AlScN thin films is challenging. Current approaches typically rely on high temperatures and expensive compound targets. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of ionized physical vapor deposition to deposit highly oriented AlScN films with minimal defects at lower temperatures. Using metal-ion synchronized high-power impulse magnetron co-sputtering (MIS-HiPIMS) we can selectively bombard the growing film with Al and/or Sc ions to enhance the adatom mobility while simultaneously providing the ability to tune stress and coat complex structures conformally. We find that the Sc solubility in wurtzite AlN is slightly reduced, whereas crystallinity and texture are markedly improved. Disoriented grains, a key challenge in growing AlScN films, are completely removed via substrate biasing, while the residual stress can be tailored by adjusting the same. The measured piezoelectric response of the films is in line with DFT predictions and on par with the current state of the art. Finally, we demonstrate conformal deposition of c-axis textured AlScN on structured Si wafers underlining the promise of ionized PVD for the fabrication of advanced RF filters and next-generation MEMS devices.</description>

      <title>Message-Passing Interatomic Potentials Learn Non-Local Electrostatic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates that E(3)-equivariant graph neural network interatomic potentials (GNN-IPs) effectively learn non-local electrostatic interactions and charge transfers. Using a toy model with point charges, it is confirmed that GNN-IPs adeptly interpolate and extrapolate electrostatic interactions, independent of geometric coupling. It is also found that the electrostatic energy between an atom pair is distributed among neighboring atoms, rather than localized solely within the two atoms involved. Furthermore, GNN-IPs have proven successful in capturing non-local interactions through charge transfer on density functional theory reference data, as evidenced by comparative analyses of the potential energy surfaces for Au clusters on both MgO and Al-doped MgO substrates.</description>

      <title>Thermal stability and phase transformation of $\alpha$-, $\kappa(\epsilon)$-, and $\gamma$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ thin films to $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ under various ambient conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions in metastable $\alpha$-, $\kappa(\epsilon)$-, and $\gamma$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films to thermodynamically stable $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ during annealing in air, N$_2$, and vacuum have been systematically investigated via in-situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. These respective polymorphs exhibited thermal stability to around 471-525$^\circ$C, 773-825$^\circ$C, and 490-575$^\circ$C before transforming into $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, across all tested ambient conditions. Particular crystallographic orientation relationships were observed before and after the phase transitions, i.e., (0006) $\alpha$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ $\parallel$ $(\overline{4}02)$ $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, (004) $\kappa(\epsilon)$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ $\parallel$ (310) and $(\overline{4}02)$ $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, and (400) $\gamma$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ $\parallel$ (400) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. The phase transition of $\alpha$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ to $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ resulted in catastrophic damage to the film and upheaval of the surface. The respective primary and possibly secondary causes of this damage are the +8.6% volume expansion and the dual displacive and reconstructive transformations that occur during this transition. The $\kappa(\epsilon)$- and $\gamma$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films converted to $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ via singular reconstructive transformations with small changes in volume and unchanged surface microstructures.</description>

      <title>Environment-adaptive machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of interatomic potentials that can effectively capture a wide range of atomic environments is a complex challenge due to several reasons. Materials can exist in numerous structural forms (e.g., crystalline, amorphous, defects, interfaces) and phases (solid, liquid, gas, plasma). Each form may require different treatment in potential modeling to reflect the real physical behavior correctly. Atoms interact through various forces such as electrostatic, van der Waals, ionic bonding, covalent bonding, and metallic bonding, which manifest differently depending on the chemical elements and their electronic structures. Furthermore, the effective interaction among atoms can change with external conditions like temperature, pressure, and chemical environment. Consequently, creating an interatomic potential that performs well across diverse conditions is difficult since optimizing the potential for one set of conditions can lead to a trade-off in the accuracy of predicted properties associated with other conditions. In this paper, we present a method to construct accurate, efficient and transferable interatomic potentials by adapting to the local atomic environment of each atom within a system. The collection of atomic environments of interest is partitioned into several clusters of atomic environments. Each cluster represents a distinctive local environment and is used to define a corresponding local potential. We introduce a many-body many-potential expansion to smoothly blend these local potentials to ensure global continuity of the potential energy surface. This is achieved by computing the probability functions that determine the likelihood of an atom belonging to each cluster. We apply the environment-adaptive machine learning potentials to predict observable properties for Ta element and InP compound, and compare them with density functional theory calculations.</description>

      <title>Beyond the random phase approximation for calculating Curie temperatures in ferromagnets: application to Fe, Ni, Co and monolayer CrI3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of solids are typically analyzed in terms of Heisenberg models where the electronic structure is approximated by interacting localized spins. However, even in such models the evaluation of thermodynamic properties constitutes a major challenge and is usually handled by a mean field decoupling scheme. The random phase approximation (RPA) comprises a common approach and is often applied to evaluate critical temperatures although it is well known that the method is only accurate well below the critical temperature. In the present work we compare the performance of the RPA with a different decoupling scheme proposed by Callen as well as the mean field decoupling of interacting Holstein-Primakoff (HP) magnons. We consider three-dimensional (3D) as well as two-dimensional (2D) model systems where the Curie temperature is governed by anisotropy. In 3D, the Callen method is the most accurate in the classical limit, and we show that the Callen decoupling produces the best agreement with experiments for bcc Fe, fcc Ni and fcc Co with exchange interactions obtained from first principles. In contrast, for low spin systems where a quantum mechanical treatment in pertinent, the HP and RPA methods appear are superior to the Callen decoupling. In 2D systems with magnetic order driven by single-ion anisotropy, it is shown that HP fails rather dramatically and both RPA and Callen approaches severely overestimates Curie temperatures. The most accurate approach is then constructed by combining RPA with the Callen decoupling of single-ion anisotropy, which yields the correct lack of order for S=1/2. We exemplify this by the case of monolayer CrI3 using exchange constant extracted from experiments.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Irradiation Behavior of Dual Phases in Ti-6Al-4V Alloy at Low-Temperature Due to Omega-phase Precursors in Beta-phase Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming to simulate the radiation damage effect on a dual alpha+beta phase Ti-6Al-4V alloy utilized as high-intensity accelerator beam window material, a series of irradiation experiments were conducted with a 2.8 MeV-Fe^2+ ion beam in several dpa regions at room temperature. The nano-indentation hardness increased steeply at 1 dpa and unchanged up to 10 dpa, due to the saturation of defect clusters and tangled dislocations in the dominant alpha-phase matrix with a size of 2~3 nm and a density of about 1x10^23 m^-3. In contrast in the intergranular beta-phase, larger loops of 20~30 nm diameter were observed with much less density of about 5x10^20 m^-3. The diffraction pattern showed rectilinear diffuse streaks between the beta-phase reflections, corresponding to the omega-phase precursor, without dose dependency in its intensity. FFT/I-FFT analysis of the HREM revealed a sub-nanometer-sized lattice disorder with local fluctuations, not discrete but continuous, and homogeneously distributed within the matrix beta-phase stably against the irradiation. The significantly low dislocation density and the absence of phase transformation in the beta-phase matrix could be attributed either to the strong sink effect expected for this distinctive sub-nanometer-sized homogeneous lattice disorder or to the anomalous point defect recombination induced by the high mobility of vacancies, both of which are originated from the metastable omega-phase precursors specifically formed in the beta(BCC) phase of group-4 transition metals.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-mediated transport and segregation tendencies of solutes in FCC nickel under diffusional creep: A density functional theory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nabarro-Herring (N-H) diffusional creep theory postulates the vacancy-mediated transport of atoms under a stress gradient as the creep mechanism under low-stress and high-temperature conditions. In multicomponent alloys, we premise that this stress-assisted flow of vacancies to and from grain boundaries will produce elemental segregation. An observation of such segregation, validated with theoretical predictions, can provide the necessary experimental evidence for the occurrence of N-H creep. Theoretical calculations of the segregation tendencies via analyzing the dominant solute diffusion mechanisms and the difference in diffusivities of the elements are therefore essential. To this end, this study applies density functional theory calculations of migration barriers and solute-vacancy binding energies as input to the self-consistent mean field theory to assess the vacancy-mediated diffusion mechanisms, transport coefficients, and segregation tendencies of Co, Cr, Mo, Re, Ta, and W solutes in face-centered cubic Ni. We find Co, Re, and W to be slow diffusers at high temperatures and Cr, Mo, and Ta to be fast diffusers. Further analysis shows that the slow diffusers tend to always enrich at vacancy sinks over a wide range of temperatures. In contrast, the fast diffusers show a transition from depletion to enrichment as the temperature lowers. Furthermore, our analysis of the segregation tendencies under tensile hydrostatic strains shows that slow diffusers are largely unaffected by the strain and favor enrichment. On the other hand, the fast diffusers exhibit high sensitivity to strain and their segregation tendency can transition from depletion to enrichment at a given temperature. The transport coefficients calculated in this work are expected to serve as input to mesoscale microstructure models to provide a more rigorous assessment of solute segregation under N-H creep conditions.</description>

      <title>Electronic and Optical Excitations in van der Waals Materials from a Non-Empirical Wannier-Localized Optimally-Tuned Screened Range-Separated Hybrid Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electronic and optical excitations in van der Waals (vdW) materials is a long-standing challenge for density functional theory. The recently proposed Wannier-localized optimally-tuned screened range-separated hybrid (WOT-SRSH) functional has proven successful in non-empirical determination of electronic band gaps and optical absorption spectra for various covalent and ionic crystals. However, for vdW materials the tuning of the material- and structure-dependent functional parameters has, until now, only been attained semi-empirically. Here, we present a non-empirical WOT-SRSH approach applicable to vdW materials, with the optimal functional parameters transferable between monolayer and bulk. We apply this methodology to prototypical vdW materials: black phosphorus, molybdenum disulfide, and hexagonal boron nitride (in the latter case including zero-point renormalization). We show that the WOT-SRSH approach consistently achieves accuracy levels comparable to experiments and ab initio many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations for band structures and optical absorption spectra, both on its own and as an optimal starting point for MBPT calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon-Germanium heterostructures are a promising quantum circuit platform, but crucial aspects as the long-term charge dynamics and cooldown-to-cooldown variations are still widely unexplored quantitatively. In this letter we present the results of an extensive bias cooling study performed on gated silicon-germanium quantum dots with an Al2O3-dielectric. Over 80 cooldowns were performed in the course of our investigations. The performance of the devices is assessed by low-frequency charge noise measurements in the band of 200 micro Hertz to 10 milli Hertz. We measure the total noise power as a function of the applied voltage during cooldown in four different devices and find a minimum in noise at 0.7V bias cooling voltage for all observed samples. We manage to decrease the total noise power median by a factor of 6 and compute a reduced tunneling current density using Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations. Furthermore, we show the variation in noise from the same device in the course of eleven different cooldowns performed under the nominally same conditions.</description>

      <title>Phase shifts, band geometry and responses in triple-Q charge and spin density waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in the impacts of phase shifts within the triple-Q spin density wave (SDW) order parameters. Concurrently, it is widely recognized that incommensurate triple-Q charge density waves (CDW) are also prevalent in low-dimensional materials, where the phase degrees of freedom in the order parameters are generally allowed. In this study, we systematically investigate the pivotal effects arising from both triple-Q CDW and SDW order parameters, with particular consideration given to possible phase shifts. We show that the phase shifts play a crucial role in determining the real-space topology of triple-Q density waves. More importantly, we show that the triple-Q CDW and SDW order parameters would influence the band geometry in the momentum space, where multiband Dirac-like fermions are induced by the triple-Q density wave order parameters near the Fermi energy. Furthermore, we explicitly establish that such nontrivial band geometry, combined with symmetry-breaking induced by phase shifts, leads to a variety of intriguing linear and nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>Tunable viscous layers in Corbino geometry using density junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In sufficiently clean materials where electron-electron interactions are strong compared to momentum-relaxing scattering processes, electron transport resembles the flow of a viscous fluid. We study hydrodynamic electron transport across density interfaces (n-n junctions) in a 2DEG in the Corbino geometry. From numerical simulations in COMSOL using realistic parameters, we show that we can produce tunable viscous layers at the density interface by varying the density ratio of charge carriers. We quantitatively explain this observation with simple analytic expressions together with boundary conditions at the interface. We also show signatures of these viscous layers in the magnetoresistance. Breaking down viscous and ohmic contributions, we find that when outer radial region of the Corbino has higher charge density compared to the inner region, the viscous layers at the interface serve to suppress the magneto-resistance produced by momentum-relaxing scattering. Conversely, the magneto-resistance is enhanced when the inner region has higher density than the outer. Our results add to the repertoire of techniques for engineering viscous electron flows, which hold a promise for applications in future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Recoverable strain from reverse plasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recoverable strain is the strain recovered once a stress is removed from a body, in the direction opposite to that in which the stress had acted. To date, the phenomenon has been understood as being elastic in origin: polymer chains stretched in the direction of an imposed stress will recoil after the stress is removed, for example. Any unrecoverable strain is instead attributed to irreversible plastic deformations. Here we study theoretically recoverable and unrecoverable strain within the soft glassy rheology model, aimed at describing the rheology of elastoplastic yield stress fluids and amorphous soft solids. We consider a material subject to the switch-on of a shear stress that is held constant before later being set back to zero, after which the strain recovery is observed. After an initially fast recoil that is indeed elastic in nature, consistent with the usual intuition, we find that significant subsequent strain recovery then arises not via further recoil of elasticity but instead by `reverse plasticity', in a sense that we discuss carefully. Also unexpectedly, although in rare parameter regimes, this plastic part of the strain post switch-off does not always in fact recover in the negative direction, counter to that of the previously imposed stress, but can sometimes continue to accumulate in the forward direction. The recovery is then non-monotonic overall, reminiscent of recent observations of non-monotonic stress relaxation after straining, which have been attributed to complex material memory effects. We elucidate the mechanisms underlying these behaviours in terms of the evolution of the SGR model's population of elastoplastic elements, and suggest connections with the notion of `reversible plasticity', as discussed in the recent physics literature.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian line graph: A generalized approach to flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Line graph (LG) lattices are well known to host flat bands (FBs) with isotropic hoppings in $s$-orbital models. Yet, higher-angular-momentum orbitals with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which are more common in real materials, lack a general approach for their inclusion in LG to achieve FBs. Here, we introduce a non-Abelian LG theory to construct FBs in realistic systems, which incorporates internal degrees of freedom and goes beyond real-valued isotropic hoppings. The lattice edges and sites in the LG are modified to be associated with arbitrary Hermitian matrices, refereed to as multiple LG. A crucial step is to map the multiple LG Hamiltonian to a tight-binding (TB) model that respects the lattice symmetry through appropriate local non-Abelian transformations in the internal space. We find the general conditions to determine the local transformation. Based on this mechanism, we discuss the realization of $d$-orbital FBs in the Kagome lattice, which may serve as a minimal model for understanding the high-orbital FBs with SOC in Kagome materials. Our approach bridges the known FBs in pure lattice models and the realization in multi-orbital systems.</description>

      <title>Metamagnetism and anomalous magnetotransport properties in rare-earth-based polar semimetals $R$AuGe ($R =$ Dy, Ho, and Gd)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the magnetic, magnetoelastic, and magnetotransport properties of single crystals of polar magnets $R$AuGe ($R=$ Dy, Ho, and Gd), grown by Au-Ge self-flux. Magnetization and magnetostriction measurements reveal multi-step metamagnetic transitions for the $c$-axis magnetic field ($H\parallel c$) for DyAuGe and HoAuGe, suggesting magnetic frustration in the triangular lattice of $R$ ions. The magnetic phase diagrams have clarified a close connection between the magnetoelastic property and the emergence of the intermediate metamagentic phase. The magnetic-field dependence of the resistivity and Hall resistivity reveal the semimetallic transport dominated by hole-type carriers, consistent with the behavior in a nonmagnetic analogue YAuGe. We also identify a signature of an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) proportional to the field-induced magnetization in $R=$ Dy, Ho, and Gd. GdAuGe shows magnetic and transport behavior as reported in a previous study using Bi-flux grown single crystals, while the self-flux grown crystal shows larger magnetoresistance ($\sim$ 345\%, at 1.8 K and 9 T) due to higher hole-type carrier mobility ($\sim$ 6400 cm$^2$/Vs). Using the two-band model analysis considering the mobility change during the magnetization process, we extract the anomalous Hall conductivity: $\sim 1200$ S/cm and $\sim 530$ S/cm for $R=$ Dy and Ho, respectively, at 1.8 K with 9 T for $H\parallel c$. The magnitude of conductivity suggests a contribution of intrinsic origin, possibly related to the Berry curvature in the electron bands induced by the time-reversal symmetry breaking and the polar lattice.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure Prediction of Multi-million Atom Systems Through Uncertainty Quantification Enabled Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ground state electron density -- obtainable using Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory (KS-DFT) simulations -- contains a wealth of material information, making its prediction via machine learning (ML) models attractive. However, the computational expense of KS-DFT scales cubically with system size which tends to stymie training data generation, making it difficult to develop quantifiably accurate ML models that are applicable across many scales and system configurations. Here, we address this fundamental challenge by employing transfer learning to leverage the multi-scale nature of the training data, while comprehensively sampling system configurations using thermalization. Our ML models are less reliant on heuristics, and being based on Bayesian neural networks, enable uncertainty quantification. We show that our models incur significantly lower data generation costs while allowing confident -- and when verifiable, accurate -- predictions for a wide variety of bulk systems well beyond training, including systems with defects, different alloy compositions, and at unprecedented, multi-million-atom scales. Moreover, such predictions can be carried out using only modest computational resources.</description>

      <title>Free energy and metastable states in the square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free energy as a function of polarization is calculated for the square-lattice $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model for $J_2 &lt; |J_1|/2$ using the random local field approximation (RLFA) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Within RLFA, it reveals a metastable state with zero polarization in the ordered phase. In addition, the Landau free energy calculated within RLFA indicates a geometric slab-droplet phase transition at low temperature, which cannot be predicted by the mean field approximation. In turn, restricted free energy calculations for finite-size samples, exact and using MC simulations, reveal metastable states with a wide range of polarization values, but with only two domains. Taking into account the dependence of the restricted free energy on the nearest-neighbor correlations allows us to identify several more metastable states. The calculations also reveal additional slab-droplet transitions at $J_2 &gt; |J_1|/4$. These findings enrich our knowledge of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model and the RLFA as a useful theoretical tool to study phase transitions in spin systems.</description>

      <title>Strain fluctuations unlock ferroelectricity in wurtzites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ferroelectrics are of practical interest for non-volatile data storage due to their reorientable, crystallographically defined polarization. Yet efforts to integrate conventional ferroelectrics into ultrathin memories have been frustrated by film-thickness limitations, which impede polarization reversal under low voltage. Wurtzite materials, including magnesium-substituted zinc oxide (Zn,Mg)O, have been shown to exhibit scalable ferroelectricity as thin films. In this work, we explain the origins of ferroelectricity in (Zn,Mg)O. Large strain fluctuations emerge locally in (Zn,Mg)O, causing a reduction of up to 45% in the local coercive field. We provide concurrent experimental and computational evidence of these effects by demonstrating polarization switching in ZnO-(Zn,Mg)O heterostructures. This work opens up an avenue to develop scalable ferroelectrics by controlling local strain gradients.</description>

Abstract: Though extensively studied since the emergence of zincblende cubic A(B,C) semiconductor alloys (zb-SCA) in the sixties, the phonon mode behavior of Ga(As,P) remains a subject of debate to this day. Recently Zollner and co-authors reported on a thorough far-infrared (IR) ellipsometry study of the vibrational spectra of Ga(As,P) spanning the composition domain. They suggest that their experimental data are better described by the cluster model than by our percolation model. On the basis of Zollner experimental data, kindly made available to us, we derive an improved version of the percolation model that explains the phonon mode behavior of Ga(As,P) beyond existing CM and PM approaches, with ab initio phonon calculations in support.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Silicate Glasses submitted to Binary Ion Exchange: Equilibrium Conditions and Interdiffusion Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10916v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion exchange processes between an ion reservoir and a solid matrix are modeled under the assumption that near interface volumes reach equilibrium in a much faster time than the overall ion exchange process time while, in the bulk of the solid matrix, ions are transported by an interdiffusion kinetic process. Ion exchange equilibrium conditions are initially established according to classical thermodynamics. The result is defined in terms of the chemical potentials of exchanging ionic species. The proposed original derivation is performed making use of the thermodynamics of subsystems to determine near-surface equilibrium concentrations and ion exchange isotherms. Interaction energies of the exchanging ions in the glass are determined through the thermodynamic factor n, which is a parameter of the ion exchange isotherm. The kinetics of the ion exchange process in silicate glass is discussed to find connections with the near-surface equilibrium condition. The flux equation for the incoming ions in the glass is written in the form of a Fick equation with a concentration-dependent interdiffusion coefficient incorporating the thermodynamic factor n. It has been found that the thermodynamic factor of the interdiffusion coefficient is related to the interaction energy of the exchanging ions in the glass allowing a new approach to the interpretation of past experimental results. Surface concentration has been found substantially connected to the second parameter of the ion-exchange isotherm which is the equilibrium constant K and significatively influenced by the chemical composition of the ion reservoir (the molten salt bath). Further treatment of kinetics of ion-exchange within the framework of non-equilibrium thermodynamics allows the interpretation of the thermodynamic factor as a function of incoming ions concentration in the glass matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Science is and always has been based on data, but the terms "data-centric" and the "4th paradigm of" materials research indicate a radical change in how information is retrieved, handled and research is performed. It signifies a transformative shift towards managing vast data collections, digital repositories, and innovative data analytics methods. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its subset Machine Learning (ML), has become pivotal in addressing all these challenges. This Roadmap on Data-Centric Materials Science explores fundamental concepts and methodologies, illustrating diverse applications in electronic-structure theory, soft matter theory, microstructure research, and experimental techniques like photoemission, atom probe tomography, and electron microscopy. While the roadmap delves into specific areas within the broad interdisciplinary field of materials science, the provided examples elucidate key concepts applicable to a wider range of topics. The discussed instances offer insights into addressing the multifaceted challenges encountered in contemporary materials research.</description>

Abstract: This study delves into the intricate electronic and optical behaviors of two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb materials, such as Stannen, arsenene, antimonene, silicene, and bismuthene(bismuth molecule), through the lens of first-principles calculations(AB Initio Calculations) based on the Kohn-Sham equations. Focusing on the exchange-correlation potential approximations within the Density Functional Theory (DFT) framework, we evaluate the potential of these materials in digital information control and management. Special attention is given to the nonlinear optical responses and electronic properties under the influence of twisted bilayer configurations, external fields, and varying twist angles. The findings offer novel insights into the design of advanced digital devices, suggesting a transformative approach to information technology through the utilization of 2D honeycomb materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to study the transition between different topological states, based on the assessment of the vibrational resonances in infrared spectra. We consider the Haldane and Kane-Mele models finding that Born effective charges are nearly quantized, with a discontinuous jump concomitant with the topological phase transition. In particular, Born effective charges display a finite value in the trivial phase and a null one in the nontrivial one. This is rooted in the connection between Born effective charges and electronic Berry curvature at the band edges. Finally, at the topological phase transition of the Haldane model, we also observe a nearly quantized jump of the chiral splitting of the zone-center phonon frequencies, induced by time-reversal symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>New tool for extraction of $^{187}$Os M\"ossbauer parameters with biologically relevant detection sensitivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A large number of osmium complexes with osmium in different oxidation states (II, III, IV, VI) have been reported recently to exhibit good antiproliferative activity in cancer cell lines. Herein, we demonstrate new opportunities offered by $^{187}$Os nuclear forward scattering (NFS) and nuclear inelastic scattering (NIS) of synchrotron radiation for characterization of hyperfine interactions and lattice dynamics in a benchmark Os(VI) complex K$_2$[OsO$_2$(OH)$_4$], by accurate extraction of M\"ossbauer parameters and the determination of Os-projected density of phonon states confirmed by first-principles phonon calculations. The values of isomer shift ($\delta$ = 3.3(1) mm/s) relative to [Os$^{IV}$ Cl$_{6}$]$^{2-}$ and quadrupole splitting ($\Delta E_Q$ = 12.0(2) mm/s) were determined with NFS, while the Lamb-M\"ossbauer factor (0.55(1)), the density of phonon states (DOS), and a full thermodynamics characterization was carried out using the NIS data combined with first principle theoretical calculations. In more general terms, this study provides strong evidence that $^{187}$Os nuclear resonance scattering is a reliable technique for the investigation of hyperfine interactions and Os specific vibrations in osmium(VI) species, which might be potentially applicable for measuring such interactions in osmium complexes of other oxidation states, including those with anticancer activity such as Os(III) and Os(IV).</description>

      <title>A robust and tunable Luttinger liquid in correlated edge of transition-metal second-order topological insulator Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and interaction always plays an important role in condensed matter physics and induces many exotic quantum phases, while rare transition metal layered material (TMLM) has been proved to possess both. Here we report a TMLM Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ has the two-dimensional second-order topology (also a quadrupole topological insulator) with correlated edge states - Luttinger liquid. It is ascribed to the unconventional nature of the mismatch between charge- and atomic- centers induced by a remarkable double-band inversion. This one-dimensional protected edge state preserves the Luttinger liquid behavior with robustness and universality in scale from micro- to macro- size, leading to a significant anisotropic electrical transport through two-dimensional sides of bulk materials. Moreover, the bulk gap can be modulated by the thickness, resulting in an extensive-range phase diagram for Luttinger liquid. These provide an attractive model to study the interaction and quantum phases in correlated topological systems.</description>

      <title>Reduced stress propagation leads to increased mechanical failure resistance in auxetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials with negative Poisson ratio have the counter-intuitive property of expanding laterally when they are stretched longitudinally. They are accordingly termed auxetic, from the Greek auxesis meaning to increase. Experimental studies have demonstrated auxetic materials to have superior material properties, compared with conventional ones. These include synclastic curvature, increased acoustic absorption, increased resilience to material fatigue, and increased resistance to mechanical failure. Until now, the latter observations have remained poorly understood theoretically. With this motivation, the contributions of this work are twofold. First, we elucidate analytically the way in which stress propagates spatially across a material following a localised plastic failure event, finding a significantly reduced stress propagation in auxetic materials compared with conventional ones. In this way, a plastic failure event occurring in one part of a material has a reduced tendency to trigger knock-on plastic events in neighbouring regions. Second, via the numerical simulation of a lattice elastoplastic model, we demonstrate a key consequence of this reduced stress propagation to be an increased resistance to mechanical failure. This is seen not only via an increase in the externally measured yield strain, but also via a decreased tendency for plastic damage to percolate internally across a sample in catastrophic system-spanning clusters.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning potentials (MLPs) have significantly impacted the fields of chemistry, physics, and biology by enabling large-scale first-principles simulations. Among different machine learning approaches, kernel-based MLPs distinguish themselves through their ability to handle small datasets, quantify uncertainties, and minimize over-fitting. Nevertheless, their extensive computational requirements present considerable challenges. To alleviate these, sparsification methods have been developed, aiming to reduce computational scaling without compromising accuracy. In the context of isothermal and isobaric ML molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, achieving precise pressure estimation is crucial for reproducing reliable system behavior under constant pressure. Despite progress, sparse kernel MLPs struggle with precise pressure prediction. Here, we introduce a virial kernel function that significantly enhances pressure estimation accuracy of MLPs. Additionally, we propose the active sparse Bayesian committee machine (BCM) potential, an on-the-fly MLP architecture that aggregates local sparse Gaussian process regression (SGPR) MLPs. The sparse BCM potential overcomes the steep computational scaling with the kernel size, and a predefined restriction on the size of kernel allows for a fast and efficient on-the-fly training. Our advancements facilitate accurate and computationally efficient machine learning-enhanced MD (MLMD) simulations across diverse systems, including ice-liquid coexisting phases, \ce{Li10Ge(PS6)2} lithium solid electrolyte, and high-pressure liquid boron nitride.</description>

      <title>Vortex formation and exotic superconducting states in field-cooled Sn-Pb solders</title>

Abstract: Formation of vortices is a typical phenomenon of type-II superconductors under magnetic fields (H). In contrast, type-I superconductors do not host vortices because of their Meissner state. As rare cases, vortices have been observed in intermediate states of type-I superconductors; in addition, the recent observation of type-II superconductivity with vortices in a (originally type-I) Pb crystal film at extremely low temperature (T) under H has opened new pathway to study vortex physics. However, thermodynamic characteristics of such type-II-like superconducting states with vortices in originally type-I element superconductors have not been detected because of the lack of bulk example. In this study, we investigated superconducting states of phase-separated Sn-Pb solders using specific heat and magnetization to reveal magnetic-flux-trapping mechanisms. Here, we show that Sn islands in the Sn-Pb solders exhibit type-II-like superconducting states with vortices when the solders host extremely high magnetic fluxes after field cooling. Furthermore, with increasing T, the amount of trapped flux decreases, and the driving force of the magnetic flux changes from type-II superconducting states of Sn to supercurrent of Pb regions surrounding the Sn islands. The field-cooled Sn-Pb solders are rich in physics of bulk vortex formation and anomalously enhanced supercurrent in element (originally type-I) superconductors.</description>
