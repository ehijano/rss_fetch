      <title>Experimental demonstration of the shadow of a laser beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light, being massless, casts no shadow; under ordinary circumstances, photons pass right through each other unimpeded. Here, we demonstrate a laser beam acting like an object - the beam casts a shadow upon a surface when the beam is illuminated by another light source. We observe a regular shadow in the sense it can be seen by the naked eye, it follows the contours of the surface it falls on, and it follows the position and shape of the object (the laser beam). Specifically, we use a nonlinear optical process involving four atomic levels of ruby. We find a maximum contrast of approximately 22 percent, similar to that of a shadow of a tree on a sunny day. Making light itself cast a shadow opens new possibilities for fabrication, imaging, and illumination.</description>

      <title>A Parallel Beam Splitting Based on Gradient Metasurface: Preparation and Fusion of Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gradient metasurface, formed by a set of subwavelength unit cells with different phase modulation, is widely used in polarized beam splitting (BS) in the classical and quantum optics. Specifically, its phase gradient allows the path and polarization of multiple output lights to be locked by corresponding inputs.Using this unique path-polarization locked property, we demonstrate that the single metasurface can function as sequentially linked beamsplitters, enabling the parallelization of a series of BS processes. Such a parallel BS metasurface provides a multi-beam interference capability for both classical and quantum light manipulation. Taking this advantage, we first prepare path and polarization hybrid entangled states of two, three, and multi photons from unentangled photon sources. Then, the ability of parallel BS-facilitated entanglement is applied to demonstrate entanglement fusion among entangled photon pairs, which can greatly enlarge the entanglement dimension. The principle of parallel BS through the metasurface opens up a versatile way to manipulate the quantum state at the micro/nano scale, which will have potential applications in on-chip quantum optics and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Semi-Transparent Image Sensors for Eye-Tracking Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image sensors hold a pivotal role in society due to their ability to capture vast amounts of information. Traditionally, image sensors are opaque due to light absorption in both the pixels and the read-out electronics that are stacked on top of each other. Making image sensors visibly transparent would have a far-reaching impact in numerous areas such as human-computer interfaces, smart displays, and both augmented and virtual reality. In this paper, we present the development and analysis of the first semi-transparent image sensor and its applicability as an eye-tracking device. The device consists of an 8x8 array of semi-transparent photodetectors and electrodes disposed on a fully transparent substrate. Each pixel of the array has a size of 60 x 140 {\mu}m and an optical transparency of 85-95%. Pixels have a high sensitivity, with more than 90% of them showing a noise equivalent irradiance &lt; 10-4 W/m2 for wavelengths of 637 nm. As the semi-transparent photodetectors have a large amount of built-in gain, the opaque read-out electronics can be placed far away from the detector array to ensure maximum transparency and fill factor. Indeed, the operation and appearance of transparent image sensors present a fundamental shift in how we think about cameras and imaging, as these devices can be concealed in plain sight.</description>

      <title>A programmable topological photonic chip</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling topological phases of light has allowed experimental observations of abundant topological phenomena and development of robust photonic devices. The prospect of more sophisticated controls with topological photonic devices for practical implementations requires high-level programmability. Here, we demonstrate a fully programmable topological photonic chip with large-scale integration of silicon photonic nanocircuits and microresonators. Photonic artificial atoms and their interactions in our compound system can be individually addressed and controlled, therefore allowing arbitrary altering of structural parameters and geometrical configurations for the observations of dynamic topological phase transitions and diverse photonic topological insulators. By individually programming artificial atoms on the generic chip, it has allowed comprehensive statistic characterisations of topological robustness against relatively weak disorders, as well as counterintuitive topological Anderson phase transitions induced by strong disorders. Our generic topological photonic chip that can be rapidly reprogrammed to implement multifunctionalities, prototypes a flexible and versatile platform for possible applications across fundamental science and topological technologies.</description>

      <title>Amplified linear and nonlinear chiral sensing assisted by anapole modes in hybrid metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between chiral molecules and circularly polarized light is largely influenced by the local optical chirality density. This interaction prompts a substantial demand of the design of nanophotonic platforms capable of enhancing such effects across large and accessible volumes. Such a magnification requires nanostructures to provide high electric and magnetic field enhancements while keeping the phase relation of circular light. Dielectric nanostructures, particularly those able to support resonances, are uniquely suited for this task due to their capacity for high electric and magnetic field enhancements. On the other hand, efficient third harmonic generation calls for strong electric field resonances within dielectric materials, a feature often boosted by incorporating plasmonic materials into hybrid systems. In this numerical study, we propose a coupled silicon disk-gold ring system that can exploit the anapole-induced field confinement to provide a broadband magnified circular dichroism under realistic conditions, reaching values up to a 5-fold enhancement. We also demonstrate that this structure can be employed as an efficient third harmonic generator which, when integrated with chiral media, enables a 10-fold enhancement in circular dichroism. Furthermore, we numerically show that pulsed illumination at intensities up to 10 GW/cm2 does not induce temperature increments that could potentially damage the samples. These findings suggest that this system can be a promising and versatile approach towards ultrasensitive background-free chiral sensing.</description>

      <title>Selective probing of longitudinal and transverse plasmon modes with electron phase-matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical properties of metallic nanoparticles are dominated by localized surface plasmons (LSPs). Their properties only depend on the constituting material, the size and shape of the nano-object as well as its surrounding medium. In anisotropic structures, such as metallic nanorods, two families of modes generally exist, transverse and longitudinal. Their spectral and spatial overlaps usually impede their separate measurements in electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). In this work, we propose three different strategies enabling to overcome this difficulty and selectively probe longitudinal and transverse modes. The first strategy is numeric and relies on morphing of nano-structures, rooted in the geometrical nature of LSPs. The two other strategies exploit the relativistic and wave nature of the electrons in an EELS experiment. The first one is the phase-matching between the electron and the plasmon excitation to enhance their coupling by either tilting the sample and modifying the electron kinetic energy. The second one - polarized EELS (pEELS) - exploits the wave nature of electrons to mimic selection rules analogous to the one existing in light spectroscopies. The above-mentioned strategies are exemplified - either experimentally or numerically - on a canonical plasmonic toy model: the nano-rod. The goal of the paper is to bring together the state-of-the-art concepts of EELS for plasmonics to tackle a pedestrian problem in this field.</description>

      <title>An optically defined phononic crystal defect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phononic crystal with a defect mode defined and controlled entirely by optical forces. By applying a strong optical trap to a single unit cell of a Si$_3$N$_4$ phononic crystal membrane, we coherently couple many modes to each other, and smoothly transfer a single defect mode into the phononic bandgap. This is accompanied by localization of the mode's spatial profile from one spanning the entire crystal to one confined within just a few unit cells, as evidenced by a 37-fold reduction in the participating mass. This proof-of-concept coupling between light and mechanical mode shape significantly broadens the optomechanical design space. It also demonstrates the feasibility of optically programmable lattice potentials, enabling (in addition to defects) reconfigurable waveguides, superlattices, and disorder, with corresponding avenues of research toward creating unique states of macroscopic quantum motion.</description>

      <title>Generation and high-resolution imaging of higher-order polarization via metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation and focusing properties of higher-order polarized beams have attracted lots of interests due to its significant applications. In this paper,we derived the formula of transforming linear polarization into higher-order polarization, which is applicable to generating arbitrary order polarization. Based on the derived formula, the focusing properties of higher-order polarization by dielectric metasurface lens are studied , which exhibit an Abbe-limit-breaking feature for small numerical aperture, i.e., NA&lt;0.6. When a binary phase (0 &amp; {\pi}) is further imposed on the aperture of metasurface lens, the focusing spot of fourth-order polarization breaks Abbe limit even by 14.3% at NA= 0.6. In addition, the effect of fabrication tolerance, say, substrate thickness and central deviation, on the focusing feature of higher-order polarization is also investigated. Our study may find significant applications in achieving higher-resolution lithography and imaging, say, by just replacing conventional linear or circular polarization with higher-order polarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report a first experimental realization of bright ultra-broadband (180 THz) fiber-based biphoton source with widely spectrally separated signal and idler photons. Such a two-photon source is realized due to the joint use of broadband phase-matching of interacting light waves and high optical nonlinearity of a silica-core photonic crystal fiber. The high performance of the developed fiber source identifies it as an important and useful tool for a wide range of optical quantum applications.</description>

      <title>A local model for the optical energy and momentum transfer in dielectric media and the microscopic origin of Abraham's force density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the continuity equations for linear momentum and energy associated to a recently introduced electromagnetic formulation based on classical dipolar sources [Eur. Phys. J. Plus 138, 1034 (2023)]. When connected to the mass-polariton quasi-particle dynamics, these equations provide a consistent microscopic description of the local optical energy and momentum transfer inside dielectric media, called microscopic mass-polariton formulation. This procedure also unveils the true microscopic origin of the long-known Abraham optical force density as an interplay between induced dipoles and mechanical stresses generated within the material.</description>

      <title>On the development of an RFSoC-based ultra-fast Phasemeter with GHz bandwidth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise measurements of the frequency and phase of an electrical or optical signal play a key role in various branches of science and engineering. Tracking changing laser frequencies is specifically demanding when the lasers themselves are noisy or if the frequencies rapidly change because they encode highly dynamic signals in, e.g., Doppler-ranging or dynamic cavity readout. Here, we report the development of a high signal bandwidth (&gt; 2 GHz) and high tracking bandwidth (2 MHz) multi-channel Phasemeter. The implementation utilizes an all-digital phase-locked loop realized within the field programmable gate array (FPGA) part of a Radio Frequency System-on-Chip (RFSoC), the programmable logic. We present performance measurements, discuss the role of the high tracking bandwidth for tracking highly dynamic signals, and demonstrate ultra-stable phase locking of a beat note between two widely tunable external cavity diode lasers. We achieve a phase-noise floor in the sub-milli radian regime, even for GHz signals, and demonstrate stable tracking of signals with a frequency change rate of 240 GHz/s.</description>

      <title>Stealthy and hyperuniform isotropic photonic bandgap structure in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In photonic crystals the propagation of light is governed by their photonic band structure, an ensemble of propagating states grouped into bands, separated by photonic band gaps. Due to discrete symmetries in spatially strictly periodic dielectric structures their photonic band structure is intrinsically anisotropic. However, for many applications, such as manufacturing artificial structural color materials or developing photonic computing devices, but also for the fundamental understanding of light-matter interactions, it is of major interest to seek materials with long range non-periodic dielectric structures which allow the formation of {\it isotropic} photonic band gaps. Here, we report the first ever 3D isotropic photonic band gap for an optimized disordered stealthy hyperuniform structure for microwaves. The transmission spectra are directly compared to a diamond pattern and an amorphous structure with similar node density. The band structure is measured experimentally for all three microwave structures, manufactured by 3D-Laser-printing for meta-materials with refractive index up to $n=2.1$. Results agree well with finite-difference-time-domain numerical investigations and a priori calculations of the band-gap for the hyperuniform structure: the diamond structure shows gaps but being anisotropic as expected, the stealthy hyperuniform pattern shows an isotropic gap of very similar magnitude, while the amorphous structure does not show a gap at all. The centimeter scaled microwave structures may serve as prototypes for micrometer scaled structures with bandgaps in the technologically very interesting region of infrared (IR).</description>

      <title>Dielectric microwave resonator with large optical apertures for spin-based quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Towards a spin-based quantum microwave-optical photon transducer, we demonstrate a low-loss dielectric microwave resonator with an internal quality factor of $2.30\times10^4$ while accommodating optical apertures with a diameter of $8\, \mathrm{mm}$. The two seemingly conflicting requirements, high quality factor and large optical apertures, are satisfied thanks to the large dielectric constant of rutile ($\mathrm{TiO_2}$). The quality factor is limited by radiation loss, and we confirmed by numerical simulation that this dielectric resonator can achieve a quality factor exceeding $10^6$ by extending the height of the resonator enclosure. Using this resonator, we performed both continuous-wave (cw) and pulse electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) crystalline powder and P1 centers in a diamond crystal in a dilution refrigerator. The cw ESR spectroscopy demonstrated high-cooperativity and strong spin-resonator coupling with the DPPH and P1 centers respectively, while the pulse ESR spectroscopy successfully measured longitudinal and transverse relaxation times.</description>

      <title>Highly confined epsilon-near-zero- and surface-phonon polaritons in SrTiO3 membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies have suggested that transition metal perovskite oxide membranes can enable surface phonon polaritons in the infrared range with low loss and much stronger subwavelength confinement than bulk crystals. Such modes, however, have not been experimentally observed so far. Here, using a combination of far-field Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and near-field synchrotron infrared nanospectroscopy (SINS) imaging, we study the phonon-polaritons in a 100 nm thick freestanding crystalline membrane of SrTiO3 transferred on metallic and dielectric substrates. We observe a symmetric-antisymmetric mode splitting giving rise to epsilon-near-zero and Berreman modes as well as highly confined (by a factor of 10) propagating phonon polaritons, both of which result from the deep-subwavelength thickness of the membranes. Theoretical modeling based on the analytical finite-dipole model and numerical finite-difference methods fully corroborate the experimental results. Our work reveals the potential of oxide membranes as a promising platform for infrared photonics and polaritonics.</description>

      <title>Quantum plasmonics model of refractive index sensing using photon correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between the electric dipole moments of a quantum emitter and a metal nanoparticle gives rise to unique optical properties, such as interference-induced photon correlations, that could be useful for enhanced intensity-based sensing. Using the quantum theory of photodetection, we propose a nanosensor system comprising a quantum emitter and a metal nanoparticle that explores the possibility of utilizing higher-order photon correlations for refractive index sensing. Both the refractive index sensitivity and resolution of the nanosensor, whose scattering spectrum lies within the visible region, are predicted. The sensor is supported by a substrate and driven weakly by a coherent field. By calculating the mean photocount and its second factorial moment resulting from the scattered field of the system, the sensing performance of the intensity and intensity-intensity correlation, are compared at optimal driving wavelengths. The mean photocount was found to be inherently low, inhibiting the role of interference-induced photon antibunching in minimizing the sensor's intensity shot noise. However, a regime in which the noise could be reduced below the shot noise limit is identified, leading to a quantum enhancement in the sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Entangled Photon-pair Generation in Nonlinear Thin-films</title>

Abstract: We develop a fully vectorial and non-paraxial formalism to describe spontaneous parametric down-conversion in nonlinear thin films. The formalism is capable of treating slabs with a sub-wavelength thickness, describe the associated Fabry-P\'erot effects, and even treat absorptive nonlinear materials. With this formalism, we perform an in-depth study of the dynamics of entangled photon-pair generation in nonlinear thin films, to provide a needed theoretical understanding for such systems that have recently attracted much experimental attention as sources of photon pairs. As an important example, we study the far-field radiation properties of photon pairs generated from a high-refractive-index nonlinear thin-film with Zinc-Blende structure, that is deposited on a linear low-refractive-index substrate. In particular, we study the thickness-dependent effect of Fabry-P\'erot interferences on the far-field radiation pattern of the photon pairs. We also pay special attention to study of entanglement generation, and find the conditions under which maximally polarization-entangled photon pairs can be generated and detected in such nonlinear thin-films.</description>

      <title>High-sensitivity dual-comb and cross-comb spectroscopy across the infrared using a widely-tunable and free-running optical parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) enables high-resolution measurements at high speeds without the trade-off between resolution and update rate inherent to mechanical delay scanning approaches. However, high system complexity and limited measurement sensitivity remain major challenges for DCS. Here, we address these challenges via a wavelength-tunable dual-comb optical parametric oscillator (OPO) combined with an up-conversion detection method. The OPO is tunable in the short-wave infrared (1300-1670 nm range) and mid-infrared (2700- 5000 nm range) where many molecules have strong absorption bands. Both OPO pump beams are generated in a single spatially-multiplexed laser cavity, while both signal and idler beams are generated in a single spatially-multiplexed OPO cavity. The near-common path of the combs in this new configuration enables comb-line-resolved and aliasing-free measurements in free-running operation. By limiting the instantaneous idler bandwidth to below 1 THz, we obtain a high power per comb line in the mid-infrared of up to 160 $\mu$W. With a novel intra-cavity nonlinear up-conversion scheme based on cross-comb spectroscopy, we leverage these power levels while overcoming the sensitivity limitations of direct mid-infrared detection, leading to a high signal-to-noise ratio (50.2 dB Hz$^{1/2}$) and record-level dual-comb figure of merit (3.5\times 10^8 Hz$^{1/2}$). As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the detection of methane with 2-ppm concentration over 3-m path length. Our results demonstrate a new paradigm for DCS compatible with high-sensitivity and high-resolution measurements over a wide spectral range.</description>

      <title>Towards optimal multimode fiber imaging by leveraging input polarization and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning techniques provide a plausible route towards achieving practical imaging through multimode fibers. The results produced by these methods are often influenced by physical factors like temperature, fiber length, external perturbations, and polarization state of the input light. Literature focuses on these different elements impacting deep-learning-enabled multimode imaging, yet the effects of input polarization remain under-explored. Here, we show experimentally that the state of polarization of light, being injected at multimode fiber input, affects the fidelity of reconstructed images from speckle patterns. Certain polarization states produce high-quality images at fiber output, while some yield degraded results. We have designed a conditional generative adversarial network~(CGAN) for image regeneration at various degrees of input light polarization. At a particular polarization state and with a thinner core multimode fiber, our network can reconstruct images with an average structural similarity index(SSIM) exceeding 0.9. Hence, in the case of multimode fibers that are held fixed, optimal imaging can be achieved by leveraging deep learning models with the input light polarization state, where the fidelity of images is maximum. We also show that the model can be trained to image adequately for all input light polarization states when the fiber has bends or twists. We anticipate that our work will be a stepping stone toward developing high-resolution and less invasive multimode fiber endoscopes.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary Optical and Transport Properties of Disordered Stealthy Hyperuniform Two-Phase Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disordered stealthy hyperuniform (SHU) two-phase media are a special subset of hyperuniform structures with novel physical properties due to their hybrid crystal-liquid nature. We have previously shown that the strong-contrast expansion of a linear fractional form of the effective dynamic dielectric constant leads to accurate approximations for disordered two-phase composites when truncated at the two-point level for distinctly different microstructural symmetries in three dimensions. Here, we further elucidate the extraordinary optical and transport properties of disordered SHU media. Among other results, we prove in detail that SHU layered and transversely isotropic media are perfectly transparent (i.e., no Anderson localization, in principle) within finite wavenumber intervals through the third-order terms. Remarkably, the results for these SHU media imply that there can be no Anderson localization within the predicted perfect transparency interval in practice because the localization length is much larger than any practically large sample size. We further contrast and compare the extraordinary physical properties of SHU layered, transversely isotropic, and fully isotropic media to other model nonstealthy microstructures, including their attenuation characteristics, as measured by the imaginary part of effective dielectric constant, and transport properties, as measured by the time-dependent diffusion spreadability. We demonstrate cross-property relations between them: they are positively correlated as the structures span from nonhyperuniform, nonstealthy hyperuniform, and SHU media. Establishing cross-property relations for SHU media for other wave phenomena (e.g., elastodynamics) and transport properties will also be useful. Cross-property relations are generally useful because they enable one to estimate one property, given a measurement of another.</description>

Abstract: Compensation of the generalized spherical aberrations is discussed for the plane-symmetric and anamorphic optical systems. The compensation rules are derived for an economical three-component double-plane symmetric system containing two cylindrical mirrors and one toroidal lens.

      <title>Giant second harmonic generation in supertwisted WS2 spirals grown in step edge particle induced non-Euclidean surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In moire crystals resulting from the stacking of twisted two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, a subtle adjustment in the twist angle surprisingly gives rise to a wide range of correlated optical and electrical properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of supertwisted WS2 spirals and the observation of giant second harmonic generation (SHG) in these spirals. Supertwisted WS2 spirals featuring different twist angles are synthesized on a Euclidean or step-edge particle-induced non-Euclidean surface using a carefully designed water-assisted chemical vapor deposition deposition. We observed an oscillatory dependence of SHG intensity on layer number, attributed to atomically phase-matched nonlinear dipoles within layers of supertwisted spiral crystals where inversion symmetry is restored. Through an investigation into the twist angle evolution of SHG intensity, we discovered that the stacking model between layers plays a crucial role in determining the nonlinearity, and the SHG signals in supertwisted spirals exhibit enhancements by a factor of 2 to 136 when compared with the SHG of the single-layer structure. These findings provide an efficient method for the rational growth of 2D twisted structures and the implementation of twist angle adjustable endowing them great potential for exploring strong coupling correlation physics and applications in the field of twistronics.</description>

      <title>Scalable On-Chip Optical Linear Processing Unit Using a Single Thin-Film Lithium Niobate Ring Modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and neuromorphic computing increasingly rely on the integration of photonics to achieve breakthroughs in processing capabilities. Our pioneering work introduces a photonic linear processing unit (LPU) that utilizes a cascading modulator structure incorporating micro-rings. This device, elegantly designed with only two thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) modulators coupled with a micro-ring, stands as a paradigm of innovation that merges low-power consumption with formidable computational throughput, achieving 36.7 billion operations per second (GOPs).The crux of our design lies in the ring-modulator's flexible architecture, engineered as a compact and singular unit, which markedly streamlines system complexity while bolstering energy efficiency. It adeptly facilitates large-scale dot-product operations, supporting vector dimensions up to 5832, an impressive feat by current standards. Furthermore, this ring-modulator-based LPU exhibits proficiency in image classification, processing 28*28-pixel resolution imagery post hardware training. As data volume demands surge, our architecture offers a scalable solution through parallel matrix multiplications, which hinge solely on increased modulation rates. This development paves the way for a new class of photonic processors that promise to handle escalating data workloads with unprecedented flexibility and efficiency.</description>

Abstract: We present analytical and numerical solutions of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the scattered wavefunctions generated by confocal parabolic billiards and parabolic segments with various $\delta$-type potential-strength functions. The analytical expressions are expressed as summations of products of parabolic cylinder functions $D_m$. We numerically investigate the resonances and tunneling in the confocal parabolic billiards by employing an accurate boundary wall method that provides a complete inside-outside picture. The criterion for discretizing the parabolic sides of the billiard is explained in detail. We discuss the phenomenon of transparency at certain eigenenergies.</description>

      <title>BICM-compatible Rate Adaptive Geometric Constellation Shaping Using Optimized Many-to-one Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a rate adaptive geometric constellation shaping (GCS) scheme which is fully backward-compatible with existing state of the art bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The system relies on optimization of the positions of the quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) points on the I/Q plane for maximized achievable information rate, while maintaining quantization and fiber nonlinear noise robustness. Furthermore, `dummy' bits are multiplexed with coded bits before mapping to symbols. Rate adaptivity is achieved by tuning the ratio of coded and `dummy' bits, while maintaining a fixed forward error-correction block and a fixed modulation format size. The points' positions and their labeling are optimized using automatic differentiation. The proposed GCS scheme is compared to a time-sharing hybrid (TH) QAM modulation and the now mainstream probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) scheme. The TH without shaping is outperformed for all studied data rates in a simulated linear channel by up to 0.7 dB. In a linear channel, PAS is shown to outperform the proposed GCS scheme, while similar performances are reported for PAS and the proposed GCS in a simulated nonlinear fiber channel. The GCS scheme is experimentally demonstrated in a multi-span recirculating loop coherent optical fiber transmission system with a total distance of up to 3000 km. Near-continuous zero-error flexible throughput is reported as a function of the transmission distance. Up to 1-2 spans of increased reach gains are achieved at the same net data rate w.r.t. conventional QAM. At a given distance, up to 0.79 bits/2D symbol of gain w.r.t. conventional QAM is achieved. In the experiment, similar performance to PAS is demonstrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although defocus can be used to generate partial phase contrast in transmission electron microscope images, cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) can be further improved by the development of phase plates which increase contrast by applying a phase shift to the unscattered part of the electron beam. Many approaches have been investigated, including the ponderomotive interaction between light and electrons. We review the recent successes achieved with this method in high-resolution, single-particle cryo-EM. We also review the status of using pulsed or near-field enhanced laser light as alternatives, along with approaches that use scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) with a segmented detector rather than a phase plate.</description>

      <title>Matrix decompositions in Quantum Optics: Takagi/Autonne, Bloch-Messiah/Euler, Iwasawa, and Williamson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we summarize four important matrix decompositions commonly used in quantum optics, namely the Takagi/Autonne, Bloch-Messiah/Euler, Iwasawa, and Williamson decompositions. The first two of these decompositions are specialized versions of the singular-value decomposition when applied to symmetric or symplectic matrices. The third factors any symplectic matrix in a unique way in terms of matrices that belong to different subgroups of the symplectic group. The last one instead gives the symplectic diagonalization of real, positive definite matrices of even size. While proofs of the existence of these decompositions exist in the literature, we focus on providing explicit constructions to implement these decompositions using standard linear algebra packages and functionalities such as singular-value, polar, Schur and QR decompositions, and matrix square roots and inverses.</description>

      <title>Gain-Loss-Induced Bipolar Non-Hermitian Skin Effect With Purely Imaginary Eigenenergies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices characterized by $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric gain and loss, where the real-gap transforms into an imaginary-gap with increasing strength of gain/loss. The energy spectrum, under open boundary conditions, consists of real eigenenergies in the presence of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, and the corresponding eigenstates are bulk modes. As the gain/loss is increased, $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaks, leading to an increase in the proportion of imaginary eigenenergies and the appearance of bipolar Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). Notably, the NHSE depending on the sign of their imaginary energy components. For Im$(E_{OBC})&gt;(&lt;)0$, the eigenstates localize at the right (left) boundary. These findings not only affirm the validity of our theoretical framework but also showcase the capability of engineered circuit systems to replicate intricate non-Hermitian phenomena. Our study unveils the unique characteristics of gain/loss-induced bipolar NHSE, shedding light on the exotic properties of non-Hermitian systems.</description>
