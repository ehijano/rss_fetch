      <title>Energy partition in collisionless counterstreaming plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast, counter-streaming plasma outflows drive magnetic field amplification, plasma heating, and particle acceleration in numerous astrophysical environments, from supernova remnant shocks to active galactic nuclei jets. Understanding how, in the absence of Coulomb collisions, energy is redistributed between the different plasma species remains a fundamental open question. We use 3D fully-kinetic simulations to investigate energy partition in weakly magnetized counter-propagating plasmas. Our results reveal a complex interplay between different processes, where at early times the Weibel instability drives a first stage of magnetic field amplification and at late times the kinking of current filaments drives a second amplification stage via a dynamo-type mechanism. Electrons are heated primarily during the latter phase through magnetic pumping. By the time the flows thermalize, we observe that the final temperature ratio $T_e/T_i$ and energy partition depend on the ion-to-electron mass ratio. For electron-proton flows, the electron thermal energy only reaches up to a few percent of the initial ion kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Effect of Controlled Magnetic Island Bifurcation on Electron Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic islands strongly influence cross-field electron transport in magnetized plasmas. In particular, bifurcations of the island topology modify the number and location of O-points, X-points, and separatrix boundaries, thereby altering diffusion pathways. In recent DIII-D experiments, external magnetic perturbations were used to rotate and periodically bifurcate the island on the q = 2 surface, causing a switchback between a q = 2/1-dominated structure and a narrower q = 4/2-dominated structure. To investigate how this topological change affects electron transport, we employ the field line tracing code TRIP3D with an implemented collisional operator. Thermal, tracer electrons launched from O-points, X-points, and outside separatrix boundaries reveal distinct diffusion regimes, including classical, subdiffusive, and superdiffusive behavior, depending on both the dominant island mode and launch location. These results suggest that island bifurcation can alter electron diffusion across rational surfaces, with direct implications for particle confinement. While the present work emphasizes diffusion as a general framework, the findings provide insight into the conditions under which electron trapping into an island or stochastization of the island's separatrix can enable additional mechanisms, such as the generation of energetic electrons.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Compression of Compact Tori Experiment and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic compression experiment at General Fusion was a repetitive non-destructive test to study plasma physics applicable to magnetic target fusion compression. A compact torus (CT) is formed with a co-axial gun into a containment region with an hour-glass shaped inner flux conserver, and an insulating outer wall. External coil currents keep the CT off the outer wall (radial levitation) and then rapidly compress it inwards. The optimal external coil configuration greatly improved both the levitated CT lifetime and the recurrence rate of shots with good compressional flux conservation. As confirmed by spectrometer data, the improved levitation field profile reduced plasma impurity levels by suppressing the interaction between plasma and the insulating outer wall during the formation process. Significant increases in magnetic field, electron density, and ion temperature were routinely observed at magnetic compression in the final external coil configuration tested, despite the prevalence of an instability, thought be an external kink mode, at compression. Matching the decay rate of the levitation currents to that of the CT currents resulted in a reduced level of MHD activity associated with unintentional compression by the levitation field, and a higher probability of long-lived CTs. The DELiTE (Differential Equations on Linear Triangular Elements) framework was developed for spatial discretisation of partial differential equations on an unstructured triangular grid in axisymmetric geometry. The framework is based on discrete differential operators in matrix form, which are derived using linear finite elements and mimic some of the properties of their continuous counterparts. A single-fluid two-temperature MHD model is implemented in this framework.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of External Magnetic Field on the Change in Cross-section of a Toroidal Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to any toroidal current column, the magnetic field is found to be sensitive as well as insensitive to its cross-sectional area depending on location of subject point, as predicted by numerical approaches [S. Aich, J. Thakkar, and J. Ghosh, Plasma Fusion Res. 17, 2403055 (2022)], and hence the presence of an angle of invariance is found to be present for any toroidal geometry. Present study aims to validate those numerical observations using the measured magnetic field due to Aditya Upgrade tokamak plasma.</description>

      <title>Advanced Shaping of Quasi-Bessel Beams for High-Intensity Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-Bessel beams produced by axiparabolas are increasingly used in high-intensity laser applications, yet their longitudinal profiles exhibit unwanted oscillations that limit their effectiveness. Here we identify the physical origin of these distortions and develop a general strategy to control the on-axis intensity of extended focal lines. By combining analytical insight with numerical and experimental validation, we show how both smooth and sharply structured longitudinal profiles can be reliably produced. This establishes a robust framework for tailoring quasi-Bessel beams in regimes relevant to laser-plasma acceleration, advanced photon sources, and other high-field applications.</description>

      <title>Detecting Solenoidal Plasma Turbulence via Laser Polarization Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies suggest that solenoidal turbulence can significantly enhance fusion reactivity, yet no standard diagnostic exists to directly measure these solenoidal flows in high-energy-density plasmas, nor to distinguish between solenoidal and compressional turbulence. We propose a method that directly diagnoses the energy and spatial structure of this rotational turbulence using the cross-polarization scattering of a probe laser. By coupling to the plasma vorticity, the scattering generates a cross-polarized signal proportional to the turbulent vorticity, effectively acting as a calorimeter for shear flows. We identify a diffractive scattering signature analogous to ``Debye-Scherrer ring'' that reveals the eddy size distribution. We show that this technique is applicable to National Ignition Facility (NIF) implosion conditions and other high-energy-density scenarios.</description>

      <title>Induced Scattering of Fast Radio Bursts in Magnetar Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate induced Compton/Brillouin scattering of electromagnetic waves in magnetized electron and positron pair plasma by verifying kinetic theory with Particle-in-Cell simulations. Applying this to fast radio bursts (FRBs) in magnetar magnetospheres, we find that the scattering--although suppressed by the magnetic field--inevitably enters the linear growth stage. The subsequent evolution bifurcates: full scattering occurs when the density exceeds a critical value, whereas below it the scattering saturates and the FRB can escape. This eases the tension with observations of compact emission regions and may explain the observed diversity, including the presence or absence of FRBs associated with X-ray bursts.</description>

      <title>Maximum Energy of Particles Accelerated in GRB Afterglow Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle acceleration in relativistic collisionless shocks remains an open problem in high-energy astrophysics. Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations predict that electron acceleration in weakly magnetized shocks proceeds via small-angle scattering, leading to a maximum electron energy significantly below the Bohm limit. This upper bound manifests observationally as a characteristic synchrotron cutoff, providing a direct probe of the underlying acceleration physics. Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows offer an exceptional laboratory for testing these predictions. Here, we model the spectral evolution of GRB afterglows during the relativistic deceleration phase, incorporating PIC-motivated acceleration prescriptions and self-consistently computing synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton emission. We find that low-energy bursts in low-density environments, typical of short GRBs, exhibit a pronounced synchrotron cutoff in the GeV band within minutes to hours after the trigger. Applying our framework to GRB 190114C and GRB 130427A, we find that current observations are insufficient to discriminate between PIC-motivated acceleration and the Bohm limit, primarily due to large uncertainties in the Fermi-LAT band. Nevertheless, future MeV-TeV afterglow observations can break model degeneracies and place substantially tighter constraints on particle acceleration in relativistic shocks.</description>

      <title>High-order exponential solver method for particle-in-cell simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outstanding advances in solid-state laser technology, employing the optical parametric chirped-pulse-amplification (OPCPA) technique, have led physicists to focus laser pulses to highly-relativistic intensities which led to novel schemes for charged-particle acceleration and radiation generation in laser-driven plasmas. Microscopic understanding of these highly nonlinear processes is possible via accurate modeling of the laser-plasma interaction using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. Numerous codes are available and they rely on finite difference time domain methods on Yee-grids or on the analytical solution of the Maxwell-equations in spectral space. In this work, we present a solution bridging these two methods, which we call finite difference exponential time domain solution. This method could provide a very high accuracy even in 3D, but with improved locality, similar to the pseudospectral analytical methods without relying on transformation to special basis functions. We verified the accuracy and the convergence of the method in various benchmarks, including laser propagation in vacuum and in underdense plasma. We also simulated electron injection in a non-linear laser-plasma wakefield acceleration and surface high-harmonic generation in the overdense regime. The results are then compared with those obtained from standard PIC codes.</description>
