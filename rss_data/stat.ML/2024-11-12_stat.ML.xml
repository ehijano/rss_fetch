      <title>A Fundamental Accuracy--Robustness Trade-off in Regression and Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a fundamental trade-off between standard and adversarial risk in a rather general situation that formalizes the following simple intuition: "If no (nearly) optimal predictor is smooth, adversarial robustness comes at the cost of accuracy." As a concrete example, we evaluate the derived trade-off in regression with polynomial ridge functions under mild regularity conditions.</description>

      <title>Compactly-supported nonstationary kernels for computing exact Gaussian processes on big data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaussian process (GP) is a widely used probabilistic machine learning method for stochastic function approximation, stochastic modeling, and analyzing real-world measurements of nonlinear processes. Unlike many other machine learning methods, GPs include an implicit characterization of uncertainty, making them extremely useful across many areas of science, technology, and engineering. Traditional implementations of GPs involve stationary kernels (also termed covariance functions) that limit their flexibility and exact methods for inference that prevent application to data sets with more than about ten thousand points. Modern approaches to address stationarity assumptions generally fail to accommodate large data sets, while all attempts to address scalability focus on approximating the Gaussian likelihood, which can involve subjectivity and lead to inaccuracies. In this work, we explicitly derive an alternative kernel that can discover and encode both sparsity and nonstationarity. We embed the kernel within a fully Bayesian GP model and leverage high-performance computing resources to enable the analysis of massive data sets. We demonstrate the favorable performance of our novel kernel relative to existing exact and approximate GP methods across a variety of synthetic data examples. Furthermore, we conduct space-time prediction based on more than one million measurements of daily maximum temperature and verify that our results outperform state-of-the-art methods in the Earth sciences. More broadly, having access to exact GPs that use ultra-scalable, sparsity-discovering, nonstationary kernels allows GP methods to truly compete with a wide variety of machine learning methods.</description>

      <title>Deep Nonparametric Conditional Independence Tests for Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional independence tests (CITs) test for conditional dependence between random variables. As existing CITs are limited in their applicability to complex, high-dimensional variables such as images, we introduce deep nonparametric CITs (DNCITs). The DNCITs combine embedding maps, which extract feature representations of high-dimensional variables, with nonparametric CITs applicable to these feature representations. For the embedding maps, we derive general properties on their parameter estimators to obtain valid DNCITs and show that these properties include embedding maps learned through (conditional) unsupervised or transfer learning. For the nonparametric CITs, appropriate tests are selected and adapted to be applicable to feature representations. Through simulations, we investigate the performance of the DNCITs for different embedding maps and nonparametric CITs under varying confounder dimensions and confounder relationships. We apply the DNCITs to brain MRI scans and behavioral traits, given confounders, of healthy individuals from the UK Biobank (UKB), confirming null results from a number of ambiguous personality neuroscience studies with a larger data set and with our more powerful tests. In addition, in a confounder control study, we apply the DNCITs to brain MRI scans and a confounder set to test for sufficient confounder control, leading to a potential reduction in the confounder dimension under improved confounder control compared to existing state-of-the-art confounder control studies for the UKB. Finally, we provide an R package implementing the DNCITs.</description>

      <title>Amortized Bayesian Local Interpolation NetworK: Fast covariance parameter estimation for Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are a ubiquitous tool for geostatistical modeling with high levels of flexibility and interpretability, and the ability to make predictions at unseen spatial locations through a process called Kriging. Estimation of Kriging weights relies on the inversion of the process' covariance matrix, creating a computational bottleneck for large spatial datasets. In this paper, we propose an Amortized Bayesian Local Interpolation NetworK (A-BLINK) for fast covariance parameter estimation, which uses two pre-trained deep neural networks to learn a mapping from spatial location coordinates and covariance function parameters to Kriging weights and the spatial variance, respectively. The fast prediction time of these networks allows us to bypass the matrix inversion step, creating large computational speedups over competing methods in both frequentist and Bayesian settings, and also provides full posterior inference and predictions using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods. We show significant increases in computational efficiency over comparable scalable GP methodology in an extensive simulation study with lower parameter estimation error. The efficacy of our approach is also demonstrated using a temperature dataset of US climate normals for 1991--2020 based on over 7,000 weather stations.</description>

      <title>Optimized Quality of Service prediction in FSO Links over South Africa using Ensemble Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibre optic communication system is expected to increase exponentially in terms of application due to the numerous advantages over copper wires. The optical network evolution presents several advantages such as over long-distance, low-power requirement, higher carrying capacity and high bandwidth among others Such network bandwidth surpasses methods of transmission that include copper cables and microwaves. Despite these benefits, free-space optical communications are severely impacted by harsh weather situations like mist, precipitation, blizzard, fume, soil, and drizzle debris in the atmosphere, all of which have an impact on the Quality of Service (QoS) rendered by the systems. The primary goal of this article is to optimize the QoS using the ensemble learning models Random Forest, ADaBoost Regression, Stacking Regression, Gradient Boost Regression, and Multilayer Neural Network. To accomplish the stated goal, meteorological data, visibility, wind speed, and altitude were obtained from the South Africa Weather Services archive during a ten-year period (2010 to 2019) at four different locations: Polokwane, Kimberley, Bloemfontein, and George. We estimated the data rate, power received, fog-induced attenuation, bit error rate and power penalty using the collected and processed data. The RMSE and R-squared values of the model across all the study locations, Polokwane, Kimberley, Bloemfontein, and George, are 0.0073 and 0.9951, 0.0065 and 0.9998, 0.0060 and 0.9941, and 0.0032 and 0.9906, respectively. The result showed that using ensemble learning techniques in transmission modeling can significantly enhance service quality and meet customer service level agreements and ensemble method was successful in efficiently optimizing the signal to noise ratio, which in turn enhanced the QoS at the point of reception.</description>

      <title>Effect sizes as a statistical feature-selector-based learning to detect breast cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breast cancer detection is still an open research field, despite a tremendous effort devoted to work in this area. Effect size is a statistical concept that measures the strength of the relationship between two variables on a numeric scale. Feature selection is widely used to reduce the dimensionality of data by selecting only a subset of predictor variables to improve a learning model. In this work, an algorithm and experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a statistical feature-selector-based learning tool capable of reducing the data dimensionality using parametric effect size measures from features extracted from cell nuclei images. The SVM classifier with a linear kernel as a learning tool achieved an accuracy of over 90%. These excellent results suggest that the effect size is within the standards of the feature-selector methods</description>

      <title>Causal-discovery-based root-cause analysis and its application in time-series prediction error diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent rapid advancements of machine learning have greatly enhanced the accuracy of prediction models, but most models remain "black boxes", making prediction error diagnosis challenging, especially with outliers. This lack of transparency hinders trust and reliability in industrial applications. Heuristic attribution methods, while helpful, often fail to capture true causal relationships, leading to inaccurate error attributions. Various root-cause analysis methods have been developed using Shapley values, yet they typically require predefined causal graphs, limiting their applicability for prediction errors in machine learning models. To address these limitations, we introduce the Causal-Discovery-based Root-Cause Analysis (CD-RCA) method that estimates causal relationships between the prediction error and the explanatory variables, without needing a pre-defined causal graph. By simulating synthetic error data, CD-RCA can identify variable contributions to outliers in prediction errors by Shapley values. Extensive simulations show CD-RCA outperforms current heuristic attribution methods, and a sensitivity analysis reveals new patterns where Shapley values may misattribute errors, paving the way for more accurate error attribution methods.</description>

      <title>Unified Bayesian representation for high-dimensional multi-modal biomedical data for small-sample classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BALDUR, a novel Bayesian algorithm designed to deal with multi-modal datasets and small sample sizes in high-dimensional settings while providing explainable solutions. To do so, the proposed model combines within a common latent space the different data views to extract the relevant information to solve the classification task and prune out the irrelevant/redundant features/data views. Furthermore, to provide generalizable solutions in small sample size scenarios, BALDUR efficiently integrates dual kernels over the views with a small sample-to-feature ratio. Finally, its linear nature ensures the explainability of the model outcomes, allowing its use for biomarker identification. This model was tested over two different neurodegeneration datasets, outperforming the state-of-the-art models and detecting features aligned with markers already described in the scientific literature.</description>

      <title>Conditional simulation via entropic optimal transport: Toward non-parametric estimation of conditional Brenier maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional simulation is a fundamental task in statistical modeling: Generate samples from the conditionals given finitely many data points from a joint distribution. One promising approach is to construct conditional Brenier maps, where the components of the map pushforward a reference distribution to conditionals of the target. While many estimators exist, few, if any, come with statistical or algorithmic guarantees. To this end, we propose a non-parametric estimator for conditional Brenier maps based on the computational scalability of \emph{entropic} optimal transport. Our estimator leverages a result of Carlier et al. (2010), which shows that optimal transport maps under a rescaled quadratic cost asymptotically converge to conditional Brenier maps; our estimator is precisely the entropic analogues of these converging maps. We provide heuristic justifications for choosing the scaling parameter in the cost as a function of the number of samples by fully characterizing the Gaussian setting. We conclude by comparing the performance of the estimator to other machine learning and non-parametric approaches on benchmark datasets and Bayesian inference problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In evolutionary computation, it is commonly assumed that a search algorithm acquires knowledge about a problem instance by sampling solutions from the search space and evaluating them with a fitness function. This is necessarily inefficient because fitness reveals very little about solutions -- yet they contain more information that can be potentially exploited. To address this observation in genetic programming, we propose EvoNUDGE, which uses a graph neural network to elicit additional knowledge from symbolic regression problems. The network is queried on the problem before an evolutionary run to produce a library of subprograms, which is subsequently used to seed the initial population and bias the actions of search operators. In an extensive experiment on a large number of problem instances, EvoNUDGE is shown to significantly outperform multiple baselines, including the conventional tree-based genetic programming and the purely neural variant of the method.</description>

      <title>Utilizing RNN for Real-time Cryptocurrency Price Prediction and Trading Strategy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for real-time cryptocurrency price prediction and optimized trading strategies. Given the high volatility of the cryptocurrency market, traditional forecasting models often fall short. By leveraging RNNs' capability to capture long-term patterns in time-series data, this research aims to improve accuracy in price prediction and develop effective trading strategies. The project follows a structured approach involving data collection, preprocessing, and model refinement, followed by rigorous backtesting for profitability and risk assessment. This work contributes to both the academic and practical fields by providing a robust predictive model and optimized trading strategies that address the challenges of cryptocurrency trading.</description>

      <title>Fully Automated Correlated Time Series Forecasting in Minutes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Societal and industrial infrastructures and systems increasingly leverage sensors that emit correlated time series. Forecasting of future values of such time series based on recorded historical values has important benefits. Automatically designed models achieve higher accuracy than manually designed models. Given a forecasting task, which includes a dataset and a forecasting horizon, automated design methods automatically search for an optimal forecasting model for the task in a manually designed search space, and then train the identified model using the dataset to enable the forecasting. Existing automated methods face three challenges. First, the search space is constructed by human experts, rending the methods only semi-automated and yielding search spaces prone to subjective biases. Second, it is time consuming to search for an optimal model. Third, training the identified model for a new task is also costly. These challenges limit the practicability of automated methods in real-world settings. To contend with the challenges, we propose a fully automated and highly efficient correlated time series forecasting framework where the search and training can be done in minutes. The framework includes a data-driven, iterative strategy to automatically prune a large search space to obtain a high-quality search space for a new forecasting task. It includes a zero-shot search strategy to efficiently identify the optimal model in the customized search space. And it includes a fast parameter adaptation strategy to accelerate the training of the identified model. Experiments on seven benchmark datasets offer evidence that the framework is capable of state-of-the-art accuracy and is much more efficient than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Are Deep Learning Methods Suitable for Downscaling Global Climate Projections? Review and Intercomparison of Existing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise for downscaling global climate change projections under different approaches, including Perfect Prognosis (PP) and Regional Climate Model (RCM) emulation. Unlike emulators, PP downscaling models are trained on observational data, so it remains an open question whether they can plausibly extrapolate unseen conditions and changes in future emissions scenarios. Here we focus on this problem as the main drawback for the operationalization of these methods and present the results of 1) a literature review to identify state-of-the-art DL models for PP downscaling and 2) an intercomparison experiment to evaluate the performance of these models and to assess their extrapolation capability using a common experimental framework, taking into account the sensitivity of results to different training replicas. We focus on minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation over Spain, a region with a range of climatic conditions with different influential regional processes. We conclude with a discussion of the findings, limitations of existing methods, and prospects for future development.</description>

      <title>$\spadesuit$ SPADE $\spadesuit$ Split Peak Attention DEcomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demand forecasting faces challenges induced by Peak Events (PEs) corresponding to special periods such as promotions and holidays. Peak events create significant spikes in demand followed by demand ramp down periods. Neural networks like MQCNN and MQT overreact to demand peaks by carrying over the elevated PE demand into subsequent Post-Peak-Event (PPE) periods, resulting in significantly over-biased forecasts. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a neural forecasting model called Split Peak Attention DEcomposition, SPADE. This model reduces the impact of PEs on subsequent forecasts by modeling forecasting as consisting of two separate tasks: one for PEs; and the other for the rest. Its architecture then uses masked convolution filters and a specialized Peak Attention module. We show SPADE's performance on a worldwide retail dataset with hundreds of millions of products. Our results reveal a reduction in PPE degradation by 4.5% and an improvement in PE accuracy by 3.9%, relative to current production models.</description>

      <title>Generative Adapter: Contextualizing Language Models in Parameters with A Single Forward Pass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LMs) are typically adapted to improve performance on new contexts (\eg text prompts that define new tasks or domains) through fine-tuning or prompting. However, there is an accuracy compute tradeoff -- fine-tuning incurs significant training cost and prompting increases inference overhead. We introduce $GenerativeAdapter$, an effective and efficient adaptation method that directly maps new contexts to low-rank LM adapters, thereby significantly reducing inference overhead with no need for finetuning. The adapter generator is trained via self-supervised learning, and can be used to adapt a single frozen LM for any new task simply by mapping the associated task or domain context to a new adapter. We apply $GenerativeAdapter$ to two pretrained LMs (Mistral-7B-Instruct and Llama2-7B-Chat) and evaluate the adapted models in three adaption scenarios: knowledge acquisition from documents, learning from demonstrations, and personalization for users. In StreamingQA, our approach is effective in injecting knowledge into the LM's parameters, achieving a 63.5% improvement in F1 score over the model with supervised fine-tuning (from $19.5$ to $31.5$) for contexts as long as 32K tokens. In the MetaICL in-context learning evaluation, our method achieves an average accuracy of $44.9$ across 26 tasks, outperforming the base model. On MSC, our method proves to be highly competitive in memorizing user information from conversations with a 4x reduction in computation and memory costs compared to prompting with full conversation history. Together, these results suggest that $GenerativeAdapter$ should allow for general adaption to a wide range of different contexts.</description>

      <title>DNAMite: Interpretable Calibrated Survival Analysis with Discretized Additive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survival analysis is a classic problem in statistics with important applications in healthcare. Most machine learning models for survival analysis are black-box models, limiting their use in healthcare settings where interpretability is paramount. More recently, glass-box machine learning models have been introduced for survival analysis, with both strong predictive performance and interpretability. Still, several gaps remain, as no prior glass-box survival model can produce calibrated shape functions with enough flexibility to capture the complex patterns often found in real data. To fill this gap, we introduce a new glass-box machine learning model for survival analysis called DNAMite. DNAMite uses feature discretization and kernel smoothing in its embedding module, making it possible to learn shape functions with a flexible balance of smoothness and jaggedness. Further, DNAMite produces calibrated shape functions that can be directly interpreted as contributions to the cumulative incidence function. Our experiments show that DNAMite generates shape functions closer to true shape functions on synthetic data, while making predictions with comparable predictive performance and better calibration than previous glass-box and black-box models.</description>

      <title>Variance-Aware Linear UCB with Deep Representation for Neural Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By leveraging the representation power of deep neural networks, neural upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms have shown success in contextual bandits. To further balance the exploration and exploitation, we propose Neural-$\sigma^2$-LinearUCB, a variance-aware algorithm that utilizes $\sigma^2_t$, i.e., an upper bound of the reward noise variance at round $t$, to enhance the uncertainty quantification quality of the UCB, resulting in a regret performance improvement. We provide an oracle version for our algorithm characterized by an oracle variance upper bound $\sigma^2_t$ and a practical version with a novel estimation for this variance bound. Theoretically, we provide rigorous regret analysis for both versions and prove that our oracle algorithm achieves a better regret guarantee than other neural-UCB algorithms in the neural contextual bandits setting. Empirically, our practical method enjoys a similar computational efficiency, while outperforming state-of-the-art techniques by having a better calibration and lower regret across multiple standard settings, including on the synthetic, UCI, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets.</description>

      <title>Filling in Missing FX Implied Volatilities with Uncertainties: Improving VAE-Based Volatility Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing data is a common problem in finance and often requires methods to fill in the gaps, or in other words, imputation. In this work, we focused on the imputation of missing implied volatilities for FX options. Prior work has used variational autoencoders (VAEs), a neural network-based approach, to solve this problem; however, using stronger classical baselines such as Heston with jumps can significantly outperform their results. We show that simple modifications to the architecture of the VAE lead to significant imputation performance improvements (e.g., in low missingness regimes, nearly cutting the error by half), removing the necessity of using $\beta$-VAEs. Further, we modify the VAE imputation algorithm in order to better handle the uncertainty in data, as well as to obtain accurate uncertainty estimates around imputed values.</description>

      <title>Learning Mixtures of Experts with EM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixtures of Experts (MoE) are Machine Learning models that involve partitioning the input space, with a separate "expert" model trained on each partition. Recently, MoE have become popular as components in today's large language models as a means to reduce training and inference costs. There, the partitioning function and the experts are both learnt jointly via gradient descent on the log-likelihood. In this paper we focus on studying the efficiency of the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm for the training of MoE models. We first rigorously analyze EM for the cases of linear or logistic experts, where we show that EM is equivalent to Mirror Descent with unit step size and a Kullback-Leibler Divergence regularizer. This perspective allows us to derive new convergence results and identify conditions for local linear convergence based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Experiments on synthetic and (small-scale) real-world data show that EM outperforms the gradient descent algorithm both in terms of convergence rate and the achieved accuracy.</description>

      <title>Model Selection for Average Reward RL with Application to Utility Maximization in Repeated Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In standard RL, a learner attempts to learn an optimal policy for a Markov Decision Process whose structure (e.g. state space) is known. In online model selection, a learner attempts to learn an optimal policy for an MDP knowing only that it belongs to one of $M &gt;1$ model classes of varying complexity. Recent results have shown that this can be feasibly accomplished in episodic online RL. In this work, we propose $\mathsf{MRBEAR}$, an online model selection algorithm for the average reward RL setting. The regret of the algorithm is in $\tilde O(M C_{m^*}^2 \mathsf{B}_{m^*}(T,\delta))$ where $C_{m^*}$ represents the complexity of the simplest well-specified model class and $\mathsf{B}_{m^*}(T,\delta)$ is its corresponding regret bound. This result shows that in average reward RL, like the episodic online RL, the additional cost of model selection scales only linearly in $M$, the number of model classes. We apply $\mathsf{MRBEAR}$ to the interaction between a learner and an opponent in a two-player simultaneous general-sum repeated game, where the opponent follows a fixed unknown limited memory strategy. The learner's goal is to maximize its utility without knowing the opponent's utility function. The interaction is over $T$ rounds with no episode or discounting which leads us to measure the learner's performance by average reward regret. In this application, our algorithm enjoys an opponent-complexity-dependent regret in $\tilde O(M(\mathsf{sp}(h^*) B^{m^*} A^{m^*+1})^{\frac{3}{2}} \sqrt{T})$, where $m^*\le M$ is the unknown memory limit of the opponent, $\mathsf{sp}(h^*)$ is the unknown span of optimal bias induced by the opponent, and $A$ and $B$ are the number of actions for the learner and opponent respectively. We also show that the exponential dependency on $m^*$ is inevitable by proving a lower bound on the learner's regret.</description>

      <title>Mutual-energy inner product optimization method for constructing feature coordinates and image classification in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a key task in machine learning, data classification is essentially to find a suitable coordinate system to represent data features of different classes of samples. This paper proposes the mutual-energy inner product optimization method for constructing a feature coordinate system. First, by analyzing the solution space and eigenfunctions of partial differential equations describing a non-uniform membrane, the mutual-energy inner product is defined. Second, by expressing the mutual-energy inner product as a series of eigenfunctions, it shows a significant advantage of enhancing low-frequency features and suppressing high-frequency noise, compared with the Euclidean inner product. And then, a mutual-energy inner product optimization model is built to extract data features, and convexity and concavity properties of its objective function are discussed. Next, by combining the finite element method, a stable and efficient sequential linearization algorithm is constructed to solve the optimization model. This algorithm only solves equations including positive definite symmetric matrix and linear programming with a few constraints, and its vectorized implementation is discussed. Finally, the mutual-energy inner product optimization method is used to construct feature coordinates, and multi-class Gaussian classifiers are trained on the MINST training set. Good prediction results of Gaussian classifiers are achieved on the MINST test set.</description>

      <title>Alleviating Hyperparameter-Tuning Burden in SVM Classifiers for Pulmonary Nodules Diagnosis with Multi-Task Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of non-invasive medical imaging, radiomic features are utilized to measure tumor characteristics. However, these features can be affected by the techniques used to discretize the images, ultimately impacting the accuracy of diagnosis. To investigate the influence of various image discretization methods on diagnosis, it is common practice to evaluate multiple discretization strategies individually. This approach often leads to redundant and time-consuming tasks such as training predictive models and fine-tuning hyperparameters separately. This study examines the feasibility of employing multi-task Bayesian optimization to accelerate the hyperparameters search for classifying benign and malignant pulmonary nodules using RBF SVM. Our findings suggest that multi-task Bayesian optimization significantly accelerates the search for hyperparameters in comparison to a single-task approach. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation to utilize multi-task Bayesian optimization in a critical medical context.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayes Portfolio Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portfolio construction is the science of balancing reward and risk; it is at the core of modern finance. In this paper, we tackle the question of optimal decision-making within a Bayesian paradigm, starting from a decision-theoretic formulation. Despite the inherent intractability of the optimal decision in any interesting scenarios, we manage to rewrite it as a saddle-point problem. Leveraging the literature on variational Bayes (VB), we propose a relaxation of the original problem. This novel methodology results in an efficient algorithm that not only performs well but is also provably convergent. Furthermore, we provide theoretical results on the statistical consistency of the resulting decision with the optimal Bayesian decision. Using real data, our proposal significantly enhances the speed and scalability of portfolio selection problems. We benchmark our results against state-of-the-art algorithms, as well as a Monte Carlo algorithm targeting the optimal decision.</description>

      <title>Weak to Strong Learning from Aggregate Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In learning from aggregate labels, the training data consists of sets or "bags" of feature-vectors (instances) along with an aggregate label for each bag derived from the (usually {0,1}-valued) labels of its instances. In learning from label proportions (LLP), the aggregate label is the average of the bag's instance labels, whereas in multiple instance learning (MIL) it is the OR. The goal is to train an instance-level predictor, typically achieved by fitting a model on the training data, in particular one that maximizes the accuracy which is the fraction of satisfied bags i.e., those on which the predicted labels are consistent with the aggregate label. A weak learner has at a constant accuracy &lt; 1 on the training bags, while a strong learner's accuracy can be arbitrarily close to 1. We study the problem of using a weak learner on such training bags with aggregate labels to obtain a strong learner, analogous to supervised learning for which boosting algorithms are known. Our first result shows the impossibility of boosting in LLP using weak classifiers of any accuracy &lt; 1 by constructing a collection of bags for which such weak learners (for any weight assignment) exist, while not admitting any strong learner. A variant of this construction also rules out boosting in MIL for a non-trivial range of weak learner accuracy. In the LLP setting however, we show that a weak learner (with small accuracy) on large enough bags can in fact be used to obtain a strong learner for small bags, in polynomial time. We also provide more efficient, sampling based variant of our procedure with probabilistic guarantees which are empirically validated on three real and two synthetic datasets. Our work is the first to theoretically study weak to strong learning from aggregate labels, with an algorithm to achieve the same for LLP, while proving the impossibility of boosting for both LLP and MIL.</description>

      <title>RandNet-Parareal: a time-parallel PDE solver using Random Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel-in-time (PinT) techniques have been proposed to solve systems of time-dependent differential equations by parallelizing the temporal domain. Among them, Parareal computes the solution sequentially using an inaccurate (fast) solver, and then "corrects" it using an accurate (slow) integrator that runs in parallel across temporal subintervals. This work introduces RandNet-Parareal, a novel method to learn the discrepancy between the coarse and fine solutions using random neural networks (RandNets). RandNet-Parareal achieves speed gains up to x125 and x22 compared to the fine solver run serially and Parareal, respectively. Beyond theoretical guarantees of RandNets as universal approximators, these models are quick to train, allowing the PinT solution of partial differential equations on a spatial mesh of up to $10^5$ points with minimal overhead, dramatically increasing the scalability of existing PinT approaches. RandNet-Parareal's numerical performance is illustrated on systems of real-world significance, such as the viscous Burgers' equation, the Diffusion-Reaction equation, the two- and three-dimensional Brusselator, and the shallow water equation.</description>

Abstract: The PAC-Bayesian framework has significantly advanced our understanding of statistical learning, particularly in majority voting methods. However, its application to multi-view learning remains underexplored. In this paper, we extend PAC-Bayesian theory to the multi-view setting, introducing novel PAC-Bayesian bounds based on R\'enyi divergence. These bounds improve upon traditional Kullback-Leibler divergence and offer more refined complexity measures. We further propose first and second-order oracle PAC-Bayesian bounds, along with an extension of the C-bound for multi-view learning. To ensure practical applicability, we develop efficient optimization algorithms with self-bounding properties.</description>

      <title>Regret Minimization and Statistical Inference in Online Decision Making with High-dimensional Covariates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates regret minimization, statistical inference, and their interplay in high-dimensional online decision-making based on the sparse linear context bandit model. We integrate the $\varepsilon$-greedy bandit algorithm for decision-making with a hard thresholding algorithm for estimating sparse bandit parameters and introduce an inference framework based on a debiasing method using inverse propensity weighting. Under a margin condition, our method achieves either $O(T^{1/2})$ regret or classical $O(T^{1/2})$-consistent inference, indicating an unavoidable trade-off between exploration and exploitation. If a diverse covariate condition holds, we demonstrate that a pure-greedy bandit algorithm, i.e., exploration-free, combined with a debiased estimator based on average weighting can simultaneously achieve optimal $O(\log T)$ regret and $O(T^{1/2})$-consistent inference. We also show that a simple sample mean estimator can provide valid inference for the optimal policy's value. Numerical simulations and experiments on Warfarin dosing data validate the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Stabilized Inverse Probability Weighting via Isotonic Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse weighting with an estimated propensity score is widely used by estimation methods in causal inference to adjust for confounding bias. However, directly inverting propensity score estimates can lead to instability, bias, and excessive variability due to large inverse weights, especially when treatment overlap is limited. In this work, we propose a post-hoc calibration algorithm for inverse propensity weights that generates well-calibrated, stabilized weights from user-supplied, cross-fitted propensity score estimates. Our approach employs a variant of isotonic regression with a loss function specifically tailored to the inverse propensity weights. Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies, we demonstrate that isotonic calibration improves the performance of doubly robust estimators of the average treatment effect.</description>

Abstract: Hierarchical time series forecasting plays a crucial role in decision-making in various domains while presenting significant challenges for modelling as they involve multiple levels of aggregation, constraints, and availability of information. This study explores the influence of distinct information utilisation on the accuracy of hierarchical forecasts, proposing and evaluating locals and a range of Global Forecasting Models (GFMs). In contrast to local models, which forecast each series independently, we develop GFMs to exploit cross-series and cross-hierarchies information, improving both forecasting performance and computational efficiency. We employ reconciliation methods to ensure coherency in forecasts and use the Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) and Multiple Comparisons with the Best (MCB) tests to assess statistical significance. The findings indicate that GFMs possess significant advantages for hierarchical forecasting, providing more accurate and computationally efficient solutions across different levels in a hierarchy. Two specific GFMs based on LightGBM are introduced, demonstrating superior accuracy and lower model complexity than their counterpart local models and conventional methods such as Exponential Smoothing (ES) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).</description>

      <title>Locally Adaptive One-Class Classifier Fusion with Dynamic $\ell$p-Norm Constraints for Robust Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to one-class classifier fusion through locally adaptive learning with dynamic $\ell$p-norm constraints. We introduce a framework that dynamically adjusts fusion weights based on local data characteristics, addressing fundamental challenges in ensemble-based anomaly detection. Our method incorporates an interior-point optimization technique that significantly improves computational efficiency compared to traditional Frank-Wolfe approaches, achieving up to 19-fold speed improvements in complex scenarios. The framework is extensively evaluated on standard UCI benchmark datasets and specialized temporal sequence datasets, demonstrating superior performance across diverse anomaly types. Statistical validation through Skillings-Mack tests confirms our method's significant advantages over existing approaches, with consistent top rankings in both pure and non-pure learning scenarios. The framework's ability to adapt to local data patterns while maintaining computational efficiency makes it particularly valuable for real-time applications where rapid and accurate anomaly detection is crucial.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Rule Lists</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models deployed in sensitive areas such as healthcare must be interpretable to ensure accountability and fairness. Rule lists (if Age &lt; 35 $\wedge$ Priors &gt; 0 then Recidivism = True, else if Next Condition . . . ) offer full transparency, making them well-suited for high-stakes decisions. However, learning such rule lists presents significant challenges. Existing methods based on combinatorial optimization require feature pre-discretization and impose restrictions on rule size. Neuro-symbolic methods use more scalable continuous optimization yet place similar pre-discretization constraints and suffer from unstable optimization. To address the existing limitations, we introduce NeuRules, an end-to-end trainable model that unifies discretization, rule learning, and rule order into a single differentiable framework. We formulate a continuous relaxation of the rule list learning problem that converges to a strict rule list through temperature annealing. NeuRules learns both the discretizations of individual features, as well as their combination into conjunctive rules without any pre-processing or restrictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuRules consistently outperforms both combinatorial and neuro-symbolic methods, effectively learning simple and complex rules, as well as their order, across a wide range of datasets.</description>

      <title>Individual Regret in Cooperative Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the regret in stochastic Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB) with multiple agents that communicate over an arbitrary connected communication graph. We show a near-optimal individual regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{AT/m}+A)$, where $A$ is the number of actions, $T$ the time horizon, and $m$ the number of agents. In particular, assuming a sufficient number of agents, we achieve a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(A)$, which is independent of the sub-optimality gaps and the diameter of the communication graph. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to show an individual regret bound in cooperative stochastic MAB that is independent of the graph's diameter and applicable to non-fully-connected communication graphs.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Role of Equivariance in Self-supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has been a leading paradigm for self-supervised learning, but it is widely observed that it comes at the price of sacrificing useful features (\eg colors) by being invariant to data augmentations. Given this limitation, there has been a surge of interest in equivariant self-supervised learning (E-SSL) that learns features to be augmentation-aware. However, even for the simplest rotation prediction method, there is a lack of rigorous understanding of why, when, and how E-SSL learns useful features for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap between practice and theory, we establish an information-theoretic perspective to understand the generalization ability of E-SSL. In particular, we identify a critical explaining-away effect in E-SSL that creates a synergy between the equivariant and classification tasks. This synergy effect encourages models to extract class-relevant features to improve its equivariant prediction, which, in turn, benefits downstream tasks requiring semantic features. Based on this perspective, we theoretically analyze the influence of data transformations and reveal several principles for practical designs of E-SSL. Our theory not only aligns well with existing E-SSL methods but also sheds light on new directions by exploring the benefits of model equivariance. We believe that a theoretically grounded understanding on the role of equivariance would inspire more principled and advanced designs in this field.

      <title>Learning Loss Landscapes in Preference Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an empirical study investigating how specific properties of preference datasets, such as mixed-quality or noisy data, affect the performance of Preference Optimization (PO) algorithms. Our experiments, conducted in MuJoCo environments, reveal several scenarios where state-of-the-art PO methods experience significant drops in performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel PO framework based on mirror descent, which can recover existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) for specific choices of the mirror map. Within this framework, we employ evolutionary strategies to discover new loss functions capable of handling the identified problematic scenarios. These new loss functions lead to significant performance improvements over DPO and ORPO across several tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the generalization capability of our approach by applying the discovered loss functions to fine-tuning large language models using mixed-quality data, where they outperform ORPO.</description>

      <title>An Energy-Based Self-Adaptive Learning Rate for Stochastic Gradient Descent: Enhancing Unconstrained Optimization with VAV method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing the learning rate remains a critical challenge in machine learning, essential for achieving model stability and efficient convergence. The Vector Auxiliary Variable (VAV) algorithm introduces a novel energy-based self-adjustable learning rate optimization method designed for unconstrained optimization problems. It incorporates an auxiliary variable $r$ to facilitate efficient energy approximation without backtracking while adhering to the unconditional energy dissipation law. Notably, VAV demonstrates superior stability with larger learning rates and achieves faster convergence in the early stage of the training process. Comparative analyses demonstrate that VAV outperforms Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) across various tasks. This paper also provides rigorous proof of the energy dissipation law and establishes the convergence of the algorithm under reasonable assumptions. Additionally, $r$ acts as an empirical lower bound of the training loss in practice, offering a novel scheduling approach that further enhances algorithm performance.</description>

      <title>Few measurement shots challenge generalization in learning to classify entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to extract general laws from a few known examples depends on the complexity of the problem and on the amount of training data. In the quantum setting, the learner's generalization performance is further challenged by the destructive nature of quantum measurements that, together with the no-cloning theorem, limits the amount of information that can be extracted from each training sample. In this paper we focus on hybrid quantum learning techniques where classical machine-learning methods are paired with quantum algorithms and show that, in some settings, the uncertainty coming from a few measurement shots can be the dominant source of errors. We identify an instance of this possibly general issue by focusing on the classification of maximally entangled vs. separable states, showing that this toy problem becomes challenging for learners unaware of entanglement theory. Finally, we introduce an estimator based on classical shadows that performs better in the big data, few copy regime. Our results show that the naive application of classical machine-learning methods to the quantum setting is problematic, and that a better theoretical foundation of quantum learning is required.</description>

      <title>Understanding Scaling Laws with Statistical and Approximation Theory for Transformer Neural Networks on Intrinsically Low-dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When training deep neural networks, a model's generalization error is often observed to follow a power scaling law dependent both on the model size and the data size. Perhaps the best known example of such scaling laws are for transformer-based large language models, where networks with billions of parameters are trained on trillions of tokens of text. Yet, despite sustained widespread interest, a rigorous understanding of why transformer scaling laws exist is still missing. To answer this question, we establish novel statistical estimation and mathematical approximation theories for transformers when the input data are concentrated on a low-dimensional manifold. Our theory predicts a power law between the generalization error and both the training data size and the network size for transformers, where the power depends on the intrinsic dimension $d$ of the training data. Notably, the constructed model architecture is shallow, requiring only logarithmic depth in $d$. By leveraging low-dimensional data structures under a manifold hypothesis, we are able to explain transformer scaling laws in a way which respects the data geometry. Moreover, we test our theory with empirical observation by training LLMs on natural language datasets. We find the observed empirical data scaling laws closely agree with our theoretical predictions. Taken together, these results rigorously show the intrinsic dimension of data to be a crucial quantity affecting transformer scaling laws in both theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on Problems with Hyperbolic Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent papers in the graph machine learning literature have introduced a number of approaches for hyperbolic representation learning. The asserted benefits are improved performance on a variety of graph tasks, node classification and link prediction included. Claims have also been made about the geometric suitability of particular hierarchical graph datasets to representation in hyperbolic space. Despite these claims, our work makes a surprising discovery: when simple Euclidean models with comparable numbers of parameters are properly trained in the same environment, in most cases, they perform as well, if not better, than all introduced hyperbolic graph representation learning models, even on graph datasets previously claimed to be the most hyperbolic as measured by Gromov $\delta$-hyperbolicity (i.e., perfect trees). This observation gives rise to a simple question: how can this be? We answer this question by taking a careful look at the field of hyperbolic graph representation learning as it stands today, and find that a number of papers fail to diligently present baselines, make faulty modelling assumptions when constructing algorithms, and use misleading metrics to quantify geometry of graph datasets. We take a closer look at each of these three problems, elucidate the issues, perform an analysis of methods, and introduce a parametric family of benchmark datasets to ascertain the applicability of (hyperbolic) graph neural networks.</description>

      <title>Learning a Single Neuron Robustly to Distributional Shifts and Adversarial Label Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning a single neuron with respect to the $L_2^2$-loss in the presence of adversarial distribution shifts, where the labels can be arbitrary, and the goal is to find a ``best-fit'' function. More precisely, given training samples from a reference distribution $\mathcal{p}_0$, the goal is to approximate the vector $\mathbf{w}^*$ which minimizes the squared loss with respect to the worst-case distribution that is close in $\chi^2$-divergence to $\mathcal{p}_{0}$. We design a computationally efficient algorithm that recovers a vector $ \hat{\mathbf{w}}$ satisfying $\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{p}^*} (\sigma(\hat{\mathbf{w}} \cdot \mathbf{x}) - y)^2 \leq C \, \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{p}^*} (\sigma(\mathbf{w}^* \cdot \mathbf{x}) - y)^2 + \epsilon$, where $C&gt;1$ is a dimension-independent constant and $(\mathbf{w}^*, \mathcal{p}^*)$ is the witness attaining the min-max risk $\min_{\mathbf{w}~:~\|\mathbf{w}\| \leq W} \max_{\mathcal{p}} \mathbb{E}_{(\mathbf{x}, y) \sim \mathcal{p}} (\sigma(\mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x}) - y)^2 - \nu \chi^2(\mathcal{p}, \mathcal{p}_0)$. Our algorithm follows a primal-dual framework and is designed by directly bounding the risk with respect to the original, nonconvex $L_2^2$ loss. From an optimization standpoint, our work opens new avenues for the design of primal-dual algorithms under structured nonconvexity.</description>

      <title>Methane projections from Canada's oil sands tailings using scientific deep learning reveal significant underestimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bitumen extraction for the production of synthetic crude oil in Canada's Athabasca Oil Sands industry has recently come under spotlight for being a significant source of greenhouse gas emission. A major cause of concern is methane, a greenhouse gas produced by the anaerobic biodegradation of hydrocarbons in oil sands residues, or tailings, stored in settle basins commonly known as oil sands tailing ponds. In order to determine the methane emitting potential of these tailing ponds and have future methane projections, we use real-time weather data, mechanistic models developed from laboratory controlled experiments, and industrial reports to train a physics constrained machine learning model. Our trained model can successfully identify the directions of active ponds and estimate their emission levels, which are generally hard to obtain due to data sampling restrictions. We found that each active oil sands tailing pond could emit between 950 to 1500 tonnes of methane per year, whose environmental impact is equivalent to carbon dioxide emissions from at least 6000 gasoline powered vehicles. Although abandoned ponds are often presumed to have insignificant emissions, our findings indicate that these ponds could become active over time and potentially emit up to 1000 tonnes of methane each year. Taking an average over all datasets that was used in model training, we estimate that emissions around major oil sands regions would need to be reduced by approximately 12% over a year, to reduce the average methane concentrations to 2005 levels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the approximation of functions by 2-layer neural networks with a small number of hidden weights based on the squared loss and small datasets. Due to the highly non-convex energy landscape, gradient-based training often suffers from local minima. As a remedy, we initialize the hidden weights with samples from a learned proposal distribution, which we parameterize as a deep generative model. To train this model, we exploit the fact that with fixed hidden weights, the optimal output weights solve a linear equation. After learning the generative model, we refine the sampled weights with a gradient-based post-processing in the latent space. Here, we also include a regularization scheme to counteract potential noise. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Scientific machine learning in ecological systems: A study on the predator-prey dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we apply two pillars of Scientific Machine Learning: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) and Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to the Lotka Volterra Predator Prey Model, a fundamental ecological model describing the dynamic interactions between predator and prey populations. The Lotka-Volterra model is critical for understanding ecological dynamics, population control, and species interactions, as it is represented by a system of differential equations. In this work, we aim to uncover the underlying differential equations without prior knowledge of the system, relying solely on training data and neural networks. Using robust modeling in the Julia programming language, we demonstrate that both Neural ODEs and UDEs can be effectively utilized for prediction and forecasting of the Lotka-Volterra system. More importantly, we introduce the forecasting breakdown point: the time at which forecasting fails for both Neural ODEs and UDEs. We observe how UDEs outperform Neural ODEs by effectively recovering the underlying dynamics and achieving accurate forecasting with significantly less training data. Additionally, we introduce Gaussian noise of varying magnitudes (from mild to high) to simulate real-world data perturbations and show that UDEs exhibit superior robustness, effectively recovering the underlying dynamics even in the presence of noisy data, while Neural ODEs struggle with high levels of noise. Through extensive hyperparameter optimization, we offer insights into neural network architectures, activation functions, and optimizers that yield the best results. This study opens the door to applying Scientific Machine Learning frameworks for forecasting tasks across a wide range of ecological and scientific domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) employs a training approach to address scenarios where users' data cannot be shared across clients. Achieving fairness in FL is imperative since training data in FL is inherently geographically distributed among diverse user groups. Existing research on fairness predominantly assumes access to the entire training data, making direct transfer to FL challenging. However, the limited existing research on fairness in FL does not effectively address two key challenges, i.e., (CH1) Current methods fail to deal with the inconsistency between fair optimization results obtained with surrogate functions and fair classification results. (CH2) Directly aggregating local fair models does not always yield a globally fair model due to non Identical and Independent data Distributions (non-IID) among clients. To address these challenges, we propose a Wasserstein Fair Federated Learning framework, namely WassFFed. To tackle CH1, we ensure that the outputs of local models, rather than the loss calculated with surrogate functions or classification results with a threshold, remain independent of various user groups. To resolve CH2, we employ a Wasserstein barycenter calculation of all local models' outputs for each user group, bringing local model outputs closer to the global output distribution to ensure consistency between the global model and local models. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, demonstrating that WassFFed outperforms existing approaches in striking a balance between accuracy and fairness.</description>

      <title>SPARTAN: A Sparse Transformer Learning Local Causation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06890v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal structures play a central role in world models that flexibly adapt to changes in the environment. While recent works motivate the benefits of discovering local causal graphs for dynamics modelling, in this work we demonstrate that accurately capturing these relationships in complex settings remains challenging for the current state-of-the-art. To remedy this shortcoming, we postulate that sparsity is a critical ingredient for the discovery of such local causal structures. To this end we present the SPARse TrANsformer World model (SPARTAN), a Transformer-based world model that learns local causal structures between entities in a scene. By applying sparsity regularisation on the attention pattern between object-factored tokens, SPARTAN identifies sparse local causal models that accurately predict future object states. Furthermore, we extend our model to capture sparse interventions with unknown targets on the dynamics of the environment. This results in a highly interpretable world model that can efficiently adapt to changes. Empirically, we evaluate SPARTAN against the current state-of-the-art in object-centric world models on observation-based environments and demonstrate that our model can learn accurate local causal graphs and achieve significantly improved few-shot adaptation to changes in the dynamics of the environment as well as robustness against removing irrelevant distractors.</description>

      <title>General framework for online-to-nonconvex conversion: Schedule-free SGD is also effective for nonconvex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the effectiveness of schedule-free methods, developed by A. Defazio et al. (NeurIPS 2024), in nonconvex optimization settings, inspired by their remarkable empirical success in training neural networks. Specifically, we show that schedule-free SGD achieves optimal iteration complexity for nonsmooth, nonconvex optimization problems. Our proof begins with the development of a general framework for online-to-nonconvex conversion, which converts a given online learning algorithm into an optimization algorithm for nonconvex losses. Our general framework not only recovers existing conversions but also leads to two novel conversion schemes. Notably, one of these new conversions corresponds directly to schedule-free SGD, allowing us to establish its optimality. Additionally, our analysis provides valuable insights into the parameter choices for schedule-free SGD, addressing a theoretical gap that the convex theory cannot explain.</description>

      <title>Towards Backwards-Compatible Data with Confounded Domain Adaptation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most current domain adaptation methods address either covariate shift or label shift, but are not applicable where they occur simultaneously and are confounded with each other. Domain adaptation approaches which do account for such confounding are designed to adapt covariates to optimally predict a particular label whose shift is confounded with covariate shift. In this paper, we instead seek to achieve general-purpose data backwards compatibility. This would allow the adapted covariates to be used for a variety of downstream problems, including on pre-existing prediction models and on data analytics tasks. To do this we consider a modification of generalized label shift (GLS), which we call confounded shift. We present a novel framework for this problem, based on minimizing the expected divergence between the source and target conditional distributions, conditioning on possible confounders. Within this framework, we provide concrete implementations using the Gaussian reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and the maximum mean discrepancy. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Ultra-marginal Feature Importance: Learning from Data with Causal Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.09938v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientists frequently prioritize learning from data rather than training the best possible model; however, research in machine learning often prioritizes the latter. Marginal contribution feature importance (MCI) was developed to break this trend by providing a useful framework for quantifying the relationships in data. In this work, we aim to improve upon the theoretical properties, performance, and runtime of MCI by introducing ultra-marginal feature importance (UMFI), which uses dependence removal techniques from the AI fairness literature as its foundation. We first propose axioms for feature importance methods that seek to explain the causal and associative relationships in data, and we prove that UMFI satisfies these axioms under basic assumptions. We then show on real and simulated data that UMFI performs better than MCI, especially in the presence of correlated interactions and unrelated features, while partially learning the structure of the causal graph and reducing the exponential runtime of MCI to super-linear.</description>

      <title>On Neural Networks as Infinite Tree-Structured Probabilistic Graphical Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17583v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) lack the precise semantics and definitive probabilistic interpretation of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). In this paper, we propose an innovative solution by constructing infinite tree-structured PGMs that correspond exactly to neural networks. Our research reveals that DNNs, during forward propagation, indeed perform approximations of PGM inference that are precise in this alternative PGM structure. Not only does our research complement existing studies that describe neural networks as kernel machines or infinite-sized Gaussian processes, it also elucidates a more direct approximation that DNNs make to exact inference in PGMs. Potential benefits include improved pedagogy and interpretation of DNNs, and algorithms that can merge the strengths of PGMs and DNNs.</description>

      <title>Deep graph kernel point processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11313v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Point process models are widely used for continuous asynchronous event data, where each data point includes time and additional information called "marks", which can be locations, nodes, or event types. This paper presents a novel point process model for discrete event data over graphs, where the event interaction occurs within a latent graph structure. Our model builds upon Hawkes's classic influence kernel-based formulation in the original self-exciting point processes work to capture the influence of historical events on future events' occurrence. The key idea is to represent the influence kernel by Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to capture the underlying graph structure while harvesting the strong representation power of GNNs. Compared with prior works focusing on directly modeling the conditional intensity function using neural networks, our kernel presentation herds the repeated event influence patterns more effectively by combining statistical and deep models, achieving better model estimation/learning efficiency and superior predictive performance. Our work significantly extends the existing deep spatio-temporal kernel for point process data, which is inapplicable to our setting due to the fundamental difference in the nature of the observation space being Euclidean rather than a graph. We present comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data to show the superior performance of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art in predicting future events and uncovering the relational structure among data.</description>

      <title>A Parameter-Free Two-Bit Covariance Estimator with Improved Operator Norm Error Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A covariance matrix estimator using two bits per entry was recently developed by Dirksen, Maly and Rauhut [Annals of Statistics, 50(6), pp. 3538-3562]. The estimator achieves near minimax rate for general sub-Gaussian distributions, but also suffers from two downsides: theoretically, there is an essential gap on operator norm error between their estimator and sample covariance when the diagonal of the covariance matrix is dominated by only a few entries; practically, its performance heavily relies on the dithering scale, which needs to be tuned according to some unknown parameters. In this work, we propose a new 2-bit covariance matrix estimator that simultaneously addresses both issues. Unlike the sign quantizer associated with uniform dither in Dirksen et al., we adopt a triangular dither prior to a 2-bit quantizer inspired by the multi-bit uniform quantizer. By employing dithering scales varying across entries, our estimator enjoys an improved operator norm error rate that depends on the effective rank of the underlying covariance matrix rather than the ambient dimension, thus closing the theoretical gap. Moreover, our proposed method eliminates the need of any tuning parameter, as the dithering scales are entirely determined by the data. Experimental results under Gaussian samples are provided to showcase the impressive numerical performance of our estimator. Remarkably, by halving the dithering scales, our estimator oftentimes achieves operator norm errors less than twice of the errors of sample covariance.</description>

      <title>Learning Energy-Based Models by Cooperative Diffusion Recovery Likelihood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05153v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training energy-based models (EBMs) on high-dimensional data can be both challenging and time-consuming, and there exists a noticeable gap in sample quality between EBMs and other generative frameworks like GANs and diffusion models. To close this gap, inspired by the recent efforts of learning EBMs by maximizing diffusion recovery likelihood (DRL), we propose cooperative diffusion recovery likelihood (CDRL), an effective approach to tractably learn and sample from a series of EBMs defined on increasingly noisy versions of a dataset, paired with an initializer model for each EBM. At each noise level, the two models are jointly estimated within a cooperative training framework: samples from the initializer serve as starting points that are refined by a few MCMC sampling steps from the EBM. The EBM is then optimized by maximizing recovery likelihood, while the initializer model is optimized by learning from the difference between the refined samples and the initial samples. In addition, we made several practical designs for EBM training to further improve the sample quality. Combining these advances, our approach significantly boost the generation performance compared to existing EBM methods on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our models for several downstream tasks, including classifier-free guided generation, compositional generation, image inpainting and out-of-distribution detection.</description>

      <title>Solving Kernel Ridge Regression with Gradient Descent for a Non-Constant Kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel ridge regression, KRR, is a generalization of linear ridge regression that is non-linear in the data, but linear in the parameters. The solution can be obtained either as a closed-form solution, which includes solving a system of linear equations, or iteratively through gradient descent. Using the iterative approach opens up for changing the kernel during training, something that is investigated in this paper. We theoretically address the effects this has on model complexity and generalization. Based on our findings, we propose an update scheme for the bandwidth of translational-invariant kernels, where we let the bandwidth decrease to zero during training, thus circumventing the need for hyper-parameter selection. We demonstrate on real and synthetic data how decreasing the bandwidth during training outperforms using a constant bandwidth, selected by cross-validation and marginal likelihood maximization. We also show theoretically and empirically that using a decreasing bandwidth, we are able to achieve both zero training error in combination with good generalization, and a double descent behavior, phenomena that do not occur for KRR with constant bandwidth but are known to appear for neural networks.</description>

Abstract: Generative diffusion models and many stochastic models in science and engineering naturally live in infinite dimensions before discretisation. To incorporate observed data for statistical and learning tasks, one needs to condition on observations. While recent work has treated conditioning linear processes in infinite dimensions, conditioning non-linear processes in infinite dimensions has not been explored. This paper conditions function valued stochastic processes without prior discretisation. To do so, we use an infinite-dimensional version of Girsanov's theorem to condition a function-valued stochastic process, leading to a stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the conditioned process involving the score. We apply this technique to do time series analysis for shapes of organisms in evolutionary biology, where we discretise via the Fourier basis and then learn the coefficients of the score function with score matching methods.</description>

      <title>Statistical Agnostic Regression: a machine learning method to validate regression models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regression analysis is a central topic in statistical modeling, aimed at estimating the relationships between a dependent variable, commonly referred to as the response variable, and one or more independent variables, i.e., explanatory variables. Linear regression is by far the most popular method for performing this task in various fields of research, such as data integration and predictive modeling when combining information from multiple sources. Classical methods for solving linear regression problems, such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Ridge, or Lasso regressions, often form the foundation for more advanced machine learning (ML) techniques, which have been successfully applied, though without a formal definition of statistical significance. At most, permutation or analyses based on empirical measures (e.g., residuals or accuracy) have been conducted, leveraging the greater sensitivity of ML estimations for detection. In this paper, we introduce Statistical Agnostic Regression (SAR) for evaluating the statistical significance of ML-based linear regression models. This is achieved by analyzing concentration inequalities of the actual risk (expected loss) and considering the worst-case scenario. To this end, we define a threshold that ensures there is sufficient evidence, with a probability of at least $1-\eta$, to conclude the existence of a linear relationship in the population between the explanatory (feature) and the response (label) variables. Simulations demonstrate the ability of the proposed agnostic (non-parametric) test to provide an analysis of variance similar to the classical multivariate $F$-test for the slope parameter, without relying on the underlying assumptions of classical methods. Moreover, the residuals computed from this method represent a trade-off between those obtained from ML approaches and the classical OLS.</description>

      <title>Achievable Fairness on Your Data With Utility Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17106v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In machine learning fairness, training models that minimize disparity across different sensitive groups often leads to diminished accuracy, a phenomenon known as the fairness-accuracy trade-off. The severity of this trade-off inherently depends on dataset characteristics such as dataset imbalances or biases and therefore, using a uniform fairness requirement across diverse datasets remains questionable. To address this, we present a computationally efficient approach to approximate the fairness-accuracy trade-off curve tailored to individual datasets, backed by rigorous statistical guarantees. By utilizing the You-Only-Train-Once (YOTO) framework, our approach mitigates the computational burden of having to train multiple models when approximating the trade-off curve. Crucially, we introduce a novel methodology for quantifying uncertainty in our estimates, thereby providing practitioners with a robust framework for auditing model fairness while avoiding false conclusions due to estimation errors. Our experiments spanning tabular (e.g., Adult), image (CelebA), and language (Jigsaw) datasets underscore that our approach not only reliably quantifies the optimum achievable trade-offs across various data modalities but also helps detect suboptimality in SOTA fairness methods.</description>

      <title>Divide-and-Conquer Posterior Sampling for Denoising Diffusion Priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in solving Bayesian inverse problems have spotlighted denoising diffusion models (DDMs) as effective priors. Although these have great potential, DDM priors yield complex posterior distributions that are challenging to sample. Existing approaches to posterior sampling in this context address this problem either by retraining model-specific components, leading to stiff and cumbersome methods, or by introducing approximations with uncontrolled errors that affect the accuracy of the produced samples. We present an innovative framework, divide-and-conquer posterior sampling, which leverages the inherent structure of DDMs to construct a sequence of intermediate posteriors that guide the produced samples to the target posterior. Our method significantly reduces the approximation error associated with current techniques without the need for retraining. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of our approach for a wide range of Bayesian inverse problems. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Badr-MOUFAD/dcps}</description>

      <title>Tighter Confidence Bounds for Sequential Kernel Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Confidence bounds are an essential tool for rigorously quantifying the uncertainty of predictions. They are a core component in many sequential learning and decision-making algorithms, with tighter confidence bounds giving rise to algorithms with better empirical performance and better performance guarantees. In this work, we use martingale tail inequalities to establish new confidence bounds for sequential kernel regression. Our confidence bounds can be computed by solving a conic program, although this bare version quickly becomes impractical, because the number of variables grows with the sample size. However, we show that the dual of this conic program allows us to efficiently compute tight confidence bounds. We prove that our new confidence bounds are always tighter than existing ones in this setting. We apply our confidence bounds to kernel bandit problems, and we find that when our confidence bounds replace existing ones, the KernelUCB (GP-UCB) algorithm has better empirical performance, a matching worst-case performance guarantee and comparable computational cost.</description>

      <title>Approximately Equivariant Neural Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equivariant deep learning architectures exploit symmetries in learning problems to improve the sample efficiency of neural-network-based models and their ability to generalise. However, when modelling real-world data, learning problems are often not exactly equivariant, but only approximately. For example, when estimating the global temperature field from weather station observations, local topographical features like mountains break translation equivariance. In these scenarios, it is desirable to construct architectures that can flexibly depart from exact equivariance in a data-driven way. Current approaches to achieving this cannot usually be applied out-of-the-box to any architecture and symmetry group. In this paper, we develop a general approach to achieving this using existing equivariant architectures. Our approach is agnostic to both the choice of symmetry group and model architecture, making it widely applicable. We consider the use of approximately equivariant architectures in neural processes (NPs), a popular family of meta-learning models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a number of synthetic and real-world regression experiments, showing that approximately equivariant NP models can outperform both their non-equivariant and strictly equivariant counterparts.</description>

      <title>Two-stage Learning-to-Defer for Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Learning-to-Defer approach has been explored for classification and, more recently, regression tasks separately. Many contemporary learning tasks, however, involves both classification and regression components. In this paper, we introduce a Learning-to-Defer approach for multi-task learning that encompasses both classification and regression tasks. Our two-stage approach utilizes a rejector that defers decisions to the most accurate agent among a pre-trained joint classifier-regressor models and one or more external experts. We show that our surrogate loss is $(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{F}, \mathcal{R})$ and Bayes--consistent, ensuring an effective approximation of the optimal solution. Additionally, we derive learning bounds that demonstrate the benefits of employing multiple confident experts along a rich model in a two-stage learning framework. Empirical experiments conducted on electronic health record analysis tasks underscore the performance enhancements achieved through our method.</description>

      <title>Pi theorem formulation of flood mapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid delineation of flash flood extents is critical to mobilize emergency resources and to manage evacuations, thereby saving lives and property. Machine learning (ML) approaches enable rapid flood delineation with reduced computational demand compared to conventional high-resolution, 2D flood models. However, existing ML approaches are limited by a lack of generalization to never-before-seen conditions. Here, we propose a framework to improve ML model generalization based on dimensionless, multi-scale features that capture the similarity of the flooding process across regions. The dimensionless features are constrained with the Buckingham $\Pi$ theorem and used with a logistic regression model for a probabilistic determination of flood risk. The features were calculated at different scales by varying accumulation thresholds for stream delineation. The modeled flood maps compared well with the results of 2D hydraulic models that are the basis of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood hazard maps. Dimensionless features outperformed dimensional features, with some of the largest gains (in the AUC) occurring when the model was trained in one region and tested in another. Dimensionless and multi-scale features in ML flood modeling have the potential to improve generalization, enabling mapping in unmapped areas and across a broader spectrum of landscapes, climates, and events.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Synthetically Generated Data from Small Sample Sizes: An Experimental Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10760v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a method to evaluate the similarity between low-sample tabular data and synthetically generated data with a larger number of samples than the original. The technique is known to as data augmentation. However, significance values derived from non-parametric tests are questionable when the sample size is limited. Our approach uses a combination of geometry, topology, and robust statistics for hypothesis testing to evaluate the "validity" of generated data. We additionally contrast the findings with prominent global metric practices described in the literature for large sample size data.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Randomized Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16221v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world data is complex and often consists of objects that can be decomposed into multiple entities (e.g. images into pixels, graphs into interconnected nodes). Randomized smoothing is a powerful framework for making models provably robust against small changes to their inputs - by guaranteeing robustness of the majority vote when randomly adding noise before classification. Yet, certifying robustness on such complex data via randomized smoothing is challenging when adversaries do not arbitrarily perturb entire objects (e.g. images) but only a subset of their entities (e.g. pixels). As a solution, we introduce hierarchical randomized smoothing: We partially smooth objects by adding random noise only on a randomly selected subset of their entities. By adding noise in a more targeted manner than existing methods we obtain stronger robustness guarantees while maintaining high accuracy. We initialize hierarchical smoothing using different noising distributions, yielding novel robustness certificates for discrete and continuous domains. We experimentally demonstrate the importance of hierarchical smoothing in image and node classification, where it yields superior robustness-accuracy trade-offs. Overall, hierarchical smoothing is an important contribution towards models that are both - certifiably robust to perturbations and accurate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of statistical inference in its various forms has been the subject of decades-long extensive research. Most of the effort has been focused on characterizing the behavior as a function of the number of available samples, with far less attention given to the effect of memory limitations on performance. Recently, this latter topic has drawn much interest in the engineering and computer science literature. In this survey paper, we attempt to review the state-of-the-art of statistical inference under memory constraints in several canonical problems, including hypothesis testing, parameter estimation, and distribution property testing/estimation. We discuss the main results in this developing field, and by identifying recurrent themes, we extract some fundamental building blocks for algorithmic construction, as well as useful techniques for lower bound derivations.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for Partially Observed Reward-States in RLHF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03282v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing deployment of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) calls for a deeper theoretical investigation of its underlying models. The prevalent models of RLHF do not account for neuroscience-backed, partially-observed "internal states" that can affect human feedback, nor do they accommodate intermediate feedback during an interaction. Both of these can be instrumental in speeding up learning and improving alignment. To address these limitations, we model RLHF as reinforcement learning with partially observed reward-states (PORRL). We accommodate two kinds of feedback $-$ cardinal and dueling feedback. We first demonstrate that PORRL subsumes a wide class of RL problems, including traditional RL, RLHF, and reward machines. For cardinal feedback, we present two model-based methods (POR-UCRL, POR-UCBVI). We give both cardinal regret and sample complexity guarantees for the methods, showing that they improve over naive history-summarization. We then discuss the benefits of a model-free method like GOLF with naive history-summarization in settings with recursive internal states and dense intermediate feedback. For this purpose, we define a new history aware version of the Bellman-eluder dimension and give a new guarantee for GOLF in our setting, which can be exponentially sharper in illustrative examples. For dueling feedback, we show that a naive reduction to cardinal feedback fails to achieve sublinear dueling regret. We then present the first explicit reduction that converts guarantees for cardinal regret to dueling regret. In both feedback settings, we show that our models and guarantees generalize and extend existing ones.</description>

      <title>On Provable Length and Compositional Generalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04875v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization capabilities of sequence-to-sequence models can be studied from the lens of two crucial forms of generalization: length generalization -- the ability to generalize to longer sequences than ones seen during training, and compositional generalization: the ability to generalize to token combinations not seen during training. In this work, we provide first provable guarantees on length and compositional generalization for common sequence-to-sequence models -- deep sets, transformers, state space models, and recurrent neural nets -- trained to minimize the prediction error. Taking a first principles perspective, we study the realizable case, i.e., the labeling function is realizable on the architecture. We show that \emph{simple limited capacity} versions of these different architectures achieve both length and compositional generalization. In all our results across different architectures, we find that the learned representations are linearly related to the representations generated by the true labeling function.</description>

      <title>Oja's Algorithm for Streaming Sparse PCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07240v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oja's algorithm for Streaming Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for $n$ data-points in a $d$ dimensional space achieves the same sin-squared error $O(r_{\mathsf{eff}}/n)$ as the offline algorithm in $O(d)$ space and $O(nd)$ time and a single pass through the datapoints. Here $r_{\mathsf{eff}}$ is the effective rank (ratio of the trace and the principal eigenvalue of the population covariance matrix $\Sigma$). Under this computational budget, we consider the problem of sparse PCA, where the principal eigenvector of $\Sigma$ is $s$-sparse, and $r_{\mathsf{eff}}$ can be large. In this setting, to our knowledge, \textit{there are no known single-pass algorithms} that achieve the minimax error bound in $O(d)$ space and $O(nd)$ time without either requiring strong initialization conditions or assuming further structure (e.g., spiked) of the covariance matrix. We show that a simple single-pass procedure that thresholds the output of Oja's algorithm (the Oja vector) can achieve the minimax error bound under some regularity conditions in $O(d)$ space and $O(nd)$ time. We present a nontrivial and novel analysis of the entries of the unnormalized Oja vector, which involves the projection of a product of independent random matrices on a random initial vector. This is completely different from previous analyses of Oja's algorithm and matrix products, which have been done when the $r_{\mathsf{eff}}$ is bounded.</description>

      <title>Do Efficient Transformers Really Save Computation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As transformer-based language models are trained on increasingly large datasets and with vast numbers of parameters, finding more efficient alternatives to the standard Transformer has become very valuable. While many efficient Transformers and Transformer alternatives have been proposed, none provide theoretical guarantees that they are a suitable replacement for the standard Transformer. This makes it challenging to identify when to use a specific model and what directions to prioritize for further investigation. In this paper, we aim to understand the capabilities and limitations of efficient Transformers, specifically the Sparse Transformer and the Linear Transformer. We focus on their reasoning capability as exhibited by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts and follow previous works to model them as Dynamic Programming (DP) problems. Our results show that while these models are expressive enough to solve general DP tasks, contrary to expectations, they require a model size that scales with the problem size. Nonetheless, we identify a class of DP problems for which these models can be more efficient than the standard Transformer. We confirm our theoretical results through experiments on representative DP tasks, adding to the understanding of efficient Transformers' practical strengths and weaknesses.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient and Optimal Covariance-Adaptive Algorithms for Combinatorial Semi-Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits, where a player selects among $P$ actions from the power set of a set containing $d$ base items. Adaptivity to the problem's structure is essential in order to obtain optimal regret upper bounds. As estimating the coefficients of a covariance matrix can be manageable in practice, leveraging them should improve the regret. We design ``optimistic'' covariance-adaptive algorithms relying on online estimations of the covariance structure, called OLSUCBC and COSV (only the variances for the latter). They both yields improved gap-free regret. Although COSV can be slightly suboptimal, it improves on computational complexity by taking inspiration from Thompson Sampling approaches. It is the first sampling-based algorithm satisfying a $\sqrt{T}$ gap-free regret (up to poly-logs). We also show that in some cases, our approach efficiently leverages the semi-bandit feedback and outperforms bandit feedback approaches, not only in exponential regimes where $P\gg d$ but also when $P\leq d$, which is not covered by existing analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12338v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the oracle complexity of the stochastic Halpern iteration with variance reduction, where we aim to approximate fixed-points of nonexpansive and contractive operators in a normed finite-dimensional space. We show that if the underlying stochastic oracle is with uniformly bounded variance, our method exhibits an overall oracle complexity of $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-5})$, improving recent rates established for the stochastic Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. Also, we establish a lower bound of $\Omega(\varepsilon^{-3})$, which applies to a wide range of algorithms, including all averaged iterations even with minibatching. Using a suitable modification of our approach, we derive a $O(\varepsilon^{-2}(1-\gamma)^{-3})$ complexity bound in the case in which the operator is a $\gamma$-contraction. As an application, we propose new synchronous algorithms for average reward and discounted reward Markov decision processes. In particular, for the average reward, our method improves on the best-known sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Uniform Memory Retrieval with Larger Capacity for Modern Hopfield Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a two-stage memory retrieval dynamics for modern Hopfield models, termed $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$, with enhanced memory capacity. Our key contribution is a learnable feature map $\Phi$ which transforms the Hopfield energy function into kernel space. This transformation ensures convergence between the local minima of energy and the fixed points of retrieval dynamics within the kernel space. Consequently, the kernel norm induced by $\Phi$ serves as a novel similarity measure. It utilizes the stored memory patterns as learning data to enhance memory capacity across all modern Hopfield models. Specifically, we accomplish this by constructing a separation loss $\mathcal{L}_\Phi$ that separates the local minima of kernelized energy by separating stored memory patterns in kernel space. Methodologically, $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$ memory retrieval process consists of: (Stage I) minimizing separation loss for a more uniform memory (local minimum) distribution, followed by (Stage II) standard Hopfield energy minimization for memory retrieval. This results in a significant reduction of possible metastable states in the Hopfield energy function, thus enhancing memory capacity by preventing memory confusion. Empirically, with real-world datasets, we demonstrate that $\mathtt{U\text{-}Hop}$ outperforms all existing modern Hopfield models and state-of-the-art similarity measures, achieving substantial improvements in both associative memory retrieval and deep learning tasks.

      <description>arXiv:2405.19785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital twins require computationally-efficient reduced-order models (ROMs) that can accurately describe complex dynamics of physical assets. However, constructing ROMs from noisy high-dimensional data is challenging. In this work, we propose a data-driven, non-intrusive method that utilizes stochastic variational deep kernel learning (SVDKL) to discover low-dimensional latent spaces from data and a recurrent version of SVDKL for representing and predicting the evolution of latent dynamics. The proposed method is demonstrated with two challenging examples -- a double pendulum and a reaction-diffusion system. Results show that our framework is capable of (i) denoising and reconstructing measurements, (ii) learning compact representations of system states, (iii) predicting system evolution in low-dimensional latent spaces, and (iv) quantifying modeling uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Universal Exact Compression of Differentially Private Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To reduce the communication cost of differential privacy mechanisms, we introduce a novel construction, called Poisson private representation (PPR), designed to compress and simulate any local randomizer while ensuring local differential privacy. Unlike previous simulation-based local differential privacy mechanisms, PPR exactly preserves the joint distribution of the data and the output of the original local randomizer. Hence, the PPR-compressed privacy mechanism retains all desirable statistical properties of the original privacy mechanism such as unbiasedness and Gaussianity. Moreover, PPR achieves a compression size within a logarithmic gap from the theoretical lower bound. Using the PPR, we give a new order-wise trade-off between communication, accuracy, central and local differential privacy for distributed mean estimation. Experiment results on distributed mean estimation show that PPR consistently gives a better trade-off between communication, accuracy and central differential privacy compared to the coordinate subsampled Gaussian mechanism, while also providing local differential privacy.</description>

      <title>From Unstructured Data to In-Context Learning: Exploring What Tasks Can Be Learned and When</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like transformers demonstrate impressive in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, allowing them to make predictions for new tasks based on prompt exemplars without parameter updates. While existing ICL theories often assume structured training data resembling ICL tasks (e.g., x-y pairs for linear regression), LLMs are typically trained unsupervised on unstructured text, such as web content, which lacks clear parallels to tasks like word analogy. To address this gap, we examine what enables ICL in models trained on unstructured data, focusing on critical sequence model requirements and training data structure. We find that many ICL capabilities can emerge simply from co-occurrence of semantically related word pairs in unstructured data; word analogy completion, for example, can provably arise purely through co-occurrence modeling, using classical language models like continuous bag of words (CBOW), without needing positional information or attention mechanisms. However, positional information becomes crucial for logic reasoning tasks requiring generalization to unseen tokens. Finally, we identify two cases where ICL fails: one in logic reasoning tasks that require generalizing to new, unseen patterns, and another in analogy completion where relevant word pairs appear only in fixed training positions. These findings suggest that LLMs' ICL abilities depend heavily on the structural elements within their training data.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Newton Proximal Extragradient Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic second-order methods achieve fast local convergence in strongly convex optimization by using noisy Hessian estimates to precondition the gradient. However, these methods typically reach superlinear convergence only when the stochastic Hessian noise diminishes, increasing per-iteration costs over time. Recent work in [arXiv:2204.09266] addressed this with a Hessian averaging scheme that achieves superlinear convergence without higher per-iteration costs. Nonetheless, the method has slow global convergence, requiring up to $\tilde{O}(\kappa^2)$ iterations to reach the superlinear rate of $\tilde{O}((1/t)^{t/2})$, where $\kappa$ is the problem's condition number. In this paper, we propose a novel stochastic Newton proximal extragradient method that improves these bounds, achieving a faster global linear rate and reaching the same fast superlinear rate in $\tilde{O}(\kappa)$ iterations. We accomplish this by extending the Hybrid Proximal Extragradient (HPE) framework, achieving fast global and local convergence rates for strongly convex functions with access to a noisy Hessian oracle.</description>

      <title>Adaptive and Optimal Second-order Optimistic Methods for Minimax Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose adaptive, line search-free second-order methods with optimal rate of convergence for solving convex-concave min-max problems. By means of an adaptive step size, our algorithms feature a simple update rule that requires solving only one linear system per iteration, eliminating the need for line search or backtracking mechanisms. Specifically, we base our algorithms on the optimistic method and appropriately combine it with second-order information. Moreover, distinct from common adaptive schemes, we define the step size recursively as a function of the gradient norm and the prediction error in the optimistic update. We first analyze a variant where the step size requires knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian. Under the additional assumption of Lipschitz continuous gradients, we further design a parameter-free version by tracking the Hessian Lipschitz constant locally and ensuring the iterates remain bounded. We also evaluate the practical performance of our algorithm by comparing it to existing second-order algorithms for minimax optimization.</description>

      <title>Boosted Conformal Prediction Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a boosted conformal procedure designed to tailor conformalized prediction intervals toward specific desired properties, such as enhanced conditional coverage or reduced interval length. We employ machine learning techniques, notably gradient boosting, to systematically improve upon a predefined conformity score function. This process is guided by carefully constructed loss functions that measure the deviation of prediction intervals from the targeted properties. The procedure operates post-training, relying solely on model predictions and without modifying the trained model (e.g., the deep network). Systematic experiments demonstrate that starting from conventional conformal methods, our boosted procedure achieves substantial improvements in reducing interval length and decreasing deviation from target conditional coverage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent diffusion causes particles placed in proximity to separate. We investigate the required swimming efforts to maintain an active particle close to its passively advected counterpart. We explore optimally balancing these efforts by developing a novel physics-informed reinforcement learning strategy and comparing it with prescribed control and physics-agnostic reinforcement learning strategies. Our scheme, coined the actor-physicist, is an adaptation of the actor-critic algorithm in which the neural network parameterized critic is replaced with an analytically derived physical heuristic function, the physicist. We validate the proposed physics-informed reinforcement learning approach through extensive numerical experiments in both synthetic BK and more realistic Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow environments, demonstrating its superiority in controlling particle dynamics when compared to standard reinforcement learning methods.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Optimization for Randomized Algorithms: A Case Study on Random Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized algorithms exploit stochasticity to reduce computational complexity. One important example is random feature regression (RFR) that accelerates Gaussian process regression (GPR). RFR approximates an unknown function with a random neural network whose hidden weights and biases are sampled from a probability distribution. Only the final output layer is fit to data. In randomized algorithms like RFR, the hyperparameters that characterize the sampling distribution greatly impact performance, yet are not directly accessible from samples. This makes optimization of hyperparameters via standard (gradient-based) optimization tools inapplicable. Inspired by Bayesian ideas from GPR, this paper introduces a random objective function that is tailored for hyperparameter tuning of vector-valued random features. The objective is minimized with ensemble Kalman inversion (EKI). EKI is a gradient-free particle-based optimizer that is scalable to high-dimensions and robust to randomness in objective functions. A numerical study showcases the new black-box methodology to learn hyperparameter distributions in several problems that are sensitive to the hyperparameter selection: two global sensitivity analyses, integrating a chaotic dynamical system, and solving a Bayesian inverse problem from atmospheric dynamics. The success of the proposed EKI-based algorithm for RFR suggests its potential for automated optimization of hyperparameters arising in other randomized algorithms.</description>

      <title>Only Strict Saddles in the Energy Landscape of Predictive Coding Networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) is an energy-based learning algorithm that performs iterative inference over network activities before updating weights. Recent work suggests that PC can converge in fewer learning steps than backpropagation thanks to its inference procedure. However, these advantages are not always observed, and the impact of PC inference on learning is not theoretically well understood. Here, we study the geometry of the PC energy landscape at the inference equilibrium of the network activities. For deep linear networks, we first show that the equilibrated energy is simply a rescaled mean squared error loss with a weight-dependent rescaling. We then prove that many highly degenerate (non-strict) saddles of the loss including the origin become much easier to escape (strict) in the equilibrated energy. Our theory is validated by experiments on both linear and non-linear networks. Based on these and other results, we conjecture that all the saddles of the equilibrated energy are strict. Overall, this work suggests that PC inference makes the loss landscape more benign and robust to vanishing gradients, while also highlighting the fundamental challenge of scaling PC to deeper models.</description>

      <title>Data-driven ODE modeling of the high-frequency complex dynamics via a low-frequency dynamics model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper [N. Tsutsumi, K. Nakai and Y. Saiki, Chaos 32, 091101 (2022)], we proposed a method for constructing a system of differential equations of chaotic behavior from only observable deterministic time series, which we call the radial function-based regression (RfR) method. However, when the targeted variable's behavior is rather complex, the direct application of the RfR method does not function well. In this study, we propose a novel method of modeling such dynamics, including the high-frequency intermittent behavior of a fluid flow, by considering another variable (base variable) showing relatively simple, less intermittent behavior. We construct an autonomous joint model composed of two parts: the first is an autonomous system of a base variable, and the other concerns the targeted variable being affected by a term involving the base variable to demonstrate complex dynamics. The constructed joint model succeeded in not only inferring a short trajectory but also reconstructing chaotic sets and statistical properties obtained from a long trajectory such as the density distributions of the actual dynamics.</description>

      <title>Provable Hyperparameter Tuning for Structured Pfaffian Settings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data-driven algorithm design automatically adapts algorithms to specific application domains, achieving better performance. In the context of parameterized algorithms, this approach involves tuning the algorithm's hyperparameters using problem instances drawn from the problem distribution of the target application domain. This can be achieved by maximizing empirical utilities that measure the algorithms' performance as a function of their hyperparameters, using problem instances. While empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of data-driven algorithm design, providing theoretical guarantees for several parameterized families remains challenging. This is due to the intricate behaviors of their corresponding utility functions, which typically admit piecewise discontinuous structures. In this work, we present refined frameworks for providing learning guarantees for parameterized data-driven algorithm design problems in both distributional and online learning settings. For the distributional learning setting, we introduce the \textit{Pfaffian GJ framework}, an extension of the classical \textit{GJ framework}, that is capable of providing learning guarantees for function classes for which the computation involves Pfaffian functions. Unlike the GJ framework, which is limited to function classes with computation characterized by rational functions, our proposed framework can deal with function classes involving Pfaffian functions, which are much more general and widely applicable. We then show that for many parameterized algorithms of interest, their utility function possesses a \textit{refined piecewise structure}, which automatically translates to learning guarantees using our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Econometric Inference for High Dimensional Predictive Regressions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LASSO introduces shrinkage bias into estimated coefficients, which can adversely affect the desirable asymptotic normality and invalidate the standard inferential procedure based on the $t$-statistic. The desparsified LASSO has emerged as a well-known remedy for this issue. In the context of high dimensional predictive regression, the desparsified LASSO faces an additional challenge: the Stambaugh bias arising from nonstationary regressors. To restore the standard inferential procedure, we propose a novel estimator called IVX-desparsified LASSO (XDlasso). XDlasso eliminates the shrinkage bias and the Stambaugh bias simultaneously and does not require prior knowledge about the identities of nonstationary and stationary regressors. We establish the asymptotic properties of XDlasso for hypothesis testing, and our theoretical findings are supported by Monte Carlo simulations. Applying our method to real-world applications from the FRED-MD database -- which includes a rich set of control variables -- we investigate two important empirical questions: (i) the predictability of the U.S. stock returns based on the earnings-price ratio, and (ii) the predictability of the U.S. inflation using the unemployment rate.</description>

      <title>Mining Causality: AI-Assisted Search for Instrumental Variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The instrumental variables (IVs) method is a leading empirical strategy for causal inference. Finding IVs is a heuristic and creative process, and justifying its validity--especially exclusion restrictions--is largely rhetorical. We propose using large language models (LLMs) to search for new IVs through narratives and counterfactual reasoning, similar to how a human researcher would. The stark difference, however, is that LLMs can dramatically accelerate this process and explore an extremely large search space. We demonstrate how to construct prompts to search for potentially valid IVs. We contend that multi-step and role-playing prompting strategies are effective for simulating the endogenous decision-making processes of economic agents and for navigating language models through the realm of real-world scenarios. We apply our method to three well-known examples in economics: returns to schooling, supply and demand, and peer effects. We then extend our strategy to finding (i) control variables in regression and difference-in-differences and (ii) running variables in regression discontinuity designs.</description>

      <title>Upsample or Upweight? Balanced Training on Heavily Imbalanced Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data availability across domains often follows a long-tail distribution: a few domains have abundant data, while most face dat . a scarcity. This imbalance poses challenges in training language models uniformly across all domains. In our study, we focus on multilingual settings, where data sizes vary significantly between high- and low-resource languages. Common strategies to address this include upsampling low-resource languages (Temperature Sampling) or upweighting their loss (Scalarization). Although often considered equivalent, this assumption has not been proven, which motivates our study. Through both theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify the conditions under which these approaches are equivalent and when they diverge. Specifically, we demonstrate that these two methods are equivalent under full gradient descent, but this equivalence breaks down with stochastic gradient descent. Empirically, we observe that Temperature Sampling converges more quickly but is prone to overfitting. We argue that this faster convergence is likely due to the lower variance in gradient estimations, as shown theoretically. Based on these insights, we propose Cooldown, a strategy that reduces sampling temperature during training, accelerating convergence without overfitting to low-resource languages. Our method is competitive with existing data re-weighting and offers computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>GIFT-Eval: A Benchmark For General Time Series Forecasting Model Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time series foundation models excel in zero-shot forecasting, handling diverse tasks without explicit training. However, the advancement of these models has been hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce the General Time Series Forecasting Model Evaluation, GIFT-Eval, a pioneering benchmark aimed at promoting evaluation across diverse datasets. GIFT-Eval encompasses 23 datasets over 144,000 time series and 177 million data points, spanning seven domains, 10 frequencies, multivariate inputs, and prediction lengths ranging from short to long-term forecasts. To facilitate the effective pretraining and evaluation of foundation models, we also provide a non-leaking pretraining dataset containing approximately 230 billion data points. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of 17 baselines, which includes statistical models, deep learning models, and foundation models. We discuss each model in the context of various benchmark characteristics and offer a qualitative analysis that spans both deep learning and foundation models. We believe the insights from this analysis, along with access to this new standard zero-shot time series forecasting benchmark, will guide future developments in time series foundation models. Code, data, and the leaderboard can be found at https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/gift-eval .</description>

      <title>Learning-to-Defer for Extractive Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-trained language models have profoundly impacted the field of extractive question-answering, leveraging large-scale textual corpora to enhance contextual language understanding. Despite their success, these models struggle in complex scenarios that demand nuanced interpretation or inferential reasoning beyond immediate textual cues. Furthermore, their size poses deployment challenges on resource-constrained devices. Addressing these limitations, we introduce an adapted two-stage Learning-to-Defer mechanism that enhances decision-making by enabling selective deference to human experts or larger models without retraining language models in the context of question-answering. This approach not only maintains computational efficiency but also significantly improves model reliability and accuracy in ambiguous contexts. We establish the theoretical soundness of our methodology by proving Bayes and $(\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{R})$--consistency of our surrogate loss function, guaranteeing the optimality of the final solution. Empirical evaluations on the SQuADv2 dataset illustrate performance gains from integrating human expertise and leveraging larger models. Our results further demonstrate that deferring a minimal number of queries allows the smaller model to achieve performance comparable to their larger counterparts while preserving computing efficiency, thus broadening the applicability of pre-trained language models in diverse operational environments.</description>

      <title>How Does Critical Batch Size Scale in Pre-training?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training large-scale models under given resources requires careful design of parallelism strategies. In particular, the efficiency notion of critical batch size (CBS), concerning the compromise between time and compute, marks the threshold beyond which greater data parallelism leads to diminishing returns. To operationalize it, we propose a measure of CBS and pre-train a series of auto-regressive language models, ranging from 85 million to 1.2 billion parameters, on the C4 dataset. Through extensive hyper-parameter sweeps and careful control of factors such as batch size, momentum, and learning rate along with its scheduling, we systematically investigate the impact of scale on CBS. Then we fit scaling laws with respect to model and data sizes to decouple their effects. Overall, our results demonstrate that CBS scales primarily with data size rather than model size, a finding we justify theoretically through the analysis of infinite-width limits of neural networks and infinite-dimensional least squares regression. Of independent interest, we highlight the importance of common hyper-parameter choices and strategies for studying large-scale pre-training beyond fixed training durations.</description>

      <title>Towards Harmless Rawlsian Fairness Regardless of Demographic Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to privacy and security concerns, recent advancements in group fairness advocate for model training regardless of demographic information. However, most methods still require prior knowledge of demographics. In this study, we explore the potential for achieving fairness without compromising its utility when no prior demographics are provided to the training set, namely \emph{harmless Rawlsian fairness}. We ascertain that such a fairness requirement with no prior demographic information essential promotes training losses to exhibit a Dirac delta distribution. To this end, we propose a simple but effective method named VFair to minimize the variance of training losses inside the optimal set of empirical losses. This problem is then optimized by a tailored dynamic update approach that operates in both loss and gradient dimensions, directing the model towards relatively fairer solutions while preserving its intact utility. Our experimental findings indicate that regression tasks, which are relatively unexplored from literature, can achieve significant fairness improvement through VFair regardless of any prior, whereas classification tasks usually do not because of their quantized utility measurements. The implementation of our method is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/wxqpxw/VFair}.</description>

      <title>Variational Low-Rank Adaptation Using IVON</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that variational learning can significantly improve the accuracy and calibration of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) without a substantial increase in the cost. We replace AdamW by the Improved Variational Online Newton (IVON) algorithm to finetune large language models. For Llama-2 with 7 billion parameters, IVON improves the accuracy over AdamW by 2.8% and expected calibration error by 4.6%. The accuracy is also better than the other Bayesian alternatives, yet the cost is lower and the implementation is easier. Our work provides additional evidence for the effectiveness of IVON for large language models. The code is available at https://github.com/team-approx-bayes/ivon-lora.</description>
