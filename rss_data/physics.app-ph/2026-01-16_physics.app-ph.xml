      <title>Interfacing Superconductor and Semiconductor Digital Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interface circuits are the key components that enable the hybrid integration of superconductor and semiconductor digital electronics. The design requirements of superconductor-semiconductor interface circuits vary depending on the application, such as high-performance classical computing, superconducting quantum computing, and digital signal processing. In this survey, various interface circuits are categorized based on the working principle and structure. The superconducting output drivers are explored, which are capable of converting and amplifying, e.g., single flux quantum (SFQ) voltage pulses, to voltage levels that semiconductor circuits can process. Several trade-offs between circuit- and system-level design parameters are examined. Accordingly, parameters such as the data rate, output voltage, power dissipation, layout area, thermal/heat load of cryogenic cables, and bit-error rate are considered.</description>

      <title>Interference-governed electromagnetic-thermal coupling and heat transport in pulse EUV-irradiated multilayer nanofilms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mo-Si multilayer mirrors are central to extreme ultraviolet lithography, where nanoscale optical interference and heat accumulation together constrain reflectivity and operational stability. Here we develop an analytical electromagnetic-thermal coupling model that directly links transfer-matrix-based interference-controlled energy deposition with transient heat conduction in EUV-irradiated multilayers. The model reveals a fundamental trade-off whereby increasing the multilayer period number enhances reflectivity but simultaneously elevates temperature by impeding heat dissipation. Interference-driven volumetric absorption further gives rise to pronounced axial temperature gradients and a post-pulse downward migration of the heat-flux maximum, a delayed-heating effect inaccessible to conventional surface-flux-based models. Systematic analysis establishes scaling laws connecting interfacial thermal resistance, beam size, and incident energy density to thermal confinement and temperature rise. By incorporating interfacial compaction kinetics, the model enables a quantitative assessment of mirror lifetime. This work offers a theoretical tool for thermal-optical co-design of multilayer nanostructures including EUV mirrors under pulsed irradiation across a wide spectral range.</description>

      <title>Geometric Criteria for Complete Mode Conversion in Detuned Systems via Piecewise-Coherent Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static phase detuning fundamentally constrains coherent state transfer in asymmetric classical and quantum systems. We introduce a Bloch-sphere formulation for piecewise-coherent modulation that recasts coupled-mode dynamics as geometric trajectories, transforming algebraic control into path optimization. The approach reveals a cone of inaccessibility at the target pole and yields exact geodesic criteria for complete mode conversion in detuned systems. Leveraging this framework, we break time-reversal symmetry to realize a magnet-free optical isolator with near-unity contrast. Furthermore, for detuning larger than coupling between modes, we develop a recursive multi-step protocol enabling deterministic transfer for arbitrary detunings and derive a universal geometric lower bound on the required number of coupling-switching events.</description>

      <title>Casimir interactions as a probe of broadband optical response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Casimir forces arise from quantum electromagnetic fluctuations and depend on the dielectric response of interacting materials across the entire frequency spectrum. Although this dependence is central to Lifshitz theory of the Casimir effect, the formulation of the force in terms of dielectric functions evaluated at imaginary frequencies has largely obscured its connection to real-frequency optical properties, limiting the use of Casimir interactions as a probe of materials. Here we demonstrate that Casimir force measurements encode sufficient information to reconstruct a material's broadband optical response. Using supervised machine learning to invert Lifshitz theory, we determine the complex permittivity of a material over more than seven orders of magnitude in frequency from a single force-distance curve. We show that measurements at different separations selectively constrain distinct frequency ranges of the dielectric response, providing direct physical insight into how quantum fluctuations sample the electromagnetic spectrum. These results establish Casimir interactions as a physically constrained, broadband spectroscopic tool and open new opportunities for optical characterization in regimes inaccessible to conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>Physically Unclonable Functions Based on Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes: A Scalable and Inexpensive Method toward Unique Identifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A physically un-clonable function (PUF) is a physical system that cannot be reproduced or predicted and therefore is a good basis to build security and anti-counterfeiting applications. The unclonability of PUFs typically stems from the randmoness induced in a system during sophisticated fabrication methods. It is precisely this built-in complexity the bottleneck hindering scalability and increasing costs. Here, we produce in a simple manner PUFs based on arrays of carbon nanotubes junctions simultaneously assembled by dielectrophoresis. We demonstrate that the intrinsic inhomogeneity of carbon nanotubes at the nanoscale, combined with the unpredictability introduced by liquid phase-based fabrication methods results in unique electronic profiles of easily scalable devices. This approach could be extrapolated to generate PUFs based on other nanoscale materials</description>

      <title>An Exact Energy Conservation Law for Magneto-Optical Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy conservation imposes fundamental bounds on the polarizabilities of nanoparticles (NPs). While such bounds are well established for isotropic and bianisotropic NPs, they remain unexplored for magneto-optical NPs. Here, we derive the exact energy-conservation law governing the electric and magnetic dipolar response of axially symmetric magneto-optical NPs under general illumination conditions and arbitrary external magnetic fields. Two central results follow from energy conservation: (i) purely magneto-optical scattering, where the non-magnetic polarizability vanishes, is fundamentally forbidden, and (ii) strong magneto-optical scattering regimes, in which the magneto-optical polarizability dominates, are intriguingly allowed.</description>

      <title>Pulse thermal imaging of FUHAO bronze artifact</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate identification of historical restoration traces and material degradation is essential for the scientific preservation of ancient bronzes. In this study, the prestigious FUHAO bronze artifact (late Shang period, 13th-11th century BCE) was non-destructively examined using pulsed thermal imaging (PT). By combining single- and double-layer heat conduction models with Thermal Tomography (TT), this approach allowed for precise spatial localization of repair crevices, patches, and filler materials, while also distinguishing restorative interventions from the original bronze substrate. The artifact was revealed to have been assembled from multiple fragments, exhibiting uneven surface corrosion and clear evidence of prior conservation. The results not only provide direct insights for conservation strategy and historical interpretation but also demonstrate the capability of pulsed thermal imaging as an effective diagnostic tool for the integrated surface and subsurface assessment of cultural heritage objects.</description>

      <title>Quantum bianisotropy in light-matter interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum bianisotropy and chirality are fundamental concepts in light matter interaction that describe how materials with broken symmetries respond to electromagnetic fields at the level of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics. In quantum bianisotropy, magnetoelectric (ME) energy plays a critical role in mediating and enhancing light matter interactions. This concept is essential for bridging the gap between classical electromagnetics (where bianisotropy often involves field nonlocality) and quantum mechanics in metamaterials. The precise manipulation of a quantum emitter's properties at a subwavelength scale is due to near fields, which effectively function as a tunable environment. We show that the ME near field, interpreted as a structure combining the effect of bianisotropy (chirality) with a quantum atmosphere, is a nonMaxwellian field with spacetime symmetry breaking. Quantum ME fields arise from the dynamic modulation and topological coupling of magnetization and electric polarization within ME meta atoms, specific subwavelength structural elements with magnetic and dielectric subsystems in magnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>A comparison of simulation tools for Muon-Induced X-ray Emission (MIXE) in thin films: a study case with lithium batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of three Monte Carlo simulation frameworks -SRIM, GEANT4, and PHITS- for modeling the transport, stopping, and atomic cascade of negative muons in micrometer-scale, multilayer systems relevant to Muon-Induced X-ray Emission (MIXE) experiments at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). Using a lithium-ion battery as a benchmark target, simulated implantation profiles are compared with experimental data from the GIANT spectrometer. All three codes reproduce the overall muon depth distributions with good consistency, even across sharp density contrasts. SRIM provides reliable implantation estimates for compact geometries, whereas PHITS reproduces GEANT4 results with comparable accuracy and additionally generates muonic X-ray spectra. These spectra, however, exhibit a systematic energy offset in the K-line transitions of medium- and high-Z elements relative to theoretical and experimental values. Despite this bias, PHITS accurately captures relative intensities and spectral shapes, enabling element-specific line identification. The results demonstrate that SRIM and PHITS constitute practical tools for rapid estimation of muon implantation and stopping profiles, and that PHITS holds strong potential for predictive MIXE spectroscopy once its transition-energy bias is corrected.</description>

      <title>Observation of Light-Driven Levitation Near Epsilon-Near-Zero Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical manipulation of micro- and nanoparticles near surfaces is fundamental for applications in sensing and microfluidics, yet controlling particle-surface interactions remains challenging. Here we experimentally investigate light-induced forces on dielectric particles near epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterial surfaces using photonic force microscopy. By illuminating trapped particles with tunable visible light, we observe a wavelength-dependent repulsive force unique to ENZ surfaces, contrasting with the attractive forces near dielectric or metallic substrates. This repulsion peaks near the ENZ frequency and may be attributed to combined optical ENZ effects and thermophoretic forces. Our findings demonstrate that ENZ metamaterials can induce stable levitation of particles via light-driven forces, offering a novel mechanism for contactless manipulation in microfluidic environments. This work advances understanding of light-matter interactions at ENZ interfaces and suggests potential for ENZ-based optical control of micro- and nanoscale objects, with potential applications in micro- and nanofluidic environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a Doppler thermometer based on direct optical frequency comb spectroscopy of an $^{85}$Rb vapor with a chirped electro-optic frequency comb (EOFC). The direct EOFC Doppler thermometer is accurate to within its approximately 1 K statistical uncertainty. We experimentally compare direct EOFC spectroscopy with conventional Doppler spectroscopy using a single-frequency, step-scanned laser probe. Our results show that direct EOFC spectroscopy mitigates transit-induced optical pumping distortion of the atomic lineshape, which is the dominant systematic temperature shift in alkali atom Doppler thermometry. Optical Bloch equation simulations of conventional and direct EOFC Doppler spectroscopy confirm that EOFC spectroscopy can use higher optical power to reduce statistical noise without optical pumping distortion. Our results indicate that EOFC Doppler thermometry is a promising approach to realizing a primary thermometer with size and measurement rate sufficient for applications including pharmaceutical manufacturing and nuclear waste monitoring.</description>

      <title>Systematic Study of Amorphous ABC Heterostructures at the Atomic Scale as a Second-Order Nonlinear Optical Metamaterial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21583v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systematic exploration of amorphous ABC heterostructures revealed that nanoscale morphological modifications markedly improved their artificial bulk second-order susceptibility. These amorphous birefringent heterostructures were fabricated through plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition of three oxides, effectively breaking the centrosymmetry on the nanoscale. We observe a dependence of the optical nonlinearity on the thickness variation of three constituent materials, SiO$_2$, TiO$_2$, and Al$_2$O$_3$, ranging from tens of nanometers to the atomic scale, and these thin films exhibit second-order susceptibility at their interfaces. Our findings reveal that the enhancement of nonlinear optical properties is strongly correlated with a high density of layers and superior interface quality, where the interface second-order nonlinearity transitions to bulk-like second-harmonic generation. An effective bulk second-order susceptibility of $\chi_{zzz} = 2.0 \pm 0.2$~pm/V at the wavelength of 1032~nm is achieved, comparable to typical values for conventional monocrystalline nonlinear materials.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional FrBD friction models for rolling contact</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive two-dimensional generalisation of the recently introduced Friction with Bristle Dynamics (FrBD) framework for rolling contact problems. The proposed formulation extends the one-dimensional FrBD model to accommodate simultaneous longitudinal and lateral slips, spin, and arbitrary transport kinematics over a finite contact region. The derivation combines a rheological representation of the bristle element with an analytical local sliding-friction law. By relying on an application of the Implicit Function Theorem, the notion of sliding velocity is then eliminated, and a fully dynamic friction model, driven solely by the rigid relative velocity, is obtained. Building upon this local model, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, covering standard linear rolling contact, as well as linear and semilinear rolling in the presence of large spin slips. For the linear formulations, well-posedness, stability, and passivity properties are investigated under standard assumptions. In particular, the analysis reveals that the model preserves passivity under almost any parametrisation of practical interest. Numerical simulations illustrate steady-state action surfaces, transient relaxation phenomena, and the effect of time-varying normal loads. The results provide a unified and mathematically tractable friction model applicable to a broad class of rolling contact systems.</description>

Abstract: Rare-earth metal oxyhydride compositions are currently attracting increasing attention to develop materials with unusual optical responses. Herein, using computer simulations of the electronic and optical properties, the optical responses of two stable yttrium oxyhydride compounds, Y4H10O and YHO, are studied for the visible light range. The emphasis is on modeling macroscopic optical characteristics, which are numerically derived within a conventional scheme using refractive indices, and absorption, transmittance, and reflection spectra. The main goal is twofold: first, to simulate spectral behavior of different single-phase and two-phase oxyhydride compositions and second, to conduct a comparative analysis that could explain the features of the transmission spectra measured for different samples. Based on the obtained results, models of new optical coatings are proposed in which yttrium oxyhydrides play the key role. In the context of nonlinear optics, the frequency profile of the second-order susceptibility for the noncentrosymmetric cubic structure of Y4H10O is evaluated and it is shown that this system could exhibit large optical nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>An information-matching approach to optimal experimental design and active learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02740v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Cavity-QED Simulation of a Maser beyond the Mean-Field Approximation</title>

Abstract: Based on the well-known Tavis-Cummings (TC) model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), we introduce a method for quantum-mechanically simulating the dynamics of experimental masers beyond the mean-field approximation (MFA) that takes into account the spatial variation of the a.c. magnetic field of the maser's amplified microwave mode across its gain medium. The distribution in the coupling between the amplified mode and the medium's very large number (typically $10^{17}$) of spatially distributed quantum emitters can be determined straightforwardly for a given geometry and composition using an electromagnetic-field solver. Upon discretising this distribution as a histogram over a small finite number of bins, we assign -- as an approximation -- the same coupling to all emitters that fall within the same bin, where the value of this coupling equals the center value of the bin's range. With our approximate Hamiltonian arranged as a weighted sum over these bins, we generate expressions for expectation values of operators in the Heisenberg picture to second order in cumulant expansion, using the publicly available QuantumCumulants.jl package in Julia. For ten evenly spaced bins, our model, which can be run on a laptop computer, is used to simulate the recorded output from an experimental maser with a pentacene-doped para-terphenyl gain medium. We find that it replicates the quantum-mechanical features of the measured maser's dynamics, in particular its damped collective Rabi oscillations, more closely than the standard TC model under the MFA can, with an R$^2$ value of 0.774, as opposed to 0.265. Our model should thus aid the quantitative engineering of improved, optimised maser designs.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Textbook Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of an RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing textbook model \cite{ZhigarevBook, Gevorgian2015}, interpret them and provide understanding of them. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>
