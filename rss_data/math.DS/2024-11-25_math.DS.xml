      <title>The independence polynomial on recursive sequences of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the zero sets of the independence polynomial on recursive sequences of graphs. We prove that for a maximally independent starting graph and a stable and expanding recursion algorithm, the zeros of the independence polynomial are uniformly bounded. Each of the recursion algorithms leads to a rational dynamical system whose formula, degree and the dimension of the space it acts upon depend on the specific algorithm. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the qualitative behavior of the dynamics exhibit universal features that can be exploited to draw conclusions about the zero sets.</description>

      <title>On the sum of two affine Cantor sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose that $K$ and $ K'$ are two affine Cantor sets. It is shown that the sum set $K+K'$ has equal box and Hausdorff dimensions and in this number named $s$, $H^s(K+K')&lt;\infty$. Moreover, for almost every pair $(K,K')$ satisfying $HD(K)+HD(K')\leq 1$, there is a dense subset $D\subset \mathbb R$ such that $H^s(K+\lambda K')=0$, for all $\lambda\in D$. It also is shown that in the context of affine Cantor sets with two increasing maps, there are generically (topological and almost everywhere) five possible structures for their sum: a Cantor set, an L, R, M-Cantorval or a finite union of closed intervals.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic spaces for the bilateral shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two H\"older potentials $\phi_+$ and $\psi_-$ for the unilateral shift, we define anisotropic Banach spaces of distributions on the bilateral shift space with a finite alphabet. On these spaces, the transfer operator for the bilateral shift is quasicompact with a spectral gap, and the unique Gibbs state associated with $\phi_+$ spans its $1$-eigenspace. This result allows us to establish exponential decay of correlations for H\"older observables and a wide range of measures on the bilateral shift space.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of an LPAA model for Tribolium Growth: Insights into Population Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flour beetles (genus Tribolium) have long been used as a model organism to understand population dynamics in ecological research. A rich and rigorous body of work has cemented flour beetles' place in the field of mathematical biology. One of the most interesting results using flour beetles is the induction of chaos in a laboratory beetle population, in which the well-established LPA (larvae-pupae-adult) model was used to inform the experimental factors which would lead to chaos. However, whether chaos is an intrinsic property of flour beetles remains an open question. Inspired by new experimental data, we extend the LPA model by stratifying the adult population into newly emerged and mature adults and considering cannibalism as a function of mature adults. We fit the model to longitudinal data of larvae, pupae, and adult beetle populations to demonstrate the model's ability to recapitulate the transient dynamics of flour beetles. We present local and global stability results for the trivial and positive steady states and explore bifurcations and limit cycles numerically. Our results suggest that while chaos is a possibility, it is a rare phenomenon within realistic ranges of the parameters obtained from our experiment, and is likely induced by environmental changes connected to media changes and population censusing.</description>

      <title>Hypercyclic algebras for weighted shifts on trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of algebras of hypercyclic vectors for weighted backward shifts on sequence spaces of directed trees with the coordinatewise product. When $V$ is a rooted directed tree, we show the set of hypercyclic vectors of any backward weighted shift operator on the space $c_0(V)$ or $\ell^1(V)$ is algebrable whenever it is not empty. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of these structures on $\ell^p(V), 1&lt;p&lt;+\infty$. Examples of hypercyclic operators not having a hypercyclic algebra are found. We also study the existence of mixing and non-mixing backward weighted shift operators on any rooted directed tree, with or without hypercyclic algebras. The case of unrooted trees is also studied.</description>

      <title>Minimizing information loss reduces spiking neuronal networks to differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking neuronal networks (SNNs) are widely used in computational neuroscience, from biologically realistic modeling of local cortical networks to phenomenological modeling of the whole brain. Despite their prevalence, a systematic mathematical theory for finite-sized SNNs remains elusive, even for idealized homogeneous networks. The primary challenges are twofold: 1) the rich, parameter-sensitive SNN dynamics, and 2) the singularity and irreversibility of spikes. These challenges pose significant difficulties when relating SNNs to systems of differential equations, leading previous studies to impose additional assumptions or to focus on individual dynamic regimes. In this study, we introduce a Markov approximation of homogeneous SNN dynamics to minimize information loss when translating SNNs into ordinary differential equations. Our only assumption for the Markov approximation is the fast self-decorrelation of synaptic conductances. The system of ordinary differential equations derived from the Markov model effectively captures high-frequency partial synchrony and the metastability of finite-neuron networks produced by interacting excitatory and inhibitory populations. Besides accurately predicting dynamical statistics, such as firing rates, our theory also quantitatively captures the geometry of attractors and bifurcation structures of SNNs. Thus, our work provides a comprehensive mathematical framework that can systematically map parameters of single-neuron physiology, network coupling, and external stimuli to homogeneous SNN dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bayesian dynamic mode decomposition for real-time ship motion digital twinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twins are widely considered enablers of groundbreaking changes in the development, operation, and maintenance of novel generations of products. They are meant to provide reliable and timely predictions to inform decisions along the entire product life cycle. One of their most interesting applications in the naval field is the digital twinning of ship performances in waves, a crucial aspect in design and operation safety. In this paper, a Bayesian extension of the Hankel dynamic mode decomposition method is proposed for ship motion's nowcasting as a prediction tool for naval digital twins. The proposed algorithm meets all the requirements for formulations devoted to digital twinning, being able to adapt the resulting models with the data incoming from the physical system, using a limited amount of data, producing real-time predictions, and estimating their reliability. Results are presented and discussed for the course-keeping of the 5415M model in beam-quartering sea state 7 irregular waves at Fr = 0.33, using data from three different CFD solvers. The results show predictions keeping good accuracy levels up to five wave encounter periods, with the Bayesian formulation improving the deterministic forecasts. In addition, a connection between the predicted uncertainty and prediction accuracy is found.</description>

      <title>On Temporal Decay of Compressible Hookean Viscoelastic Fluids with Relatively Large Elasticity Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Jiang--Jiang (J. Differential Equations 282, 2021) showed the existence of unique strong solutions in spatial periodic domain (denoted by $\mathbb{T}^3$), whenever the elasticity coefficient is larger than the initial velocity perturbation of the rest state. Motivated by Jiang--Jiang's result, we revisit the Cauchy problem of the compressible viscoelastic fluids in Lagrangian coordinates. Employing an energy method with temporal weights and an additional asymptotic stability condition of initial density in Lagrangian coordinates, we extend the Jiang--Jiang's result with exponential decay-in-time in $\mathbb{T}^3$ to the one with algebraic decay-in-time in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^3$. Thanks to the algebraic decay of solutions established by the energy method with temporal weights, we can further use the spectral analysis to improve the temporal decay rate of solutions. In particular, we find that the $k$-th order spatial derivatives of both the density and deformation perturbations converge to zero in $L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ at a rate of $(1+t)^{-\frac{3}{4}-\frac{k+1}{2}}$, which is faster than the decay rate $(1 +t)^{-\frac{3}{4}-\frac{k}{2}}$ obtained by Hu--Wu (SIAM J. Math. Anal. 45, 2013) for $k=0$ and $ 1$. In addition, it's well-known that the decay rate $(1+t)^{-\frac{3}{4}-\frac{k}{2}}$ of the density perturbation is optimal in the compressible Navier--Stokes equations (A.~Matsumura, T.~Nishida, Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser-A. 55, 1979). Therefore, our faster temporal decay rates indicate that the elasticity accelerates the decay of the density perturbation after the rest state of a compressible viscoelastic fluid being perturbed.</description>

      <title>Cup and cap products for cohomology and homology groups of ample groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the cup and cap products within the cohomology and homology groups of ample groupoids, focusing on their applications and fundamental properties. Ample groupoids, which are \'etale groupoids with a totally disconnected unit space, play a crucial role in the study of topological dynamical systems and operator algebras. We introduce the cup product, which defines a bilinear map on cohomology classes, providing a graded ring structure, and the cap product, which defines a bilinear map relating homology and cohomology. The paper aims to make these concepts accessible to a broader mathematical audience, offering clear definitions and detailed explanations. We also demonstrate an application of the cap product in the analysis of automorphisms of groupoid $C^*$-algebras. Specifically, we show how it helps determine the asymptotic innerness of automorphisms. Our results include the first explicit computations of cup products in the cohomology of tiling spaces, which may pave the way for new research in this area.</description>

      <title>Reactive Robot Navigation Using Quasi-conformal Mappings and Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a robot control algorithm suitable for safe reactive navigation tasks in cluttered environments. The proposed approach consists of transforming the robot workspace into the \emph{ball world}, an artificial representation where all obstacle regions are closed balls. Starting from a polyhedral representation of obstacles in the environment, obtained using exteroceptive sensor readings, a computationally efficient mapping to ball-shaped obstacles is constructed using quasi-conformal mappings and M\"obius transformations. The geometry of the ball world is amenable to provably safe navigation tasks achieved via control barrier functions employed to ensure collision-free robot motions with guarantees both on safety and on the absence of deadlocks. The performance of the proposed navigation algorithm is showcased and analyzed via extensive simulations and experiments performed using different types of robotic systems, including manipulators and mobile robots.</description>

      <title>Geodesics and dynamical information projections on the manifold of H\"older equilibrium probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09677v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider here the discrete time dynamics described by a transformation $T:M \to M$, where $T$ is either the action of shift $T=\sigma$ on the symbolic space $M=\{1,2,...,d\}^\mathbb{N}$, or, $T$ describes the action of a $d$ to $1$ expanding transformation $T:S^1 \to S^1$ of class $C^{1+\alpha}$ (\,for example $x \to T(x) =d\, x $ (mod $1) $\,), where $M=S^1$ is the unit circle. It is known that the infinite-dimensional manifold $\mathcal{N}$ of equilibrium probabilities for H\"older potentials $A:M \to \mathbb{R}$ is an analytical manifold and carries a natural Riemannian metric associated with the asymptotic variance. We show here that under the assumption of the existence of a Fourier-like Hilbert basis for the kernel of the Ruelle operator there exists geodesics paths. When $T=\sigma$ and $M=\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$ such basis exists.
  In a different direction, we also consider the KL-divergence $D_{KL}(\mu_1,\mu_2)$ for a pair of equilibrium probabilities. If $D_{KL}(\mu_1,\mu_2)=0$, then $\mu_1=\mu_2$. Although $D_{KL}$ is not a metric in $\mathcal{N}$, it describes the proximity between $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$. A natural problem is: for a fixed probability $\mu_1\in \mathcal{N}$ consider the probability $\mu_2$ in a convex set of probabilities in $\mathcal{N}$ which minimizes $D_{KL}(\mu_1,\mu_2)$. This minimization problem is a dynamical version of the main issues considered in information projections. We consider this problem in $\mathcal{N}$, a case where all probabilities are dynamically invariant, getting explicit equations for the solution sought. Triangle and Pythagorean inequalities will be investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method of reconstructing the phase-amplitude dynamics directly from measured electrophysiological signals to estimate the coupling between brain regions. For this purpose, we use the recent advances in the field of phase-amplitude reduction of oscillatory systems, which allow the representation of an uncoupled oscillatory system as a phase-amplitude oscillator in a unique form using transformations (parameterizations) related to the eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator. By combining the parameterization method and the Fourier-Laplace averaging method for finding the eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator, we developed a method of assessing the transformation functions from the signals of the interacting oscillatory systems. The resulting reconstructed dynamical system is a network of phase-amplitude oscillators with the interactions between them represented as coupling functions in phase and amplitude coordinates.</description>

Abstract: Assume that $f$ is a $C^r(r\geq 2)$ specially absolutely partial hyperbolic endomorphism on the 2-torus which is homotopic to an expanding linear endomorphism $A$ with irrational real eigenvalues $|\lambda^u_A|&gt;|\lambda^c_A|&gt;1$. If $f$ expands area, then the semi-conjugacy $h$ between $f$ and $A$ is the conjugacy, and the conjugacy is $C^1$ along the center foliation. Furthermore, if $f$ not only expands area but also has the $C^1$ center bundle, then the conjugacy is smooth.</description>

Abstract: Assume that the interval $I=[0,1)$ is partitioned into finitely many intervals $I_1,\dots,I_r$ and consider a map $T\colon I\to I$ so that $T_{\vert I_s}$ is a translation for each $1 \le s \le r$. We do not assume that the images of these intervals are disjoint. Such maps are called Interval Translation Maps. Let $ITM(r)$ be the space of all such transformations, where we fix $r$ but not the intervals $I_1,\dots,I_r$, nor the translations. The set $X(T):=\bigcap_{n\ge 0} T^n[0,1)$ can be a finite union of intervals (in which case the map is called of finite type), or is a disjoint union of finitely many intervals and a Cantor set (in which case the map is called of infinite type). In this paper we show that there exists an open and dense subset $\mathcal{S}(r)$ of $ITM(r)$ consisting of stable maps, i.e. each $T\in \mathcal{S}(r)$ is of finite type, the first return map to any component of $X(T)$ corresponds to a circle rotation and $\mathcal{S}(r) \ni T \mapsto X(T)$ is continuous in the Hausdorff topology.</description>

      <title>Phase and gain stability for adaptive dynamical networks</title>

Abstract: In adaptive dynamical networks, the dynamics of the nodes and the edges influence each other. We show that we can treat such systems as a closed feedback loop between edge and node dynamics. Using recent advances on the stability of feedback systems from control theory, we derive local, sufficient conditions for steady states of such systems to be linearly stable. These conditions are local in the sense that they are written entirely in terms of the (linearized) behavior of the edges and nodes. We apply these conditions to the Kuramoto model with inertia written in adaptive form, and the adaptive Kuramoto model. For the former we recover a classic result, for the latter we show that our sufficient conditions match necessary conditions where the latter are available, thus completely settling the question of linear stability in this setting. The method we introduce can be readily applied to a vast class of systems. It enables straightforward evaluation of stability in highly heterogeneous systems.</description>

      <title>The Product of linear forms over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to study the product of $n$ linear forms over function fields. We calculate the maximum value of the minima of the forms with determinant one when $n$ is small. The value is equal to the natural bound given by algebraic number theory. Our proof is based on a reduction theory of diagonal group orbits on homogeneous spaces. We also show that the forms defined algebraically correspond to periodic orbits with respect to the diagonal group actions.</description>
