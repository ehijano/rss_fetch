      <title>D4PM: A Dual-branch Driven Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model with Joint Posterior Diffusion Sampling for EEG Artifacts Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artifact removal is critical for accurate analysis and interpretation of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Traditional methods perform poorly with strong artifact-EEG correlations or single-channel data. Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have demonstrated strong potential for EEG denoising, notably improving fine-grained noise suppression and reducing over-smoothing. However, existing methods face two main limitations: lack of temporal modeling limits interpretability and the use of single-artifact training paradigms ignore inter-artifact differences. To address these issues, we propose D4PM, a dual-branch driven denoising diffusion probabilistic model that unifies multi-type artifact removal. We introduce a dual-branch conditional diffusion architecture to implicitly model the data distribution of clean EEG and artifacts. A joint posterior sampling strategy is further designed to collaboratively integrate complementary priors for high-fidelity EEG reconstruction. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that D4PM delivers superior denoising. It achieves new state-of-the-art performance in EOG artifact removal, outperforming all publicly available baselines. The code is available at https://github.com/flysnow1024/D4PM.</description>

      <title>UTOPY: Unrolling Algorithm Learning via Fidelity Homotopy for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging Inverse problems aim to reconstruct an underlying image from undersampled, coded, and noisy observations. Within the wide range of reconstruction frameworks, the unrolling algorithm is one of the most popular due to the synergistic integration of traditional model-based reconstruction methods and modern neural networks, providing an interpretable and highly accurate reconstruction. However, when the sensing operator is highly ill-posed, gradient steps on the data-fidelity term can hinder convergence and degrade reconstruction quality. To address this issue, we propose UTOPY, a homotopy continuation formulation for training the unrolling algorithm. Mainly, this method involves using a well-posed (synthetic) sensing matrix at the beginning of the unrolling network optimization. We define a continuation path strategy to transition smoothly from the synthetic fidelity to the desired ill-posed problem. This strategy enables the network to progressively transition from a simpler, well-posed inverse problem to the more challenging target scenario. We theoretically show that, for projected gradient descent-like unrolling models, the proposed continuation strategy generates a smooth path of unrolling solutions. Experiments on compressive sensing and image deblurring demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses conventional unrolled training, achieving up to 2.5 dB PSNR improvement in reconstruction performance.

      <title>Subjective Evaluation of Low Distortion Coded Light Fields with View Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light field technology is a powerful imaging method that captures both the intensity and direction of light rays in a scene, enabling the reconstruction of 3D information and supporting a range of unique applications. However, light fields produce vast amounts of data, making efficient compression essential for their practical use. View synthesis plays a key role in light field technology by enabling the generation of new views, yet its interaction with compression has not been fully explored. In this work, a subjective analysis of the effect of view synthesis on light field compression is conducted. To achieve this, a sparsely sampled light field is created by dropping views from an original light field. Both light fields are then encoded using JPEG Pleno and VVC. View synthesis is then applied to the compressed sampled light field to reconstruct the same number of views as the original. The subjective evaluation follows the proposed JPEG AIC-3 test methodology designed to assess the quality of high-fidelity compressed images. This test consists of two test stimuli displayed side-by-side, each alternating between an original and a coded view, creating a flicker effect on both sides. The user must choose which side has the stronger flicker and, therefore, the lower quality. Using these subjective results, a selection of metrics is validated.</description>

      <title>Hint: hierarchical inter-frame correlation for one-shot point cloud sequence compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated strong capability in compressing point clouds. Within this area, entropy modeling for lossless compression is widely investigated. However, most methods rely solely on parent orsibling contexts and level-wise autoregression, which suffers from decoding latency on the order of 10 to 100 seconds. We propose HINT, a method that integrates temporal and spatial correlation for sequential point cloud compression. Specifically, it first uses a two stage temporal feature extraction: (i) a parent-level existence map and (ii) a child-level neighborhood lookup in the previous frame. These cues are fused with the spatial features via elementwise addition and encoded with a group-wise strategy. Experimental results show that HINT achieves encoding and decoding time at 105 ms and 140 ms, respectively, equivalent to 49.6x and 21.6x acceleration in comparison with G-PCC, while achieving up to bit rate reduction of 43.6%, in addition, consistently outperforming over the strong spatial only baseline (RENO).</description>

      <title>Undersampled Phase Retrieval with Image Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase retrieval seeks to recover a complex signal from amplitude-only measurements, a challenging nonlinear inverse problem. Current theory and algorithms often ignore signal priors. By contrast, we evaluate here a variety of image priors in the context of severe undersampling with structured random Fourier measurements. Our results show that those priors significantly improve reconstruction, allowing accurate reconstruction even below the weak recovery threshold.</description>

      <title>Learning Mechanistic Subtypes of Neurodegeneration with a Physics-Informed Variational Autoencoder Mixture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases demands methods that capture heterogeneous and spatially varying dynamics from sparse, high-dimensional neuroimaging data. Integrating partial differential equation (PDE) based physics knowledge with machine learning provides enhanced interpretability and utility over classic numerical methods. However, current physics-integrated machine learning methods are limited to considering a single PDE, severely limiting their application to diseases where multiple mechanisms are responsible for different groups (i.e., subtypes) and aggravating problems with model misspecification and degeneracy. Here, we present a deep generative model for learning mixtures of latent dynamic models governed by physics-based PDEs, going beyond traditional approaches that assume a single PDE structure. Our method integrates reaction-diffusion PDEs within a variational autoencoder (VAE) mixture model framework, supporting inference of subtypes of interpretable latent variables (e.g. diffusivity and reaction rates) from neuroimaging data. We evaluate our method on synthetic benchmarks and demonstrate its potential for uncovering mechanistic subtypes of Alzheimer's disease progression from positron emission tomography (PET) data.</description>

      <title>HQCNN: A Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network for Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classification of medical images plays a vital role in medical image analysis; however, it remains challenging due to the limited availability of labeled data, class imbalances, and the complexity of medical patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network (HQCNN) for both binary and multi-class classification. The architecture of HQCNN integrates a five-layer classical convolutional backbone with a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit that incorporates quantum state encoding, superpositional entanglement, and a Fourier-inspired quantum attention mechanism. We evaluate the model on six MedMNIST v2 benchmark datasets. The HQCNN consistently outperforms classical and quantum baselines, achieving up to 99.91% accuracy and 100.00% AUC on PathMNIST (binary) and 99.95% accuracy on OrganAMNIST (multi-class) with strong robustness on noisy datasets like BreastMNIST (87.18% accuracy). The model demonstrates superior generalization capability and computational efficiency, accomplished with significantly fewer trainable parameters, making it suitable for data-scarce scenarios. Our findings provide strong empirical evidence that hybrid quantum-classical models can advance medical imaging tasks.</description>

      <title>Two Web Toolkits for Multimodal Piano Performance Dataset Acquisition and Fingering Annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piano performance is a multimodal activity that intrinsically combines physical actions with the acoustic rendition. Despite growing research interest in analyzing the multimodal nature of piano performance, the laborious process of acquiring large-scale multimodal data remains a significant bottleneck, hindering further progress in this field. To overcome this barrier, we present an integrated web toolkit comprising two graphical user interfaces (GUIs): (i) PiaRec, which supports the synchronized acquisition of audio, video, MIDI, and performance metadata. (ii) ASDF, which enables the efficient annotation of performer fingering from the visual data. Collectively, this system can streamline the acquisition of multimodal piano performance datasets.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Multicenter Experts in Multimodal AI for Debiased Radiotherapy Target Delineation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clinical decision-making reflects diverse strategies shaped by regional patient populations and institutional protocols. However, most existing medical artificial intelligence (AI) models are trained on highly prevalent data patterns, which reinforces biases and fails to capture the breadth of clinical expertise. Inspired by the recent advances in Mixture of Experts (MoE), we propose a Mixture of Multicenter Experts (MoME) framework to address AI bias in the medical domain without requiring data sharing across institutions. MoME integrates specialized expertise from diverse clinical strategies to enhance model generalizability and adaptability across medical centers. We validate this framework using a multimodal target volume delineation model for prostate cancer radiotherapy. With few-shot training that combines imaging and clinical notes from each center, the model outperformed baselines, particularly in settings with high inter-center variability or limited data availability. Furthermore, MoME enables model customization to local clinical preferences without cross-institutional data exchange, making it especially suitable for resource-constrained settings while promoting broadly generalizable medical AI.</description>

      <title>MedFuncta: A Unified Framework for Learning Efficient Medical Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research in medical imaging primarily focuses on discrete data representations that poorly scale with grid resolution and fail to capture the often continuous nature of the underlying signal. Neural Fields (NFs) offer a powerful alternative by modeling data as continuous functions. While single-instance NFs have successfully been applied in medical contexts, extending them to large-scale medical datasets remains an open challenge. We therefore introduce MedFuncta, a unified framework for large-scale NF training on diverse medical signals. Building on Functa, our approach encodes data into a unified representation, namely a 1D latent vector, that modulates a shared, meta-learned NF, enabling generalization across a dataset. We revisit common design choices, introducing a non-constant frequency parameter $\omega$ in widely used SIREN activations, and establish a connection between this $\omega$-schedule and layer-wise learning rates, relating our findings to recent work in theoretical learning dynamics. We additionally introduce a scalable meta-learning strategy for shared network learning that employs sparse supervision during training, thereby reducing memory consumption and computational overhead while maintaining competitive performance. Finally, we evaluate MedFuncta across a diverse range of medical datasets and show how to solve relevant downstream tasks on our neural data representation. To promote further research in this direction, we release our code, model weights and the first large-scale dataset - MedNF - containing &gt; 500 k latent vectors for multi-instance medical NFs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practical applications, low-light images are often compressed for efficient storage and transmission. Most existing methods disregard compression artifacts removal or hardly establish a unified framework for joint task enhancement of low-light images with varying compression qualities. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid priors-guided network (HPGN) that enhances compressed low-light images by integrating both compression and illumination priors. Our approach fully utilizes the JPEG quality factor (QF) and DCT quantization matrix to guide the design of efficient plug-and-play modules for joint tasks. Additionally, we employ a random QF generation strategy to guide model training, enabling a single model to enhance low-light images with different compression levels. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method..</description>

      <title>A new dataset and comparison for multi-camera frame synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many methods exist for frame synthesis in image sequences but can be broadly categorised into frame interpolation and view synthesis techniques. Fundamentally, both frame interpolation and view synthesis tackle the same task, interpolating a frame given surrounding frames in time or space. However, most frame interpolation datasets focus on temporal aspects with single cameras moving through time and space, while view synthesis datasets are typically biased toward stereoscopic depth estimation use cases. This makes direct comparison between view synthesis and frame interpolation methods challenging. In this paper, we develop a novel multi-camera dataset using a custom-built dense linear camera array to enable fair comparison between these approaches. We evaluate classical and deep learning frame interpolators against a view synthesis method (3D Gaussian Splatting) for the task of view in-betweening. Our results reveal that deep learning methods do not significantly outperform classical methods on real image data, with 3D Gaussian Splatting actually underperforming frame interpolators by as much as 3.5 dB PSNR. However, in synthetic scenes, the situation reverses -- 3D Gaussian Splatting outperforms frame interpolation algorithms by almost 5 dB PSNR at a 95% confidence level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI) offers a way to generate intermediate frames between consecutive frames of a video sequence. Although the development of advanced frame interpolation algorithms has received increased attention in recent years, assessing the perceptual quality of interpolated content remains an ongoing area of research. In this paper, we investigate simple ways to process motion fields, with the purposes of using them as video quality metric for evaluating frame interpolation algorithms. We evaluate these quality metrics using the BVI-VFI dataset which contains perceptual scores measured for interpolated sequences. From our investigation we propose a motion metric based on measuring the divergence of motion fields. This metric correlates reasonably with these perceptual scores (PLCC=0.51) and is more computationally efficient (x2.7 speedup) compared to FloLPIPS (a well known motion-based metric). We then use our new proposed metrics to evaluate a range of state of the art frame interpolation metrics and find our metrics tend to favour more perceptual pleasing interpolated frames that may not score highly in terms of PSNR or SSIM.</description>

      <title>Efficient Fine-Tuning of DINOv3 Pretrained on Natural Images for Atypical Mitotic Figure Classification in MIDOG 2025</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) represent abnormal cell division associated with poor prognosis. Yet their detection remains difficult due to low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple domains. In this work, we fine-tuned the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision transformer, pretrained on natural images, using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), training only ~1.3M parameters in combination with extensive augmentation and a domain-weighted Focal Loss to handle domain heterogeneity. Despite the domain gap, our fine-tuned DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology, reaching second place on the preliminary test set. These results highlight the advantages of DINOv3 pretraining and underline the efficiency and robustness of our fine-tuning strategy, yielding state-of-the-art results for the atypical mitosis classification challenge in MIDOG 2025.</description>

Abstract: Mitotic figures are classified into typical and atypical variants, with atypical counts correlating strongly with tumor aggressiveness. Accurate differentiation is therefore essential for patient prognostication and resource allocation, yet remains challenging even for expert pathologists. Here, we leveraged Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs) pre-trained on large histopathology datasets and applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning via low-rank adaptation. In addition, we incorporated ConvNeXt V2, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture, to complement PFMs. During training, we employed a fisheye transform to emphasize mitoses and Fourier Domain Adaptation using ImageNet target images. Finally, we ensembled multiple PFMs to integrate complementary morphological insights, achieving competitive balanced accuracy on the Preliminary Evaluation Phase dataset.</description>

      <title>FASL-Seg: Anatomy and Tool Segmentation of Surgical Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream, for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation, respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing streams for varying feature resolutions.</description>

      <title>Domain Generalization for In-Orbit 6D Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the relative 6D pose, i.e., position and orientation, of a target spacecraft, from a monocular image, a key capability for future autonomous Rendezvous and Proximity Operations. Due to the difficulty of acquiring large sets of real images, spacecraft pose estimation networks are exclusively trained on synthetic ones. However, because those images do not capture the illumination conditions encountered in orbit, pose estimation networks face a domain gap problem, i.e., they do not generalize to real images. Our work introduces a method that bridges this domain gap. It relies on a novel, end-to-end, neural-based architecture as well as a novel learning strategy. This strategy improves the domain generalization abilities of the network through multi-task learning and aggressive data augmentation policies, thereby enforcing the network to learn domain-invariant features. We demonstrate that our method effectively closes the domain gap, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the widespread SPEED+ dataset. Finally, ablation studies assess the impact of key components of our method on its generalization abilities.</description>

      <title>Traffic Co-Simulation Framework Empowered by Infrastructure Camera Sensing and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traffic simulations are commonly used to optimize urban traffic flow, with reinforcement learning (RL) showing promising potential for automated traffic signal control, particularly in intelligent transportation systems involving connected automated vehicles. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is particularly effective for learning control strategies for traffic lights in a network using iterative simulations. However, existing methods often assume perfect vehicle detection, which overlooks real-world limitations related to infrastructure availability and sensor reliability. This study proposes a co-simulation framework integrating CARLA and SUMO, which combines high-fidelity 3D modeling with large-scale traffic flow simulation. Cameras mounted on traffic light poles within the CARLA environment use a YOLO-based computer vision system to detect and count vehicles, providing real-time traffic data as input for adaptive signal control in SUMO. MARL agents trained with four different reward structures leverage this visual feedback to optimize signal timings and improve network-wide traffic flow. Experiments in a multi-intersection test-bed demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MARL approach in enhancing traffic conditions using real-time camera based detection. The framework also evaluates the robustness of MARL under faulty or sparse sensing and compares the performance of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for vehicle detection. Results show that while better accuracy improves performance, MARL agents can still achieve significant improvements with imperfect detection, demonstrating scalability and adaptability for real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Direct Video-Based Spatiotemporal Deep Learning for Cattle Lameness Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16404v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cattle lameness is a prevalent health problem in livestock farming, often resulting from hoof injuries or infections, and severely impacts animal welfare and productivity. Early and accurate detection is critical for minimizing economic losses and ensuring proper treatment. This study proposes a spatiotemporal deep learning framework for automated cattle lameness detection using publicly available video data. We curate and publicly release a balanced set of 50 online video clips featuring 42 individual cattle, recorded from multiple viewpoints in both indoor and outdoor environments. The videos were categorized into lame and non-lame classes based on visual gait characteristics and metadata descriptions. After applying data augmentation techniques to enhance generalization, two deep learning architectures were trained and evaluated: 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNN) and Convolutional Long-Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM2D). The 3D CNN achieved a video-level classification accuracy of 90%, with a precision, recall, and F1 score of 90.9% each, outperforming the ConvLSTM2D model, which achieved 85% accuracy. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on multistage pipelines involving object detection and pose estimation, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a direct end-to-end video classification approach. Compared with the best end-to-end prior method (C3D-ConvLSTM, 90.3%), our model achieves comparable accuracy while eliminating pose estimation pre-processing.The results indicate that deep learning models can successfully extract and learn spatio-temporal features from various video sources, enabling scalable and efficient cattle lameness detection in real-world farm settings.</description>
