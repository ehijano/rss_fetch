      <title>Comparing cohomology via exact split pairs in diagram algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we compare the cohomology between the categories of modules of the diagram algebras and the categories of modules of its input algebras. Our main result establishes a sufficient condition for exact split pairs between these two categories, analogous to a work by Diracca and Koenig in [7]. To be precise, we prove the existence of the exact split pairs in $A$-Brauer algebras, cyclotomic Brauer algebras, and walled Brauer algebras with their respective input algebras.</description>

      <title>Generically $\tau$-regular irreducible components of module varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras, the study of projective presentations of maximal rank is closely related to the study of generically $\tau$-regular irreducible components of varieties of modules over such algebras. We show that a module is $\tau$-regular if and only if its minimal projective presentation is of maximal rank. This is a refinement of a theorem by Plamondon. We prove that generic extensions of generically $\tau$-regular components by simple projective modules are again generically $\tau$-regular. This leads to the classification of all generically $\tau$-regular components for triangular algebras. We also show that an algebra is hereditary if and only if all irreducible components of its varieties of modules are generically $\tau$-regular. Finally, we discuss when the set of generically $\tau$-regular components coincides with the set of generically $\tau^-$-regular components.</description>

      <title>Ribbon blocks for centraliser algebras of symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $l,m$ are natural numbers with $l\le m$, and $\mathbb{F}$ a field of characteristic $p$, and let $\mathcal{C}_{l,m}^{\mathbb{F}}$ denote the centraliser of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}S_l$ inside $\mathbb{F}S_m$. Ellers and Murray give a conjectured classification of the blocks of $\mathcal{C}_{l,m}^{\mathbb{F}}$, in terms of the $p$-blocks of $S_l$ and $S_m$. We prove this conjecture for a family of blocks that we call ribbon blocks and belt blocks. These are the blocks containing Specht modules labelled by skew partitions having no repeated entries in their $p$-content.</description>

      <title>Vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quasimap vertex functions of type $D$ Nakajima quiver varieties. When the quiver varieties have isolated torus fixed points, we compute the coefficients of the vertex functions in the $K$-theoretic fixed point basis. We also give an explicit combinatorial description of zero-dimensional type $D$ quiver varieties and their vertex functions using the combinatorics of minuscule posets. Using Macdonald polynomials, we prove that these vertex functions can be expressed as products of $q$-binomial functions, which proves a degeneration of the conjectured 3d mirror symmetry of vertex functions. We provide an interpretation of type $D$ spin vertex functions as the partition functions of the half-space Macdonald processes of Barraquand, Borodin, and Corwin. This hints that the geometry of quiver varieties may provide new examples of integrable probabilistic models.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to the Representation Theory of Lorentzian Pseudo-Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel approach to the finite dimensional representation theory of the entire Lorentz group $\operatorname{O}(1,3)$ is presented. It is shown that the entire Lorentz group may be understood as a semi-direct product between the identity component of the entire Lorentz group, and the Klein four group of reflections: $\operatorname{O}(1,3) = \operatorname{SO}^+(1,3) \rtimes \operatorname{K}_4$. The discussion concludes with the convenient representation theory of generic tensor representations of $\operatorname{O}(1,3)$, namely that there are four physically meaningful representations of $\operatorname{O}(1,3)$ for each representation of $\operatorname{SO}^+(1,3)$. There is a brief discussion of the time reversal of the electromagnetic field, concluding in agreement with standard texts such as Jackson, and works by Malament.</description>

      <title>Classifying thick subcategories over a Koszul complex via the curved BGG correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we classify the thick subcategories of the bounded derived category of dg modules over a Koszul complex on any list of elements in a regular ring. This simultaneously recovers a theorem of Stevenson when the list of elements is a regular sequence and the classification of thick subcategories for an exterior algebra over a field (via the BGG correspondence). One of the major ingredients is a classification of thick tensor submodules of perfect curved dg modules over a commutative noetherian graded ring concentrated in even degrees, recovering a theorem of Hopkins and Neeman. We give several consequences of the classification result over a Koszul complex, one being that the lattice of thick subcategories of the bounded derived category is fixed by Grothendieck duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an elliptic avatar of loop spaces in derived algebraic geometry, completing the familiar trichotomoy of rational, trigonometric and elliptic objects. Heuristically, the elliptic loop space of $\mathcal{Y}$ is the stack of maps to $\mathcal{Y}$ from a certain exotic avatar $\mathcal{S}_{E}$ of the elliptic curve $E$, such that the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on $\mathcal{S}_{E}$ is the convolution category of zero-dimensionally supported coherent sheaves on $E$. For quotient stacks, the structure sheaf of the elliptic loop space gives rise to a theory of equivariant elliptic Hodge cohomology.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Donaldson-Thomas theory. I. Component lattices of stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first paper in a series on intrinsic Donaldson-Thomas theory, a generalization of Donaldson-Thomas theory from the linear case, or the case of moduli stacks of objects in $3$-Calabi-Yau abelian categories, to the non-linear case of general $(-1)$-shifted symplectic stacks. This is done by developing a new framework for studying the enumerative geometry of general algebraic stacks, and we expect that this framework can also be applied to extending other types of enumerative theories for linear stacks to the non-linear case.
  In this paper, we establish the foundations of our framework. We introduce the component lattice of an algebraic stack, which is the key combinatorial object in our theory. It generalizes and globalizes the cocharacter lattice and the Weyl group of an algebraic group, and is defined as the set of connected components of the stack of graded points of the original stack.
  We prove several results on the structure of graded and filtered points of a stack using the component lattice. The first is the constancy theorem, which states that there is a wall-and-chamber structure on the component lattice, such that the isomorphism types of connected components of the stacks of graded and filtered points stay constant within each chamber. The second is the finiteness theorem, providing a criterion for the finiteness of the number of possible isomorphism types of these components. The third is the associativity theorem, generalizing the structure of Hall algebras from linear stacks to general stacks, involving a notion of Hall categories.
  Finally, we discuss some applications of these results outside Donaldson-Thomas theory, including a construction of stacks of real-weighted filtrations, and a generalization of the semistable reduction theorem to real-weighted filtrations.</description>

      <title>Bratteli networks and the Spectral Action on quivers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of noncommutative geometry, we consider quiver representations -- not on vector spaces, as traditional, but on finite-dimensional prespectral triples (`discrete topological noncommutative spaces'). A similar idea appeared in the original work of Marcolli-van Suijlekom on quiver representations in spectral triples (`discrete noncommutative geometries'), which paved the way for some of our results in independent directions. We introduce Bratteli networks, a structure that yields a neat combinatorial characterisation of the space $\mathrm{Rep}~Q$ of prespectral-triple-representations of a quiver $\mathrm{Rep}~Q$, as well as of the gauge group and of their quotient. Not only these claims that make it possible to `integrate over $\mathrm{Rep}~Q$' are, as we now argue, in line with the spirit of random noncommutative geometry -- formulating path integrals over Dirac operators -- but they also contain a physically relevant case. Namely, the equivalence between quiver representations and path algebra modules, established here for the new category, inspired the following construction: Only from representation theory data, we build a spectral triple for the quiver and evaluate the spectral action functional from a general formula over closed paths. When we apply this construction to lattice-quivers, we obtain not only Wilsonian Yang-Mills lattice gauge theory, but also the Weisz-Wohlert-cells in the context of Symanzik's improved gauge theory. We show that a hermitian (`Higgs') matrix field emerges from the self-loops of the quiver and derive the Yang-Mills--Higgs theory on flat space as a smooth limit.</description>

      <title>Quasi-integrable modules over affine Lie superalgebras (Critical level)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representation theory of Lie (super)algebras has garnered significant research attention over many years, specially due to its applications in theoretical physics; in this regard, representation theory of affine Lie (super)algebras is of great importance.
  To characterize simple modules over affine Lie (super)algebras, we need to address the cases of nonzero and critical level separately. Although a vast amount of research exists on the representation theory of affine Lie (super)algebras, investigations regarding general modules at the critical level are few.
  In the current paper, we focus on twisted affine Lie superalgebras {$\LL$} ($\LL_1\neq \{0\}$).
  The even part of almost all such {$\LL$}'s contains two affine Lie algebras and in turn, the behavior of the restricted modules corresponding to these affine components and their interactions play important roles in characterizing simple $\LL$-modules. In this paper, we deal with $\LL$-modules, at the critical level, for which only one of the restricted modules corresponding to the affine components of {$\LL_0$}, is integrable. The results are important from two perspectives: first, we provide a characterization of a class of modules at the critical level and second, we will use this to characterize general modules at the critical level.</description>

Abstract: From the perspective of $\tau$-tilting theory, we study Frobenius--Perron dimensions of finite-dimensional algebras. First, we evaluate the Frobenius--Perron dimensions of $\tau$-tilting finite algebras by a combinatorial method in $\tau$-tilting theory. Secondly, we give the upper bound for the Frobenius--Perron dimension for $\tau$-tilting finite algebras of tame representation type. Thirdly, we determine the Frobenius--Perron dimensions of Nakayama algebras and generalized preprojective algebras of Dynkin type in the sense of Geiss--Leclerc--Schr\"oer.</description>

      <title>Connected components of the space of triples of transverse partial flags in $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ and Anosov representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We count the number of connected components in the space of triples of transverse flags in any flag manifold of $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$. We compute the effect the involution of the unipotent radical has on those components and deduce that for certain parabolic subgroups $P_{\Theta}$, any $P_{\Theta}$-Anosov subgroup is virtually isomorphic to either a surface group of a free group. We give examples of Anosov subgroups which are neither free nor surface groups for some sets of roots which do not fall under the previous results. As a consequence of the methods developed here, we get an explicit algorithm based on computation of minors to check if a unipotent matrix in $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ belong to the $\Theta$-positive semigroup $U_\Theta^{&gt;0}$ when $p\neq q$.</description>
