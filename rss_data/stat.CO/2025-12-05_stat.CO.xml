      <title>A Benchmark Study of Classical and Dual Polynomial Regression (DPR)-Based Probability Density Estimation Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability density function (PDF) plays a central role in statistical and machine learning modeling. Real-world data often deviates from Gaussian assumptions, exhibiting skewness and exponential decay. To evaluate how well different density estimation methods capture such irregularities, we generated six unimodal datasets from diverse distributions that reflect real-world anomalies. These were compared using parametric methods (Pearson Type I and Normal distribution) as well as non-parametric approaches, including histograms, kernel density estimation (KDE), and our proposed method. To accelerate computation, we implemented GPU-based versions of KDE (tKDE) and histogram estimation (tHDE) in TensorFlow, both of which outperform Python SciPy's KDE. Prior work demonstrated the use of piecewise modeling for density estimation, such as local polynomial regression; however, these methods are computationally intensive. Based on the concept of piecewise modeling, we developed a computationally efficient model, the Dual Polynomial Regression (DPR) method, which leverages tKDE or tHDE for training. DPR employs the piecewise strategy to split the PDF at its mode and fit polynomial regressions to the left and right halves independently, enabling better capture of the asymmetric shape of the unimodal distribution. We used the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), and Pearson's correlation coefficient, with reference to the baseline PDF, to validate accuracy. We verified normalization using Area Under the Curve (AUC) and computational overhead via execution time. Validation on real-world systolic and diastolic data from 300,000 unique patients shows that the DPR of order 4, trained with tKDE, offers the best balance between accuracy and computational overhead.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Retrieval of Atmospheric Boundary Layers with Nonstationary Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) plays a critical role in governing turbulent exchanges of momentum, heat moisture, and trace gases between the Earth's surface and the free atmosphere, thereby influencing meteorological phenomena, air quality, and climate processes. Accurate and temporally continuous characterization of the ABL structure and height evolution is crucial for both scientific understanding and practical applications. High-resolution retrievals of the ABL height from vertical velocity measurements is challenging because it is often estimated using empirical thresholds applied to profiles of vertical velocity variance or related turbulence diagnostics at each measurement altitude, which can suffer from limited sampling and sensitivity to noise. To address these limitations, this work employs nonstationary Gaussian process (GP) modeling to more effectively capture the spatio-temporal dependence structure in the data, enabling high-quality -- and, if desired, high-resolution -- estimates of the ABL height without reliance on ad-hoc parameter tuning. By leveraging Vecchia approximations, the proposed method can be applied to large-scale datasets, and example applications using full-day vertical velocity profiles comprising approximately $5$M measurements are presented.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes on High Dimensional Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These lecture notes cover advanced topics in linear regression, with an in-depth exploration of the existence, uniqueness, relations, computation, and non-asymptotic properties of the most prominent estimators in this setting. The covered estimators include least squares, ridgeless, ridge, and lasso. The content follows a proposition-proof structure, making it suitable for students seeking a formal and rigorous understanding of the statistical theory underlying machine learning methods.</description>
