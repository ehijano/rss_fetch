      <title>Uncertainty quantification for $\mu \to e$ conversion in nuclei: charge distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the rate for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei for a given set of effective operators mediating the violation of lepton flavor symmetry crucially depends on hadronic and nuclear matrix elements. In particular, the uncertainties inherent in this non-perturbative input limit the discriminating power that can be achieved among operators by studying different target isotopes. In order to quantify the associated uncertainties, as a first step, we go back to nuclear charge densities and propagate the uncertainties from electron scattering data for a range of isotopes relevant for $\mu\to e$ conversion in nuclei, including $^{40,48}$Ca, $^{48,50}$Ti, and $^{27}$Al. We provide as central results Fourier-Bessel expansions of the corresponding charge distributions with complete covariance matrices, accounting for Coulomb-distortion effects in a self-consistent manner throughout the calculation. As an application, we evaluate the overlap integrals for $\mu\to e$ conversion mediated by dipole operators. In combination with modern ab-initio methods, our results will allow for the evaluation of general $\mu\to e$ conversion rates with quantified uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference of nuclear incompressibility from proton elliptic flow in central Au+Au collisions at 400 MeV/nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The incompressibility $K$ of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) is inferred in a Bayesian analysis of proton elliptic flow in mid-central Au + Au collisions at $E = 400$ MeV/nucleon using a Gaussian process (GP) emulator of the isospin-dependent quantum molecular dynamics (IQMD) model for heavy-ion collisions, with or without considering the momentum dependence of single-nucleon potentials. Consistent but with smaller quantified uncertainties than previous results from forward modeling of the collective flow in heavy-ion collisions using IQMD, considering the momentum dependence of nucleon potentials, $K=191.3^{+3.7}_{-6.3}$ MeV at 68\% confidence level, indicating a very soft SNM equation of state, is inferred from the combined data of the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the proton elliptic flow in the Au+Au collisions considered. Ignoring the momentum dependence of single-nucleon potentials, the extracted value for $K$ is $234.7^{+14.6}_{-11.4}$ MeV, in agreement with its fiducial value derived from giant resonance studies.</description>

      <title>Impact of the nuclear equation of state on the formation of twin stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twin stars-two stable neutron stars (NSs) with the same mass but different radii have long been proposed to appear as a consequence of a possible first-order phase transition in NS matter. Within a meta-model for the EOS of hybrid stars, we revisit the viability of twin stars and its dependence on numerous parameters characterizing the EOS of nuclear matter, quark matter, and the phase transition between them. While essentially no experimental constraint exists for the last two, parameters characterizing the EOS of neutron-rich nucleonic matter have been constrained within various ranges by terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations. Within these ranges, the impact of nuclear EOS on the formation of twin stars is studied. It is found that the symmetry energy of neutron-rich nucleonic matter notably influences the formation of twin stars, particularly through its slope $L$ and curvature $K_{\rm sym}$. Conversely, the EOS of symmetric nuclear matter shows minimal influence on the formation of twin stars, partially owing to its relatively well-constrained parameters.</description>

      <title>Double-pion electroproduction off protons in deuterium: Quasifree cross sections and final-state interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13962v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The single-differential and fully integrated cross sections for quasifree $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ electroproduction off protons bound in deuterium have been extracted for the first time. The experimental data were collected at Jefferson Laboratory with the CLAS detector. The measurements were performed in the kinematic region of the invariant mass $W$ from 1.3 to 1.825 GeV and the photon virtuality $Q^{2}$ from 0.4 to 1.0 GeV$^2$. Sufficient experimental statistics allowed for narrow binning in all kinematic variables, while maintaining a small statistical uncertainty. The extracted cross sections were compared with the corresponding cross sections off free protons, which allowed us to obtain an estimate of the contribution from events in which interactions between the final-state hadrons and the spectator neutron took place.</description>

      <title>Impact of two-body currents on magnetic dipole moments of nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14383v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of two-body currents on magnetic dipole moments of medium-mass and heavy nuclei using the valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group with chiral effective field theory interactions and currents. Focusing on near doubly magic nuclei from oxygen to bismuth, we have found that the leading two-body currents globally improve the agreement with experimental magnetic moments. Moreover, our results show the importance of multi-shell effects for $^{41}$Ca, which suggest that the $Z=N=20$ gap in $^{40}$Ca is not as robust as in $^{48}$Ca. The increasing contribution of two-body currents in heavier systems is explained by the operator structure of the center-of-mass dependent Sachs term.</description>

      <title>Muon Capture on $^{6}$Li, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O from $Ab~Initio$ Nuclear Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Muon capture on nuclei is one of the most promising probes of the nuclear electroweak current driving the yet-hypothetical neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. Both processes involve vector and axial-vector currents at finite momentum transfer, $q\sim 100$ MeV, as well as the induced pseudoscalar and weak-magnetism currents. Comparing measured muon-capture rates with reliable $ab~initio$ nuclear-theory predictions could help us validate these currents. To this end, we compute partial muon-capture rates for $^{6}$Li, $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O, feeding the ground and excited states in $^{6}$He, $^{12}$B and $^{16}$N, using $ab~initio$ no-core shell model with two- and three-nucleon chiral interactions. We remove the spurious center-of-mass motion by introducing translationally invariant operators and approximate the effect of hadronic two-body currents by Fermi-gas model. We solve the bound-muon wave function from the Dirac wave equations in the Coulomb field created by a finite nucleus. We find that the computed rates to the low-lying states in the final nuclei are in good agreement with the measured counterparts. We highlight sensitivity of some of the transitions to the sub-leading three-nucleon interaction terms. We also compare summed rates to several tens of final states with the measured total capture rates and note that we slightly underestimate the total rate with this simple approach due to limited range of excitation energies.</description>

      <title>Injection and capture of antiprotons in a Penning-Malmberg trap using a drift tube accelerator and degrader foil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Antiproton Decelerator (AD) at CERN provides antiproton bunches with a kinetic energy of 5.3 MeV. The Extra-Low ENergy Antiproton ring at CERN, commissioned at the AD in 2018, now supplies a bunch of electron-cooled antiprotons at a fixed energy of 100 keV. The MUSASHI antiproton trap was upgraded by replacing the radio-frequency quadrupole decelerator with a pulsed drift tube to re-accelerate antiprotons and optimize the injection energy into the degrader foils. By increasing the beam energy to 119 keV, a cooled antiproton accumulation efficiency of (26 +- 6)% was achieved.</description>

      <title>Recent Neutrino Oscillation Parameters Impact on the Effective Majorana Neutrino Mass in 0$\nu\beta\beta$ Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how recent updates to neutrino oscillation parameters and the sum of neutrino masses influence the sensitivity of neutrinoless double-beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments. Incorporating the latest cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses and laboratory measurements on oscillations, we determine the sum of neutrino masses for both the normal hierarchy (NH) and the inverted hierarchy (IH). Our analysis reveals a narrow range for the sum of neutrino masses, approximately 0.06 eV/c$^2$ for NH and 0.102 eV/c$^2$ for IH. Utilizing these constraints, we calculate the effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH scenarios, establishing the corresponding allowed regions. Importantly, we find that the minimum neutrino mass is non-zero, as constrained by the current oscillation parameters. Additionally, we estimate the half-life of 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay using these effective Majorana masses for both NH and IH. Our results suggest that upcoming ton-scale experiments will comprehensively explore the IH scenario, while 100-ton-scale experiments will effectively probe the parameter space for the NH scenario, provided the background index can achieve 1 event/kton-year in the region of interest.</description>
