      <title>Uniaxial stress effect on the electronic structure of quantum materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uniaxial stress has proven to be a powerful experimental tuning parameter for effectively controlling lattice, charge, orbital, and spin degrees of freedom in quantum materials. In addition, its ability to manipulate the symmetry of materials has garnered significant attention. Recent technical progress to combine uniaxial stress cells with quantum oscillation and angle-resolved photoemission techniques allowed to study the electronic structure as function of uniaxial stress. This review provides an overview on experimental advancements in methods and examines studies on diverse quantum materials, encompassing the semimetal WTe2, the unconventional superconductor Sr2RuO4, Fe-based superconductors, and topological materials.</description>

      <title>Polarons in the Cubic Generalized Fr\"ohlich Model: Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the variational polaron equation framework, the Fr\"ohlich model for cubic systems with three-fold degenerate electronic bands is numerically solved in the strong coupling regime, for a wide range of its input parameters. By comparing the results to the previously reported ones obtained with the Gaussian Ansatz approach, the inadequacy of the latter is uncovered, especially when degenerate bands are present in a system. Moreover, the symmetry groups of polaronic solutions in the cubic generalized Fr\"ohlich model without spin-orbit coupling are investigated: we provide and discuss a phase diagram of symmetry groups of ground-state polarons, showing spontaneous symmetry breaking. While the cubic symmetry of the three-band degenerate model Hamiltonian corresponds to the full octahedral group $O_h$, lowest-energy polarons possess either $D_{4h}$ or $D_{3d}$ point groups. This phase diagram bears some similarities but differs nevertheless from the one that is obtained by the straight analysis of the band effective masses. The obtained results will provide a firm ground for further exploration of the generalized Fr\"ohlich model and will likely be applicable beyond the model's inherent approximations.</description>

      <title>Theory of nonlinear terahertz susceptibility in ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytical theory is developed for predicting the nonlinear susceptibility of ionic polarization to continuous electromagnetic waves in both bulk and strained thin film ferroelectrics. Using a perturbation method for solving the nonlinear equation of motion for ionic polarization within the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, the full second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor is derived as a function of frequency, temperature, and strain. The theory predicts the coexistence of a significantly enhanced second-order dielectric susceptibility and a relatively low dielectric loss in BaTiO3 films with a strain-stabilized monoclinic ferroelectric phase and in a strained SrTiO3 film near its temperature-driven second-order ferroelectric-to-paraelectric phase transition. This work establishes a theoretical framework for predicting and exploiting nonlinear interactions between THz waves and ferroelectric materials, and more generally, suggests exciting opportunities to strain-engineer nonlinear dynamical properties of ferroelectrics beyond the static and quasi-static limits.</description>

      <title>Large anomalous Nernst effect in the ferromagnetic Fe3Si polycrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-throughput calculation predicts that the Fe-based cubic ferromagnet Fe$_3$Si may exhibit a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE). Here, we report our experimental observation of the large Nernst coefficient $S_{yx}\sim$2 $\mu$V/K and the transverse thermoelectric coefficient $-\alpha_{yx}$ $\sim$ 3 Am$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ for Fe$_3$Si polycrystal at room temperature. The large $-\alpha_{yx}$ indicates that the large ANE originates from the intrinsic Berry curvature mechanism. The high Curie temperature of 840 K and the most abundant raw elements of Fe and Si make Fe$_3$Si a competitive candidate for Nernst thermoelectric generations.</description>

      <title>Strategy for Direct Detection of Chiral Phonons with Phase-Structured Free Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral phonons possessing valley pseudo angular momentum (PAM) underlie a diversity of quantum phenomena of fundamental and applied importance, but are challenging to probe directly. We show that deficiencies of typical momentum-resolved electron energy loss measurements that make it impossible to distinguish the PAM of chiral phonons can be overcome by introducing pinwheel free electron states with well-defined PAM. Transitions between such states generate 2D periodic arrays of in-plane field vortices with polarization textures tailored to selectively couple to desired chiral mode symmetries.</description>

      <title>Imaging thermally fluctuating N\`eel vectors in van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying antiferromagnetic domains is essential for fundamental physics and potential spintronics applications. Despite its importance, few systematic studies have been performed on van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnets (AFMs) domains with high spatial resolutions, and direct probing of the N\`eel vectors remains challenging. In this work, we found a multidomain in vdW AFM NiPS3, a material extensively investigated for its exotic magnetic exciton. We employed photoemission electron microscopy combined with the X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD-PEEM) to image the NiPS3's magnetic structure. The nanometer-spatial resolution of XMLD-PEEM allows us to determine local N\`eel vector orientations and discover thermally fluctuating N\'eel vectors that are independent of the crystal symmetry even at 65 K, well below TN of 155 K. We demonstrate a Ni ions' small in-plane orbital moment anisotropy is responsible for the weak magneto-crystalline anisotropy. The observed multidomain's thermal fluctuations may explain the broadening of magnetic exciton peaks at higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Spectral Features of the Fourth Order Irreducible Correlations in a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding high-order correlations or multi-particle entities in a many-body system is not only of fundamental importance in condensed matter physics, but also critical for many technological applications. So far, higher-order multi-particle irreducible correlations in semiconductors have not been studied beyond the second-order or two-particle case. In this paper, we study the correlation of two electrons and two holes (2e2h) using the four-body Bethe-Salpeter equation (4B-BSE) and applied to the calculation of the helicity-resolved absorption between the two-body and four-body states for a monolayer MoTe2. Surprisingly, we found a rich series of spectral peaks within an energy span of ~40 meV below the exciton that has not been seen before. To understand the origin of the new spectral peaks, the Feynman diagrams of the 4B BSE are recast into the cluster expansion formalism, allowing us to study the individual effects of selected clusters or correlations of various orders. We found that the irreducible clusters of orders up to the 3rd and their factorized combinations cannot explain the spectral features. Importantly, we found that the 4th order irreducible correlation is necessary and sufficient to explain the new features. The 4th order irreducible correlation corresponds to a four-particle irreducible cluster involving two electrons and two holes, alternatively called quadron or quadruplon. The new 4th order correlation or four-particle entity not only enriches our understanding of many-body correlations but also could provide new mechanism for light emission or absorption for possible new optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>A compact, portable device for microscopic magnetic imaging based on diamond quantum sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic imaging based on ensembles of diamond nitrogen-vacancy quantum sensors has emerged as a useful technique for the spatial characterisation of magnetic materials and current distributions. However, demonstrations have so far been restricted to laboratory-based experiments using relatively bulky apparatus and requiring manual handling of the diamond sensing element, hampering broader adoption of the technique. Here we present a simple, compact device that can be deployed outside a laboratory environment and enables robust, simplified operation. It relies on a specially designed sensor head that directly integrates the diamond sensor while incorporating a microwave antenna and all necessary optical components. This integrated sensor head is complemented by a small control unit and a laptop computer that displays the resulting magnetic image. We test the device by imaging a magnetic sample, demonstrating a spatial resolution of 4 $\mu$m over a field of view exceeding 1 mm, and a best sensitivity of 45 $\mu$T/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ per ($5\,\mu$m)$^2$ pixel. Our portable magnetic imaging instrument may find use in situations where taking the sample to be measured to a specialist lab is impractical or undesirable.</description>

      <title>Digital Dark Field -- Higher Signal to Noise and Greater Specificity Dark Field Imaging using a 4DSTEM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method for dark field imaging is introduced which uses scanned electron diffraction (or 4DSTEM - 4-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy datasets) as its input. Instead of working on simple summation of intensity, it works on a sparse representation of the diffraction patterns in terms of a list of their diffraction peaks. This is tested on a thin perovskite film containing structural ordering resulting in additional superlattice spots that reveal details of domain structures, and is shown to give much better selectivity and contrast than conventional virtual dark field imaging. It is also shown to work well in polycrystalline aggregates of CuO nanoparticles. In view of the higher contrast and selectivity, and the complete exclusion of diffuse scattering from the image formation, it is expected to be of significant benefit for characterisation of a wide variety of crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Cu$_x$Al$_{1-x}$ films as Alternatives to Copper for Advanced Interconnect Metallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cu$_x$Al$_{1-x}$ thin films with $0.2 \le x \le 0.7$ have been studied as potential alternatives for the metallization of advanced interconnects. First-principles simulations were used to obtain the Cu$_x$Al$_{1-x}$ electronic structure and cohesive energy to benchmark different intermetallics and their prospects for interconnect metallization. Next, thin Cu$_x$Al$_{1-x}$ films were deposited by PVD with thicknesses in the range between 3 and 28 nm. The lowest resistivities of 9.5 $\mu\Omega$cm were obtained for 28 nm thick stochiometric CuAl and CuAl$_2$ after 400$^\circ$C post-deposition annealing. Based on the experimental results, we discuss the main challenges for the studied aluminides from an interconnect point of view, namely the control of the film stoichiometry, the phase separation observed for off-stoichiometric CuAl and CuAl$_2$, as well as the presence of a nonstoichiometric surface oxide.</description>

      <title>CatTSunami: Accelerating Transition State Energy Calculations with Pre-trained Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct access to transition state energies at low computational cost unlocks the possibility of accelerating catalyst discovery. We show that the top performing graph neural network potential trained on the OC20 dataset, a related but different task, is able to find transition states energetically similar (within 0.1 eV) to density functional theory (DFT) 91% of the time with a 28x speedup. This speaks to the generalizability of the models, having never been explicitly trained on reactions, the machine learned potential approximates the potential energy surface well enough to be performant for this auxiliary task. We introduce the Open Catalyst 2020 Nudged Elastic Band (OC20NEB) dataset, which is made of 932 DFT nudged elastic band calculations, to benchmark machine learned model performance on transition state energies. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we replicated a well-known, large reaction network with 61 intermediates and 174 dissociation reactions at DFT resolution (40 meV). In this case of dense NEB enumeration, we realize even more computational cost savings and used just 12 GPU days of compute, where DFT would have taken 52 GPU years, a 1500x speedup. Similar searches for complete reaction networks could become routine using the approach presented here. Finally, we replicated an ammonia synthesis activity volcano and systematically found lower energy configurations of the transition states and intermediates on six stepped unary surfaces. This scalable approach offers a more complete treatment of configurational space to improve and accelerate catalyst discovery.</description>

      <title>Piezoresistivity as an Order Parameter for Ferroaxial Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in the understanding of the collective behavior of electrons and ions have revealed new types of ferroic orders beyond ferroelectricity and ferromagnetism, such as the ferroaxial state. The latter retains only rotational symmetry around a single axis and reflection symmetry with respect to a single mirror plane, both of which are set by an emergent electric toroidal dipole moment. Due to this unusual symmetry-breaking pattern, it has been challenging to directly measure the ferroaxial order parameter, despite the increasing attention this state has drawn. Here, we show that off-diagonal components of the piezoresistivity tensor (i.e., the linear change in resistivity under strain) transform the same way as the ferroaxial moments, providing a direct probe of such order parameters. We identify two new proper ferroaxial materials through a materials database search, and use first-principles calculations to evaluate the piezoconductivity of the double-perovskite CaSnF$_6$, revealing its connection to ferroaxial order and to octahedral rotation modes.</description>

      <title>Influence of Polymer on Shock-Induced Pore Collapse: Hotspot Criticality through Reactive Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shock initiation of energetic materials is mediated by the localization of mechanical energy into hotspots. These originate through the interaction of the shock and material microstructure; the most potent hotspots are formed by the collapse of porosity. Recent work using molecular dynamics (MD) has shed light on the molecular mechanisms responsible for the shock-to-deflagration transition following pore collapse in pure energetic materials. However, explosive formulations are composites of energetic crystals and a polymer binder, which differs from the prior focus on pure materials. The role of polymer phases on hotspot formation and its criticality is not well-understood. We use reactive MD simulations to investigate the role of polystyrene and polyvinyl nitrate films around pores in the shock-induced pore collapse of RDX. The polymer affects the hotspots' temperature and their criticality. While the presence of inert polymer often delays or hinders chemical reactions of the energetic material, certain geometries accelerate chemistry. The simulations provide a mechanistic understanding of these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Electron Drag Effect on Thermal Conductivity in Two-dimensional Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have shown great potential in applications as transistors, where thermal dissipation becomes crucial because of the increasing energy density. Although thermal conductivity of 2D materials has been extensively studied, interactions between nonequilibrium electrons and phonons, which can be strong when high electric fields and heat current coexist, are not considered. In this work, we systematically study the electron drag effect, where nonequilibrium electrons impart momenta to phonons and influence the thermal conductivity, in 2D semiconductors using ab initio simulations. We find that, at room temperature, electron drag can significantly increase thermal conductivity by decreasing phonon-electron scattering in 2D semiconductors, while its impact in three-dimensional (3D) semiconductors is negligible. We attribute this difference to the large electron-phonon scattering phase space and higher contribution to thermal conductivity by drag-active phonons. Our work elucidates the fundamental physics underlying coupled electron-phonon transport in materials of various dimensionalities.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We increase the dynamical range of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) by actively subtracting dominant current-harmonics generated by nonlinearities in the current-voltage characteristics that could saturate the current preamplifier at low junction impedances or high gains. The strict phase relationship between a cosinusoidal excitation voltage and the current-harmonics allows excellent cancellation using the displacement-current of a driven compensating capacitor placed at the input of the preamplifier. Removal of DC currents has no effect on, and removal of the first harmonic only leads to a rigid shift in conductivity that can be numerically reversed by adding the known removal current. Our method requires no permanent change of the hardware but only two phase synchronized voltage sources and a multi-frequency lock-in amplifier to enable high dynamic range spectroscopy and imaging.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic resonance response in square artificial spin ice: roles of geometry in vertex dynamics and magnetic configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial spin ice (ASI) represents a class of uniquely structured superlattices comprising geometrically arranged interacting nanomagnets. This arrangement facilitates the exploration of magnetic frustration phenomena and related spin wave dynamics, contributing to the field of magnonics. In this work, we present a compressive study of spin wave dynamics in square ASI lattices using micromagnetic simulations, explicitly focusing on ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and oscillation modes. We investigate how variations in the aspect ratio of nanomagnets dimensions influence magnetic excitations in both saturated and remanent states. We analyze the frequency variations of FMR peaks corresponding to edges and bulk oscillation modes in relation to both magnetic configuration and nanomagnets dimensions. We emphasize the remanent state of square ASI vertex configurations, particularly focusing on their characteristic energy states (Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV), while detailing how symmetries influence oscillation modes. We observe distinct FMR responses originating from vertices, exhibiting unique characteristics for each energy state. Our results offer a potential method of utilizing the FMR technique to identify energy states in ASI systems.</description>

      <title>Mori generalized master equations offer an efficient route to predict and interpret transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting how a material's microscopic structure and dynamics determine its transport properties remains a fundamental challenge. To alleviate this task's often prohibitive computational expense, we propose a Mori-based generalized quantum master equation (GQME) to predict the frequency-resolved conductivity of small-polaron forming systems described by the dispersive Holstein model. Unlike previous GQME-based approaches to transport that scale with the system size and only give access to the DC conductivity, our method requires only one calculation and yields both the DC and AC mobilities. We further show to easily augment our GQME with numerically accessible derivatives of the current to increase computational efficiency, collectively offering computational cost reductions of up to $90\%$, depending on the transport regime. Finally, we leverage our exact simulations to demonstrate the limited applicability of the celebrated and widely invoked Drude-Smith model in small-polaron forming systems. We instead introduce a cumulant-based analysis of experimentally accessible frequency data to infer the microscopic Hamiltonian parameters. This approach promises to provide valuable insights into material properties and facilitate guided design by linking macroscopic terahertz measurements to the microscopic details of small polaron-forming systems.</description>

      <title>3-center and 4-center 2-particle Gaussian AO integrals on modern accelerated processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an implementation of the McMurchie-Davidson (MD) algorithm for 3-center and 4-center 2-particle integrals over Gaussian atomic orbitals (AOs) with low and high angular momenta $l$ and varying degrees of contraction for graphical processing units (GPUs). This work builds upon our recent implementation of a matrix form of the MD algorithm that is efficient for GPU evaluation of 4-center 2-particle integrals over Gaussian AOs of high angular momenta ($l\geq 4$) [$\mathit{J. Phys. Chem. A}\ \mathbf{127}$, 10889 (2023)]. The use of unconventional data layouts and three variants of the MD algorithm allow to evaluate integrals in double precision with sustained performance between 25% and 70% of the theoretical hardware peak. Performance assessment includes integrals over AOs with $l\leq 6$ (higher $l$ is supported). Preliminary implementation of the Hartree-Fock exchange operator is presented and assessed for computations with up to quadruple-zeta basis and more than 20,000 AOs. The corresponding C++ code is a part of the experimental open-source $\mathtt{LibintX}$ library available at $\mathbf{github.com:ValeevGroup/LibintX}$.</description>

      <title>Polaritonic Fourier crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polaritonic crystals - periodic structures where the hybrid light-matter waves called polaritons can form Bloch states - promise a deeply subdiffractional nanolight manipulation and enhanced light-matter interaction. In particular, polaritons in van der Waals materials boast extreme field confinement and long lifetimes allowing for the exploitation of wave phenomena at the nanoscale. However, in conventionally patterned nanostructures, polaritons are prone to severe scattering loss at the sharp material edges, making it challenging to create functional polaritonic crystals. Here, we introduce a new concept of a polaritonic Fourier crystal based on a harmonic modulation of the polariton momentum in a pristine polaritonic waveguide with minimal scattering. We employ hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and near-field imaging to reveal a neat and well-defined band structure of phonon-polaritons in the Fourier crystal, stemming from the dominant excitation of the first-order Bloch mode. Furthermore, we show that the fundamental Bloch mode possesses a polaritonic bandgap even in the relatively lossy naturally abundant hBN. Thus, our work provides a new paradigm for polaritonic crystals essential for enhanced light-matter interaction, dispersion engineering, and nanolight guiding.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Configurational Spectral Splitting between Trion and Charged Exciton in a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body electron-hole complexes in a semiconductor are important both from a fundamental physics point of view and for practical device applications. A three-body system of electrons (e) and holes (h) (2e1h, or 1e2h) in a two-band semiconductor is commonly believed to be associated with two spectral peaks for the exciton and trion (or charged exciton), respectively. But both the validity of this understanding and the physical meaning of a trion or charged exciton have not been thoroughly examined. From the physics point of view, there are two different configurations, (e)(eh) or (eeh), which could be considered charged exciton and trion, respectively. Here (...) represents an irreducible cluster with respect to Coulomb interactions. In this paper, we consider these issues related to the 2e1h three-body problem theoretically and experimentally using monolayer MoTe2 as an example. Our theoretical tools involve the three-body Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE) and the cluster expansion technique, especially their correspondence. Experimentally, we measure the photoluminescence spectrum on a gate-controlled monolayer MoTe2. We found two spectral peaks that are 21 and 4 meV, respectively, below the exciton peak, in contrast to the single "trion" peak from the conventional understanding. We show that, while the three-body BSE in a two-band model can reproduce all spectral features, the cluster-expansion technique shows that the two peaks correspond to the charged exciton (e)(eh) and trion (eeh), respectively. In other words, there is a spectral splitting due to the two different many-body configurations. Furthermore, we find that the trion only exists in the intervalley case, while the charged exciton exists both for the intervalley and intravalley cases.</description>

      <title>All optical control of bubble and skyrmion breathing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the dynamics of topologically protected spin objects by all optical means promises enormous potential for future spintronic applications. Excitation of bubbles and skyrmions in ferrimagnetic [Fe(0.35 nm)/Gd(0.40 nm)]$_{160}$ multilayers by ultrashort laser pulses leads to a periodic modulation of the core diameter of these spin objects, the so-called breathing mode. We demonstrate versatile amplitude and phase control of this breathing using a double excitation scheme, where the observed dynamics is controlled by the excitation delay. We gain insight into both the time scale on which the breathing mode is launched and the role of the spin object size on the dynamics. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast optical excitation allows for precise tuning of the spin dynamics of trivial and non-trivial spin objects, showing a possible control strategy in device applications.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Conducting Boundary Channels in 1T-TaS$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials that transition between metal and insulator, the two opposing states that distinguish all solids, are fascinating because they underlie many mysteries in the physics of the solid state. In 1T-TaS$_{2}$, the metal-insulator transition is linked to a series of metastable states of a chiral charge density wave whose basic nature is still an open question. In this work, we show that pulses of current through these materials create current-carrying boundary channels that distinguish the metallic and insulating states. We demonstrate electrical control of these channels' properties, suggesting their formation could be due to the complex interplay of the formation of domain walls and the viscous flow of electrons. Our findings show that physical boundaries play a key role in the properties of the metastable states of the metal-insulator transition, highlighting new possibilities for in-situ electrical design and active manipulation of electrical components.</description>

      <title>Probing fragile topology with a screw dislocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fragile topology, akin to twisted bilayer graphene and the exotic phases therein, is a notable topological class with intriguing properties. However, due to its unique nature and the lack of bulk-edge correspondence, the experimental signature of fragile topology has been under debated since its birth. Here, we demonstrate experimentally that fragile topological phases with filling anomaly can be probed via screw dislocations, despite that they do not support gapless edge states. Using a designer hexagonal phononic crystal with a fragile topological band gap, we find that 1D gapless bound modes can emerge at a screw dislocation due to the bulk fragile topology. We then establish a connection between our system and the twisted boundary condition via the gauge invariance principle and illustrate that such an emergent phenomenon is an intrinsic property of fragile topological phases with filling anomaly. We observe experimentally the 1D topological bound states using the pump-probe measurements of their dispersion and wavefunctions, which unveils a novel bulk-defect correspondence of fragile topology and a powerful tool for probing fragile topological phases and materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in artificial intelligence and natural language processing has led to the development of large-scale datasets aimed at benchmarking the performance of machine learning models. Herein, we introduce 'RetChemQA,' a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the capabilities of such models in the domain of reticular chemistry. This dataset includes both single-hop and multi-hop question-answer pairs, encompassing approximately 45,000 Q&amp;As for each type. The questions have been extracted from an extensive corpus of literature containing about 2,530 research papers from publishers including NAS, ACS, RSC, Elsevier, and Nature Publishing Group, among others. The dataset has been generated using OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo, a cutting-edge model known for its exceptional language understanding and generation capabilities. In addition to the Q&amp;A dataset, we also release a dataset of synthesis conditions extracted from the corpus of literature used in this study. The aim of RetChemQA is to provide a robust platform for the development and evaluation of advanced machine learning algorithms, particularly for the reticular chemistry community. The dataset is structured to reflect the complexities and nuances of real-world scientific discourse, thereby enabling nuanced performance assessments across a variety of tasks. The dataset is available at the following link: https://github.com/nakulrampal/RetChemQA</description>

Abstract: Version 13 of XtalOpt, an evolutionary algorithm for crystal structure prediction, is now available for download from the CPC program library or the XtalOpt website, https://xtalopt.github.io. In the new version of the XtalOpt code, a general platform for multi-objective global optimization is implemented. This functionality is designed to facilitate the search for (meta)stable phases of functional materials through minimization of the enthalpy of a crystalline system coupled with the simultaneous optimization of any desired properties that are specified by the user. The code is also able to perform a constrained search by filtering the parent pool of structures based on a user-specified feature, while optimizing multiple objectives. Here, we present the implementation and various technical details, and we provide a brief overview of additional improvements that have been introduced in the new version of XtalOpt.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enforced metal-insulator transition and topological adiabatic charge pump in sliding bilayers of threefold symmetric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliding bilayers are systems that exploit the possibility of relatively translating two monolayers along a specific direction in real space, such that different stackings could be implemented in the process. This simple approach allows for manipulating the electronic properties of layered materials similarly as in twisted multilayers. In this work, the sliding of bilayers, composed of one type of monolayer with spatial symmetry described by space group P$\bar{3}1m$ is studied. Using a minimal tight-binding model along with symmetry analysis, we propose two effects that arise in a specific sliding direction. First, the sliding-induced control of the band gap magnitude, which produces a metal-insulator transition, is demonstrated. In addition, the potential to achieve a topological adiabatic charge pump for cyclic sliding is discussed. For each effect, we also present material implementations using first-principles calculations. Bilayer GaS is selected for the metal-insulator transition and bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide ZrS$_2$ is found to display the topological pump effect. Both realizations show good agreement with the predictions of the model.</description>

      <title>Unraveling p-type and n-type interfaces in Superconducting Infinite-Layer Nickelate thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After decades of research, superconductivity was finally found in nickel-based analogs of superconducting cuprates, with infinite-layer (IL) structure. These results are so far restricted to thin films in the case of IL-nickelates. Therefore, the nature of the interface with the substrate, and how it couples with the thin film properties is still an open question. Here, using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)- electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and four-dimensional (4D)-STEM, a novel chemically sharp p-type interface is observed in a series of superconducting IL-praseodymium nickelate samples, and a comparative study is carried out with the previously reported n-type interface obtained in other samples. Both interfaces have strong differences, with the p-type interface being highly polar. In combination with ab-initio calculations, we find that the influence of the interface on the electronic structure is local, and does not extend beyond 2-3 unit cells into the thin film. This decouples the direct influence of the interface in driving the superconductivity, and indicates that the IL-nickelate thin films do not have a universal interface model. Insights into the spatial hole-distribution in SC samples, provided by monochromated EELS and total reflection-hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy, suggest that this particular distribution might be directly influencing superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Local insulator-to-superconductor transition in amorphous InO$_x$ films modulated by e-beam irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method enabling precise post-fabrication modulation of the electrical resistance in micrometer-scale regions of amorphous indium oxide (a-InO$_x$) films. By subjecting initially insulating films to an electron beam at room temperature, we demonstrate that the exposed region of the films becomes superconducting. The resultant superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) is adjustable up to 2.8 K by changing the electron dose and accelerating voltage. This technique offers a compelling alternative to traditional a-InO$_x$ annealing methods for both fundamental investigations and practical applications. Moreover, it empowers independent adjustment of electrical properties across initially identical a-InO$_x$ samples on the same substrate, facilitating the creation of superconducting microstructures with precise $T_c$ control at the micrometer scale. The observed resistance modifications likely stem from photoreduction induced by X-ray and/or UV radiation emitted during electron beam interactions with the film and substrate.</description>

      <title>From STEM-EDXS data to phase separation and quantification using physics-guided NMF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the development of a new algorithm which combines state-of-the-art energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy theory and a suitable machine learning formulation for the hyperspectral unmixing of scanning transmission electron microscope EDX spectrum images. The algorithm is based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) incorporating a physics-guided factorization model. It optimizes a Poisson likelihood, under additional simplex constraint together with user-chosen sparsity-inducing and smoothing regularizations, and is based on iterative multiplicative updates. The fluorescence of X-rays is fully modeled thanks to state-of-the-art theoretical work. It is shown that the output of the algorithm can be used for a direct chemical quantification. With this approach, it is straightforward to include a priori knowledge on the specimen such as the presence or absence of certain chemical elements in some of its phases. This work is implemented within two open-source Python packages, espm and emtables, which are used here for data simulation, data analysis and quantification. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that incorporating physical modeling in the decomposition helps retrieve meaningful components from spatially and spectrally mixed phases, even when the data are very noisy. For synthetic data with a higher signal, the regularizations yield a tenfold increase in the quality of the reconstructed abundance maps compared to standard NMF. Our approach is further validated on experimental data with a known ground truth, where state-of-the art results are achieved by using prior knowledge about the sample. Our model can be generalized to any other scanning spectroscopy techniques where underlying physical modeling can be linearized.</description>

Abstract: We study structurally-triggered metal-insulator transition in CaCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ by means of local density approximation (LDA) +$U$ and LDA+dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The ferrimagnetic insulating phase is essentially the same within both approaches. While LDA+$U$ describes the metal-insulator transition as a Peierls-like instability driven by Fermi surface nesting in the magnetically ordered phase, LDA+DMFT allows also the site-selective Mott transition without magnetic ordering as well as smooth crossover between the two pictures. We point out similarities and differences to rare-earth nickelates.</description>

      <title>Design rules for controlling active topological defects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00666v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological defects play a central role in the physics of many materials, including magnets, superconductors and liquid crystals. In active fluids, defects become autonomous particles that spontaneously propel from internal active stresses and drive chaotic flows stirring the fluid. The intimate connection between defect textures and active flow suggests that properties of active materials can be engineered by controlling defects, but design principles for their spatiotemporal control remain elusive. Here we propose a symmetry-based additive strategy for using elementary activity patterns, as active topological tweezers, to create, move and braid such defects. By combining theory and simulations, we demonstrate how, at the collective level, spatial activity gradients act like electric fields which, when strong enough, induce an inverted topological polarization of defects, akin to a negative susceptibility dielectric. We harness this feature in a dynamic setting to collectively pattern and transport interacting active defects. Our work establishes an additive framework to sculpt flows and manipulate active defects in both space and time, paving the way to design programmable active and living materials for transport, memory and logic.</description>

      <title>Shear flow of non-Brownian rod-sphere mixtures near jamming</title>

Abstract: We use the discrete element method, taking particle contact and hydrodynamic lubrication into account, to unveil the shear rheology of suspensions of frictionless non-Brownian rods in the dense packing fraction regime. We find that, analogously to the random close packing volume fraction, the shear-driven jamming point of this system varies in a non-monotonic fashion as a function of the rod aspect ratio. The latter strongly influences how the addition of rod-like particles affects the rheological response of a suspension of frictionless non-Brownian spheres to an external shear flow. At fixed values of the total (rods plus spheres) packing fraction, the viscosity of the suspension is reduced by the addition of "short" ( $\leq 2$) rods but is instead increased by the addition of "long" ( $\geq2$) rods. A mechanistic interpretation is provided in terms of packing and excluded-volume arguments.</description>

      <title>Go Green: Selected Configuration Interaction as a More Sustainable Alternative for High Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13111</link>

Abstract: Recently, a new distributed implementation of the full configuration interaction (FCI) method has been reported [Gao et al. J. Chem Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 1185]. Thanks to a hybrid parallelization scheme, the authors were able to compute the exact energy of propane (\ce{C3H8}) in the minimal basis STO-3G. This formidable task involves handling an active space of 26 electrons in 23 orbitals or a Hilbert space of \SI{1.3d12} determinants. This is, by far, the largest FCI calculation reported to date. Here, we illustrate how, from a general point of view, selected configuration interaction (SCI) can achieve microhartree accuracy at a fraction of the computational and memory cost, via a sparse exploration of the FCI space. The present SCI calculations are performed with the \textit{Configuration Interaction using a Perturbative Selection made Iteratively} (CIPSI) algorithm, as implemented in a determinant-driven way in the \textsc{quantum package} software. The present study reinforces the common wisdom that among the exponentially large number of determinants in the FCI space, only a tiny fraction of them significantly contribute to the energy. More importantly, it demonstrates the feasibility of achieving comparable accuracy using more reasonable and sustainable computational resources, hence reducing the ever-growing carbon footprint of computational chemistry.</description>

      <title>Nuclear spin relaxation mediated by donor-bound and free electrons in wide CdTe quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17435v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nuclear spin systems in CdTe/(Cd,Zn)Te and CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te quantum wells (QW) are studied using a multistage technique combining optical pumping and Hanle effect-based detection. The samples demonstrate drastically different nuclear spin dynamics in zero and weak magnetic fields. In CdTe/(Cd,Zn)Te, the nuclear spin relaxation time is found to strongly increase with the magnetic field, growing from 3 s in zero field to tens of seconds in a field of 25 G. In CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te the relaxation is an order of magnitude slower, and it is field-independent up to at least 70 G. The differences are attributed to the nuclear spin relaxation being mediated by different kinds of resident electrons in these QWs. In CdTe/(Cd,Mg)Te, a residual electron gas trapped in the QW largely determines the relaxation dynamics. In CdTe/(Cd,Zn)Te, the fast relaxation in zero field is due to interaction with localized donor-bound electrons. Nuclear spin diffusion barriers form around neutral donors when the external magnetic field exceeds the local nuclear field, which is about $B_L\approx$0.4 G in CdTe. This inhibits nuclear spin diffusion towards the donors, slowing down relaxation. These findings are supported by theoretical modeling. In particular, we show that the formation of the diffusion barrier is made possible by several features specific to CdTe: (i) the large donor binding energy (about 10 meV), (ii) the low abundance of magnetic isotopes (only $\approx$30 % of nuclei have nonzero spin), and (iii) the absence of nuclear quadrupole interactions between nuclei. The two latter properties are also favorable to nuclear spin cooling via optical pumping followed by adiabatic demagnetization. Under non-optimized conditions we have reached sub-microkelvin nuclear spin temperatures in both samples, lower than all previous results obtained in GaAs.</description>

      <title>3D characterization of kinematic fields and poroelastic swelling near the tip of a propagating crack in a hydrogel</title>

Abstract: In fracture mechanics, polyacrylamide hydrogels have been widely used as a model material for experiments, benefited from its optical transparency, fracture brittleness, and low Rayleigh wave velocity. To describe the brittle fracture in the hydrogels, linear elastic fracture mechanics comes as the first choice. However, in soft materials such as hydrogels, the crack opening can be extremely large, leading to substantial geometric nonlinearity and material nonlinearity at the crack tip. Furthermore, poroelasticity may also modify the local mechanical state within the polymer network. Direct characterization of the kinematic fields and poroelastic effect at the crack tip is lacking. Here, based on a hybrid method of digital image correlation and particle tracking technique, we retrieved high-resolution 3D particle trajectories near the tip of a slowly propagating crack and measured the near-tip 3D kinematic fields, including the displacement fields, rotation fields, stretch fields, strain fields, and swelling fields. Results confirmed the complex multi-axial stretching near the crack tip and the substantial geometric nonlinearity, particularly on the two wakes of the crack where rotation exceeds $30^{\circ}$. Comparison between the measured and predicted displacement and strain fields, derived from linear elastic fracture mechanics, highlights a disagreement in the direct vicinity of the crack tip, particularly for displacement component $u_x$ and through-thickness strain component $\varepsilon_{zz}$. Significant swelling, due to the poroelastic solvent migration, is also observed, with a strong correlation to the local stretch. Our experimental method, without any assumption of the material properties, can be readily extended to study 3D crack tips in a huge varieties of materials, and our results can shed light on the fundamental fracture mechanics.</description>

      <title>Tunable exciton valley-pseudospin orders in moir\'e Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin and charge are the two most important degrees of freedom of electrons. Their interplay lies at the heart of numerous strongly correlated phenomena including Hubbard model physics and high temperature superconductivity. Such interplay for bosons, on the other hand, is largely unexplored in condensed matter systems. Here we demonstrate a unique realization of the spin-1/2 Bose-Hubbard model through excitons in a semiconducting moir\'e superlattice. We find evidence of a transient in-plane ferromagnetic (FM-$xy$) order of exciton spin - here valley pseudospin - around exciton filling $\nu_{ex}$ = 1, which transitions into a FM-$z$ order both with increasing exciton filling and a small magnetic field of 10 mT. The phase diagram is different from the fermion case and is qualitatively captured by a simple phenomenological model, highlighting the unique consequence of Bose-Einstein statistics. Our study paves the way for engineering exotic phases of matter from spinor bosons, as well as for unconventional devices in optics and quantum information science.</description>
