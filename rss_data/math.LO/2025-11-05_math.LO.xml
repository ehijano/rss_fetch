      <title>Dirac - von Neumann axioms in the setting of Continuous Model Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recast the well-known axiom system of quantum mechanics used by physicists (the Dirac calculus) in the language of Continuous Logic. For the basic version of the axiomatic system we prove that along with the canonical continuous model the axioms have approximate finite models of large sizes, in fact the continuous model is isomorphic to an ultraproduct of finite models. We analyse the continuous logic quantifier corresponding to Dirac integration and show that in finite context it has two versions, local and global, which coincide on Gaussian wave-functions.</description>

      <title>Found in Translation: at the limits of the Hudetz program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to provide an analysis of what it means when we say that a pair of theories, very generously construed, are equivalent in the sense that they are interdefinable. With regard to theories articulated in first order logic, we already have a natural and well-understood device for addressing this problem: the theory of relative interpretability as based on translation. However, many important theories in the sciences and mathematics (and, in particular, physics) are precisely formulated but are not naturally articulated in first order logic or any obvious language at all. In this paper, we plan to generalize the ordinary theory of interpretation to accommodate such theories by offering an account where definability does not mean definability relative to a particular structure, but rather definability without such reservations: definable in the language of mathematics.</description>

      <title>On the Computability of Finding Capacity-Achieving Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the problem of constructing capacity-achieving codes from an algorithmic perspective. Specifically, we prove that there exists a Turing machine which, given a discrete memoryless channel $p_{Y|X}$, a target rate $R$ less than the channel capacity $C(p_{Y|X})$, and an error tolerance $\epsilon &gt; 0$, outputs a block code $\mathcal{C}$ achieving a rate at least $R$ and a maximum block error probability below $\epsilon$. The machine operates in the general case where all transition probabilities of $p_{Y|X}$ are computable real numbers, and the parameters $R$ and $\epsilon$ are rational. The proof builds on Shannon's Channel Coding Theorem and relies on an exhaustive search approach that systematically enumerates all codes of increasing block length until a valid code is found. This construction is formalized using the theory of recursive functions, yielding a $\mu$-recursive function $\mathrm{FindCode} : \mathbb{N}^3 \rightharpoonup \mathbb{N}$ that takes as input appropriate encodings of $p_{Y|X}$, $R$, and $\epsilon$, and, whenever $R &lt; C(p_{Y|X})$, outputs an encoding of a valid code. By Kleene's Normal Form Theorem, which establishes the computational equivalence between Turing machines and $\mu$-recursive functions, we conclude that the problem is solvable by a Turing machine. This result can also be extended to the case where $\epsilon$ is a computable real number, while we further discuss an analogous generalization of our analysis when $R$ is computable as well. We note that the assumptions that the probabilities of $p_{Y|X}$, as well as $\epsilon$ and $R$, are computable real numbers cannot be further weakened, since computable reals constitute the largest subset of $\mathbb{R}$ representable by algorithmic means.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative linear logic fragments with sub-context-free complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new descriptive complexity characterisations of classes REG (regular languages), LCFL (linear context-free languages) and CFL (context-free languages) as restrictions on inference rules, size of formulae and permitted connectives in the Lambek calculus; fragments of the intuitionistic non-commutative linear logic with direction-sensitive implication connectives. Our identification of the Lambek calculus fragments with proof complexity REG and LCFL is the first result of its kind. We further show the CFL complexity of one of the strictly `weakest' possible variants of the logic, admitting only a single inference rule. The proof thereof, moreover, is based on a direct translation between type-logical and formal grammar and structural induction on provable sequents; a simpler and more intuitive method than those employed in prior works. We thereby establish a clear conceptual utility of the Cut-elimination theorem for comparing formal grammar and sequent calculus, and identify the exact analogue of the Greibach Normal Form in Lambek grammar. We believe the result presented herein constitutes a first step toward a more extensive and richer characterisation of the interaction between computation and logic, as well as a finer-grained complexity separation of various sequent calculi.</description>

      <title>Monadic Second-Order Logic of Permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutations can be viewed as pairs of linear orders, or more formally as models over a signature consisting of two binary relation symbols. This approach was adopted by Albert, Bouvel and F\'eray, who studied the expressibility of first-order logic in this setting. We focus our attention on monadic second-order logic.
  Our results go in two directions. First, we investigate the expressive power of monadic second-order logic. We exhibit natural properties of permutations that can be expressed in monadic second-order logic but not in first-order logic. Additionally, we show that the property of having a fixed point is inexpressible even in monadic second-order logic.
  Secondly, we focus on the complexity of monadic second-order model checking. We show that there is an algorithm deciding if a permutation $\pi$ satisfies a given monadic second-order sentence $\varphi$ in time $f(|\varphi|, \operatorname{tw}(\pi)) \cdot n$ for some computable function $f$ where $n = |\pi|$ and $\operatorname{tw}(\pi)$ is the tree-width of $\pi$. On the other hand, we prove that the problem remains hard even when we restrict the permutation $\pi$ to a fixed hereditary class $\mathcal{C}$ with mild assumptions on $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <title>Recursively Enumerably Representable Classes and Computable Versions of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study computable probably approximately correct (CPAC) learning, where learners are required to be computable functions. It had been previously observed that the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning, which characterizes PAC learnability by finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC-)dimension, no longer holds in this framework. Recent works recovered analogs of the Fundamental Theorem in the computable setting, for instance by introducing an effective VC-dimension. Guided by this, we investigate the connection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER) classes, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the effective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one, even for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for various notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes satisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that CPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that realize the same samples. Furthermore, it is shown that CPAC learnable classes satisfying a unique identification property are necessarily RER. Finally, we establish that agnostic learnability can be guaranteed for RER classes, by considering the relaxed notion of nonuniform CPAC learning.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Proofs for iGL via Corecursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyclic proof theory studies proofs where cycles are allowed. This is useful for developing proof theory for logics with fixpoint operators: cycles can be used to represent the unfolding of a fixpoint. However, this cyclic character is not unique to such explicit fixpoints. For example, modal logics whose frames have a Noetherian (conversely wellfounded) condition, such as GL (Goedel-Loeb logic), S4Grz (Grzegorczyk logic) and K4Grz also have cyclic proof systems.
  Particularly, Shamkanov introduces a non-wellfounded and a cyclic sequent system GL. He proves the equivalence of these two systems with an acyclic finite system via proof translations. In order to go from the finite system to the non-wellfounded system he defines the translation by corecursion.
  Iemhoff generalized the work of Shamkanov studying when, for a given modal logic proof system, there exists another modal logic proof system such that proofs in the first are equivalent to cyclic proofs in the second. There, she shows that iGL, an intuitionistic version of GL, also has a natural cyclic proof system.
  We provide an alternative proof of the equivalence of a standard calculus for iGL and a cyclic one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00200v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a weak A2 space (or wA2-space), which generalises spaces satisfying Todor\v{c}evi\'c's axioms A1-A4 and countable vector spaces. We show that in any Polish weak A2 space, analytic sets are Kastanas Ramsey, and discuss the relationship between Kastanas Ramsey sets and sets in the projective hierarchy. We also show that in all spaces satisfying A1-A4, every subset of $\cal{R}$ is Kastanas Ramsey iff Ramsey, generalising the recent result by Cano and Di Prisco. Finally, we show that in the setting of Gowers wA2-spaces, Kastanas Ramsey sets and strategically Ramsey sets coincide, providing a connection between the recent studies on topological Ramsey spaces and countable vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Toward higher-order infinite time Turing machines: simulational $\Gamma$-machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infinite time Turing machines (ITTMs) have been introduced by Hamkins and Lewis in their seminal article arXiv:math/9808093. The strength of the model comes from a limit rule which allows the ITTM to compute through ordinal stages. This rule is simple to describe and another rule would lead to a different model of ordinal computation. The aim of this article is to define a collection of limit rules for which the models of infinite Turing machine they induce have nice properties, akin to that of the ITTM. Through the analysis of the universal ITTM and of its preponderant role in the study of the ITTM, we devise a set of four constraints. A limit rule satisfying those constraints yields a model of infinite machine for which we can define a universal machine. Adding a fifth constraint, we show that any limit rule definable in set theory which meets those constraints produces a model of infinite machine with the desired properties. Among those, the fact that the supremum of the writable ordinal matches that of the clockable ordinal. That is, with the usual notations, the equality $\lambda = \gamma$ holds for any of those limit rules. Eventually, we provide a counter-example to show that the four first constraints alone are not sufficient.</description>

      <title>New consequences of PFA($T^*$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T^*$ be an almost Suslin tree, that is, an Aronszajn tree with no stationary antichains. Krueger introduced a forcing axiom, $\mathrm{PFA}(T^*)$, for the class of proper forcings that preserve that $T^*$ is almost Suslin. He showed that $\mathrm{PFA}(T^*)$ implies several well-known consequences of the Proper Forcing Axiom ($\mathrm{PFA}$), including Suslin's Hypothesis and the P-ideal dichotomy. We extend this list by proving that $\mathrm{PFA}(T^*)$ also implies the Mapping Reflection Principle ($\mathrm{MRP}$) and the Open Graph Axiom ($\mathrm{OGA}$). Additionally, we show that $\mathrm{PFA}(T^*)$ implies that all special Aronszajn trees are club-isomorphic, but it does not imply that all almost Suslin trees are club-isomorphic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two theorems witnessing the abundance of geometrically trivial strongly minimal autonomous differential equations of arbitrary order are shown. The first one states that a generic algebraic vector field of degree $d\geq 2$ on the affine space of dimension $n \geq 2$ is strongly minimal and geometrically trivial. The second one states that if $X_0$ is the complement of a smooth hyperplane section $H$ of a smooth projective variety $X$ of dimension $n$, then for $d$ large enough, the system of differential equations associated with a generic vector field on $X_0$ with a pole of order at most $d$ along $H$ is strongly minimal and geometrically trivial.
  This produces the first examples of meromorphic functions that are new in the sense of Painlev\'e and satisfy autonomous differential equations of order $n \geq 4$.</description>

Abstract: We consider modal logic extended with the well-known temporal operator 'eventually' and provide a cut-elimination procedure for a cyclic sequent calculus that captures this fragment. The work showcases an adaptation of the reductive cut-elimination method to cyclic calculi. Notably, the proposed algorithm applies to a cyclic proof and directly outputs a cyclic cut-free proof without appealing to intermediate machinery for regularising the end proof.</description>

      <title>A Proof-Theoretic Approach to the Semantics of Classical Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear logic (LL) is a resource-aware, abstract logic programming language that refines both classical and intuitionistic logic. Linear logic semantics is typically presented in one of two ways: by associating each formula with the set of all contexts that can be used to prove it (e.g. phase semantics) or by assigning meaning directly to proofs (e.g. coherence spaces).
  This work proposes a different perspective on assigning meaning to proofs by adopting a proof-theoretic perspective. More specifically, we employ base-extension semantics (BeS) to characterise proofs through the notion of base support.
  Recent developments have shown that BeS is powerful enough to capture proof-theoretic notions in structurally rich logics such as intuitionistic linear logic. In this paper, we extend this framework to the classical case, presenting a proof-theoretic approach to the semantics of the multiplicative-additive fragment of linear logic (MALL).</description>
