      <title>Electron-neutrino lepton number crossings: variations with the supernova core physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial ingredient affecting fast neutrino flavor conversion in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is the shape of the angular distribution of the electron-neutrino lepton number (ELN). The presence of an ELN crossing signals favorable conditions for flavor conversion. However, the dependence of ELN crossings on the SN properties is only partially understood. We investigate a suite of 12 spherically symmetric neutrino-hydrodynamics simulations of the core collapse of a SN with a mass of $18.6 M_\odot$; each model employs different microphysics (i.e., three different nuclear equations of state, with and without muon creation) and includes or not a mixing-length treatment for proto-neutron star convection. We solve the Boltzmann equations to compute the neutrino angular distributions relying on static fluid properties extracted from each of the SN simulations in our suite for six selected post-bounce times. We explore the dependence of the ELN distributions on the SN microphysics and proto-neutron star convection. We find that the latter shifts the proto-neutron star radius outwards, favoring the appearance of ELN crossings at larger radii. On the other hand, muon creation causes proto-neutron star contraction, facilitating the occurrence of ELN crossings at smaller radii. These effects mildly depend on the nuclear equation of state. Our findings highlight the subtle impact of the SN microphysics, proto-neutron star convection, and neutrino transport on the ELN angular distributions.</description>

      <title>The role of three-dimensional effects on ion injection and acceleration in perpendicular shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the conditions that enable particle acceleration at non-relativistic collisionless shocks is essential to unveil the origin of cosmic rays. We employ 2D and 3D hybrid simulations (with kinetic ions and fluid electrons) to explore particle acceleration and magnetic field amplification in non-relativistic perpendicular shocks, focusing on the role of shock drift acceleration and its dependence on the shock Mach number. We perform an analysis of the ion injection process and demonstrate why efficient acceleration is only observed in 3D. In particular, we show that ion injection critically depends on the "porosity" of the magnetic turbulence in the downstream region near the shock, a property describing how easily the post-shock region allows particles to traverse it and return upstream without being trapped. This effect can only be properly captured in 3D. Additionally, we explore the impact of numerical resolution on ion energization, highlighting how resolving small-scale turbulence -- on scales below the thermal ion gyroradius -- is essential for accurately modeling particle injection. Overall, our results emphasize the necessity of high-resolution 3D simulations to capture the fundamental microphysics driving particle acceleration at perpendicular shocks.</description>

      <title>Variability in Black Hole Accretion: Dependence on Rotational and Magnetic Energy Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black hole (BH) hot accretion flows are initialized with small rotating tori and produce stable jets with only small fluctuations. However, recent studies using larger scale Bondi-like initial conditions have reported intermittent jet activity and loss of coherent rotation. To investigate the differences, we modify the standard torus setup across four BH spins: $a_*=0$, $0.5$, $0.9$, $-0.9$. First, we increase the torus size significantly (pressure maximum at 500 gravitational radii), allowing long simulations ($2.8\times10^5$ gravitational times) without gas depletion. These runs reproduce the weak variability seen in smaller tori, indicating that a larger dynamic range alone does not cause strong fluctuations. We observe moderate suppression of the accretion rate by factors of $\sim 1.6, ~2.5$ for BH spins $a_*=0.5,~0.9$, respectively, compared to $a_*=0$. Also, the density profile scales as $\rho(r)\propto r^{-1.1}$ for prograde BHs. Next, we considerably strengthen the initial magnetic field in the large torus by setting the plasma-$\beta\approx 1$. This induces strong variability in the evolution. The jet efficiency in the $a_*=0.9$ model, for instance, now varies by over 3 orders of magnitude, and gas rotation reverses directions. Combining these results with prior studies, we propose that a key parameter is the ratio $R$ between the rotational and magnetic energies in the initial state. Strong variability appears later in models with a larger value of $R$. The implication is that all simulations, and by extension all hot accretion flows in Nature, will ultimately develop intermittent jets if evolved long enough.</description>

      <title>ASKAP J144834-685644: a newly discovered long period radio transient detected from radio to X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are an emerging group of radio transients that show periodic polarised radio bursts with periods varying from a few minutes to a few hours. Fewer than a dozen LPTs have been detected so far, and their origin (source and emission mechanism) remains unclear. Here, we report the discovery of a 1.5 hr LPT, ASKAP J144834-685644, adding to the current sample of sources. ASKAP J144834-685644 is one of the very few LPTs that has been detected from X-rays to radio. It shows a steep radio spectrum and polarised radio bursts, which resemble the radio emission in known LPTs. In addition, it also shows highly structured and periodic narrow-band radio emission. Multi-wavelength properties suggest that the spectral energy distribution (SED) peaks at near ultraviolet wavelengths, indicating the presence of a hot magnetic source. Combining multi-wavelength information, we infer that ASKAP J144834-685644 may be a near edge-on magnetic white dwarf binary (MWD), although we can not fully rule out ASKAP J144834-685644 being an isolated white dwarf pulsar or even a transitional millisecond pulsar (despite the lack of radio pulsations). If ASKAP J144834-685644 is an MWD binary, the observed broadband spectral energy distribution can be explained by emission from an accretion disk. This hints that some fraction of optically bright LPTs may be accreting binaries with the radio period being the orbital period. It might further suggest a connection between optically bright non-accreting synchronized LPTs, such as polars, and non-accreting asynchronous WD pulsars, such as AR Sco and J1912-4410.</description>

      <title>Detection of Low-Redshift Excess in Supernova-Linked Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are traditionally classified into long (lGRBs) and short (sGRBs) durations based on their $T_{90}$, with lGRBs widely used as tracers of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) due to their observed association with core-collapse supernovae. However, recent detections of kilonovae accompanying some lGRBs challenge this assumption, suggesting potential contamination from compact binary mergers. Here, we move beyond the conventional $T_{90}$-based classification and focus exclusively on GRBs directly associated with supernovae - the most direct signatures of massive stellar collapse - to reassess their connection to the SFR. Using a sample of SN/GRBs, we construct the luminosity - redshift ($L$-$z$) plane and uncover a significant correlation between these variables. To account for observational biases, we apply the $\tau$ statistic and Lynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method to derive the intrinsic luminosity function and formation rate. Our analysis reveals that even among this well-defined subsample, the SN/GRB formation rate still exceeds the SFR at low redshifts ($z &lt; 1$). These findings suggest that GRBs at low redshift may not serve as reliable tracers of the SFR, and that larger samples are required to further investigate this discrepancy.</description>

      <title>The Double-Episode Jet Genesis of the eROSITA and Fermi Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermi and eROSITA bubbles are two pairs of large diffuse multi-band structures detected in our Milky Way galaxy, yet their origins remain uncertain. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the model where these bubbles were produced by two successive active galactic nucleus jet activities from the Galactic center, with their edges delineated by the correspondingly driven forward shocks. Our simulations successfully reproduce the observed morphology, multi-band X-ray surface brightness distributions between 0.11 and 2.04 keV, and O viii/O vii line ratios, matching ROSAT and eROSITA observations. The results indicate that the first jet pair, launched 15 Myr ago, created the eROSITA bubbles, now extending to ~15 kpc with gas temperatures of ~0.25 keV. The second jet pair, launched 5 Myr ago, produced the Fermi bubbles, currently reaching ~10 kpc with temperatures of 0.3--0.4 keV. The sharp edges of the eROSITA and Fermi bubbles are naturally explained by the forward shocks in this double-episode jet scenario. Our findings support a Galactic-scale origin for these structures and suggest episodic jet activities from the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Driven Retrograde Precession in Misaligned Black Hole Accretion Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of accreting black hole (BH) systems, such as microquasars and supermassive black holes, often reveal a precessing jet with changing directions, indicating a misaligned accretion flow relative to the BH spin. The precession is commonly attributed to the Lense-Thirring (LT) effect, which arises from the BH's rotation twisting the surrounding spacetime and accretion flow. In the strongly magnetized regime, which is preferred accretion flow conditions for M~87$^*$ and likely other jet-producing systems, the large-scale magnetic field can significantly influence the flow dynamics. Here, we perform large-scale three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of tilted accretion onto a rotating BH, and find a never-seen-before new retrograde precession. This precession arises from a magnetic torque on the disk generated by the poloidal magnetic field aligned with the BH's rotation, opposing the LT torque. This finding highlights the unique property of highly magnetized accretion flows around BHs and provides a new interpretation of jet precession observed in many systems.</description>

      <title>Probing neutrino emission at GeV energies from compact binary mergers detected during O1-O4a with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact binary mergers, detected in gravitational waves since 2015, are candidate sources for astrophysical neutrinos in the GeV regime from proton-proton and proton-neutron collisions. This contribution presents the results of the search for such a signal using mergers detected during the fourth observing run of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA interferometers. We use the dense infill array at the center of the IceCube detector, IceCube-DeepCore, to select neutrino candidates in the 0.5-5 GeV energy range. The search for a statistically significant excess associated with an astrophysical signal is performed in a $\pm$ 500 s window around the gravitational wave detection time. We do not observe any statistically significant excess in the neutrino data, and set upper limits on the neutrino emission from these objects. Additionally, we search for subpopulations of neutrino-emitting sources, including merger events detected in previous observing runs; no significant signal has been identified yet.</description>

      <title>The Pierre Auger Observatory: Contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Rays Conference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13771v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory, located in La Pampa Amarilla, Argentina, has been continuously acquiring data since 2004. It comprises a surface detector array covering 3,000 km$^2$ and 27 fluorescence telescopes, designed to detect extensive air showers initiated by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. An upgrade to the Observatory was commissioned in 2024, enhancing the existing water-Cherenkov detectors with additional radio antennas, surface scintillator detectors, and a buried scintillator array. This compilation of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference, held in Geneva, Switzerland (July 15-24, 2025), presents recent results from the Pierre Auger Collaboration, addressing a wide range of fundamental questions in astroparticle physics. The included papers cover measurements of the energy spectrum, mass composition, and arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, investigations of hadronic interactions in extensive air showers, and searches for ultra-high-energy photons and neutrinos. Additional topics include radio detection techniques, solar-related phenomena, and atmospheric events such as ELVES and TGFs. The list also contains first results and performance evaluations of the upgraded detectors, AugerPrime, along with reports on outreach and social engagement initiatives conducted by the Collaboration.</description>

Abstract: Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows and kilonovae (KNe) are electromagnetic transients that can accompany binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Therefore, studying their emission processes is of general interest for constraining cosmological parameters or the behavior of ultra-dense matter. One common method to analyze electromagnetic data from BNS mergers is to sample a Bayesian posterior over the parameters of a physical model for the transient. However, sampling the posterior is computationally costly, and because of the many likelihood evaluations needed in this process, detailed models are too expensive to be used directly in inference. In the present article, we address this problem by introducing fiesta, a python package to train machine learning (ML) surrogates for GRB afterglow and kilonova models that can accelerate likelihood evaluations. Specifically, we introduce extensive ML surrogates for the state-of-the-art GRB afterglow models afterglowpy and pyblastafterglow, as well as a new surrogate for the KN emission as modeled by the possis code. Our surrogates enable evaluation of the lightcurve posterior within minutes. We also provide built-in posterior sampling capabilities in fiesta that rely on the flowMC package which scale efficiently to higher dimensions when adding up to tens of nuisance sampling parameters. Because of its use of the JAX framework, fiesta also allows for GPU acceleration during both surrogate training and posterior sampling. We apply our framework to reanalyze AT2017gfo/GRB170817A and GRB211211A using our surrogates, thus employing the new pyblastafterglow model for the first time in Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>A Hidden Pulse: Uncovering a New Timing Signal in Cygnus X-1 with AstroSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of fast variability properties in X-ray binaries advances our understanding of the physical processes and geometric properties of the accretion flow around the compact object. In this work, we study the evolution of the timing properties of Cygnus X-1 with AstroSat/LAXPC, during the transition of the source from the hard to soft state in 2017. We use a novel frequency-segmented technique to fit simultaneously the cross spectra and part of the power spectra and coherence function with a multi-Lorentzian model and predict the phase-lags and the complementary parts of the power spectra and coherence function. We study the evolution of the frequency and power of the main variability components that are present throughout all the states. In particular, we identify previously undetected variability components, one of which manifests as a narrow dip in the coherence function and a broad drop in the phase-lag spectrum at the same frequency. This dip in coherence, which we detected for the first time in Cygnus X-1 at energies above 3 keV, appears in a state in which the source shows high-amplitude radio variability and significant hard X-ray polarization. While the contribution of the compact jet in X-rays is debated in the literature, this study provides a new avenue for investigating jet properties as well as the geometry of the Comptonizing medium.</description>

      <title>The spin-orbit alignment hypothesis in millisecond pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are spun up during their accretion phase in a binary system. The exchange of angular momentum between the accretion disk and the star tends to align the spin and orbital angular momenta on a very short time scale compared to the accretion stage. In this work, we study a subset of $\gamma$-ray MSPs in binaries for which the orbital inclination $i$ has been accurately constrained thanks to the Shapiro delay measurements. Our goal is to constrain the observer viewing angle $\zeta$ and to check whether it agrees with the orbital inclination $i$, thus $\zeta \approx i$. We use a Bayesian inference technique to fit the MSP $\gamma$-ray light-curves based on the third $\gamma$-ray pulsar catalogue (3PC). The emission model relies on the striped wind model deduced from force-free neutron star magnetosphere simulations. We found good agreement between those two angles ($i$ and $\zeta$) for a significant fraction of our sample, between 1/2 and 2/3, confirming the spin-orbit alignment scenario during the accretion stage. However about one third of our sample deviates significantly from this alignment. The reasons are manifold: either the $\gamma$-ray fit is not reliable or some precession and external torque avoid an almost perfect alignment.</description>

      <title>Transient QPOs of Fermi-LAT blazars with Linearly Multiplicative Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study on the detection and characterization of transient quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the $\gamma$-ray emission of blazars 4C +31.03, MG1 J123931+0443, and PKS 1622$-$253. Using light curves derived from \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope data, we investigate oscillatory patterns characterized by periodic multiplicative amplitudes that vary linearly over time. By segmenting the light curves into increasing and decreasing trends, we analyze each segment independently, allowing for precise measurements of both the periodicity and long-term variations. To interpret these QPOs, we explore various theoretical scenarios that could explain their origin and underlying physical mechanisms. The estimated periods for blazars MG1 J123931+0443 and PKS 1622$-$253 are consistent with precessional dynamics expected in binary supermassive black hole systems, although our current results do not allow for a definitive conclusion.</description>

      <title>Strangeon Matter: from Stars to Nuggets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fact that strange sea quarks are abundant in the nucleons, but without strangeness, is of great importance for understanding the nature of dense matter condensed by the strong interaction, particularly in the context of the ``gigantic nucleus'' formed by the gravitational collapse of an evolved massive star. We hypothesize that the basic unit of bulk strong matter with the light-flavor symmetry of valence quarks is ``strangeon'', which is the counterpart of the nucleon found in atomic nuclei. In addition to strangeon stars (SnSs) with large baryon number of $A\approx 10^{57}$, strange nuggets (SnNs) with $A\gtrsim 10^{10}$ could also exist in the Universe. Both the SnS and the SnN are explained, with attention to their observational evidence.</description>

      <title>Reconnection-driven Flares in M87*: Proton-synchrotron Powered GeV Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection in current layers that form intermittently in radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto black holes is a promising mechanism for particle acceleration and high-energy emission. It has been recently proposed that such layers, arising during flux eruption events, can power the rapid TeV flares observed from the core of M87. In this scenario, inverse Compton scattering of soft radiation from the accretion flow by energetic electron-positron pairs produced near the reconnection layer was suggested as the primary emission mechanism. However, detailed calculations show that radiation from pairs alone cannot account for the GeV emission detected by the Fermi observatory. In this work, we combine analytic estimates with 3D radiative particle-in-cell simulations of pair-proton plasmas to show that the GeV emission can be naturally explained by synchrotron radiation from protons accelerated in the current sheet. Although the exact proton content of the layer is uncertain, our model remains robust across a broad range of proton-to-pair number density ratios. While protons are subdominant in number compared to pairs, our simulations demonstrate that they can be accelerated more efficiently, leading to a self-regulated steady state in which protons dominate the energy budget. Ultimately, proton synchrotron emission accounts for approximately 5% to 20% of the total dissipation power. The majority is radiated as MeV photons via pair synchrotron emission, with a smaller fraction emitted as TeV photons through inverse Compton scattering.</description>

      <title>Extreme value distribution for GRB prompt data -- How unexpected was the BOAT event?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are known to be unpredictable in time and position. A few (observationally) exceptional events have been observed, as GRB221009A that stands out for its fluence and peak flux, being orders of magnitude higher than what measured so far. Analyzing the observed fluence, peak flux or duration distributions typically requires one to assume some scenarios, and the consistency of the observed data with the predictions turns out to be an important model diagnostic. However, it is also of interest to model these distributions using general statistical properties that do not rely on specific model assumptions, allowing one to derive inferences only based on the consistency of the observed distributions with the hypothesis of one single population of events that generate them. We obtained fluences, peak fluxes and durations from the catalogues of GRBs observed by the CGRO-BATSE and Fermi-GBM instruments. We selected the extreme values in slots of equal duration and modelled their distributions by the generalized extreme value (GEV) formalism. The GEV distribution is a limit distribution naturally arising when the number of observations is large and is essentially independent of the phenomena producing the observed data. The distributions of extreme values for fluences, peak fluxes and durations are consistent with being extracted from a single population of events but the fluence and peak flux recorded for GRB221009A constitutes a striking exception. The probability to observe such an event, assuming it is a cosmological GRB, is low, with a median value of about one event per millennium for the fluence and about one event per century for the peak flux.</description>

      <title>Boosted dark matter versus dark matter-induced neutrinos from single and stacked blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12278v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics responsible for the production of observed high-energy neutrinos have not been established so far, neither for the diffuse astrophysical ones nor for those detected from single blazars. We recently proposed that both could be explained by deep inelastic scatterings between sub-GeV dark matter (DM) around blazars and protons within their jets. Here, we compute the proton-recoil signals at the neutrino detectors Super-Kamiokande, KamLAND, Borexino, JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE induced by DM that is itself boosted by the scatterings with protons in blazar jets. We do it for the four cases of vector, axial, scalar and pseudoscalar mediators of DM-quark interactions. We perform the analysis for the single blazar TXS 0506+056 and for a sample of more than 300 stacked blazars. We find that searches for such blazar-boosted DM leave room for a variety of DM models to explain observations of high-energy neutrinos. We check that the depletion of the DM spike induced by DM-proton and DM-DM interactions does not compromise the DM interpretation for high-energy neutrinos, but challenges other blazar-DM signals.</description>

      <title>INTEGRAL, eROSITA and Voyager Constraints on Light Bosonic Dark Matter: ALPs, Dark Photons, Scalars, $B-L$ and $L_{i}-L_{j}$ Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decay of light bosonic dark matter particles can produce a bright electron/positron ($e^+e^-$) flux that can be strongly constrained by local Voyager observations of the direct $e^+e^-$ flux, as well as 511 keV Line and X-ray continuum observations of $e^+e^-$ emission. We carefully analyze the $e^+e^-$ yield and resulting cosmic-ray and X-ray spectra from theoretically well-motivated light dark matter models, including: (a) electrophilic axion-like particles, (b) dark photons, (c) scalars, and (d) $B-L$ and $L_{i}-L_{j}$ vector bosons. We use the morphology and spectrum of the INTEGRAL 511 keV line data, the eROSITA X-ray continuum spectrum and the Voyager $e^+e^-$ spectrum to constrain the decay lifetime and coupling of each dark matter model. We find that 511 keV observations typically set world-leading limits on bosonic dark matter decay below masses of $\sim$1 GeV, while eROSITA observations provide the strongest constraints in the range from 1--10 GeV. Finally, we forecast future limits from 21 cm line searches with next-generation HERA data.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Period Changes for 25 X-ray Binaries and the Measurement of an Empirical Universal Law for Angular Momentum Loss in Accreting Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I measure and collect timings of phase markers (like eclipse times) for the orbits of 25 X-ray binaries (XRBs) so as to calculate the steady evolutionary period change ($\dot{P}$). I combine these with my observed $\dot{P}$ measures from 52 cataclysmic variables (CVs). Further, I subtract out the contributions from gravitational radiation ($\dot{P}_{\rm GR}$) and mass transfer ($\dot{P}_{\rm mt}$), deriving the period change from the residual unknown angular momentum loss ($\dot{P}_{\rm AML}$=$\dot{P}$-$\dot{P}_{\rm GR}$-$\dot{P}_{\rm mt}$). I have $\dot{P}_{\rm AML}$ measures for 77 XRBs and CVs, with these being direct measures of the driver of binary evolution. The venerable Magnetic Braking Model (MBM) of binary evolution has its most fundamental predictions tested, with most systems having predictions wrong by over one order-of-magnitude. Other proposed mechanisms to explain the AML also fail, so we are left with no known mechanism that dominates the AML. An alternative path to the AML law is empirical, where my $\dot{P}_{\rm AML}$ measures are fitted to a power-law involving the fundamental binary properties. With this, the dominant AML law for systems with orbital periods ($P$) from 0.13--1.0 days is $\dot{P}_{\rm AML} = -1500\times10^{-12} P^{1.29} M_{\rm prim}^{2.75} M_{\rm comp}^{-1.00}\dot{M}^{0.43}_{-8}$, in appropriate units. Similar AML laws for binaries below the Period Gap and for binaries with $P$$&gt;$1.0 day are derived. These three AML laws are of good accuracy and are the best representations of the actual evolution for all 77 XRBs and CVs of all classes, so the three taken together can be called `universal'.</description>

      <title>A half-ring of ionized circumstellar material trapped in the magnetosphere of a white dwarf merger remnant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many white dwarfs are observed in compact double white dwarf binaries and, through the emission of gravitational waves, a large fraction are destined to merge. The merger remnants that do not explode in a Type Ia supernova are expected to initially be rapidly rotating and highly magnetized. We here present our discovery of the variable white dwarf ZTF J200832.79+444939.67, hereafter ZTF J2008+4449, as a likely merger remnant showing signs of circumstellar material without a stellar or substellar companion. The nature of ZTF J2008+4449 as a merger remnant is supported by its physical properties: hot ($35,500\pm300$ K) and massive ($1.12\pm0.03$ M$_\odot$), the white dwarf is rapidly rotating with a period of $\approx$ 6.6 minutes and likely possesses exceptionally strong magnetic fields ($\sim$ 400-600 MG) at its surface. Remarkably, we detect a significant period derivative of $(1.80\pm0.09)\times10^{-12}$ s/s, indicating that the white dwarf is spinning down, and a soft X-ray emission that is inconsistent with photospheric emission. As the presence of a mass-transferring stellar or brown dwarf companion is excluded by infrared photometry, the detected spin down and X-ray emission could be tell-tale signs of a magnetically driven wind or of interaction with circumstellar material, possibly originating from the fallback of gravitationally bound merger ejecta or from the tidal disruption of a planetary object. We also detect Balmer emission, which requires the presence of ionized hydrogen in the vicinity of the white dwarf, showing Doppler shifts as high as $\approx$ 2000 km s$^{-1}$. The unusual variability of the Balmer emission on the spin period of the white dwarf is consistent with the trapping of a half ring of ionised gas in the magnetosphere of the white dwarf.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of the Accretion Disk Formed in Prompt Collapse Mergers with Future Gravitational-Wave Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production site of heavy r-process elements, such as Gold and Uranium, is uncertain. Neutron star mergers are the only astrophysical phenomenon in which we have witnessed their formation. However, the amount of heavy elements resulting from the merger remains poorly constrained, mainly due to uncertainties on the mass and angular momentum of the disk formed in the merger remnant. Matter accretion from the disk is also thought to power gamma ray-bursts. We discover from numerical relativity simulations that the accretion disk influences the ringdown gravitational-wave signal produced by binaries that promptly collapse to black-hole at merger. We propose a method to \emph{directly} measure the mass of the accretion disk left during black hole formation in binary mergers using observatories such as the Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer with a relative error of 10\% for binaries at a distance of up to 30~Mpc, corresponding to an event rate of 0.001 to 0.25 events per year.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Investigation of Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows Detected by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts produce afterglows that can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum and can provide insight into the nature of their progenitors. While most telescopes that observe afterglows are designed to rapidly react to trigger information, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) continuously monitors sections of the sky at cadences between 30 minutes and 200 seconds. This provides TESS with the capability of serendipitously observing the optical afterglow of GRBs. We conduct the first extensive search for afterglows of known GRBs in archival TESS data reduced with the TESSreduce package, and detect 11 candidate signals that are temporally coincident with reported burst times. We classify 3 of these as high-likelihood GRB afterglows previously unknown to have been detected by TESS, one of which has no other afterglow detection reported on the Gamma-ray Coordinates Network. We classify 5 candidates as tentative and the remainder as unlikely. Using the afterglowpy package, we model each of the candidate light curves with a Gaussian and a top hat model to estimate burst parameters; we find that a mean time delay of $740\pm690\,$s between the explosion and afterglow onset is required to perform these fits. The high cadence and large field of view make TESS a powerful instrument for localising GRBs, with the potential to observe afterglows in cases when no other backup photometry is possible, and at timescales previously unreachable by optical telescopes.</description>

      <title>McFACTS I: Testing the LVK AGN channel with Monte Carlo For AGN Channel Testing &amp; Simulation (McFACTS)</title>

Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are a promising source of the binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed in gravitational waves with LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK). Constraining the AGN channel allows us to limit AGN parameter space (disk density, size, average lifetime) and nuclear star cluster (NSC) parameter space. Constraints on AGN and NSCs have implications for $\Lambda$CDM models of AGN feedback and models of AGN-driven SMBH merger and growth. Here we present several qualitative studies of the AGN channel using new public, open-source, fast, reproducible code \texttt{McFACTS}\footnote{https://github.com/mcfacts/mcfacts}:Monte Carlo for AGN channel Testing \&amp; Simulation. We demonstrate several important features for testing the AGN channel, including: i) growth to large mass IMBH is helped by the presence of migration traps or swamps, ii) flat BH initial mass functions highlight hierarchical merger features in the mass spectrum, iii) the ($q,\chi_{\rm eff}$) anti-correlation is a strong test of the bias to prograde mergers in the AGN channel, iv) spheroid encounters can drive a fraction of mergers with high in-plane spin components ($\chi_{\rm p}$), v) a high rate of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are driven by an initial population of embedded retrograde BH, vi) Both LVK and LISA are powerful probes of models of AGN disks and their embedded populations.</description>

      <title>Nebular spectra of kilonovae with detailed recombination rates -- I. Light r-process composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To investigate spectra of kilonovae in the NLTE phase (t &gt;=1week), we perform atomic calculations for dielectronic (DR) and radiative (RR) recombination rates for the light r-process elements: Se (Z = 34), Rb (Z = 37), Sr (Z = 38), Y (Z = 39), and Zr (Z = 40) using the HULLAC code. For the different elements, our results for the total rate coefficients for recombining from the ionization states of II to I, III to II, and IV to III vary between 10^-13-10^-9 cm^3/s, 10^-12-10^-10 cm^3/s, and 10^-13-10^-10 cm^3/s, respectively, at a temperature of T = 10,000 K. We also provide fits to the ground state photoionization cross sections of the various ions, finding larger and more slowly declining values with energy in comparison to the hydrogenic approximation. Using this new atomic data, we study the impact on kilonova model spectra at phases of t = 10 days and t = 25 days using the spectral synthesis code SUMO. Compared to models using the previous treatment of recombination as a constant rate, the new models show significant changes in ionization and temperature, and correspondingly, in emergent spectra. With the new rates, we find that Zr (Z = 40) plays a yet more dominant role in kilonova spectra for light r-process compositions. Further, we show that previously predicted mid-infrared (e.g. [Se III] 4.55 mum) and optical (e.g. [Rb I] 7802, 7949 A) lines disappear in the new model. Instead a strong [Se I] line is seen to be emerging at lambda=5.03 mum. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the detailed microphysics for modelling and interpreting the late-time kilonova spectra.</description>

      <title>Cosmogenic Neutrino Point Source and KM3-230213A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmogenic neutrinos (CNs) are produced by ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) interacting with cosmic background radiation. We investigated the properties of CN point/extended sources, i.e, the neutrino spectrum, and angular profile as functions of time, by assuming that UHECR sources are transient events, such as gamma-ray bursts. The properties depend much on the intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), but the angular extent is in general sub-degree, within which the CN flux can overshoot the diffuse CN flux in early time. The nearby CN point sources could be detected for the low IGMF case by future neutrino telescopes. The recent KM3-230213A event is possible to account for by a nearby transient CN source, rather than diffuse CN emission. Observations of CN point sources will provide a chance to search for UHECR sources.</description>

      <title>Plasma Instabilities Dominate Radioactive Transients Magnetic Fields: The self-confinement of leptons in Type Ia and Core-Collapse Supernovae, and Kilonovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The light curves of radioactive transients, such as supernovae and kilonovae, are powered by the decay of radioisotopes, which release high-energy leptons through $\beta^+$ and $\beta^-$ decays. These leptons deposit energy into the expanding ejecta. As the ejecta density decreases during expansion, the plasma becomes collisionless, with particle motion governed by electromagnetic forces. In such environments, strong or turbulent magnetic fields are thought to confine particles, though the origin of these fields and the confinement mechanism have remained unclear. Using fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we demonstrate that plasma instabilities can naturally confine high-energy leptons. These leptons generate magnetic fields through plasma streaming instabilities, even in the absence of pre-existing fields. The self-generated magnetic fields slow lepton diffusion, enabling confinement and transferring energy to thermal electrons and ions. Our results naturally explain the positron trapping inferred from late-time observations of thermonuclear and core-collapse supernovae. Furthermore, they suggest potential implications for electron dynamics in the ejecta of kilonovae. We also estimate synchrotron radio luminosities from positrons for Type Ia supernovae and find that such emission could only be detectable with next-generation radio observatories from a Galactic or local-group supernova in an environment without any circumstellar material.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the Detection of High-Redshift Gamma-Ray Bursts in the Era of EP and SVOM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are a promising probe of the high-redshift Universe, but their detection remains observationally challenging. In this work, we explore the detectability of high-$z$ GRBs by the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) aboard the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}) and the coded-mask gamma-ray imager (ECLAIRs) aboard the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}). Using a population synthesis model calibrated to $Swift$ GRB observations, we develop a tool to estimate high-$z$ GRB detection rates for instruments with specific energy bands and sensitivities. Our results indicate that \emph{EP}/WXT could detect $\sim5.1^{+3.4}_{-2.4}$ (with 68\% confidence level) GRBs annually at $z&gt;6$, compared to $\sim0.7^{+1.0}_{-0.4}$ $\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z&gt;6$ for \emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs. While \emph{EP} cannot independently determine redshifts (requiring optical/near-infrared follow-up), its assumed $\sim30\%$ follow-up efficiency yields $\sim1.5^{+1.0}_{-0.7}$ confirmed $z&gt;6$ GRBs annually. \emph{SVOM}, equipped with dedicated follow-up telescopes, will promptly identify high-$z$ candidates deserving deep near-infrared spectroscopy to ensure robust confirmation of high-$z$ GRBs. We anticipate that \emph{EP} and \emph{SVOM} will open new avenues for utilizing enlarged samples of high-$z$ GRBs to explore the early Universe. Moreover, \emph{EP} will assemble a substantial sample of soft, low-luminosity GRBs at low-to-intermediate redshifts, providing critical insights into the structure of GRB jets.</description>

      <title>Updated Earth Tomography Using Atmospheric Neutrinos at IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed a sample of high purity, primarily atmospheric, muon neutrino events over 11 years from all directions below the horizon, spanning the energy range 500 GeV to 100 TeV. While this sample was initially used for an eV-scale sterile neutrino search, its purity and spanned parameter space can also be used to perform an earth tomography. This flux of neutrinos traverses the earth and is attenuated in varying amounts depending on the energy and traversed column density of the event. By parameterizing the earth as multiple constant--density shells, IceCube can measure the upgoing neutrino flux as a function of the declination, yielding an inference of the density of each shell. In this talk, the latest sensitivities of this analysis and comparisons with the previous measurement are presented. In addition, the analysis procedure, details about the data sample, and systematic effects are also explained. This analysis is one of the latest, weak-force driven, non-gravitational, measurements of the earth's density and mass.</description>

      <title>A Torus Remnant Revealed by the Infrared Echo of TDE AT2019qiz: Implications for the Missing Energy and QPE Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AT2019qiz is the first standard optical tidal disruption event (TDE) with detection of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), providing strong evidence for TDE-QPE association. Moreover, it belongs to the rare subset of optical TDEs with prominent infrared (IR) echoes revealed by the multi-epoch photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The IR light curve shows an early bump, followed by a steady rise until the second-to-last epoch, after which it appears to enter a plateau phase. The dust temperature decreased until the fourth epoch and remains approximately constant for the subsequent five epochs. We have fitted the last five epochs using a convex dust ring model, resulting in an inner radius $&gt;1.2$ pc. Such a large radius greatly exceeds the inner radius of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) torus for a $10^6\,M_{\odot}$ black hole and thus could be a torus remnant with the inner part having vanished, further supporting the unified scenario of recently faded AGNs, TDEs, and QPEs. Consequently, a connection between QPEs and IR-bright TDEs is naturally expected. Moreover, the echo requires at least a peak bolometric luminosity of $(6.6, 9.5, 1.0)\times 44 \,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ assuming silicate, silicon carbide, and graphite dust grains, respectively, all of which are significantly higher than the peak optical blackbody luminosity. It adds to the accumulating evidence that the missing energy of TDEs may lie in the unobservable extreme UV. This work highlights the unique value of IR echoes in the study of TDEs and QPEs, and a promising prospect in the era of the Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor, the successor to WISE.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from the Sun can discover dark matter-electron scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We probe dark matter-electron scattering using high-energy neutrino observations from the Sun. Dark matter (DM) interacting with electrons can get captured inside the Sun. These captured DM may annihilate to produce different Standard Model (SM) particles. Neutrinos produced from these SM states can be observed in IceCube and DeepCore. Although there is no excess of neutrinos in the solar direction, we find that the current datasets of IceCube and DeepCore set the strongest constraint on the DM-electron scattering cross section in the DM mass range $10$\,GeV to $10^5$\,GeV. Therefore our work implies that future observations of the Sun by neutrino telescopes have the potential to discover the DM-electron interaction.</description>

      <title>Neutron matter from local chiral effective field theory interactions at large cutoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron matter is an important many-body system that provides valuable constraints for the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars. Neutron-matter calculations employing chiral effective field theory (EFT) interactions have been extensively used for this purpose. Among the various many-body methods, quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods stand out due to their nonperturbative nature and the achievable precision. However, QMC methods require local interactions as input, which leads to the appearance of stronger regulator artifacts compared to non-local interactions. To circumvent this, we employ large-cutoff interactions derived within chiral EFT ($400 \mev \leq \Lambda_c \leq 700 \mev$) for studies of pure neutron matter. These interactions have been adjusted to nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts, the triton binding energy, as well as the triton $\beta$-decay half-life. We find that regulator artifacts significantly decrease with increasing cutoff, leading to a significant reduction of uncertainties in the neutron-matter EOS. We discuss implications for the symmetry energy and demonstrate how our new calculations lead to a reduction in the theoretical uncertainty of predicted neutron-star radii by up to 30\% for low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>In-flight Characteristics and Modelling of the Instrumental Background of EP/FXT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The in-flight instrumental background of the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) onboard Einstein Probe (EP) mission is analysed in this work by utilizing observations collected during Performance Verification phase and subsequent dedicated filter wheel closed observations. The instrumental backgrounds of the two FXT modules are consistent with each other, with an average rate of $\sim 4\times10^{-2}$\,counts/s/keV in the 0.5--10\,keV band for each module. The background is nearly uniformly distributed across the detector area, with a minor increase ($&lt;8\%$) observed along rows. The spatial distribution shows significant modulation by the geomagnetic field. The spectral shapes remain unchanged in 0.5--10\,keV at different rates. The long-term temporal variation indicates a periodic change associated with the orbital precession ($\sim 57$ days). The innovative design of FXT full-frame readout mode enables simultaneous recording of events in both the imaging area (IMG) and the frame store area (FSA) of the pnCCD. FSA event rates show a strong linear correlation with the IMG, based on which the IMG instrumental background modelling is established.</description>
