      <title>Dynamics of antibody binding and neutralization during viral infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In vivo in infection, virions are constantly produced and die rapidly. In contrast, most antibody binding assays do not include such features. Motivated by this, we considered virions with n=100 binding sites in simple mathematical models with and without the production of virions. In the absence of viral production, at steady state, the distribution of virions by the number of sites bound is given by a binomial distribution, with the proportion being a simple function of antibody affinity (Kon/Koff) and concentration; this generalizes to a multinomial distribution in the case of two or more kinds of antibodies. In the presence of viral production, the role of affinity is replaced by an infection analog of affinity (IAA), with IAA=Kon/(Koff+dv+r), where dv is the virus decaying rate and r is the infection growth rate. Because in vivo dv can be large, the amount of binding as well as the effect of Koff on binding are substantially reduced. When neutralization is added, the effect of Koff is similarly small which may help explain the relatively high Koff reported for many antibodies. We next show that the n+2-dimensional model used for neutralization can be simplified to a 2-dimensional model. This provides some justification for the simple models that have been used in practice. A corollary of our results is that an unexpectedly large effect of Koff in vivo may point to mechanisms of neutralization beyond stoichiometry. Our results suggest reporting Kon and Koff separately, rather than focusing on affinity, until the situation is better resolved both experimentally and theoretically.</description>

      <title>MTLComb: multi-task learning combining regression and classification tasks for joint feature selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is a learning paradigm that enables the simultaneous training of multiple communicating algorithms. Although MTL has been successfully applied to ether regression or classification tasks alone, incorporating mixed types of tasks into a unified MTL framework remains challenging, primarily due to variations in the magnitudes of losses associated with different tasks. This challenge, particularly evident in MTL applications with joint feature selection, often results in biased selections. To overcome this obstacle, we propose a provable loss weighting scheme that analytically determines the optimal weights for balancing regression and classification tasks. This scheme significantly mitigates the otherwise biased feature selection. Building upon this scheme, we introduce MTLComb, an MTL algorithm and software package encompassing optimization procedures, training protocols, and hyperparameter estimation procedures. MTLComb is designed for learning shared predictors among tasks of mixed types. To showcase the efficacy of MTLComb, we conduct tests on both simulated data and biomedical studies pertaining to sepsis and schizophrenia.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Protein Language Model for Unified Molecular Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protein language models have demonstrated significant potential in the field of protein engineering. However, current protein language models primarily operate at the residue scale, which limits their ability to provide information at the atom level. This limitation prevents us from fully exploiting the capabilities of protein language models for applications involving both proteins and small molecules. In this paper, we propose ESM-AA (ESM All-Atom), a novel approach that enables atom-scale and residue-scale unified molecular modeling. ESM-AA achieves this by pre-training on multi-scale code-switch protein sequences and utilizing a multi-scale position encoding to capture relationships among residues and atoms. Experimental results indicate that ESM-AA surpasses previous methods in protein-molecule tasks, demonstrating the full utilization of protein language models. Further investigations reveal that through unified molecular modeling, ESM-AA not only gains molecular knowledge but also retains its understanding of proteins.</description>

      <title>PPFlow: Target-aware Peptide Design with Torsional Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Therapeutic peptides have proven to have great pharmaceutical value and potential in recent decades. However, methods of AI-assisted peptide drug discovery are not fully explored. To fill the gap, we propose a target-aware peptide design method called \textsc{PPFlow}, based on conditional flow matching on torus manifolds, to model the internal geometries of torsion angles for the peptide structure design. Besides, we establish a protein-peptide binding dataset named PPBench2024 to fill the void of massive data for the task of structure-based peptide drug design and to allow the training of deep learning methods. Extensive experiments show that PPFlow reaches state-of-the-art performance in tasks of peptide drug generation and optimization in comparison with baseline models, and can be generalized to other tasks including docking and side-chain packing.</description>

      <title>Molecular docking via quantum approximate optimization algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular docking plays a pivotal role in drug discovery and precision medicine, enabling us to understand protein functions and advance novel therapeutics. Here, we introduce a potential alternative solution to this problem, the digitized-counterdiabatic quantum approximate optimization algorithm (DC-QAOA), which utilizes counterdiabatic driving and QAOA on a quantum computer. Our method was applied to analyze diverse biological systems, including the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complex with PM-2-020B, the DPP-4 complex with piperidine fused imidazopyridine 34, and the HIV-1 gp120 complex with JP-III-048. The DC-QAOA exhibits superior performance, providing more accurate and biologically relevant docking results, especially for larger molecular docking problems. Moreover, QAOA-based algorithms demonstrate enhanced hardware compatibility in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, indicating their potential for efficient implementation under practical docking scenarios. Our findings underscore quantum computing's potential in drug discovery and offer valuable insights for optimizing protein-ligand docking processes.</description>
