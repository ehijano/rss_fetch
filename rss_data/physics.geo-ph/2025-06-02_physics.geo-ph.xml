      <title>DiffPINN: Generative diffusion-initialized physics-informed neural networks for accelerating seismic wavefield representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a powerful framework for seismic wavefield modeling, yet they typically require time-consuming retraining when applied to different velocity models. Moreover, their training can suffer from slow convergence due to the complexity of of the wavefield solution. To address these challenges, we introduce a latent diffusion-based strategy for rapid and effective PINN initialization. First, we train multiple PINNs to represent frequency-domain scattered wavefields for various velocity models, then flatten each trained network's parameters into a one-dimensional vector, creating a comprehensive parameter dataset. Next, we employ an autoencoder to learn latent representations of these parameter vectors, capturing essential patterns across diverse PINN's parameters. We then train a conditional diffusion model to store the distribution of these latent vectors, with the corresponding velocity models serving as conditions. Once trained, this diffusion model can generate latent vectors corresponding to new velocity models, which are subsequently decoded by the autoencoder into complete PINN parameters. Experimental results indicate that our method significantly accelerates training and maintains high accuracy across in-distribution and out-of-distribution velocity scenarios.</description>

      <title>Generalized nearest-neighbor distance and Hawkes point process modeling applied to mining induced seismicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling seismic activity rates and clustering plays an important role in studies of induced seismicity associated with mining and other resource extraction operations. This is critical for understanding the physical and statistical characteristics of seismicity and assessing the associated hazard. In this work, we introduce the generalization of the Nearest-Neighbor Distance (NND) method by incorporating an arbitrary distribution function for the frequency-magnitude statistics of seismic events. Operating within a rescaled hyperspace that includes spatial, temporal, and magnitude domains, the NND method provides an effective framework for examining seismic clustering. By integrating a mixture of the two tapered Pareto distributions, the generalized NND approach accommodates deviations from standard frequency-magnitude scaling when studying the clustering properties of seismicity. In addition, the application of the temporal Hawkes process to model the mining seismicity rate reveals that the seismicity is primarily driven by external factors and lacks pronounced interevent triggering. A case study from a potash mine in Saskatchewan is presented to illustrate the application of the generalized NND method and the Hawkes process to estimate the clustering properties and occurrence rates of induced microseismicity. The implications of observed temporal variations and clustering behavior are discussed, providing insights into the nature of induced seismicity within mining environments.</description>

      <title>Controlled Spherulitic Crystal Growth from Salt Mixtures: A Universal Mechanism for Complex Crystal Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherulites are complex polycrystalline structures that form through the self-assembly of small aggregated nanocrystals starting from a central point and growing radially outward. Despite their wide prevalence and relevance to fields ranging from geology to medicine, the dynamics of spherulitic crystallization and the conditions required for such growth remain ill-understood. Here, we report on the conditions to induce controlled spherulitic growth of sodium sulfate from evaporating aqueous solutions of sulfate salt mixtures at room temperature. We reveal that introducing divalent metal ions in the solution cause spherulitic growth of sodium sulfate. For the first time, we quantify the supersaturation at the onset of spherulitic growth from salt mixtures and determine the growth kinetics. Our results show that the nonclassical nucleation process induces the growth of sodium sulfate spherulites at high supersaturation in highly viscous solutions. The latter reaches approximately 111 Pa$\cdot$s, triggered by the divalent ions, at the onset of spherulite precipitation leading to a diffusion limited growth. We also show that spherulites, which are metastable structures formed under out-of-equilibrium conditions, can evolve into other shapes when supersaturation decreases as growth continues at different evaporation rates. These findings shed light on the conditions under which spherulites form and offer practical strategies for tuning their morphology.</description>

      <title>Electronic Temperature-Driven Phase Stability and Structural Evolution of Iron at High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Gibbs free-energy phase diagrams for compressed iron within a pressure range of 20 to 300 GPa and electronic temperature up to 3 eV obtained using finite-temperature density functional and density functional perturbation theories. Our results for bcc, fcc, and hcp phases predict solid-solid phase transitions in iron driven purely by electronic entropy and temperature. We found a phase transition from hcp to bcc at pressures above 200 GPa, which depends on the electronic temperature. An experimental observation of the stability of the bcc phase above 200 GPa by X-ray Free Electron Laser has recently been reported.</description>

      <title>Should We Expect Further Acceleration of the Earth's Rotation in the Coming Years?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06343v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, it has been suggested in the literature that the difference between universal and coordinated time UT1-UTC could reach a large positive value in the coming years (Agnew 2024). This would make it necessary to introduce a negative leap second into UTC for the first time in history, which in turn will cause serious problems in time keeping and synchronization systems around the world. Based on the latest Earth's rotation and universal time data published by the international Earth rotation and reference systems service (IERS) and their prediction, in this paper, we have shown that the acceleration trend observed over the past four years is likely to return to slowing down soon. Therefore, fears about the possible need to introduce a negative leap second into the UTC time scale in the next few years in the light of recent observational data have seen unfounded.</description>

      <title>On Godunov-type finite volume methods for seismic wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational complexity of simulating seismic waves demands continual exploration of more efficient numerical methods. While Finite Volume methods are widely acclaimed for tackling general nonlinear hyperbolic (wave) problems, their application in realistic seismic wave simulation remains uncommon, with rare investigations in the literature. Furthermore, seismic wavefields are influenced by sharp subsurface interfaces frequently encountered in realistic models, which could, in principle, be adequately solved with Finite Volume methods. In this study, we delved into two Finite Volume (FV) methods to assess their efficacy and competitiveness in seismic wave simulations, compared to traditional Finite Difference schemes. We investigated Gudunov-type FV methods: an upwind method called wave propagation algorithm (WPA), and a Central-Upwind type method (CUp). Our numerical analysis uncovered that these finite volume methods could provide less dispersion (albeit increased dissipation) compared to finite differences for seismic problems characterized by velocity profiles with abrupt transitions in the velocity. However, when applied to more realistic seismic models, finite volume methods yielded unfavorable outcomes compared to finite difference methods, the latter offering lower computational costs and higher accuracy. This highlights that despite the potential advantages of finite volume methods, such as their conservative nature and aptitude for accurately capturing shock waves in specific contexts, our results indicate that they are only advantageous for seismic simulations when unrealistic abrupt transitions are present in the velocity models in the velocity models.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Seismic Artificial Intelligence with Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has transformed the seismic community with deep learning models (DLMs) that are trained to complete specific tasks within workflows. However, there is still lack of robust evaluation frameworks for evaluating and comparing DLMs. We address this gap by designing an evaluation framework that jointly incorporates two crucial aspects: performance uncertainty and learning efficiency. To target these aspects, we meticulously construct the training, validation, and test splits using a clustering method tailored to seismic data and enact an expansive training design to segregate performance uncertainty arising from stochastic training processes and random data sampling. The framework's ability to guard against misleading declarations of model superiority is demonstrated through evaluation of PhaseNet [1], a popular seismic phase picking DLM, under 3 training approaches. Our framework helps practitioners choose the best model for their problem and set performance expectations by explicitly analyzing model performance with uncertainty at varying budgets of training data.</description>
