      <title>Applicability of the Minimal Dominating Set for Influence Maximisation in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal dominating set (MDS) is a well-established concept in network controllability and has been successfully applied in various domains, including sensor placement, network resilience, and epidemic containment. In this study, we adapt the local-improvement MDS routine and explore its potential for enhancing seed selection for influence maximisation in multilayer networks (MLN). We employ the Linear Threshold Model (LTM), which offers an intuitive representation of influence spread or opinion dynamics by accounting for peer influence accumulation. To ensure interpretability, we utilise rank-refining seed selection methods, with the results further filtered with MDS. Our findings reveal that incorporating MDS into the seed selection process improves spread only within a specific range of situations. Notably, the improvement is observed for larger seed set budgets, lower activation thresholds, and when an "AND" strategy is used to aggregate influence across network layers. This scenario reflects situations where an individual does not require the majority of their acquaintances to hold a target opinion, but must be influenced across all social circles.</description>

      <title>Crisis, Country, and Party Lines: Politicians' Misinformation Behavior and Public Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Politicians with large media visibility and social media audiences have a significant influence on public discourse. Consequently, their dissemination of misinformation can have profound implications for society. This study investigated the misinformation-sharing behavior of 3,277 politicians and associated public engagement by using data from X (formerly Twitter) during 2020-2021. The analysis was grounded in a novel and comprehensive dataset including over 400,000 tweets covering multiple levels of governance-national executive, national legislative, and regional executive-in Germany, Italy, the UK, and the USA, representing distinct clusters of misinformation resilience. Striking cross-country differences in misinformation-sharing behavior and public engagement were observed. Politicians in Italy (4.9%) and the USA (2.2%) exhibited the highest rates of misinformation sharing, primarily among far-right and conservative legislators. Public engagement with misinformation also varied significantly. In the USA, misinformation attracted over 2.5 times the engagement of reliable information. In Italy, engagement levels were similar across content types. Italy is unique in crisis-related misinformation, particularly regarding COVID-19, which surpassed general misinformation in both prevalence and audience engagement. These insights underscore the critical roles of political affiliation, governance level, and crisis contexts in shaping the dynamics of misinformation. The study expands the literature by providing a cross-national, multi-level perspective, shedding light on how political actors influence the proliferation of misinformation during crisis.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Expansion for Hypergraph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypergraph, with its powerful ability to capture higher-order relationships, has gained significant attention recently. Consequently, many hypergraph representation learning methods have emerged to model the complex relationships among hypergraphs. In general, these methods leverage classic expansion methods to convert hypergraphs into weighted or bipartite graphs, and further employ message passing mechanisms to model the complex structures within hypergraphs. However, classical expansion methods are designed in straightforward manners with fixed edge weights, resulting in information loss or redundancy. In light of this, we design a novel clique expansion-based Adaptive Expansion method called AdE to adaptively expand hypergraphs into weighted graphs that preserve the higher-order structure information. Specifically, we introduce a novel Global Simulation Network to select two representative nodes for adaptively symbolizing each hyperedge and connect the rest of the nodes within the same hyperedge to the corresponding selected nodes. Afterward, we design a distance-aware kernel function, dynamically adjusting edge weights to ensure similar nodes within a hyperedge are connected with larger weights. Extensive theoretical justifications and empirical experiments over seven benchmark hypergraph datasets demonstrate that AdE has excellent rationality, generalization, and effectiveness compared to classic expansion models.</description>

      <title>A BERT Based Hybrid Recommendation System For Academic Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universities serve as a hub for academic collaboration, promoting the exchange of diverse ideas and perspectives among students and faculty through interdisciplinary dialogue. However, as universities expand in size, conventional networking approaches via student chapters, class groups, and faculty committees become cumbersome. To address this challenge, an academia-specific profile recommendation system is proposed to connect like-minded stakeholders within any university community. This study evaluates three techniques: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and a hybrid approach to generate effective recommendations. Due to the unlabelled nature of the dataset, Affinity Propagation cluster-based relabelling is performed to understand the grouping of similar profiles. The hybrid model demonstrated superior performance, evidenced by its similarity score, Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), achieving an optimal balance between diversity and relevance in recommendations. Furthermore, the optimal model has been implemented as a mobile application, which dynamically suggests relevant profiles based on users' skills and collaboration interests, incorporating contextual understanding. The potential impact of this application is significant, as it promises to enhance networking opportunities within large academic institutions through the deployment of intelligent recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Highly engaging events reveal semantic and temporal compression in online community discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: People nowadays express their opinions in online spaces, using different forms of interactions such as posting, sharing and discussing with one another. How do these digital traces change in response to events happening in the real world? We leverage Reddit conversation data, exploiting its community-based structure, to elucidate how offline events influence online user interactions and behavior. Online conversations, as posts and comments, are analysed along their temporal and semantic dimensions. Conversations tend to become repetitive with a more limited vocabulary, develop at a faster pace, and feature heightened emotions. As the event approaches, the shifts occurring in conversations are reflected in the users' dynamics. Users become more active and they exchange information with a growing audience, despite using a less rich vocabulary and repetitive messages. The recurring patterns we discovered are persistent across a wide range of events and several contexts, representing a fingerprint of how online dynamics change in response to real-world occurrences.</description>

      <title>Evolving Hate Speech Online: An Adaptive Framework for Detection and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of social media platforms has led to an increase in the spread of hate speech, particularly targeting vulnerable communities. Unfortunately, existing methods for automatically identifying and blocking toxic language rely on pre-constructed lexicons, making them reactive rather than adaptive. As such, these approaches become less effective over time, especially when new communities are targeted with slurs not included in the original datasets. To address this issue, we present an adaptive approach that uses word embeddings to update lexicons and develop a hybrid model that adjusts to emerging slurs and new linguistic patterns. This approach can effectively detect toxic language, including intentional spelling mistakes employed by aggressors to avoid detection. Our hybrid model, which combines BERT with lexicon-based techniques, achieves an accuracy of 95% for most state-of-the-art datasets. Our work has significant implications for creating safer online environments by improving the detection of toxic content and proactively updating the lexicon. Content Warning: This paper contains examples of hate speech that may be triggering.</description>
