      <title>Strong conciseness and equationally Noetherian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A word $w$ is said to be concise in a class of groups if, for every $G$ in that class such that the set of $w$-values $w\{G\}$ is finite, the verbal subgroup $w(G)$ is also finite. In the context of profinite groups, the notion of strong conciseness imposes a more demanding condition on $w$, requiring that $w(G)$ is finite whenever $|w\{G\}|&lt; 2^{\aleph_0}$. We investigate the relation between these two properties and the notion of equationally Noetherian groups, by proving that in a profinite group $G$ with a dense equationally Noetherian subgroup, $w\{G\}$ is finite whenever $|w\{G\}|&lt; 2^{\aleph_0}$. Consequently, we conclude that every word is strongly concise in the classes of profinite linear groups, pro-$\mathcal{C}$ completions of residually $\mathcal{C}$ linear groups and pro-$\mathcal{C}$ completions of virtually abelian-by-polycyclic groups, thereby extending well-known conciseness properties of these classes of groups.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give several equivalent characterisations of the maximal pro-2 quotients of real projective groups. In particular, for pro-2 real projective groups we provide a presentation in terms of generators and relations, and a purely cohomological characterisation. As a consequence we explicitly reconstruct such groups from their mod 2 cohomology rings.</description>

      <title>Hybrid spherical designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spherical $t$-designs are finite point sets on the unit sphere that enable exact integration of polynomials of degree at most $t$ via equal-weight quadrature. This concept has recently been extended to spherical $t$-design curves by the use of normalized path integrals. However, explicit examples of such curves are rare.
  We construct new spherical $t$-design curves for small $t$ based on the edges of a distinct subclass of convex polytopes. We then introduce hybrid $t$-designs that combine points and curves for exact polynomial integration of higher degree. Our constructions are based on the vertices and edges of dual pairs of convex polytopes and polynomial invariants of their symmetry group. A notable result is a hybrid $t$-design for $t=19$.</description>

      <title>On a local property of infinite Galois extensions implying the Northcott property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2001, Bombieri and Zannier studied the Northcott property (N) for infinite Galois extensions of the rationals. In particular they provided a local property of the extensions that imply property (N). Later, Checcoli and Fehm demonstrated the existence of infinite extensions satisfying this local property. In this article, we establish two main results. First, we show that this local property, unlike property (N), is not preserved under finite extensions. Second, we show that, for an infinite Galois extension of Q, such local property cannot be read on the Galois group. More precisely, we exhibit several profinite groups that are realizable over Q by fields that do not satisfy the local property.</description>

      <title>Homeomorphism groups of basilica, rabbit and airplane Julia sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The airplane, the basilica and the Douady rabbit (and, more generally, rabbits with more than two ears) are well-known Julia sets of complex quadratic polynomials.
  In this paper we study the groups of all homeomorphisms of such fractals and of all automorphisms of their laminations.
  In particular, we identify them with some kaleidoscopic group or universal groups and thus realize them as Polish permutation groups.
  From these identifications, we deduce algebraic, topological and geometric properties of these groups.</description>

      <title>The quasi-isometry invariance of the Coset Intersection Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$ consisting of a group and finite collection of subgroups, we introduce a simplicial $G$-complex $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ called the coset intersection complex. We prove that the quasi-isometry type and the homotopy type of $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ are quasi-isometric invariants of the group pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$. Classical properties of $\mathcal{P}$ in $G$ correspond to topological or geometric properties of $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$, such as having finite height, having finite width, being almost malnormal, admiting a malnormal core, or having thickness of order one. As applications, we obtain that a number of algebraic properties of $\mathcal{P}$ in $G$ are quasi-isometry invariants of the pair $(G,\mathcal{P})$. For a certain class of right-angled Artin groups and their maximal parabolic subgroups, we show that the complex $\mathcal{K}(G,\mathcal{P})$ is quasi-isometric to the Extension graph; in particular, it is quasi-isometric to a tree.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Preservations of Ulam Stability-type Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02474v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show some preservation results of amenably extending strongly Ulam stable groups under mild decay assumptions, including quantitative preservation of asymptotic bounds under the assumption that the modulus of stability is H\"older continuous of exponent $s&gt;\frac 1 2$ at 0, utilizing some simplistic integral estimates. Additionally, we show some partial results around inductive preservation of modulus bounds in infinite dimensions using these integral estimates, as well as strong quantitative preservation in the finite dimensional case. This implies the existence of $\mathfrak{U}$ uniformly stable existential closures among groups with sufficiently large Lipschitz estimates of any countable group. Finally, we show quantitative control preserving difficulty of approximation of maps over stable groups on diagonally embedding into higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>A new approach to strong convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16026v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family of random matrices $\boldsymbol{X}^N=(X_1^N,\ldots,X_d^N)$ is said to converge strongly to a family of bounded operators $\boldsymbol{x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$ when $\|P(\boldsymbol{X}^N,\boldsymbol{X}^{N*})\|\to\|P(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{x}^*)\|$ for every noncommutative polynomial $P$. This phenomenon plays a key role in several recent breakthroughs on random graphs, geometry, and operator algebras. However, proofs of strong convergence are notoriously delicate and have relied largely on problem-specific methods.
  In this paper, we develop a new approach to strong convergence that uses only soft arguments. Our method exploits the fact that for many natural models, the expected trace of $P(\boldsymbol{X}^N,\boldsymbol{X}^{N*})$ is a rational function of $\frac{1}{N}$ whose lowest order asymptotics are easily understood. We develop a general technique to deduce strong convergence directly from these inputs using the inequality of A. and V. Markov for univariate polynomials and elementary Fourier analysis. To illustrate the method, we develop the following applications.
  1. We give a short proof of the result of Friedman that random regular graphs have a near-optimal spectral gap, and obtain a sharp understanding of the large deviations probabilities of the second eigenvalue.
  2. We prove a strong quantitative form of the strong convergence property of random permutation matrices due to Bordenave and Collins.
  3. We extend the above to any stable representation of the symmetric group, providing many new examples of the strong convergence phenomenon.</description>

      <title>What makes math problems hard for reinforcement learning: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a long-standing conjecture from combinatorial group theory, we explore, from multiple perspectives, the challenges of finding rare instances carrying disproportionately high rewards. Based on lessons learned in the context defined by the Andrews-Curtis conjecture, we propose algorithmic enhancements and a topological hardness measure with implications for a broad class of search problems. As part of our study, we also address several open mathematical questions. Notably, we demonstrate the length reducibility of all but two presentations in the Akbulut-Kirby series (1981), and resolve various potential counterexamples in the Miller-Schupp series (1991), including three infinite subfamilies.</description>
