      <title>Sensitivity Analysis of emissions Markets: A Discrete-Time Radner Equilibrium Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emissions markets play a crucial role in reducing pollution by encouraging firms to minimize costs. However, their structure heavily relies on the decisions of policymakers, on the future economic activities, and on the availability of abatement technologies. This study examines how changes in regulatory standards, firms' abatement costs, and emissions levels affect allowance prices and firms' efforts to reduce emissions. This is done in a Radner equilibrium framework encompassing inter-temporal decision-making, uncertainty, and a comprehensive assessment of the market dynamics and outcomes. The results of this research have the potential to assist policymakers in enhancing the structure and efficiency of emissions trading systems, through an in-depth comprehension of the reactions of market stakeholders towards different market situations.</description>

      <title>Do LLM Personas Dream of Bull Markets? Comparing Human and AI Investment Strategies Through the Lens of the Five-Factor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to adopt a personality and behave in a human-like manner. There is a large body of research that investigates the behavioural impacts of personality in less obvious areas such as investment attitudes or creative decision making. In this study, we investigated whether an LLM persona with a specific Big Five personality profile would perform an investment task similarly to a human with the same personality traits. We used a simulated investment task to determine if these results could be generalised into actual behaviours. In this simulated environment, our results show these personas produced meaningful behavioural differences in all assessed categories, with these behaviours generally being consistent with expectations derived from human research. We found that LLMs are able to generalise traits into expected behaviours in three areas: learning style, impulsivity and risk appetite while environmental attitudes could not be accurately represented. In addition, we showed that LLMs produce behaviour that is more reflective of human behaviour in a simulation environment compared to a survey environment.</description>

      <title>Social Dynamics of Consumer Response: A Unified Framework Integrating Statistical Physics and Marketing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how consumers react to advertising inputs is essential for marketers aiming to optimize advertising strategies and improve campaign effectiveness. This study examines the complex nature of consumer behaviour by applying theoretical frameworks derived from physics and social psychology. We present an innovative equation that captures the relation between spending on advertising and consumer response, using concepts such as symmetries, scaling laws, and phase transitions. By validating our equation against well-known models such as the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations, we prove its effectiveness in accurately representing the complexity of consumer response dynamics. The analysis emphasizes the importance of key model parameters, such as marketing effectiveness, response sensitivity, and behavioural sensitivity, in influencing consumer behaviour. The work explores the practical implications for advertisers and marketers, as well as discussing the limitations and future research directions. In summary, this study provides a thorough framework for comprehending and forecasting consumer reactions to advertising, which has implications for optimizing advertising strategies and allocating resources.</description>

      <title>Is the annualized compounded return of Medallion over 35%?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a challenge to estimate fund performance by compounded returns. Arguably, it is incorrect to use yearly returns directly for compounding, with reported annualized return of above 60% for Medallion for the 31 years up to 2018. We propose an estimation based on fund sizes and trading profits and obtain a compounded return of 31.8% before fees. Alternatively, we suggest using the manager's wealth as a proxy and arriving at a compounded growth rate of 25.6% for Simons for the 33 years up to 2020. We conclude that the annualized compounded return of Medallion before fees is probably under 35%. Our findings have implications for correctly estimating fund performance.</description>

      <title>Financial Statement Analysis with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can successfully perform financial statement analysis in a way similar to a professional human analyst. We provide standardized and anonymous financial statements to GPT4 and instruct the model to analyze them to determine the direction of firms' future earnings. Even without narrative or industry-specific information, the LLM outperforms financial analysts in its ability to predict earnings changes directionally. The LLM exhibits a relative advantage over human analysts in situations when the analysts tend to struggle. Furthermore, we find that the prediction accuracy of the LLM is on par with a narrowly trained state-of-the-art ML model. LLM prediction does not stem from its training memory. Instead, we find that the LLM generates useful narrative insights about a company's future performance. Lastly, our trading strategies based on GPT's predictions yield a higher Sharpe ratio and alphas than strategies based on other models. Our results suggest that LLMs may take a central role in analysis and decision-making.</description>
