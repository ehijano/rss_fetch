      <title>Full counting statistics and first-passage times in quantum Markovian processes: Ensemble relations, metastability, and fluctuation theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for characterizing fluctuations in quantum transport and nonequilibrium thermodynamics using two complementary approaches: full counting statistics and first-passage times. Focusing on open quantum systems governed by Markovian Lindblad dynamics, we derive general ensemble relations that connect the two approaches at all times, and we clarify how the steady states reached at long times relate to those reached at large jump counts. In regimes of metastability, long-lived intermediate states cause violations of experimentally testable cumulant relations, as we discuss. We also formulate a fluctuation theorem governing the probability of rare fluctuations in the first-passage time distributions based on results from full counting statistics. Our results apply to general integer-valued trajectory observables that do not necessarily increase monotonically in time. Three illustrative applications, a two-state emitter, a driven qubit, and a variant of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, highlight the physical implications of our results and provide guidelines for practical calculations. Our framework provides a complete picture of first-passage time statistics in Markovian quantum systems, encompassing multiple earlier results, and it has direct implications for current experiments in quantum optics, superconducting circuits, and nanoscale heat engines.</description>

      <title>Linear approximations of large deviations: Cubic diffusion test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for approximating the large deviation rate function of time-integrated observables of diffusion processes, used in statistical physics to characterize the fluctuations of nonequilibrium systems. The method is based on linearizing the effective process associated with the large deviations of the process and observable considered, and is tested for a simple one-dimensional nonlinear diffusion model involving a cubic drift. The results show that the linear approximation compares well with the exact rate function, especially in the large fluctuation regime, and that its accuracy is related to the way the linearized process localizes in space. Possible extensions and applications to more complex diffusion models are proposed for future work.</description>

      <title>Odd relaxation in three-dimensional Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical works predict a hierarchy of long-lived, non-hydrodynamic modes in two-dimensional Fermi liquids arising from the feature -- supposedly unique to two dimensions -- that relaxation by head-on scattering is not efficient in the presence of Pauli blocking. This leads to a parity-based separation of scattering rates, with odd-parity modes relaxing much more slowly than even-parity ones. In this work, we establish that a similar effect exists in isotropic three-dimensional Fermi liquids, even though relaxation does not proceed solely by head-on scattering. We show that while the relaxation rates of even and odd modes in 3D share the same leading-order $\sim T^2$ low-temperature scaling typical of Fermi liquids, their magnitudes differ, with odd-parity modes relaxing more slowly than even ones for a broad class of interactions. We find a relative difference between odd-and even-parity relaxation rates as large as $40\%$ just by Pauli blocking alone, with a strong additional dependence on the scattering potential, such that the odd-even staggering is further enhanced by interactions that favor large-angle scattering. We identify signatures of these odd-parity relaxation rates in the static transverse conductivity as well as the transverse collective mode structure. Our results establish the unexpected existence of a tomographic-like regime in higher-dimensional Fermi liquids and suggest experimental probes via transport measurements.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Uplifts: Parisi-Sourlas with Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theories (CFTs) play a key role in critical phenomena by modifying scaling behaviors and generating new universality classes. We introduce Parisi-Sourlas (PS) supersymmetry in the presence of extended operators and demonstrate that any $p$-dimensional defect in a CFT$_d$ can be uplifted to a defect in a PS-supersymmetric CFT$_{d+2}$. Surprisingly, there are actually two distinct uplifted defects--of dimensions $p$ and $p+2$--which reduce to the original one. We show how this reduction works for correlators with insertions both in the bulk and on the defect. As a byproduct, we find new relations between defect conformal blocks in dimensions $d$ and $d+2$. We further show that the reduction of the $p$-dimensional defect implies and extend a "global symmetry reduction" previously considered in the literature. Finally, we provide various examples of these uplifts, including perturbative computations in epsilon expansion of the uplift of the Ising magnetic line defect, as well as exact computations of observables in the four-dimensional uplift of minimal models with boundaries.</description>

      <title>Violation of kinetic uncertainty relation in maser heat engines: Role of spontaneous emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the kinetic uncertainty relation (KUR)-a fundamental trade-off between dynamical activity and current fluctuations-in two configurations of a maser heat engine. We find that KUR violations arise only in one model. This asymmetry originates from spontaneous emission, which breaks the structural symmetry between the configurations and modifies their coherence dynamics. While we analyze several contributing factors-including statistical signatures such as the Fano factor and the ratio of dynamical activity to current-our results show that the decisive mechanism is the slower decoherence in one configuration, which enables quantum violations of the classical steady-state KUR bound. By contrast, the faster coherence decay in the other configuration suppresses such violations, driving it closer to classical behavior. These findings highlight the critical role of decoherence mechanisms in determining fundamental thermodynamic bounds and provide insights for the design of quantum heat engines in which the control of decoherence is central to suppressing fluctuations and enhancing reliable performance.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of fixation probability in a population with fluctuating size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many biological processes, the size of a population changes stochastically with time, and recent work in the context of cancer and bacterial growth have focused on the situation when the mean population size grows exponentially. Here, motivated by the evolutionary process of genetic hitchhiking in a selectively neutral population, we consider a model in which the mean size of the population increases linearly. We are interested in understanding how the fluctuations in the population size impact the first passage statistics, and study the fixation probability that a mutant reaches frequency one by a given time in a population whose size follows a conditional Wright-Fisher process. We find that at sufficiently short and long times, the fixation probability can be approximated by a model that ignores temporal correlations between the inverse of the population size, but at intermediate times, it is significantly smaller than that obtained by neglecting the correlations. Our analytical and numerical study of the correlation functions show that the conditional Wright-Fisher process of interest is neither a stationary nor a Gaussian process; we also find that the variance of the inverse population size initially increases linearly with time $t$ and then decreases as $t^{-2}$ at intermediate times followed by an exponential decay at longer times. Our work emphasizes the importance of temporal correlations in populations with fluctuating size that are often ignored in population-genetic studies of biological evolution.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba Effect in Dissipative Spin Chains at Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Mpemba Effect (QME) is the quantum counterpart of the classical Mpemba effect--a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a system initially at a higher temperature relax to thermal eauilibrium faster than one at a lower temperature. In this work, we investigate the QME in one-dimensional quantum spin chains coupled to a Markovian environment. By analyzing the full relaxation dynamics governed by the Lindblad master equation, we reveal the emergence of a strong quantum Mpemba effect at quantum critical points. Our findings reveal that criticality enhances the non-monotonic dependence of relaxation times on the initial temperature, leading to anomalously accelerated equilibration. This phenomenon is directly linked to the structure of the Liouvillian spectrum at criticality and the associated overlaps with the initial states. These findings demonstrate that quantum phase transitions could provide a natural setting for realizing and enhancing non-equilibrium phenomena in open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform an extensive investigation of the localization properties of the eigenmodes of the Laplace and adjacency matrix for one-dimensional random geometric graphs. We evaluate the density of states, the probability distribution of the participation ratio and its relation to the eigenvalue. By disentangling the influence of system size, graph component size distribution, mean degree of nodes, network motifs, and degeneracy, we provide a comprehensive understanding of this system. We compare our findings to ordered graphs with the same mean degree and to one-dimensional tight-binding models.</description>

      <title>Numerical Integration of stochastic differential equations: The Heun Algorithm Revisited and It\^o-Stratonovich Calculus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widely used Heun algorithm for the numerical integration of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is critically re-examined. We discuss and evaluate several alternative implementations, motivated by the fact that the standard Heun scheme is constructed from a low-order integrator. The convergence, stability, and equilibrium properties of these alternatives are assessed through extensive numerical simulations. Our results confirm that the standard Heun scheme remains a benchmark integration algorithm for SDEs due to its robust performance. As a byproduct of this analysis, we also disprove a previous claim in the literature regarding the strong convergence of the Heun scheme.</description>

      <title>The charge-carrier trapping effect on 1/f noise in monolayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frequency exponent of 1/f noise in graphene-boron nitride heterostructures is known to have multiple extrema in its dependence on the charge carrier concentration. This behavior is explained in the present paper as a result of the charge carrier trapping by impurities in the boron nitride. A kinetic equation for the charge carriers subject to trapping and interacting with acoustic phonons is derived. This equation is solved numerically, and the equilibrium solutions are used to evaluate the frequency exponent according to the quantum theory of 1/f noise. It is found that the frequency exponent does develop several minima and maxima, provided that the trapping probability is sufficiently wide and has a threshold with respect to the charge carrier energy. A detailed comparison with the experimental data is made, and the results are used to estimate the energy threshold and the trapping cross-section.</description>

      <title>Temperature dependence in Krylov space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the recursion method applied to a generic 2pt function of a quantum system and show, in full generality, that the temperature dependence of the corresponding Lanczos coefficients is governed by integrable dynamics. After an appropriate change of variables, Lanczos coefficients with even and odd indices are described by two independent Toda chains, related at the level of the initial conditions. Consistency of the resulting equations can be used to show that certain scale-invariant models necessarily have a degenerate spectrum. We dub this self-consistency-based approach the ''Krylov bootstrap''. The known analytic behavior of the Toda chain at late times translates into analytic control over the 2pt function and Krylov complexity at very low temperatures. We also discuss the behavior of Lanczos coefficients when the temperature is low but not much smaller than the spectral gap, and elucidate the origin of the staggering behavior of Lanczos coefficients in this regime.</description>

      <title>Geometric Study on Canonical Nonlinearity for FCC-based Binary Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For classical discrete systems under constant composition (typically reffered to as substitutional alloys), canonical average can act as a map from a set of many-body interatomic interactions to that of configuration in thermodynamic equilibrium, the so-called canonical nonlinearity: CN, which generally exhibits complicated nonlinearity. Whereas our recent study reveals that the CN can be reasonablly addressed for individual microscopic configuration by two different measures of special vector field on configuration space2,3 and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence DKL, their direct correlation on real lattices, is still unclear. We here address this problem for fcc-based equiatomic binary alloys that have been one of the most studied system in the context of CN. We confirm that while local contribution to CN from DKL for each configuration exhibits strong, positive correlation with the vector field, non-local contribution from DKL exhibit no effective correlation. We find that depedence of the averaged non-local nonlinearity over all configurations can be well-characterized by normalied geometric distance in configurational polyhedra between for practical and separable system in terms of the structural degrees of freedom. This fact certainly indicates that non-local nonlinearity has profound connection to the geometric configuration for ground-state structures of alloys on configuration space.</description>

      <title>Boundary layers, transport and universal distribution in boundary driven active systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss analytical results for a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in one dimension in presence of boundary reservoirs. It exhibits `kinetic boundary layers', nonmonotonous distribution, current without density gradient, diffusion facilitated current reversal and optimisation on tuning dynamical parameters, and a new transport effect in the steady state. The spatial and internal degrees of freedom together possess a symmetry, using which we find the eigenspectrum for large systems. The eigenvalues are arranged in two bands which can mix in certain conditions resulting in a crossover in the relaxation. The late time distribution for large systems is obtained analytically; it retains a strong and often dominant `active' contribution in the bulk rendering an effective passive-like description inadequate. A nontrivial `Milne length' also emerges in the dynamics. Finally, a novel universality is proposed in the absorbing boundary problem for dynamics with short-ranged colored noise. Active processes driven by active reservoirs may thus provide a common physical ground for diverse and new nonequilibrium phenomena.</description>

      <title>Topological Invariants in the Pore Morphology Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a pore morphology algorithm that emphasizes the central role of topology in multiphase flow through porous media. Analysis of drainage in lattice-based pore networks identifies two key quantities, the percolation threshold and residual saturation, as topological invariants. These descriptors, which are based solely on connectivity rather than geometric details, capture the essential structure of the network. The percolation threshold is interpreted as a topological phase transition, marking the transition from global connectivity of the defending fluid to isolated clusters of trapped fluid. The universality of scaling exponents across different lattice geometries reveals the existence of topological universality classes, where systems with equivalent connectivity display identical critical behavior. This topological framework underscores the robustness of the identified invariants and provides a general basis for upscaling pore-scale processes in complex media.</description>

      <title>Microbiomes Through The Looking Glass: Linking species interactions to dysbiosis through a disordered Lotka-Volterra framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of environmental sequencing technologies, such as metagenomics, has significantly enhanced our ability to study microbial communities. The eubiotic composition of these communities is crucial for maintaining ecological functions and host health. Species diversity is only one facet of a healthy community organization; together with abundance distributions and interaction structures, it shapes reproducible macroecological states, i.e., joint statistical fingerprints that summarize whole-community behavior. Despite recent developments, a theoretical framework connecting empirical data with ecosystem modeling is still in its infancy, particularly in the context of disordered systems. Here, we present a novel framework that couples statistical physics tools for disordered systems with metagenomic data, explicitly linking diversity, interactions, and stability to define and compare these macroecological states. By employing the generalized Lotka-Volterra model with random interactions, we reveal two different emergent patterns of species interaction networks and species abundance distributions for healthy and diseased microbiomes. On the one hand, healthy microbiomes have similar community structures across individuals, characterized by strong species interactions and abundance diversity consistent with neutral stochastic fluctuations. On the other hand, diseased microbiomes show greater variability driven by deterministic factors, thus resulting in less ecologically stable and more divergent communities. Our findings suggest the potential of disordered system theory to characterize microbiomes and to capture the role of ecological interactions on stability and functioning.</description>

      <title>Localized states, topology and anomalous Hall conductivity on a 30 degrees twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $30^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer formed by two copies of Haldane model and explore its evolution with varying interlayer coupling strength. Specifically, we compute the system's energy spectrum, its fractal dimensions, topological entanglement entropy, local Chern markers and anomalous Hall conductivity. We find that at weak interlayer coupling, the system %remains gapped still has a bulk energy gap, topological edge states and retains topological properties of the isolated layers, but at strong interlayer coupling, this energy gap closes, but it is possible that another bulk gap may open. Such a system possesses multiple states localized at various locations of the lattice. We also establish that topological entanglement entropy and anomalous Hall conductivity can be used to characterize the system's topological properties in the same way as a local Chern marker.</description>

      <title>Long-time divergences in the nonlinear response of gapped one-dimensional many-particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider one dimensional many-particle systems that exhibit kinematically protected single-particle excitations over their ground states. We show that momentum and time-resolved 4-point functions of operators that create such excitations diverge linearly in particular time differences. This behaviour can be understood by means of a simple semiclassical analysis based on the kinematics and scattering of wave packets of quasiparticles. We verify that our wave packet analysis correctly predicts the long-time limit of the four-point function in the transverse field Ising model through a form factor expansion. We present evidence in favour of the same behaviour in integrable quantum field theories. In addition, we extend our discussion to experimental protocols where two times of the four-point function coincide, e.g. 2D coherent spectroscopy and pump-probe experiments. Finally, focusing on the Ising model, we discuss subleading corrections that grow as the square root of time differences. We show that the subleading corrections can be correctly accounted for by the same semiclassical analysis, but also taking into account wave packet spreading.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi complexity in mean-field disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Configurational entropy, or complexity, plays a critical role in characterizing disordered systems such as glasses, yet its measurement often requires significant computational resources. Recently, R\'enyi entropy, a one-parameter generalization of Shannon entropy, has gained attention across various fields of physics due to its simpler functional form, making it more practical for measurements. In this paper, we compute the R\'enyi version of complexity for prototypical mean-field disordered models, including the random energy model, its generalization, referred to as the random free energy model, and the $p$-spin spherical model. We first demonstrate that the R\'enyi complexity with index $m$ is related to the free energy difference for a generalized annealed Franz-Parisi potential with $m$ clones. Detailed calculations show that for models having one-step replica symmetry breaking (RSB), the R\'enyi complexity vanishes at the Kauzmann transition temperature $T_K$, irrespective of $m&gt;1$, while RSB solutions are required even in the liquid phase. This study strengthens the link between R\'enyi entropy and the physics of disordered systems and provides theoretical insights for its practical measurements.</description>

      <title>Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into $L$ parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. Using the fact that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a \textit{fractal} multipartite decomposition -- it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction -- we then build \textit{exact, analytical} tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of \textit{generalized} Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.</description>

      <title>Squeezing generation crossing a mean-field critical point: Work statistics, irreversibility and critical fingerprints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical consequences of quantum phase transitions on thermodynamical quantities, such as work statistics and entropy production, is one of the most intriguing aspect of quantum many-body systems, pinpointing the emergence of irreversibility to critical features. In this work, we investigate the critical fingerprints appearing in these key thermodynamical quantities for a mean-field critical system undergoing a finite-time cycle, starting from a thermal state at a generic inverse temperature. In contrast to non-zero dimensional many-body systems, the presence of a mean-field critical point in a finite-time cycle leads to constant irreversible work even in the limit of infinitely slow driving. This links with the fact that a slow finite-time cycle results in a constant amount of squeezing, which enables us to derive analytical expressions for the work statistics and irreversible entropy, depending solely on the mean-field critical exponents and the functional form of the control parameter near the critical point. We find that the probability of observing negative work values, corresponding to negative irreversible entropy, is inversely proportional to the time the system remains near to the critical point, and this trend becomes less pronounced the lower the temperature of the initial thermal state. Finally, we determine the irreversibility traits under squeezing generation at zero-temperature using the relative entropy of coherence.</description>
