      <title>Current rectification via Photosystem I monolayers induced by their orientation on hydrophilic self-assembled monolayers on titanium nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photosystem I (PSI) is a photosynthetic protein which evolved to efficiently transfer electrons through the thylakoid membrane. This remarkable process attracted the attention of the biomolecular electronics community, which aims to study and understand the underlying electronic transport through these proteins by contacting ensembles of PSI with solid-state metallic contacts. This paper extends published work of immobilizing monolayers of PSI with a specific orientation, by using organophosphonate self-assembled molecules with hydrophilic heads on ultra-flat titanium nitride. Electrical measurements carried out with eutectic GaIn top contacts showed current rectification ratios of up to ~200. The previously proposed rectification mechanism, relying on the protein's internal electric dipole, was inquired by measuring shifts in the work function. Our straightforward bottom-up fabrication method may allow for further experimental studies on PSI molecules, such as embedding them in solid-state, transparent top contact schemes for optoelectronic measurements.</description>

      <title>Mono-exponential Current Attenuation with Distance across 16 nm Thick Bacteriorhodopsin Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable ability of natural proteins to conduct electricity in the dry state over long distances remains largely inexplicable despite intensive research. In some cases, a (weakly) exponential length-attenuation, as in off-resonant tunneling transport, extends to thicknesses even beyond 10 nm. This report deals with such charge transport characteristics observed in self-assembled multilayers of the protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR). About 7.5 nm to 15.5 nm thick bR layers were prepared on conductive titanium nitride (TiN) substrates using aminohexylphosphonic acid and poly-diallyl-dimethylammonium electrostatic linkers. Using conical EGaIn top contacts, an intriguing, mono-exponential conductance attenuation as a function of the bR layer thickness with a small attenuation coefficient $\beta \approx 0.8 \space {\rm nm}^{-1}$ is measured at zero bias. Variable-temperature measurements using evaporated Ti/Au top contacts yield effective energy barriers of about 100 meV from fitting the data to tunneling, hopping, and carrier cascade transport models. The observed temperature-dependence is assigned to the protein-electrode interfaces. The transport length and temperature dependence of the current densities are consistent with tunneling through the protein-protein and protein-electrode interfaces, respectively. Importantly, our results call for new theoretical approaches to find the microscopic mechanism behind the remarkably efficient, long-range electron transport within bR.</description>

      <title>Solution landscape of reaction-diffusion systems reveals a nonlinear mechanism and spatial robustness of pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous pattern formation in homogeneous systems is ubiquitous in nature. Although Turing demonstrated that spatial patterns can emerge in reaction-diffusion (RD) systems when the homogeneous state becomes linearly unstable, it remains unclear whether the Turing mechanism is the only route for pattern formation. Here, we develop an efficient algorithm to systematically map the solution landscape to find all steady-state solutions. By applying our method to generic RD models, we find that stable spatial patterns can emerge via saddle-node bifurcations before the onset of Turing instability. Furthermore, by using a generalized action in functional space based on large deviation theory, our method is extended to evaluate stability of spatial patterns against noise. Applying this general approach in a three-species RD model, we show that though formation of Turing patterns only requires two chemical species, the third species is critical for stabilizing patterns against strong intrinsic noise in small biochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Tunable Hyperuniformity in Cellular Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniform materials, characterized by their suppressed density fluctuations and vanishing structure factors as the wave number approaches zero, represent a unique state of matter that straddles the boundary between order and randomness. These materials exhibit exceptional optical, mechanical, and acoustic properties, making them of great interest in materials science and engineering. Traditional methods for creating hyperuniform structures, including collective-coordinate optimization and centroidal Voronoi tessellations, have primarily been computational and face challenges in capturing the complexity of naturally occurring systems. This study introduces a comprehensive theoretical framework to generate hyperuniform structures inspired by the collective organization of biological cells within an epithelial tissue layer. By adjusting parameters such as cell elasticity and interfacial tension, we explore a spectrum of hyperuniform states from fluid to rigid, each exhibiting distinct mechanical properties and types of density fluctuations. Our results not only advance the understanding of hyperuniformity in biological tissues but also demonstrate the potential of these materials to inform the design of novel materials with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Squeezed Light via Exciton-Phonon Cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squeezed light is a particularly useful quantum resource, which finds broad applications in quantum information processing, quantum metrology and sensing, and biological measurements. It has been successfully generated in various physical systems. Here we introduce a new mechanism and system to produce squeezed light using an exciton-phonon cavity-QED system. Specifically, we adopt a semiconductor microcavity embedded with a quantum well, which supports both linear and nonlinear interactions among excitons, phonons, and cavity photons. We show that the strong exciton-phonon nonlinear interaction can induce a quadrature-squeezed cavity output field, and reveal an important role of the exciton-photon coupling in engineering the squeezing spectrum and improving the robustness of the squeezing against thermal noise. Our results indicate that room-temperature squeezing of light is possible for materials with high exciton binding energy.</description>

      <title>Circuit design in biology and machine learning. I. Random networks and dimensional reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A biological circuit is a neural or biochemical cascade, taking inputs and producing outputs. How have biological circuits learned to solve environmental challenges over the history of life? The answer certainly follows Dobzhansky's famous quote that ``nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.'' But that quote leaves out the mechanistic basis by which natural selection's trial-and-error learning happens, which is exactly what we have to understand. How does the learning process that designs biological circuits actually work? How much insight can we gain about the form and function of biological circuits by studying the processes that have made those circuits? Because life's circuits must often solve the same problems as those faced by machine learning, such as environmental tracking, homeostatic control, dimensional reduction, or classification, we can begin by considering how machine learning designs computational circuits to solve problems. We can then ask: How much insight do those computational circuits provide about the design of biological circuits? How much does biology differ from computers in the particular circuit designs that it uses to solve problems? This article steps through two classic machine learning models to set the foundation for analyzing broad questions about the design of biological circuits. One insight is the surprising power of randomly connected networks. Another is the central role of internal models of the environment embedded within biological circuits, illustrated by a model of dimensional reduction and trend prediction. Overall, many challenges in biology have machine learning analogs, suggesting hypotheses about how biology's circuits are designed.</description>

      <title>Identifying the minimal sets of distance restraints for FRET-assisted protein structural modeling</title>

Abstract: Proteins naturally occur in crowded cellular environments and interact with other proteins, nucleic acids, and organelles. Since most previous experimental protein structure determination techniques require that proteins occur in idealized, non-physiological environments, the effects of realistic cellular environments on protein structure are largely unexplored. Recently, F\"{o}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) has been shown to be an effective experimental method for investigating protein structure in vivo. Inter-residue distances measured in vivo can be incorporated as restraints in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to model protein structural dynamics in vivo. Since most FRET studies only obtain inter-residue separations for a small number of amino acid pairs, it is important to determine the minimum number of restraints in the MD simulations that are required to achieve a given root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) from the experimental structural ensemble. Further, what is the optimal method for selecting these inter-residue restraints? Here, we implement several methods for selecting the most important FRET pairs and determine the number of pairs $N_{r}$ that are needed to induce conformational changes in proteins between two experimentally determined structures. We find that enforcing only a small fraction of restraints, $N_{r}/N \lesssim 0.08$, where $N$ is the number of amino acids, can induce the conformational changes. These results establish the efficacy of FRET-assisted MD simulations for atomic scale structural modeling of proteins in vivo.</description>

      <title>A ubiquitous transfer function links interacting elements to emerging property of complex systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of complex systems, self-organization magnifies the compounding effects of element interactions by propagating, modifying, and enhancing functionality, ultimately leading to emergent system properties. The intricacies of self-organization make unveiling the elusive link between element interactions and emergent system properties akin to finding the proverbial Holy Grail. In the search for identifying a method to predict system-level properties, we used an inductive approach to bypass the self-organization. By observing drug interactions within biological complex system, system property, efficacy, emerged as a smooth response surface in the multi-dimensional space of drug-system interactions, which can be represented by the Complex System Response (CSR) function. This CSR function has been successfully validated across diverse disease models in cell lines, animals, and clinical trials. Notably, the CSR function reveals that biological complex systems exhibit second-order non-linearity. In this study, we generalized the CSR function to physical complex systems, linking maximum compressive yielding stress to impactful manufacturing parameters of the Selective Laser Melting (SLM) process. Remarkably though anticipated, the CSR function reveals the connection between the macroscale system property (compressive yielding stress) and the microstructure during self-organizing process. In addition, the second-order non-linear CSR functions ensure a single global optimum in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Systematic Analysis of Biomolecular Conformational Ensembles with PENSA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic-level simulations are widely used to study biomolecules and their dynamics. A common goal in such studies is to compare simulations of a molecular system under several conditions -- for example, with various mutations or bound ligands -- in order to identify differences between the molecular conformations adopted under these conditions. However, the large amount of data produced by simulations of ever larger and more complex systems often renders it difficult to identify the structural features that are relevant for a particular biochemical phenomenon. We present a flexible software package named PENSA that enables a comprehensive and thorough investigation into biomolecular conformational ensembles. It provides featurizations and feature transformations that allow for a complete representation of biomolecules like proteins and nucleic acids, including water and ion binding sites, thus avoiding bias that would come with manual feature selection. PENSA implements methods to systematically compare the distributions of molecular features across ensembles to find the significant differences between them and identify regions of interest. It also includes a novel approach to quantify the state-specific information between two regions of a biomolecule, which allows, e.g., tracing information flow to identify allosteric pathways. PENSA also comes with convenient tools for loading data and visualizing results, making them quick to process and easy to interpret. PENSA is an open-source Python library maintained at https://github.com/drorlab/pensa along with an example workflow and a tutorial. We demonstrate its usefulness in real-world examples by showing how it helps to determine molecular mechanisms efficiently.</description>
