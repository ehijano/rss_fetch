      <title>Experimental Study of Periodically Poled Piezoelectric Film Lithium Niobate Resonator at Cryogenic Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports the first study of periodically poled piezoelectric film (P3F) lithium niobate (LiNbO3) resonators at cryogenic temperatures. We experimentally investigate the temperature dependency of resonant frequencies and quality factor (Q) of higher-order Lamb modes up to 20 GHz between 80{\deg}K and 297{\deg}K, using a tri-layer P3F LiNbO3 resonators as the experimental platform. The supported thickness-shear Lamb modes between second-order symmetric (S2) and eleventh-order antisymmetric (A11) modes show temperature coefficients of frequency (TCF) averaging -68.8 ppm/K. Higher Q and more pronounced spurious modes are observed at lower temperatures for many modes. Upon further study, the cryogenic study will be crucial for identifying dominant loss mechanisms and origins of spurious modes in higher-order Lamb wave devices for millimeter-wave applications.</description>

      <title>Metaharvesting: Emergent energy harvesting by piezoelectric metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibration energy harvesting is a technology that enables electric power generation by augmenting vibrating materials or structures with piezoelectric elements. In a recent work, we quantified the intrinsic energy-harvesting availability of a piezoelectric phononic crystal (Piezo-PnC) by calculating its damping ratio across the Brillouin zone and subtracting off the damping ratio of the corresponding non-piezoelectric version of the phononic crystal. It was highlighted that the resulting quantity is indicative of the amount of useful energy available for harvesting and is independent of the finite structure size and boundary conditions and of any forcing conditions. Here we investigate the intrinsic energy harvesting availability of two other material systems chosen to be statically equivalent to a given Piezo-PnC: a piezoelectric locally resonant metamaterial (Piezo-LRM) and a piezoelectric inertially amplified metamaterial (Piezo-IAM). Upon comparing with the intrinsic energy harvesting availability of the Piezo-PnC, we observe an emergence of energy harvesting capacity, a phenomenon we refer to as metaharvesting. This is analogous to the concept of metadamping, except the quantity evaluated is associated with piezoelectric energy harvesting rather than raw dissipation. Our results show that the intrinsic energy harvesting availability is enhanced by local resonances, and enhanced further by inertial amplification. These findings open a pathway towards fundamental design of architectured piezoelectric materials with superior energy harvesting capacity.</description>

      <title>Derivation of Antenna $Q$-factor based on Antenna Scattering-Matrix Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A radio antenna is primarily designed to convert electromagnetic waves into electrical current and vice versa. However, a part of the incident wavefield is scattered due to structural effects and reflected power at the antenna's electrical port. Because the latter depends on the load impedance, an antenna can also be referred to as a loaded scatterer. Its interaction with electromagnetic waves is defined by means of absorption and scattering cross-sections (ACS and SCS). When immersed in a diffuse field such as the one generated within a reverberation chamber (RC), the impact of the load antenna results from averaged properties over incident angles. One fundamental quantity is the antenna quality factor (Q-factor) directly related to the averaged ACS. Current formulations of Q-factor are based on different power budget analysis which do not enable the consideration of wave interferences between the ingoing and outgoing fields. Additionally, the structural component is always neglected in the current formulations. In this paper, we introduce a rigorous formulation of the antenna Q-factor which takes into account the aforementioned effects. The antenna is modeled using the scattering-matrix theory which linearly links the ingoing and outgoing waves in terms of spherical harmonics expansion. The derived theory is validated using several numerical simulations based on a Method-of-Moment code. Then, the capability to take advantage of this model to retrieve antenna properties from multiple Q-factor estimations in an RC is demonstrated. All results are compared to the existing Q-factor formulations.</description>

      <title>Diamond Micro-Chip for Quantum Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond is an increasingly popular quantum sensor for microscopy of electrical current, magnetization, and spins. However, efficient NV-sample integration with a robust, high-quality interface remains an outstanding challenge to realize scalable, high-throughput microscopy. In this work, we characterize a diamond micro-chip (DMC) containing a (111)-oriented NV ensemble; and demonstrate its utility for high-resolution quantum microscopy. We perform strain imaging of the DMC and find minimal detrimental strain variation across a field-of-view of tens of micrometer. We find good ensemble NV spin coherence and optical properties in the DMC, suitable for sensitive magnetometry. We then use the DMC to demonstrate wide-field microscopy of electrical current, and show that diffraction-limited quantum microscopy can be achieved. We also demonstrate the deterministic transfer of DMCs with multiple materials of interest for next-generation electronics and spintronics. Lastly, we develop a polymer-based technique for DMC placement. This work establishes the DMC's potential to expand the application of NV quantum microscopy in materials, device, geological, biomedical, and chemical sciences.</description>

      <title>The Advection Boundary Law in absence of mean flow: passivity, nonreciprocity and enhanced noise transmission attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sound attenuation along a waveguide is intensively studied for applications ranging from heating and air-conditioning ventilation systems, to aircraft turbofan engines. In particular, the new generation of Ultra-High-By-Pass-Ratio turbofan requires higher attenuation at low frequencies, in less space for liner treatment. This demands to go beyond the classical acoustic liner concepts and overcome their limitations. In this paper, we discuss an unconventional boundary operator, called Advection Boundary Law, which can be artificially synthesized by electroactive means, such as Electroacoustic Resonators. This boundary condition entails nonreciprocal propagation, meanwhile enhancing noise transmission attenuation with respect to purely locally-reacting boundaries, along one sense of propagation. Because of its artificial nature though, its acoustical passivity limits are yet to be defined. In this paper, we provide a thorough numerical study to assess the performances of the Advection Boundary Law, in absence of mean flow. An experimental test-bench validates the numerical outcomes in terms of passivity limits, non-reciprocal propagation and enhanced isolation with respect to local impedance operators. This work provides the guidelines to properly implement the Advection Boundary Law for optimal noise transmission attenuation. Moreover, the tools and criteria provided here can also be employed for the design and characterization of other innovative liners.</description>

      <title>High sensitivity and large scanning range optical antennas enabled by multi-casting ridge-waveguide subwavelength structure arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large-scale integrated photonics, optical phased array (OPA) is an effective way to realize highly integrated, stable and low-cost beam control system. Achieving a large field of view (FOV) in the longitudinal direction without increasing fabrication cost and system complexity is still a significant challenge in OPA antennas. Here, a high sensitivity and large scanning range antenna based on subwavelength structure array is proposed to enhance the longitudinal scanning and free-space radiating efficiency by using the ridge-waveguide structure and backward-emitting. A millimeter-long grating antenna with a far-field beam divergence of 0.13{\deg} and a wavelength sensitivity of 0.237{\deg}/nm is experimentally demonstrated. Furthermore, by using different sideband periods, we introduce a multi-casting grating antenna with a large scanning range up to 42.6{\deg}. The proposed devices show significant improvement in longitudinal wavelength sensitivity compared with the typical waveguide grating antennas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon photonics arises as a viable solution to address the stringent resource demands of emergent technologies, such as neural networks. Within this framework, photonic memories are fundamental building blocks of photonic integrated circuits that have not yet found a standardized solution due to several trade-off among different metrics such as energy consumption, speed, footprint, or fabrication complexity, to name a few. In particular, a photonic memory exhibiting ultra-high endurance performance (&gt; 10^6 cycles) has been elusive to date. Here, we report an ultra-high endurance silicon photonic memory using vanadium dioxide (VO_2) exhibiting a record cyclability of up to 10^7 cycles without degradation. Moreover, our memory features an ultra-compact footprint below 5 {\mu}m with potential for nanosecond and picojoule programming performance. Our silicon photonic memory could find application in emerging photonic applications demanding high number of memory updates such as photonic neural networks with in-situ training.</description>

      <title>A universal crack tip correction algorithm discovered by physical deep symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital image correlation is a widely used technique in the field of experimental mechanics. In fracture mechanics, determining the precise location of the crack tip is crucial. In this paper, we introduce a universal crack tip detection algorithm based on displacement and strain fields obtained by digital image correlation. Iterative crack tip correction formulas are discovered by applying deep symbolic regression guided by physical unit constraints to a dataset of simulated cracks under mode I, II and mixed-mode conditions with variable T-stress. For the training dataset, we fit the Williams series expansion with super-singular terms to the simulated displacement fields at randomly chosen origins around the actual crack tip. We analyse the discovered formulas and apply the most promising one to digital image correlation data obtained from uniaxial and biaxial fatigue crack growth experiments of AA2024-T3 sheet material. Throughout the experiments, the crack tip positions are reliably detected leading to improved stability of the crack propagation curves.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel scheme for rapid quantitative analysis of debris generated during experiments with solid targets following relativistic laser-plasma interaction at high-power laser facilities. Experimental data indicates that predictions by available modelling for non-mass-limited targets are reasonable, with debris on the order of hundreds ug-per-shot. We detect for the first time that several % of the debris is ejected directional following the target normal (rear- and interaction side); and confirm previous work that found the debris ejection in direction of the interaction side to be larger than on the side of the target rear.</description>

      <title>Temporal Twistronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of twistronics and moir\'e physics, which is present in twisted two-dimensional bilayer materials, has recently attracted growing attention in various fields of science and engineering such as condensed matter physics, nanophotonics, polaritonics and excitonics. The twist angle between the two layers has offered an additional degree of control over electron and photon interaction with such structures. Inspired by the photonic version of twistronics, here we introduce and investigate theoretically the temporal analogue of twistronics in anisotropic optical media. We study how a monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave propagating in a spatially unbounded, anisotropic medium undergoes major changes when the relative permittivity tensor of the medium is rapidly changed in time to create a new anisotropic medium that is the rotated version of the original medium. We consider both the elliptic and hyperbolic anisotropic scenarios. The propagation-angle-dependent forward (FW) and backward (BW) waves with their converted frequencies and relative amplitudes are obtained. To concentrate on the main features of this concept without getting into details of dispersion, in our work here we assume dispersionless and lossless material parameters. Our results reveal how frequency conversion is highly dependent on the direction of propagation of the original wave, rotation angle, and initial values of the material parameters, proposing another class of "magic angles" for such temporal twistronics.</description>

      <title>Unifying frequency metrology across microwave, optical, and free-electron domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency metrology lies at the heart of precision measurement. Optical frequency combs provide a coherent link uniting the microwave and optical domains in the electromagnetic spectrum, with profound implications in timekeeping, sensing and spectroscopy, fundamental physics tests, exoplanet search, and light detection and ranging. Here, we extend this frequency link to free electrons by coherent modulation of the electron phase by a continuous-wave laser locked to a fully stabilized optical frequency comb. Microwave frequency standards are transferred to the optical domain via the frequency comb, and are further imprinted in the electron spectrum by optically modulating the electron phase with a photonic chip-based microresonator. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we apply this frequency link in the calibration of an electron spectrometer, and use the electron spectrum to measure the optical frequency. Our work bridges frequency domains differed by a factor of $\sim10^{13}$ and carried by different physical objects, establishes a spectroscopic connection between electromagnetic waves and free-electron matter waves, and has direct ramifications in ultrahigh-precision electron spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: Developing hybrid materials and structures for electromagnetic wave engineering has been a promising route towards novel functionalities and tunabilities in many modern applications and perspectives in new quantum technologies. Despite its established success in engineering optical light and terahertz waves, the implementation of meta-resonators operating at the microwave band is still emerging, especially those that allow for on-chip integration and size miniaturization, which has turned out crucial to developing hybrid quantum systems at the microwave band. In this work, we present a microwave meta-resonator consisting of split-ring and and spiral resonators, and implement it to the investigation of photon-magnon coupling for hybrid magnonic applications. We observe broadened bandwidth to the split ring modes augmented by the additional spiral resonator, and, by coupling the modes to a magnetic sample, the resultant photon-magnon coupling can be significantly enhanced to more than ten-fold. Our work suggests that combinatorial, hybrid microwave resonators may be a promising approach towards future development and implementation of photon-magnon coupling in hybrid magnonic systems.</description>

Abstract: Ultrathin bismuth exhibits rich physics including strong spin-orbit coupling, ferroelectricity, nontrivial topology, and light-induced structural dynamics. We use \textit{ab initio} calculations to show that light can induce structural transitions to four transient phases in bismuth monolayers. These light-induced phases exhibit nontrivial topological character, which we illustrate using the recently introduced concept of spin bands and spin-resolved Wilson loops. Specifically, we find that the topology changes via the closing of the electron and spin band gaps during photo-induced structural phase transitions, leading to distinct edge states. Our study provides strategies to tailor electronic and spin topology via ultrafast control of photo-excited carriers and associated structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Advancing large-scale thin-film PPLN nonlinear photonics with segmented tunable micro-heaters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin-film periodically poled lithium niobate (TF-PPLN) devices have recently gained prominence for efficient wavelength conversion processes in both classical and quantum applications. However, the patterning and poling of TF-PPLN devices today are mostly performed at chip scales, presenting a significant bottleneck for future large-scale nonlinear photonic systems that require the integration of multiple nonlinear components with consistent performance and low cost. Here, we take a pivotal step towards this goal by developing a wafer-scale TF-PPLN nonlinear photonic platform, leveraging ultraviolet stepper lithography and an automated poling process. To address the inhomogeneous broadening of the quasi-phase matching (QPM) spectrum induced by film thickness variations across the wafer, we propose and demonstrate segmented thermal optic tuning modules that can precisely adjust and align the QPM peak wavelengths in each section. \hl{Using the segmented micro-heaters, we show the successful realignment of inhomogeneously broadened multi-peak QPM spectra with up to 57$\%$ enhancement of conversion efficiency. We achieve a high normalized conversion efficiency of 3802$\%$W$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$ in a 6 mm long PPLN waveguide, recovering 84$\%$ of the theoretically predicted efficiency in this device.} The advanced fabrication techniques and segmented tuning architectures presented herein pave the way for wafer-scale integration of complex functional nonlinear photonic circuits with applications in quantum information processing, precision sensing and metrology, and low-noise-figure optical signal amplification.</description>
