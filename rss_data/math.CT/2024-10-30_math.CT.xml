      <title>Locally rigid $\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We survey the theory of locally rigid and rigid symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories over an arbitrary base $\mathcal{V}\in\mathrm{CAlg}(\mathbf{Pr}^\mathrm{L})$. Along the way, we introduce and study ``$\mathcal{V}$-atomic morphisms'', which are analogues of compact morphisms over an arbitrary base $\mathcal{V}$.</description>

      <title>Dualizable presentable $\infty$-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{V}$, the $\infty$-category $\mathbf{Mod}_\mathcal{V}(\mathbf{Pr}^{\mathrm{L}})^{\mathrm{dbl}}$ of dualizable presentable $\mathcal{V}$-modules and internal left adjoints between them is itself presentable.
  Along the way, we survey formal properties of these dualizable $\mathcal V$-modules. We pay close attention to the case of the $\infty$-category of spectra, where we survey the foundational properties of ``compact morphisms''.</description>

      <title>Contextads as Wreaths; Kleisli, Para, and Span Constructions as Wreath Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce contextads and the Ctx construction, unifying various structures and constructions in category theory dealing with context and contextful arrows -- comonads and their Kleisli construction, actegories and their Para construction, adequate triples and their Span construction. Contextads are defined in terms of Lack--Street wreaths, suitably categorified for pseudomonads in a tricategory of spans in a 2-category with display maps. The associated wreath product provides the Ctx construction, and by its universal property we conclude trifunctoriality. This abstract approach lets us work up to structure, and thus swiftly prove that, under very mild assumptions, a contextad equipped colaxly with a 2-algebraic structure produces a similarly structured double category of contextful arrows. We also explore the role contextads might play qua dependently graded comonads in organizing contextful computation in functional programming. We show that many side-effects monads can be dually captured by dependently graded comonads, and gesture towards a general result on the `transposability' of parametric right adjoint monads to dependently graded comonads.</description>

      <title>Superselection sectors for posets of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a commutant-closed collection of von Neumann algebras acting on a common Hilbert space indexed by a poset with an order-reversing involution. We give simple geometric axioms for the poset which allow us to construct a braided tensor category of superselection sectors analogous to the construction of Gabbiani and Fr\"ohlich for conformal nets. For cones in $\mathbb{R}^2$, we weaken our conditions to a bounded spread version of Haag duality and obtain similar results. We show that intertwined nets of algebras have isomorphic braided tensor categories of superselection sectors. Finally, we show that the categories constructed here are equivalent to those constructed by Naaijkens and Ogata for certain 2D quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Relating ample and biample topological categories with Boolean restriction and range semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the equivalence by Cockett and Garner between restriction monoids and ample categories to the biunary and non-unital setting of Boolean range semigroups which are non-unital one-object versions of range categories. We show that Boolean range semigroups are equivalent to ample topological categories where the range map $r$ is open, and \'etale Boolean range semigroups are equivalent to biample topological categories. These results yield the equivalence between \'etale Boolean range semigroups and Boolean birestriction semigroups and a characterization when a Boolean restriction semigroup admits a compatible cosupport operation. We also recover the equivalence between Boolean birestriction semigroups and biample topological categories by Kudryavtseva and Lawson. Our technique builds on the usual constructions relating inverse semigroups with ample topological groupoids via germs and slices.</description>

      <title>Proto-Quipper with Reversing and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum programming language Quipper supports circuit operations such as reversing and control, which allows programmers to control and reverse certain quantum circuits. In addition to these two operations, Quipper provides a function called with-computed, which can be used to program circuits of the form $g; f; g^{\dagger}$. The latter is a common pattern in quantum circuit design. One benefit of using with-computed, as opposed to constructing the circuit $g ; f; g^{\dagger}$ directly from $g$, $f$, and $g^{\dagger}$, is that it facilitates an important optimization. Namely, if the resulting circuit is later controlled, only the circuit $f$ in the middle needs to be controlled; the circuits $g$ and $g^{\dagger}$ need not even be controllable.
  In this paper, we formalize a semantics for reversible and controllable circuits, using a dagger symmetric monoidal category $\mathbf{R}$ to interpret reversible circuits, and a new notion we call a controllable category $\mathbf{N}$ to interpret controllable circuits. The controllable category $\mathbf{N}$ encompasses the control and with-computed operations in Quipper. We extend the language Proto-Quipper with reversing, control and the with-computed operation. Since not all circuits are reversible and/or controllable, we use a type system with modalities to track reversibility and controllability. This generalizes the modality of Fu-Kishida-Ross-Selinger 2023. We give an abstract categorical semantics for reversing, control and with-computed, and show that the type system and operational semantics are sound with respect to this semantics. Lastly, we construct a concrete model using a generalization of biset enrichment from Fu-Kishida-Ross-Selinger 2022.</description>

      <title>A formal characterization of discrete condensed objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Condensed mathematics, developed by Clausen and Scholze over the last few years, proposes a generalization of topology with better categorical properties. It replaces the concept of a topological space by that of a condensed set, which can be defined as a sheaf on a certain site of compact Hausdorff spaces. Since condensed sets are supposed to be a generalization of topological spaces, one would like to be able to study the notion of discreteness. There are various ways to define what it means for a condensed set to be discrete. In this paper we describe them, and prove that they are equivalent. The results have been fully formalized in the Lean proof assistant.</description>
