      <title>Enhanced Single-Cell RNA-seq Embedding through Gene Expression and Data-Driven Gene-Gene Interaction Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides unprecedented insights into cellular heterogeneity, enabling detailed analysis of complex biological systems at single-cell resolution. However, the high dimensionality and technical noise inherent in scRNA-seq data pose significant analytical challenges. While current embedding methods focus primarily on gene expression levels, they often overlook crucial gene-gene interactions that govern cellular identity and function. To address this limitation, we present a novel embedding approach that integrates both gene expression profiles and data-driven gene-gene interactions. Our method first constructs a Cell-Leaf Graph (CLG) using random forest models to capture regulatory relationships between genes, while simultaneously building a K-Nearest Neighbor Graph (KNNG) to represent expression similarities between cells. These graphs are then combined into an Enriched Cell-Leaf Graph (ECLG), which serves as input for a graph neural network to compute cell embeddings. By incorporating both expression levels and gene-gene interactions, our approach provides a more comprehensive representation of cellular states. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets demonstrates that our method enhances the detection of rare cell populations and improves downstream analyses such as visualization, clustering, and trajectory inference. This integrated approach represents a significant advance in single-cell data analysis, offering a more complete framework for understanding cellular diversity and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Prognostic Biomarker Discovery in Pancreatic Cancer Through Hybrid Ensemble Feature Selection and Multi-Omics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction of patient survival using high-dimensional multi-omics data requires systematic feature selection methods that ensure predictive performance, sparsity, and reliability for prognostic biomarker discovery. We developed a hybrid ensemble feature selection (hEFS) approach that combines data subsampling with multiple prognostic models, integrating both embedded and wrapper-based strategies for survival prediction. Omics features are ranked using a voting-theory-inspired aggregation mechanism across models and subsamples, while the optimal number of features is selected via a Pareto front, balancing predictive accuracy and model sparsity without any user-defined thresholds. When applied to multi-omics datasets from three pancreatic cancer cohorts, hEFS identifies significantly fewer and more stable biomarkers compared to the conventional, late-fusion CoxLasso models, while maintaining comparable discrimination performance. Implemented within the open-source mlr3fselect R package, hEFS offers a robust, interpretable, and clinically valuable tool for prognostic modelling and biomarker discovery in high-dimensional survival settings.</description>

      <title>Safe Sequences via Dominators in DAGs for Path-Covering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A path-covering problem on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) requires finding a set of source-to-sink paths that cover all the nodes, all the arcs, or subsets thereof, and additionally they are optimal with respect to some function. In this paper we study safe sequences of nodes or arcs, namely sequences that appear in some path of every path cover of a DAG.
  We show that safe sequences admit a simple characterization via cutnodes. Moreover, we establish a connection between maximal safe sequences and leaf-to-root paths in the source- and sink-dominator trees of the DAG, which may be of independent interest in the extensive literature on dominators. With dominator trees, safe sequences admit an O(n)-size representation and a linear-time output-sensitive enumeration algorithm running in time O(m + o), where n and m are the number of nodes and arcs, respectively, and o is the total length of the maximal safe sequences.
  We then apply maximal safe sequences to simplify Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) for two path-covering problems, LeastSquares and MinPathError, which are at the core of RNA transcript assembly problems from bioinformatics. On various datasets, maximal safe sequences can be computed in under 0.1 seconds per graph, on average, and ILP solvers whose search space is reduced in this manner exhibit significant speed-ups. For example on graphs with a large width, average speed-ups are in the range 50-250x for MinPathError and in the range 80-350x for LeastSquares. Optimizing ILPs using safe sequences can thus become a fast building block of practical RNA transcript assembly tools, and more generally, of path-covering problems.</description>
