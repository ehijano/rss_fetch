      <title>The $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry-breaking transition in a chain of trapped interacting ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped ions are an ideal platform to implement quantum simulation. Previously the parity-time reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry-breaking transition in the paradigmatic non-Hermitian Hamiltonian $h_{PT}=J\sigma_x-i\Gamma\sigma_z$ has been observed in a single ion experiment in a passive way. In this work, we propose to study the interaction effects on the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry-breaking transition in a chain of $N$ trapped interacting ions. We consider an effective Ising interaction $H^\text{Ising-x}_\text{int} =\sum_{j&lt;k}U_{jk}\sigma_x^j\sigma_x^k$ between the ions on top of $h_{PT}$. We find that sufficiently strong interaction strength can enhance the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric phase for even $N$ while the phase is suppressed in all the other cases. In particular, the suppression can be so strong that even infinitesimal dissipation, quantified by $\Gamma$, can turn the system into the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry-breaking phase. In addition, we assess the convolved effects due to the coupling and the spin phase shifts. Our findings can be readily tested in ion chain experiments.</description>

      <title>Competing few-body correlations in ultracold Fermi polarons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaron, a typical quasi-particle that describes a single impurity dressed with surrounding environment, serves as an ideal platform for bridging few- and many-body physics. In particular, different few-body correlations can compete with each other and lead to many intriguing phenomena. In this work, we review the recent progresses made in understanding few-body correlation effects in attractive Fermi polarons of ultracold gases. By adopting a unified variational ansatz that incorporates different few-body correlations in a single framework, we will discuss their competing effects in Fermi polarons when the impurity and majority fermions have the same or different masses. For the equal-mass case, we review the nature of polaron-molecule transition that is driven by two-body correlations, and especially highlight the finite momentum character and huge degeneracy of molecule states. For the mass-imbalanced case, we focus on the smooth crossover between polaron and various dressed clusters that originate from high-order correlations. These competing few-body correlations reviewed in Fermi polarons suggest a variety of exotic new phases in the corresponding many-body system of Fermi-Fermi mixtures.</description>

      <title>Probing the goldstino excitation via tunneling current noise in a Bose-Fermi mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Goldstino, which is a fermionic Nambu-Goldstone mode, has been predicted in a Bose-Fermi mixture when the supersymmetry is broken. To detect this excitation mode, we theoretically investigate the shot noise of the supersymmetry-like tunneling current in a repulsively interacting ultracold Bose-Fermi mixture. The Fano factor, which is defined by the noise-to-current ratio, reflect the elementary carriers of the tunneling process. The change of the Fano factor microscopically as the density changes evinces a crossover from the quasiparticle transport to multiparticle (Goldstino) transport. The tunneling channel can also be changed by tuning the potential barrier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review some unresolved theoretical issues in three-dimensional two-component Fermi gases, drawing on recent experiments on cold atoms in immaterial traps close to a magnetic Feshbach resonance. We distinguish successively (i) the open questions arising in the few-body problem with Wigner-Bethe-Peierls contact interactions - essentially the stability of the gas with respect to the Efimov effect and the calculation of the cluster (or virial) coefficients, (ii) those arising in the effective low-energy theory of Landau and Khalatnikov quantum hydrodynamics - essentially the damping of phonon modes and the coherence time of the condensate of pairs, and finally (iii) questions requiring a complete, microscopic solution of the many-body problem, such as the properties of the acoustic excitation branch (Goldstone) of the condensate of pairs, or its collective excitation branch (Higgs) in the broken-pair continuum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of the two-spinon excitations on the field-field correlator of the Tonks-Girardeau gas at thermal equilibrium. Recently, such excitations were investigated for the ground state of the system, and discovered that they prevail for evaluating the one-body correlation function of the model. Here we extend it for finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Detection of Andreev-Bashkin superfluid drag using Cavity Optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Andreev-Bashkin (AB) effect, which corresponds to the non-viscous dragging of one superfluid by another, was predicted several decades ago but has so far eluded experimental observation. We theoretically propose, using the powerful techniques of cavity optomechanics on a ring Bose-Einstein condensate, a detection scheme three orders of magnitude more sensitive than existing methods and proposals. This scheme allows for observing the AB effect in real-time, \textit{in situ} and with minimal destruction of the superfluids. Our proposal, which considers persistent currents in weakly repulsive condensates, is supported by numerical simulations of the stochastic Gross-Pitaevski equation, which agrees well with our analytic Bogoliubov-de Gennes calculations. Our work opens the way for sensitively probing the dynamics of rotationally interacting superfluids and has fundamental implications for ongoing studies of superfluid hydrodynamics, atomtronics, matter-wave interferometry, and cavity optomechanical sensing.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of Quantum Strings by Edge Defect in Kagome Rydberg Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezers can grab particles with their laser beam fingers, so these tiny point objects can be moved by using the laser light. However, manipulation of topological defects, especially higher-dimension ones becomes extremely difficult because they usually require non-local operation involving a great deal of operators, e.g. string operator. Here, using a large-scale quantum Monte Carlo method, we demonstrate the quantum string excitation can be grabbed in the Kagome Rydberg atom array with well-designed edges. After inserting an edge defect, the fractional charge at one end of the string is found to be pinned, allowing the quantum string to be manipulated. Since the quantum string is directed, its quantum fluctuations can be clearly observed due to the movement of the dangling fractional charge at the other end. Then, we can drag the two ends of the string in opposite directions, which is analogous to the separation of a quark-anti-quark pair connected by a gluon string. As the separation distance increases, the quantum fluctuations of the string are strongly suppressed. Eventually, a string-breaking phenomenon occurs. However, if both edge defects are located on the same side, the strings are always broken because both dangling fractional charges take the same gauge charge and can not annihilate each other into the vacuum. This work not only proposes an ideal experimental platform for analyzing quantum string excitations in the ground state but also provides a much simpler method for manipulating quantum string excitations in frustrated systems, such as spin ice.</description>

      <title>Cavity dark mode mediated by atom array without atomic scattering loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We realize a ring cavity strongly interacting with an atom array with configurable spatial structures. By preparing the atom array with a maximized structure factor, we observe the emergence of a cavity dark mode, where the standing-wave nodes are dynamically locked to the positions of the atoms. The dark mode is decoupled from the atoms, protecting the system from dissipation through atomic scattering, but still mediates strong coupling and enables efficient conversion between two optical modes. Moreover, we impart an arbitrary large phase shift on the converted optical fields by translating the atom array. This strongly interacting ring cavity system with single-atom addressability opens ways to quantum optical engineering and the generation of photonic quantum states based on the geometrical structure of atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by nonlinear interaction in a coupler supported by fractional diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a one-dimensional model of coupled fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with a double-well potential applied to one component. This study examines ground state (GS) solitons, observing spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in both the actuated field and the partner component due to linear coupling. Numerical simulations reveal symmetric and asymmetric profiles arising from a slightly asymmetric initial condition. Asymmetry is influenced by nonlinearities, potential depth, and coupling strength, with self-focusing systems favoring greater asymmetry. Fractional diffraction affects the amplitude and localization of symmetric profiles and the stability of asymmetric ones. We identify critical L\'evy index values for generating coupled GS solitons. Stability analysis of unstable, centrally asymmetric GS solitons demonstrates oscillatory dynamics, providing new insights into SSB in fractional systems and half-trapped solitons.</description>

      <title>Dual-species Optical tweezer for Rb and K atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical tweezer experiment with neutral atoms is a focal topic in cold atom physics due to its significant potential in quantum computing and simulation. Here, we present the realization of a dual-species optical tweezer for both Rb and K atoms, marking the first step towards creating a polar molecule optical tweezer array. Initially, Rb and K atoms are collected using a dual magneto-optical trap (MOT) and further cooled to 7 $\mu$K for Rb and 10 $\mu$K for K. By employing 850 nm tweezer beams, we demonstrate the ability to capture individual Rb or K atoms. The filling ratios of Rb and K can be finely adjusted by controlling the atomic densities of both species. Utilizing the post-selection technique, we can create a deterministic array of two-species atoms, paving the way for future polar molecule array formation.</description>

      <title>Trapping of Bose-Einstein condensates in a three-dimensional dark focus generated by conical refraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:1705.02425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient three-dimensional dark-focus optical trapping potential for neutral atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates. This "optical bottle" is created by a single blue-detuned light field exploiting the phenomenon of conical refraction occurring in biaxial crystals. The conversion of a Gaussian input beam to the bottle beam has an efficiency of close to 100 % and the optical setup requires the addition of the biaxial crystal and a circular polarizer only. Based on the conical-refraction theory, we derive the general form of the potential, the trapping frequencies, and the potential barrier heights. We present experiments on confining a $^{87}$Rb Bose-Einstein condensate in three dimensions. We determine the trap shape, the vibrational frequencies along the weak axis, as well as the lifetime of ultracold atoms in this type of potential.</description>

      <title>Dipolar Droplets at 3D-1D Crossover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15433v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate beyond-mean-field corrections to the energy of an elongated homogeneous Bose gas strongly confined in two directions, with dipoles aligned along the long axis of the system. When the dipolar interaction reaches its critical strength, the mean-field approach predicts instability. However, similar to the free-space case, beyond-mean-field effects significantly alter the ground state of the system, leading to the formation of a self-bound atomic cloud known as a quantum droplet. Our analysis demonstrates that the beyond-mean-field contribution to the energy in the quasi-1D region, in addition to the confinement induced shift of the mean field energy, is proportional to the third power of the density $\sim n^3$. Therefore, it can be interpreted as an effective three-body repulsion that stabilizes the gas, preventing collapse and leading to a finite-density solution. We also show that the same effect plays a crucial role in the binding of strongly elongated dipolar droplets under harmonic confinement.</description>

Abstract: We present Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the properties of a two-component mass imbalanced Fermi gas, corresponding to the $^6$Li-$^{40}$K mixture. We compute the equation of state of the unpolarized system as a function of the scattering length with particular attention paid to the unitary limit, where the effect of the effective range of the interaction is explored. We have also computed the pair distribution function and the momentum distribution over a range of interaction strengths to provide information about the structure of the system. Finally, we have computed the heavy/light quasiparticle spectrum. Our theoretical predictions, based on Quantum Monte Carlo calculations, can be tested by future experiments with ultracold fermionic gases.</description>

      <title>Absence of gapless Majorana edge modes in few-leg bosonic flux ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for Majorana excitations has seen tremendous efforts in recent years, ultimately aiming for their individual controllability in future topological quantum computers. A promising framework to realize such exotic Majorana fermions are topologically ordered non-Abelian phases of matter, such as certain fractional quantum Hall states. Quantum simulators provide unprecedented controllability and versatility to investigate such states, and developing experimentally feasible schemes to realize and identify them is of immediate relevance. Motivated by recent experiments, we consider bosons on coupled chains, subjected to a magnetic flux and experiencing Hubbard repulsion. At magnetic filling factor $\nu=1$, similar systems on cylinders have been found to host the non-Abelian Moore-Read Pfaffian state in the bulk. Here, we address the question whether more realistic few-leg ladders can host this exotic state and its chiral Majorana edge states. To this end, we perform extensive DMRG simulations and determine the central charge of the ground state. While we do not find any evidence of gapless Majorana edge modes in systems of up to six legs, exact diagonalization of small systems reveals evidence for the Pfaffian state in the entanglement structure. By systematically varying the number of legs and monitoring the appearance and disappearance of this signal, our work highlights the importance of finite-size effects for the realization of exotic states in experimentally realistic systems.</description>

We calculate the density profiles, the Bogoliubov quasiparticles modes, and the localization length in both the mixture and droplet phases. We show that for one-dimensional speckle potentials, the peculiar interplay of disorder and the Lee-Huang-Yang fluctuations may enhance localization in one component while inducing delocalization in the other. Our results reveal also that thermal fluctuations lead to the emergence of two and multiple localization maxima. In the droplet state, our findings uncover that the Anderson localization of quasiparticles is weak in the flat-top region since its excitation modes are restricted to those below the particle-emission threshold.</description>

Abstract: The composite particle duality extends the notions of both flux attachment and statistical transmutation in spacetime dimensions beyond 2+1D. It constitutes an exact correspondence that can be understood either as a theoretical framework or as a dynamical physical mechanism. The immediate implication of the duality is that an interacting quantum system in arbitrary dimensions can experience a modification of its statistical properties if coupled to a certain gauge field. In other words, commutation relations of quantum fields can be effectively modified by a dynamical physical process. For instance, an originally bosonic quantum fluid in $d$ spatial dimensions can feature composite fermionic (or anyonic) excitations when coupled to a statistical gauge field. In 3+1D the mechanism of flux attachment induces a dynamical formation of dyons as higher-dimensional analogues of Laughlin quasiparticles. In 1+1D there is lack of flux attachment but a remnant in the form of a statistical gauge field can be explicitly constructed. We also introduce a family of interacting quantum many-body systems that undergo statistical transmutation as indicated by the duality. This opens the door to a new realm of topological phases across dimensions both in lattice and continuum systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09517</link>

Abstract: Quantum thermalization occurs in a broad class of systems from elementary particles to complex materials. Out-of-equilibrium quantum systems have long been understood to either thermalize or retain memory of their initial states, but not both. Here we achieve the first coexistence of thermalization and memory in a quantum system, where we use both Rydberg blockade and facilitation in an atom array to engineer a fragmentation of the Hilbert space into exponentially many disjointed subspaces. We find that the kinetically constrained system yields quantum many-body scars arising from the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ class of initial states, which generalizes beyond the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ scars previously reported in other quantum systems. When bringing multiple long-range interactions into resonance, we observe quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments, where the thermalized system retains characteristics of the initial configuration. Intriguingly, states belonging to different subspaces do not thermalize with each other even when they have the same energy. Our work challenges established ideas of quantum thermalization while experimentally resolving the longstanding tension between thermalization and memory. These results may be applied to control entanglement dynamics in quantum processors and quantum sensors.</description>
