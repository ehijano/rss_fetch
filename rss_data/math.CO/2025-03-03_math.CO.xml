      <title>Aggregation of evaluations without unanimity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dokow and Holzman determined which predicates over $\{0, 1\}$ satisfy an analog of Arrow's theorem: all unanimous aggregators are dictatorial. Szegedy and Xu, extending earlier work of Dokow and Holzman, extended this to predicates over arbitrary finite alphabets.
  Mossel extended Arrow's theorem in an orthogonal direction, determining all aggregators without the assumption of unanimity. We bring together both threads of research by extending the results of Dokow-Holzman and Szegedy-Xu to the setting of Mossel. As an application, we determine which symmetric predicates over $\{0,1\}$ are such that all aggregators are dictatorial.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial Ramsey Statement for Bounded VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theorem by Ding, Oporowski, Oxley, and Vertigan states that every sufficiently large bipartite graph without twins contains a matching, co-matching, or half-graph of any given size as an induced subgraph. We prove that this Ramsey statement has polynomial dependency assuming bounded VC-dimension of the initial graph, using the recent verification of the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property for graphs of bounded VC-dimension. Since the theorem of Ding et al. plays a role in (finite) model theory, which studies even more restricted structures, we also comment on further refinements of the theorem within this context.</description>

      <title>Locally connected graphs: metric properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we show that any connected locally connected graph defines a metric space having at least as many lines as vertices with only three exception: the complete multipartite graphs $K_{1,2,2}$, $K_{2,2,2}$ and $K_{2,2,2,2}$. This proves that this class fulfills a conjecture, proposed by Chen and Chv\'atal, saying that any metric space on n points has at least n lines or a line containing all the points.</description>

      <title>On common energies and sumsets II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue to study the relationship between the size of the sum of a set and the common energy of its subsets. We find a rather sharp subexponential dependence between the doubling constant of a set $A$ and the minimal common energy taken over all partitions of $A$ into two disjoint subsets. As an application, we give a proof of the well--known arithmetic regularity lemma with better dependence on parameters.</description>

      <title>4-tangrams are 4-avoidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tangram is a word in which every letter occurs an even number of times. Thus it can be cut into parts that can be arranged into two identical words. The \emph{cut number} of a tangram is the minimum number of required cuts in this process. Tangrams with cut number one corresponds to squares. For $k\ge1$, let $t(k)$ denote the minimum size of an alphabet over which an infinite word avoids tangrams with cut number at most~$k$. The existence of infinite ternary square-free words shows that $t(1)=t(2)=3$. We show that $t(3)=t(4)=4$, answering a question from D\k{e}bski, Grytczuk, Pawlik, Przyby\l{}o, and \'Sleszy\'nska-Nowak.</description>

      <title>Canonical forms of oriented matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positive geometries are semialgebraic sets equipped with a canonical differential form whose residues mirror the boundary structure of the geometry. Every full-dimensional projective polytope is a positive geometry. Motivated by the canonical forms of polytopes, we construct a canonical form for any tope of an oriented matroid, inside the Orlik--Solomon algebra of the underlying matroid. Using these canonical forms, we construct bases for the Orlik--Solomon algebra of a matroid, and for the Aomoto cohomology. These bases of canonical forms are a foundational input in the theory of matroid amplitudes introduced by the second author.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for Ramsey numbers of bounded degree hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, for all $k \ge 3,$ and any integers $\Delta, n$ with $n \ge \Delta,$ there exists a $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ whose $4$-color Ramsey number is at least $\mathrm{tw}_k(c_k \sqrt{\Delta}) \cdot n$, for some constant $c_k &gt; 0$, where $\mathrm{tw}_k$ denotes the tower function. This is tight up to the power of $\Delta$ on top of the tower and extends a result of Graham, R\"{o}dl and Ruci\'{n}ski for graphs.</description>

      <title>Graph factors and powers of Hamilton cycles in the budget-constrained random graph process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the following budget-constrained random graph process introduced by Frieze, Krivelevich and Michaeli. A player, called Builder, is presented with $t$ distinct edges of $K_n$ one by one, chosen uniformly at random. Builder may purchase at most $b$ of these edges, and must (irrevocably) decide whether to purchase each edge as soon as it is offered. Builder's goal is to construct a graph which satisfies a certain property; we investigate the properties of containing different $F$-factors or powers of Hamilton cycles.
  We obtain general lower bounds on the budget $b$, as a function of $t$, required for Builder to obtain partial $F$-factors, for arbitrary $F$. These imply lower bounds for many distinct spanning structures, such as powers of Hamilton cycles. Notably, our results show that, if $t$ is close to the hitting time for a partial $F$-factor, then the budget $b$ cannot be substantially lower than $t$. These results give negative answers to questions of Frieze, Krivelevich and Michaeli.
  Conversely, we also exhibit a simple strategy for constructing (partial) $F$-factors, in particular showing that our general lower bound is tight up to constant factors. The ideas from this strategy can be exploited for other properties. As an example, we obtain an essentially optimal strategy for powers of Hamilton cycles. In order to formally prove that this strategy succeeds, we develop novel tools for analysing multi-stage strategies, which may be of general interest for studying other properties.</description>

Abstract: We evaluate the Hankel determinants of the convolution powers of Motzkin numbers for $r\leq 27$ by finding shifted periodic continued fractions, which arose in application of Sulanke and Xin's continued fraction method. We also conjecture some polynomial characterization of these determinants.</description>

      <title>Halfspace Representations of Path Polytopes of Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a tree $T$, its path polytope is the convex hull of the edge indicator vectors for the paths between any two distinct leaves in $T$. These polytopes arise naturally in polyhedral geometry and applications, such as phylogenetics, tropical geometry, and algebraic statistics. We provide a minimal halfspace representation of these polytopes. The construction is made inductively using toric fiber products.</description>

      <title>Gallai-Schur Triples and Related Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schur's Theorem states that, for any $r \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, there exists a minimum integer $S(r)$ such that every $r$-coloring of $\{1,2,\dots,S(r)\}$ admits a monochromatic solution to $x+y=z$. Recently, Budden determined the related Gallai-Schur numbers; that is, he determined the minimum integer $GS(r)$ such that every $r$-coloring of $\{1,2,\dots,GS(r)\}$ admits either a rainbow or monochromatic solution to $x+y=z$. In this article we consider problems that have been solved in the monochromatic setting under a monochromatic-rainbow paradigm. In particular, we investigate Gallai-Schur numbers when $x \neq y$, we consider $x+y+b=z$ and $x+y&lt;z$, and we investigate the asymptotic minimum number of rainbow and monochromatic solutions to $x+y=z$ and $x+y&lt;z$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K = \mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. Associated to every $n$-element $B_h$ set $A = \{a_1,\ldots, a_n\}$ in $K$ is the $B_h$-vector $\mathbf{a} = (a_1,\ldots, a_n)$ in $K^n$. This paper proves that ``almost all'' $n$-element subsets of $K$ are $B_h$-sets in the sense that the set of all $B_h$-vectors is an open and dense subset of $K^n$.</description>

      <title>Power sum expansions for Kromatic symmetric functions using Lyndon heaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:2301.02177, Crew, Pechenik, and Spirkl defined the Kromatic symmetric function $\overline{X}_G$ as a $K$-analogue of Stanley's chromatic symmetric function $X_G$, and one question they asked was how $\overline{X}_G$ expands in their $\overline{p}_\lambda$ basis, which they defined as a $K$-analogue of the classic power sum basis $p_\lambda.$ In arXiv:2408.01395, we gave a formula that partially answered this question but did not explain the combinatorial significance of the coefficients. Here, we give combinatorial descriptions for the $\overline{p}$-coefficients of $\overline{X}_G$ and $\omega(\overline{X}_G)$, lifting the $p$-expansion of $X_G$ in terms of acyclic orientations that was given by Bernardi and Nadeau in arXiv:1904.01262. We also propose an alternative $K$-analogue $\overline{p}'$ of the $p$-basis that gives slightly cleaner expansion formulas. Our expansions are based on Lyndon heaps, introduced by Lalonde (1995), which are representatives for certain equivalence classes of acyclic orientations on clan graphs of $G$. Additionally, we show that knowing $\overline{X}_G$ is equivalent to knowing the multiset of independence polynomials of induced subgraphs of $G$, which gives shorter proofs of all our results from arXiv:2403.15929 that $\overline{X}_G$ can be used to determine the number of copies in $G$ of certain induced subgraphs. We also give power sum expansions for the Kromatic quasisymmetric function $\overline{X}_G(q)$ defined by Marberg in arXiv:2312.16474 in the case where $G$ is the incomparability graph of a unit interval order.</description>

      <title>Orientations of graphs omitting non-edge-critical directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1974, Erd\H{o}s asked the following question: given a graph $G$ and a directed graph $\vec{H}$, how many ways are there to orient the edges of $G$ such that it does not contain $\vec{H}$ as a subgraph. We denote this value by $D(G, \vec{H})$. Further, we let $D(n, \vec{H})$ denote the maximum of $D(G, \vec{H})$ over all graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices. In 2006, Alon and Yuster gave an exact answer when $\vec{H}$ is a tournament. In 2023, Buci\'c, Janzer, and Sudakov gave asymptotic answers for all directed graphs $\vec{H}$, and in the same paper, they gave an exact answer when $\vec{H}$ is a directed cycle. In this paper, we give a better bound for some specific non-bipartite directed graphs. Further, we obtain exact values of $D(G, \vec{H})$ for some small non-edge-critical directed graphs $\vec{H}$. Finally, for these graphs, we classify all graphs $G$ that attain the bound $D(G, \vec{H}) = D(n, \vec{H})$.</description>

      <title>Extremal Betti Numbers and Persistence in Flag Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate several problems concerning extremal Betti numbers and persistence in filtrations of flag complexes. For graphs on $n$ vertices, we show that $\beta_k(X(G))$ is maximal when $G=\mathcal{T}_{n,k+1}$, the Tur\'an graph on $k+1$ partition classes, where $X(G)$ denotes the flag complex of $G$. Building on this, we construct an edgewise (one edge at a time) filtration $\mathcal{G}=G_1\subseteq \cdots \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{n,k+1}$ for which $\beta_k(X(G_i))$ is maximal for all graphs on $n$ vertices and $i$ edges. Moreover, the persistence barcode $\mathcal{B}_k(X(G))$ achieves a maximal number of intervals, and total persistence, among all edgewise filtrations with $|E(\mathcal{T}_{n,k+1})|$ edges.
  For $k=1$, we consider edgewise filtrations of the complete graph $K_n$. We show that the maximal number of intervals in the persistence barcode is obtained precisely when $G_{\lceil n/2\rceil \cdot \lfloor n/2 \rfloor}=\mathcal{T}_{n,2}$. Among such filtrations, we characterize those achieving maximal total persistence. We further show that no filtration can optimize $\beta_1(X(G_i))$ for all $i$, and conjecture that our filtrations maximize the total persistence over all edgewise filtrations of $K_n$.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional $q$-Jacobi Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical Jacobi polynomials on the interval $[-1,1]$ are eigenfunctions of a second order differential operator. It is well known that this operator generates a diffusion process on $[-1,1]$. Further, this fact admits an extension to $N$ dimensions (Demni (2010), Remling-R\"osler (2011)) leading to a $3$-parameter family of diffusion processes $X_N$ on the space of $N$-particle configurations in $[-1,1]$. The generators of the processes $X_N$ are related to Heckman-Opdam's Jacobi polynomials attached to the root system $BC_N$.
  The first result of the paper shows that the processes $X_N$ have a $q$-analog, the $N$-dimensional $q$-Jacobi processes. These are Feller Markov processes related to the $N$-variate symmetric big $q$-Jacobi polynomials. The later polynomials were introduced and studied by Stokman (1997) and Stokman-Koornwinder (1997); they depend on two Macdonald parameters $(q,t)$ and $4$ extra continuous parameters.
  The $N$-dimensional $q$-Jacobi processes are still defined on a space of $N$-particle configurations, only now the particles live not on $[-1,1]$ but on certain one-dimensional $q$-grids.
  The second result (the main one) asserts that the $N$-dimensional $q$-Jacobi processes survive a limit transition as $N$ goes to infinity and two of the extra parameters vary together with $N$ in a certain way. In the limit, one obtains a family of Feller Markov processes which are infinite-dimensional in the sense that they live on configurations with infinitely many particles. The proof uses a lifting of the multivariate big $q$-Jacobi polynomials to the algebra of symmetric functions -- a construction that does not hold for the Heckman-Opdam's Jacobi polynomials.
  Note also that the large-$N$ limit transition is carried out without any space scaling, which would be impossible in the continuous case.</description>

      <title>On the $L_2$-discrepancy of Latin hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate $L_2$-discrepancies of what we call weak Latin hypercubes. In this case it turns out that there is a precise equivalence between the extreme and periodic $L_2$-discrepancy which follows from a much broader result about generalized energies for weighted point sets.
  Motivated by this we study the asymptotics of the optimal $L_2$-discrepancy of weak Latin hypercubes. We determine asymptotically tight bounds for $d \geq 3$ and even the precise (dimension dependent) constant in front of the dominating term for $d \geq 4$.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the celebrated Fr\"{o}berg's theorem to embedded joins of copies of a simplicial complex, namely higher secant complexes to the simplicial complex, in terms of property $N_{q+1,p}$ due to Green and Lazarsfeld. Furthermore, we investigate combinatorial phenomena parallel to geometric ones observed for higher secant varieties of minimal degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(Q,R)$ be a gentle quiver such that $Q$ is a directed tree, and $\mathbb{K}$ be an algebraically closed field. We study the resolving subcategories generated by a single nonprojective indecomposable module of $\mathbb{K}Q/\langle R \rangle$-mod. We modify the geometric model of Baur--Coelho-Sim\~oes and Opper--Plamondon--Schroll to compute such subcategories. Then we prove that these subcategories are the join-irreducible of the poset of all the resolving subcategories ordered by inclusion.</description>

      <title>Bubble sort and Howe duality for staircase matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an independent proof of the Cauchy identities for staircase matrices, originally discovered in arXiv:2411.03117, using the combinatorics of the Bruhat poset and the bubble-sort procedure. Additionally, we derive new insights into certain coefficients appearing in one of these identities. The first part of the paper focuses on combinatorial aspects. It is self-contained, of independent interest, and introduces a generalization of parabolic Bruhat graphs for monotone functions on an arborescent poset. The second part examines the intersections of Demazure modules within a given integrable representation. Finally, we propose a generalization of the classical Howe duality for staircase matrices in terms of the corresponding distributive lattice of Demazure submodules. Computing the associated character yields the desired Cauchy identities for staircase matrices.</description>

Abstract: Defant and Kravitz considered the following problem: Suppose that, to the right of a foot, there is a line of colored socks that needs to be sorted. However, at any point in time, one can only either place the leftmost sock to the right of the foot onto the foot (stack) or remove the outermost sock on the foot and make it the rightmost sock to the left of the foot (unstack). In this paper, we explicitly describe all minimal initial sock orderings that are unsortable.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Number of Bases in a Family of Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07768v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proportion of $d$-element subsets of $\mathbb{F}_2^d$ that are bases is asymptotic to $\prod_{j=1}^{\infty}(1-2^{-j}) \approx 0.29$ as $d \to \infty$. It is natural to ask whether there exists a (large) subset $\mathcal{F}$ of $\mathbb{F}_2^d$ such that the proportion of $d$-element subsets of $\mathcal{F}$ that are bases is (asymptotically) greater than this number. As well as being a natural question in its own right, this would imply better lower bounds on the Tur\'an densities of certain hypercubes and `daisy' hypergraphs.
  We give a negative answer to the above question. More generally, we obtain an asymptotically sharp upper bound on the proportion of linearly independent $r$-element subsets of a (large) family of vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^d$, for $r \leq d$. This bound follows from an exact result concerning the probability of obtaining a linearly independent sequence when we randomly sample $r$ elements with replacement from our family of vectors: we show that this probability, for any family of vectors, is at most what it is when the family is the whole space $\mathbb{F}_2^d \setminus \{0\}$. Our results also go through when $\mathbb{F}_2$ is replaced by $\mathbb{F}_q$ for any prime power $q$.</description>

      <title>Coarse cops and robber in graphs and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (abstract shortened to meet arxiv's length requirements) We investigate two variants of the classical Cops and robber game in graphs, recently introduced by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche. The two versions are played in infinite graphs and the goal of the cops is to prevent the robber to visit some ball of finite radius (chosen by the robber) infinitely many times. Moreover the cops and the robber move at a different speed, and the cops can choose a radius of capture before the game starts. Depending on the order in which the parameters are chosen, this naturally defines two games, a weak version and a strong version (in which the cops are more powerful), and thus two variants of the cop number of a graph $G$: the weak cop number and the strong cop number. It turns out that these two parameters are invariant under quasi-isometry and thus we can investigate these parameters in finitely generated groups by considering any of their Cayley graphs; the parameters do not depend on the chosen set of generators.
  We answer a number of questions raised by Lee, Mart\'inez-Pedroza, and Rodr\'iguez-Quinche, and more recently by Cornect and Mart\'inez-Pedroza. This includes a proof that the weak and strong cop numbers are monotone under quasi-isometric embedding, characterizations of graphs of weak cop number 1 and graphs of strong cop number 1, and a proof that the grid has infinite strong cop number. Moreover we tie the weak cop number of a graph $G$ to the existence of asymptotic minors of large tree-width in $G$, and use the result to prove that any finitely presented group has weak cop number 1 or $\infty$.
  We have learned very recently that some of our results have been obtained independently by Appenzeller and Klinge, using fairly different arguments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of integral Ricci curvature $I_{\kappa_0}$ for graphs, which measures the amount of Ricci curvature below a given threshold $\kappa_0$. We focus our attention on the Lin-Lu-Yau Ricci curvature. As applications, we prove a Bonnet-Myers-type diameter estimate, a Moore-type estimate on the number of vertices of a graph in terms of the maximum degree $d_M$ and diameter $D$, and a Lichnerowicz-type estimate for the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of the Graph Laplacian, generalizing the results obtained by Lin, Lu, and Yau. All estimates are uniform, depending only on geometric parameters like $\kappa_0$, $I_{\kappa_0}$, $d_M$, or $D$, and do not require the graphs to be positively curved.</description>

      <title>Deformation Theory for Finite Cluster Complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.02566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the deformation theory of the Stanley-Reisner rings associated to cluster complexes for skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras of geometric and finite cluster type. In particular, we show that in the skew-symmetric case, these cluster complexes are unobstructed, generalizing a result of Ilten and Christophersen in the $A_n$ case.
  We also study the connection between cluster algebras with universal coefficients and cluster complexes. We show that for a full rank positively graded cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}$ of geometric and finite cluster type, the cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{univ}}$ with universal coefficients may be recovered as the universal family over a partial closure of a torus orbit in a multigraded Hilbert scheme. Likewise, we show that under suitable hypotheses, the cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{univ}}$ may be recovered as the coordinate ring for a certain torus-invariant semiuniversal deformation of the Stanley-Reisner ring of the cluster complex.
  We apply these results to show that for any cluster algebra $\mathcal{A}$ of geometric and finite cluster type, $\mathcal{A}$ is Gorenstein, and $\mathcal{A}$ is unobstructed if it is skew-symmetric. Moreover, if $\mathcal{A}$ has enough frozen variables then it has no non-trivial torus-invariant deformations. We also study the Gr\"obner theory of the ideal of relations among cluster and frozen variables of $\mathcal{A}$. As a byproduct we generalize previous results in this setting obtained by Bossinger, Mohammadi and N\'ajera Ch\'avez for Grassmannians of planes and $\text{Gr}(3,6)$.</description>

      <title>On Matrix Algebras Isomorphic to Finite Fields and Planar Dembowski-Ostrom Monomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime and $n$ a positive integer. As the first main result, we present a deterministic algorithm for deciding whether the matrix algebra $\mathbb{F}_p[A_1,\dots,A_t]$ with $A_1,\dots,A_t \in \mathrm{GL}(n,\mathbb{F}_p)$ is a finite field, performing at most $\mathcal{O}(tn^6\log(p))$ elementary operations in $\mathbb{F}_p$. In the affirmative case, the algorithm returns a defining element $a$ so that $\mathbb{F}_p[A_1,\dots,A_t] = \mathbb{F}_p[a]$.
  We then study an invariant for the extended-affine equivalence of Dembowski-Ostrom (DO) polynomials. More precisely, for a DO polynomial $g \in \mathbb{F}_{p^n}[x]$, we associate to $g$ a set of $n \times n$ matrices with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_p$, denoted $\mathrm{Quot}(\mathcal{D}_g)$, that stays invariant up to matrix similarity when applying extended-affine equivalence transformations to $g$. In the case where $g$ is a planar DO polynomial, $\mathrm{Quot}(\mathcal{D}_g)$ is the set of quotients $XY^{-1}$ with $Y \neq 0,X$ being elements from the spread set of the corresponding commutative presemifield, and $\mathrm{Quot}(\mathcal{D}_g)$ forms a field of order $p^n$ if and only if $g$ is equivalent to the planar monomial $x^2$, i.e., if and only if the commutative presemifield associated to $g$ is isotopic to a finite field.
  As the second main result, we analyze the structure of $\mathrm{Quot}(\mathcal{D}_g)$ for all planar DO monomials, i.e., for commutative presemifields of odd order being isotopic to a finite field or a commutative twisted field. More precisely, for $g$ being equivalent to a planar DO monomial, we show that every non-zero element $X \in \mathrm{Quot}(\mathcal{D}_g)$ generates a field $\mathbb{F}_p[X] \subseteq \mathrm{Quot}(\mathcal{D}_g)$ and $\mathrm{Quot}(\mathcal{D}_g)$ contains the field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$.</description>

      <title>The Equivalence Problem of E-Pattern Languages with Length Constraints is Undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Patterns are words with terminals and variables. The language of a pattern is the set of words obtained by uniformly substituting all variables with words that contain only terminals. Length constraints restrict valid substitutions of variables by associating the variables of a pattern with a system (or disjunction of systems) of linear diophantine inequalities. Pattern languages with length constraints contain only words in which all variables are substituted to words with lengths that fulfill such a given set of length constraints. We consider membership, inclusion, and equivalence problems for erasing and non-erasing pattern languages with length constraints.
  Our main result shows that the erasing equivalence problem - one of the most prominent open problems in the realm of patterns - becomes undecidable if length constraints are allowed in addition to variable equality.
  Additionally, it is shown that the terminal-free inclusion problem, a prominent problem which has been shown to be undecidable in the binary case for patterns without any constraints, is also generally undecidable for all larger alphabets in this setting.
  Finally, we also show that considering regular constraints, i.e., associating variables also with regular languages as additional restrictions together with length constraints for valid substitutions, results in undecidability of the non-erasing equivalence problem. This sets a first upper bound on constraints to obtain undecidability in this case, as this problem is trivially decidable in the case of no constraints and as it has unknown decidability if only regular- or only length-constraints are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work builds on our previous developments regarding a notion of freeness for tensors. We aim to establish a tensorial free convolution for compactly supported measures. First, we define higher-order analogues of the semicircular (or Wigner) law and the free Poisson (or Marcenko-Pastur) law, giving their moments and free cumulants. We prove the convergence of a Wishart-type tensor to the free Poisson law and recall the convergence of a Wigner tensor to the semicircular law. We also present a free Central Limit Theorem in this context. Next, we introduce a tensorial free convolution, define the $R$-transform, and provide the first examples of free convolution of measures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and study a novel efficient algorithm for clustering and classification tasks based on the famous MBO scheme. On the one hand, inspired by Jacobs et al. [J. Comp. Phys. 2018], we introduce constraints on the size of clusters leading to a linear integer problem. We prove that the solution to this problem is induced by a novel order statistic. This viewpoint allows us to develop exact and highly efficient algorithms to solve such constrained integer problems. On the other hand, we prove an estimate of the computational complexity of our scheme, which is better than any available provable bounds for the state of the art. This rigorous analysis is based on a variational viewpoint that connects this scheme to volume-preserving mean curvature flow in the big data and small time-step limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum Latin square is an $n \times n$ array of unit vectors where each row and column forms an orthonormal basis of a fixed complex vector space. We introduce the notion of $(G,G')$-invariant quantum Latin squares for finite groups $G$ and $G'$. These are quantum Latin squares with rows and columns indexed by $G$ and $G'$ respectively such that the inner product of the $a,b$-entry with the $c,d$-entry depends only on $a^{-1}c \in G$ and $b^{-1}d \in G'$. This definition is motivated by the notion of group invariant bijective correlations introduced in [Roberson \&amp; Schmidt (2020)], and every group invariant quantum Latin square produces a group invariant bijective correlation, though the converse does not hold. In this work we investigate these group invariant quantum Latin squares and their corresponding correlations. Our main result is that, up to applying a global isometry to every vector in a $(G,G')$-invariant quantum Latin square, there is a natural bijection between these objects and trace and conjugate transpose preserving isomorphisms between the group algebras of $G$ and $G'$. This in particular proves that a $(G,G')$-invariant quantum Latin square exists if and only if the multisets of degrees of irreducible representations are equal for $G$ and $G'$. Another motivation for this line of work is that whenever Cayley graphs for groups $G$ and $G'$ are quantum isomorphic, then there is a $(G,G')$-invariant quantum correlation witnessing this, and thus it suffices to consider such correlations when searching for quantum isomorphic Cayley graphs. Given a group invariant quantum correlation, we show how to construct all pairs of graphs for which it gives a quantum isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bounds for Open Addressing Without Reordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit one of the simplest problems in data structures: the task of inserting elements into an open-addressed hash table so that elements can later be retrieved with as few probes as possible. We show that, even without reordering elements over time, it is possible to construct a hash table that achieves far better expected search complexities (both amortized and worst-case) than were previously thought possible. Along the way, we disprove the central conjecture left by Yao in his seminal paper ``Uniform Hashing is Optimal''. All of our results come with matching lower bounds.</description>

      <title>A Coboundary Temperely-Lieb Category for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By considering a suitable renormalization of the Temperley--Lieb category, we study its specialization to the case $q=0$. Unlike the $q\neq 0$ case, the obtained monoidal category, $\mathcal{TL}_0(\Bbbk)$, is not rigid or braided. We provide a closed formula for the Jones--Wenzl projectors in $\mathcal{TL}_0(\Bbbk)$ and give semisimple bases for its endomorphism algebras. We explain how to obtain the same basis using the representation theory of finite inverse monoids, via the associated M\"obius inversion. We then describe a coboundary structure on $\mathcal{TL}_0(\Bbbk)$ and show that its idempotent completion is coboundary monoidally equivalent to the category of $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$-crystals. This gives a diagrammatic description of the commutor for $\mathfrak{sl}_{2}$-crystals defined by Henriques and Kamnitzer and of the resulting action of the cactus group. We also study fiber functors of $\mathcal{TL}_0(\Bbbk)$ and discuss how they differ from the $q\neq 0$ case.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal List-Recovery of Linear Code Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove several results on linear codes achieving list-recovery capacity. We show that random linear codes achieve list-recovery capacity with constant output list size (independent of the alphabet size and length). That is, over alphabets of size at least $\ell^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}$, random linear codes of rate $R$ are $(1-R-\varepsilon, \ell, (\ell/\varepsilon)^{O(\ell/\varepsilon)})$-list-recoverable for all $R\in(0,1)$ and $\ell$. Together with a result of Levi, Mosheiff, and Shagrithaya, this implies that randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes also achieve list-recovery capacity. We also prove that our output list size is near-optimal among all linear codes: all $(1-R-\varepsilon, \ell, L)$-list-recoverable linear codes must have $L\ge \ell^{\Omega(R/\varepsilon)}$.
  Our simple upper bound combines the Zyablov-Pinsker argument with recent bounds from Kopparty, Ron-Zewi, Saraf, Wootters, and Tamo on the maximum intersection of a "list-recovery ball" and a low-dimensional subspace with large distance. Our lower bound is inspired by a recent lower bound of Chen and Zhang.</description>
