      <title>Higher holonomy for curved L${}_\infty$-algebras 1: simplicial methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a natural morphism $\rho$ from the nerve $\text{MC}_\bullet(L) = \text{MC}(\Omega_\bullet \widehat{\otimes} L)$ of a pronilpotent curved L${}_\infty$-algebra $L$ to the simplicial subset $\gamma_\bullet(L) = \text{MC}(\Omega_\bullet \widehat{\otimes} L,s_\bullet)$ of Maurer--Cartan element satisfying the Dupont gauge condition. This morphism equals the identity on the image of the inclusion $\gamma_\bullet(L) \hookrightarrow \text{MC}_\bullet(L)$. The proof uses the extension of Berglund's homotopical perturbation theory for L${}_\infty$-algebras to curved L${}_\infty$-algebras. The morphism $\rho$ equals the holonomy for nilpotent Lie algebras. In a sequel to this paper, we use a cubical analogue $\rho^\square$ of $\rho$ to identify $\rho$ with higher holonomy for semiabelian curved \Linf-algebras.</description>

      <title>Any Graph is a Mapper Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mapper algorithm is a popular tool for visualization and data exploration in topological data analysis. We investigate an inverse problem for the Mapper algorithm: Given a dataset $X$ and a graph $G$, does there exist a set of Mapper parameters such that the output Mapper graph of $X$ is isomorphic to $G$? We provide constructions that affirmatively answer this question. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to engineer Mapper parameters to generate a desired graph.</description>

      <title>On embeddings and acyclic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an acyclic map $X\to Y$ of closed manifolds dimension $d$, we study the relationship between the embeddings of $Y$ in $S^{n}$ with those of $X$ in $S^{n}$ when $n-d \ge 3$.
  The approach taken here is to first solve the Poincar\'e duality space variant of the problem. We then apply the surgery machine to obtain the corresponding results for manifolds. Thereafter, we focus on the case when $X$ is a smooth homology sphere and deduce results about the homotopy type of the space of block embeddings of $X$ in a sphere.</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology via Ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent homology is one of the most popular methods in Topological Data Analysis. An initial step in any analysis with persistent homology involves constructing a nested sequence of simplicial complexes, called a filtration, from a point cloud. There is an abundance of different complexes to choose from, with Rips, Alpha, and witness complexes being popular choices. In this manuscript, we build a different type of a geometrically-informed simplicial complex, called an ellipsoid complex. This complex is based on the idea that ellipsoids aligned with tangent directions better approximate the data compared to conventional (Euclidean) balls centered at sample points that are used in the construction of Rips and Alpha complexes, for instance. We use Principal Component Analysis to estimate tangent spaces directly from samples and present algorithms as well as an implementation for computing ellipsoid barcodes, i.e., topological descriptors based on ellipsoid complexes. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments and compare ellipsoid barcodes with standard Rips barcodes. Our findings indicate that ellipsoid complexes are particularly effective for estimating homology of manifolds and spaces with bottlenecks from samples. In particular, the persistence intervals corresponding to a ground-truth topological feature are longer compared to the intervals obtained when using the Rips complex of the data. Furthermore, ellipsoid barcodes lead to better classification results in sparsely-sampled point clouds. Finally, we demonstrate that ellipsoid barcodes outperform Rips barcodes in classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Distributional Lusternik-Schnirelmann category of manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain several sufficient conditions for the distributional LS-category (dcat) of closed manifolds to be maximum, i.e., equal to their classical LS-category (cat). This gives us many new computations of dcat, especially for essential manifolds and (generalized) connected sums. In the process, we also determine the dcat of closed 3-manifolds having torsion-free fundamental groups and some closed geometrically decomposable 4-manifolds. Finally, we extend some of our results to closed Alexandrov spaces and discuss their cat and dcat in dimension 3.</description>

      <title>Equivariant formality of istropy actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:1511.06228v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a compact connected Lie group and $K$ a connected Lie subgroup. In this paper, we collect an assortment of results on equivariant formality of the isotropy action of $K$ on $G/K$. If the isotropy action of $K$ on $G/K$ is equivariantly formal, then $G/K$ is formal in the sense of rational homotopy theory. This enables us to strengthen a theorem of Shiga--Takahashi to a characterization of equivariant formality in this case. Using a K-theoretic analogue of equivariant formality introduced and shown by the second-named author to be equivalent to equivariant formality in the usual sense, we provide a representation-theoretic characterization for equivariant formality of the isotropy action and give a new, uniform proof of equivariant formality for some classes of homogeneous spaces for which it was previously known.</description>

      <title>Controllable Subspaces in Structured Networks of Hierarchical Directed Acyclic Graphs: Controllability of Individual Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the context of structured networks, this paper introduces the concept of the Fixed Strongly Structurally Controllable Subspace (FSSCS), enabling a comprehensive characterization of controllable subspaces. From a graph-theoretical viewpoint, the paper defines Fixed Strongly Structurally Controllable (FSSC) nodes based on the FSSCS concept and establishes the necessary and sufficient conditions for their identification. This paper proposes a method for determining the exact dimension of the Strongly Structurally Controllable Subspace (SSCS) in hierarchical directed acyclic graphs, employing a blend of graph-theoretical approaches and controllability matrix analyses. This approach not only facilitates the identification of FSSC nodes but also enhances our understanding of the robustness of node controllability against variations in network parameters within structured networks, marking a significant advancement in the field of strong structural controllability of individual nodes.</description>

      <title>On twisted torsion of compact $3$-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a $3$-manifold with connected non-vacuos boundary which is not spherical. Assume that $N$ is another $3$-manifold with vacuous boundary and $N^{\ast}$ is the $3$-manifold obtained by removing from $N$ the interior of a $3$-cell. In the present paper, we find a relationship between the multiplicative property of the twisted Reidemeister torsion and the connected sum operation on these manifolds in order to understand their topology and geometry.</description>
