      <title>Efficient Quantum Simulation of Non-Adiabatic Molecular Dynamics with Precise Electronic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of non-adiabatic chemical processes such as photocatalysis and photosynthesis, non-adiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) is an indispensable theoretical tool, which requires precise potential energy surfaces (PESs) of ground and excited states. Quantum computing offers promising potential for calculating PESs that are intractable for classical computers. However, its realistic application poses significant challenges to the development of quantum algorithms that are sufficiently general to enable efficient and precise PES calculations across chemical systems with diverse properties, as well as to seamlessly adapt existing NAMD theories to quantum computing. In this work, we introduce a quantum-adapted extension to the Landau-Zener-Surface-Hopping (LZSH) NAMD. This extension incorporates curvature-driven hopping corrections that protect the population evolution while maintaining the efficiency gained from avoiding the computation of non-adiabatic couplings (NACs), as well as preserving the trajectory independence that enables parallelization. Furthermore, to ensure the high-precision PESs required for surface hopping dynamics, we develop a sub-microhartree-accurate PES calculation protocol. This protocol supports active space selection, enables parallel acceleration either on quantum or classical clusters, and demonstrates adaptability to diverse chemical systems - including the charged H3+ ion and the C2H4 molecule, a prototypical multi-reference benchmark. This work paves the way for practical application of quantum computing in NAMD, showcasing the potential of parallel simulation on quantum-classical heterogeneous clusters for ab-initio computational chemistry.</description>

      <title>Enhanced particle diffusion in fluctuating binary environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate single-particle diffusion in a two-state Langevin model where the friction coefficient randomly switches between low-friction (liquid-like) and high-friction (glassy-like) states. The dynamics are governed by the ratio between the friction switching time $\tau$ and the intrinsic velocity relaxation time $\tau_0$. For fast switching ($\tau/\tau_0 \lesssim 1$) the motion is homogeneous and Brownian, whereas for slow switching ($\tau/\tau_0 \gg 1$) the particle exhibits intermittent dynamics and an enhanced diffusion coefficient. Analysis of the single-particle overlap function $Q(t)$ and the dynamic susceptibility $\chi_4(t)$ reveals decoupling of the diffusion coefficient from the average friction upon cooling, which coincides with increasing temporal dynamic heterogeneity. This minimal model provides a transparent framework for understanding single-particle transport in media with fluctuating local mobility, including supercooled liquids and phase-separated soft materials.</description>

      <title>Effect of the avoided crossing on the rovibrational energy levels, resonances, and predissociation lifetimes within the ground and first excited electronic states of lithium fluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the LiF spectrum up to $7800$ cm$^{-1}$ above the first dissociation limit. The ab initio calculations of the adiabatic potentials and other molecular functions are performed in a wide range of interatomic separations, $r=1$-17 bohr. We consider the model of two interacting electronic states including both the bound states and the resonances of two kinds, the tunneling resonances and the predissociative ones. The Born-Oppenheimer potentials are modeled with use of two functions imitating the diabatic terms whereas the coupling between them was set constant equal to the half of the minimum separation between the adiabatic terms, and then we define the final diabatic terms and the final diabatic coupling via the adiabatic potentials and the angle of the adiabatic-to-diabatic basis rotation obtained by integration of the nonadiabatic coupling matrix element. The energies of the bound states, as well as the positions and widths of the resonances are calculated. The observed transition frequencies are reproduced with the standard deviation of 0.0009 cm$^{-1}$ for $^7$LiF, 0.0006 cm$^{-1}$ for $^6$LiF, and within the experimental uncertainties for the most of the lines. The line lists for the bound-bound $X$-$X$ rovibrational transitions are calculated for quantum numbers $v\le50,\Delta v\le15,J\le170$ ($J\le200$ for the 0-0 and 1-0 bands).</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric effect in the mixed valence polyoxovanadate cage V$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of spintronic and quantum computing devices increases demand for efficient, energy saving method of spin manipulation at molecular scale. Polyoxovanadate molecular magnets being susceptible to both electric and magnetic fields may serve here as a good base material. In this paper two isostructural anions [V$_{12}$As$_8$O$_{40}$(HCO$_2$)]$^{n-}$ (with $n=3,5$) featuring two different mixed-valence states with itinerant and localized valence electrons are studied. The impact of the electric field on their magnetic properties is investigated by means of two complementary methods informed by magnetic measurements: effective Hamiltonian calculations and density functional theory. It is demonstrated that the magnetoelectric effect in theses molecules is induced mostly by relocation of itinerant electrons, is highly anisotropic, depends on the valence state and can be detected even at room temperature. These findings can pave the way to practical applications in which an electric field control over spin state is required.</description>

      <title>Competing excitonic couplings as origin of mimicked phase transitions in zinc-phthalocyanine single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical properties of molecular crystals are largely determined by the excitonic coupling of neighboring molecules. This coupling is extremely sensitive to the arrangement of adjacent molecular units, as their electronic interaction is defined by the relative orientation of the individual transition dipole moments and their wave function overlap. Hence, the optical properties, such as fluorescence, are usually highly anisotropic and good indicators of structural changes during the variation of intensive thermodynamic parameters like temperature or pressure. Here, we discuss the peculiar though archetypical case of $\beta$-phase zinc-phthalocyanine: In single crystals, we report a sudden change of spectral emission with temperature from a broad, unpolarized Frenkel-exciton type luminescence to a narrow, highly polarized superradiance-like fluorescence below 80 K. Surprisingly, we find that there is no sign of a discrete structural phase transition in this temperature regime. To understand this apparent contradiction, we perform polarization-, temperature- and time-dependent photoluminescence measurements along different crystallographic directions to fully map the emission characteristics of the crystal-exciton. By means of ab-initio calculations on a density functional theory level we conclude that our observations are consistent with a dimer exciton model when considering thermalized electronic states. As such, our study presents a representative case study on a well-established molecular material class demonstrating that caution is advised when attributing discrete changes in electronic observables to a structural phase transition. As we show for zinc-phthalocyanine in its $\beta$-phase modification, slowly varying excitonic couplings and thermal redistribution of excitations can mimic the same signatures attributed to a structural phase transition.</description>

      <title>Rational regulation strategies of interstitial localized electrons in electride: A density functional theory study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a class of electron-rich materials, electrides demonstrate promising applications in many fields. However, the required high pressure restricts the practical applications to some extent. This study reveals that the unique feature of electride, i.e., the localization of interstitial electrons, can be greatly enhanced and tuned by self-defective doping, applying tensile/compressive stress, or shear stress. Moreover, the requirement of orbital orthogonality between the valence and core electron wave functions, as well as the Pauli exclusion principle, should be the driven force for the electron interstitial localization; and the exertion of external pressure modifies the available space to accommodate the electronic wave functions, thus enhances the interstitial localization. These discoveries lay down the ground for searching for promising electrides that are practicable at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>New insights into hydrogen-assisted intergranular cracking in nickel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the grain boundary (GB) susceptibility to hydrogen-assisted intergranular cracking in pure nickel as a function of coincident site lattice value ($\Sigma$-n), over a wide range of hydrogen concentrations (4 to 14 wppm). Cracks on the surface and within the bulk material were identified across the entire gauge region of the specimens. The susceptibility of GBs to crack initiation and propagation was evaluated by separating cracks containing single GB or multiple GBs. A larger loss in fracture strain, a smaller reduction in area, and an increase in the percentage of intergranular fracture indicated a higher degree of embrittlement at elevated hydrogen concentrations. The number of cracks was significantly higher on the surface than in the bulk for the most severe hydrogen charging conditions ($\geq$ 8 wppm), while a similar number was observed for lower concentrations. The propensity for hydrogen-assisted intergranular cracking at different types of GBs on the surface and in the bulk material was consistent, indicating that while cathodic charging can promote surface cracks, it does not significantly impact the GBs relative susceptibility. The $\Sigma$-3 boundaries were the most resistant to cracking, as evidenced by the considerably lower fraction of these GBs exhibiting intergranular cracking at all hydrogen concentrations considered. This contrasts literature findings for Ni alloys and can be explained by the segregation energies and reductions in the cohesive strength with hydrogen, with less favorable trapping at the $\Sigma$-3 boundaries. No evidence of plasticity-mediated cracking initiation was observed.</description>

      <title>Non-classical nucleation pathways in liquid condensation revealed by simulation and theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19473v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using state-of-the-art rare-event sampling simulations, we precisely characterize the nucleation of liquid droplets from a supersaturated Lennard-Jones gas and uncover a key physical feature: critical clusters nucleate with a density that differ substantially from that of the macroscopic equilibrium liquid. Our atomistic simulations also reveal a non-classical nucleation pathway showing simultaneous growth and densification in liquid condensation. We then exploit these insights to develop a two-variable nucleation theory, in which the cluster density is allowed to vary. Our accessible model based on the capillary approximation is able to quantitatively retrieve the numerical results in nucleation rate and critical cluster properties over a large range of supersaturation. Remarkably, the two-variable model successfully captures the observed nucleation pathway. The effectiveness of this integrated numerical and theoretical framework demonstrates that the cluster density is a decisive variable in nucleation, highlighting the limitations of the single-variable description while offering a robust foundation for its refinement.</description>

      <title>Simulating the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions in NMR by spin dynamic mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17720v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simulation of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments is a notoriously difficult task, if many spins participate in the dynamics. The recently established dynamic mean-field theory for high-temperature spin systems (spinDMFT) represents an efficient yet accurate method to deal with this scenario. SpinDMFT reduces a complex lattice system to a time-dependent single-site problem, which can be solved numerically with small computational effort. Since the approach retains local quantum degrees of freedom, a quadrupolar term can be exactly incorporated. This allows us to study the interplay of dipolar and quadrupolar interactions for any parameter range, i.e., without the need for a perturbative treatment. We obtain a remarkable agreement with experimental data for an aluminium nitride monocrystal, which strongly suggests the use of spinDMFT as a prediction tool. Furthermore, we draw a comparison between a quantum-mechanical and a classical version of spinDMFT showing that local quantum effects are of great importance for the studied type of system.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Water Structure at Charged Interfaces Studied by Depth Resolved Vibrational SFG/DFG Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The molecular water structure at charged aqueous interfaces is shaped by interfacial electric fields, which can induce significant anisotropy in the molecular orientations extending over nanometer-scale distances. Despite great relevance, very little is known about the details of this depth-dependent anisotropic water structure, mainly due to the lack of appropriate experimental techniques. Here, we present a depth-resolved study of the water anisotropy at the interface to insoluble charged surfactants using a newly developed technique which allows for directly correlating nonlinear vibrational spectra with depth information on the nanometer scale. We demonstrate that the obtained data allows for a full reconstruction of the nonlinear vibrational responses as function of depth. The results for the case of low salinity solutions show the presence of two pronounced regions within the interfacial anisotropy with largely deviating degrees of preferential molecular orientations. A spectral analysis of the depth-dependent vibrational responses furthermore reveals that the natural local hydrogen-bond structure of bulk water remains largely unperturbed throughout the interfacial region, including water in direct proximity of the surface charges. These findings significantly refine our understanding of the anisotropic water structure at the interface to hydrophilic charged surfactants and showcase the large potential of our depth-resolved spectroscopic technique.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Pruning for Increased Robustness and Reduced Computational Overhead in Gaussian Process Accelerated Saddle Point Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a strategy for accelerating saddle point searches on high-dimensional energy surfaces by reducing the number of times the energy and its derivatives with respect to atomic coordinates need to be evaluated. The computational overhead in the hyperparameter optimization can, however, be large and make the approach inefficient. Failures can also occur if the search ventures too far into regions that are not represented well enough by the GP model. Here, these challenges are resolved by using geometry-aware optimal transport measures and an active pruning strategy using a summation over Wasserstein-1 distances for each atom-type in farthest-point sampling, selecting a fixed-size subset of geometrically diverse configurations to avoid rapidly increasing cost of GP updates as more observations are made. Stability is enhanced by permutation-invariant metric that provides a reliable trust radius for early-stopping and a logarithmic barrier penalty for the growth of the signal variance. These physically motivated algorithmic changes prove their efficacy by reducing to less than a half the mean computational time on a set of 238 challenging configurations from a previously published data set of chemical reactions. With these improvements, the GP approach is established as, a robust and scalable algorithm for accelerating saddle point searches when the evaluation of the energy and atomic forces requires significant computational effort.</description>

      <title>Modeling formation and transport of clusters at high temperature and pressure gradients by implying partial chemical equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theoretical approach to describing transport of an entire ensemble of clusters with different sizes as a single species in gas has been developed. The major assumption is an existence of local partial chemical equilibrium between the clusters. It is shown that thermal diffusion emerges in the collective description as a significant factor even if it is negligible when transport of the original molecular species is considered. Analytical expressions for the effective diffusion and thermal diffusion coefficients at temperature, pressure, and chemical composition gradients have been derived. The theory has been applied to a technology of H2S conversion in a centrifugal plasma-chemical reactor and has made it possible to account for sulfur clusters in numerical process modeling.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling of Continuous Lyophilization for Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lyophilization (aka freeze drying) is a typical process in pharmaceutical manufacturing used for improving the stability of various drug products, including its recent applications to mRNA vaccines. While extensive efforts have been dedicated to shifting the pharmaceutical industry toward continuous manufacturing, the majority of industrial-scale lyophilization is still being operated in a batch mode. This article presents the first mechanistic model for a complete continuous lyophilization process, which comprehensively incorporates and describes key transport phenomena in all three steps of lyophilization, namely freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. The proposed model considers the state-of-the-art lyophilization technology, in which vials are suspended and move continuously through the process. The validated model can accurately predict the evolution of critical process parameters, including the product temperature, ice/water fraction, sublimation front position, and concentration of bound water, for the entire process. Several applications related to model-based process design and optimization of continuous lyophilization are also demonstrated. The final model is made available in MATLAB and Julia as an open-source software package called ContLyo, which can ultimately be leveraged for guiding the design and development of future continuous lyophilization processes.</description>

      <title>Lower Bound on the Representation Complexity of Antisymmetric Tensor Product Functions</title>

Abstract: Tensor product function (TPF) approximations have been widely adopted in solving high-dimensional problems, such as partial differential equations and eigenvalue problems, achieving desirable accuracy with computational overhead that scales linearly with problem dimensions. However, recent studies have underscored the extraordinarily high computational cost of TPFs on quantum many-body problems, even for systems with as few as three particles. A key distinction in these problems is the antisymmetry requirement on the unknown functions. In the present work, we rigorously establish that the minimum number of involved terms for a class of TPFs to be exactly antisymmetric increases exponentially fast with the problem dimension. This class encompasses both traditionally discretized TPFs and the recent ones parameterized by neural networks. Our proof exploits the link between the antisymmetric TPFs in this class and the corresponding antisymmetric tensors and focuses on the Canonical Polyadic rank of the latter. As a result, our findings reveal that low-rank TPFs are fundamentally unsuitable for high-dimensional problems where antisymmetry is essential.</description>

      <title>Exponential speed-up in VQE molecular energy ranking with Sridhara-compressed Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12678</link>

Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are residual and intermediary molecules in the Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) to produce graphene from methane. Ranking a combinatorial space of variants of PAHs by energy allows the CVD to be optimized, while simulations of PAHs are strong candidates for quantum advantage in quantum computers. We extend on Sridhara's root formula to perform block diagonalization (SBD) of six PAHs using Hartree-Fock Hamiltonians with STO-3G basis set and $(2,2)$, $(4,4)$, $(6,6)$ settings of active orbitals and active electrons. We show that the proposed SBD algorithm followed by Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) allows ranking molecules by ground state energy with $77.8\%$ of success in comparison with the uncompressed VQE, while speeding up the VQE simulation in $164.16\%$ (median) keeping its average error of active space reduction down to $0.09\%$. We conclude that the flexibilization of constraints of the SBD algorithm makes it a fast and reliable estimator for active space reduction in molecular simulation.</description>
