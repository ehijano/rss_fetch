      <title>Difference of weighted composition operators between Bergman spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first obtain a simpler proof of the main results in [IEOT, {\bf 93}(2021), 17], which characterized the bounded and compact differences $C_{u,\varphi}-C_{v,\psi}$ of two weighted composition operators acting from $A_{\alpha}^p(\mathbb{D})$ to $A_{\alpha}^q(\mathbb{D})$. Then we get some characterizations for the difference of weighted composition operator belonging to Schatten class. Moreover, compact difference of a weighted composition operator and a unweighted composition operator on Hardy space is also studied. It shows a rigidity, i.e. $C_{u,\varphi}-C_{\psi}$ is compact on $H^{2}(\mathbb{D})$ if and only if both $C_{u',\varphi}:H^2(\mathbb{D})\to A_{1}^2(\mathbb{D})$ and $C_{u\varphi',\varphi}-C_{\psi',\psi}:A_{1}^2(\mathbb{D})\to A_{1}^2(\mathbb{D})$ are compact, which generalize a result in [JFA, {\bf 278}(2020), 108401].</description>

      <title>Essential norm and Schatten class difference of weighted composition operators over the ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the essential norm estimate for the difference of two weighted composition operators acting on standard weighted Bergman spaces over the unit ball. And we get some characterizations for the difference of weighted composition operators belonging to Schatten class, which has rarely been considered before. Our methods are fundamental, which involve Carleson measures and $R$-Berezin transform.</description>

      <title>Density properties of orbits for a hypercyclic operator on a Banach space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study density properties of orbits for a hypercyclic operator $T$ on a separable Banach space $X$, and show that exactly one of the following four cases holds: (1) every vector in $X$ is asymptotic to zero with density one; (2) generic vectors in $X$ are distributionally irregular of type $1$; (3) generic vectors in $X$ are distributionally irregular of type $2\frac{1}{2}$ and no hypercyclic vector is distributionally irregular of type $1$; (4) every hypercyclic vector in $X$ is divergent to infinity with density one. We also present some examples concerned with weighted backward shifts on $\ell^p$ to show that all the above four cases can occur. Furthermore, we show that similar results hold for $C_0$-semigroups.</description>

      <title>Microlocal analysis of non-linear operators arising in Compton CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel microlocal analysis of a non-linear ray transform, $\mathcal{R}$, arising in Compton Scattering Tomography (CST). Due to attenuation effects in CST, the integral weights depend on the reconstruction target, $f$, which has singularities. Thus, standard linear Fourier Integral Operator (FIO) theory does not apply as the weights are non-smooth. The V-line (or broken ray) transform, $\mathcal{V}$, can be used to model the attenuation of incoming and outgoing rays. Through novel analysis of $\mathcal{V}$, we characterize the location and strength of the singularities of the ray transform weights. In conjunction, we provide new results which quantify the strength of the singularities of distributional products based on the Sobolev order of the individual components. By combining this new theory, our analysis of $\mathcal{V}$, and classical linear FIO theory, we determine the Sobolev order of the singularities of $\mathcal{R}f$. The strongest (lowest Sobolev order) singularities of $\mathcal{R}f$ are shown to correspond to the wavefront set elements of the classical Radon transform applied to $f$, and we use this idea and known results on the Radon transform to prove injectivity results for $\mathcal{R}$. In addition, we present novel reconstruction methods based on our theory, and we validate our results using simulated image reconstructions.</description>

      <title>The Rhaly Operators on K\"othe Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the Rhaly operator on K\"othe spaces, with a primary focus on understanding its well-definedness, continuity, and compactness. We especially examine operators acting on power series spaces of both infinite and finite type. In the sequel, we provide integral representations for the Rhaly operator on the space of entire functions $H(\mathbb{C})$ and the space of holomorphic functions on the unit disc $H(\mathbb{D})$. We also investigate the topologizability and power boundedness of the Rhaly operators, which leads to findings about their mean ergodicity, uniform mean ergodicity, and Ces\`aro boundedness.</description>

      <title>A universal approximation theorem and its applications to vector lattice theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result in approximation theory states that for any continuous function \( \varphi: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \), the set \( \operatorname{span}\{\varphi \circ g : g \in \operatorname{Aff}(\mathbb{R})\} \) is dense in \( \mathcal{C}(\mathbb{R}) \) if and only if \( \varphi \) is not a polynomial. In this note, we present infinite dimensional variants of this result. These extensions apply to neural network architectures and improves the main density result obtained in \cite{BDG23}. We also discuss applications and related approximation results in vector lattices, improving and complementing results from \cite{AT:17, bhp,BT:24}.</description>

      <title>Matrix convex sets over the Euclidean ball and polar duals of real free spectrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the free spectrahedron determined by universal anticommuting self-adjoint unitaries is not equal to the minimal matrix convex set over the ball in dimension three or higher. This example, as well as other matrix convex sets over the ball, then provides context for structure results on the extreme points of coordinate projections. In particular, we show that the free polar dual of a real free spectrahedron is rarely the projection of a real free spectrahedron, contrasting a prior result of Helton, Klep, and McCullough over the complexes. We use this to show that spanning results for free spectrahedra that are closed under complex conjugation do not extend to free spectrahedrops that meet the same assumption. These results further clarify the role of the coefficient field.</description>

      <title>On spectrally optimal duals for r-erasures of frames generated by graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [9], authors studied spectrally optimal dual frames for 1-erasure and 2-erasures of frames generated by graph. In this paper, we study spectrally optimal dual frames for r-erasures. We show that the spectral radius of the error operator of unitary equivalent frames is same with respect to their respective canonical dual frames. We prove that if a frame is generated by a connected graph, then its canonical dual frame is the unique spectrally optimal dual frame for r-erasures. Further, we show that the canonical dual of frames generated by disconnected graphs are non-unique spectrally optimal dual frames for r-erasures.</description>

      <title>Optimal decay of semi-uniformly stable operator semigroups with empty spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that it is impossible to quantify the decay rate of a semi-uniformly stable operator semigroup based on sole knowledge of its spectrum. More precisely, given an arbitrary positive function $r$ vanishing at $\infty$, we construct a Banach space $X$ and a bounded semigroup $ (T(t))_{t \geq 0}$ of operators on it whose infinitesimal generator $A$ has empty spectrum $\sigma(A)=\varnothing$, but for which, for some $x \in X$, $$\limsup_{t\to\infty} \frac{\|T(t)A^{-1}x\|_{X}}{r(t)}=\infty.$$</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of diffeomorphic minimizers of $L^p$-mean distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $L^p$-mean distortion functionals, \[{\cal E}_p[f] = \int_\mathbb Y K^p_f(z) \; dz, \] for Sobolev homeomorphisms $f: \overline{\mathbb Y}\xrightarrow{\rm onto} \overline{\mathbb X}$ where $\mathbb X$ and $\mathbb Y$ are bounded simply connected Lipschitz domains, and $f$ coincides with a given boundary map $f_0 \colon \partial \mathbb Y \to \partial \mathbb X$. Here, $K_f(z)$ denotes the pointwise distortion function of $f$. It is conjectured that for every $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$, the functional $\mathcal{E}_p$ admits a minimizer that is a diffeomorphism. We prove that if such a diffeomorphic minimizer exists, then it is unique.</description>

      <title>On Bauschke-Bendit-Moursi modulus of averagedness and classifications of averaged nonexpansive operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Averaged operators are important in Convex Analysis and Optimization Algorithms. In this paper, we propose classifications of averaged operators, firmly nonexpansive operators, and proximal operators using the Bauschke-Bendit-Moursi modulus of averagedness. We show that if an operator is averaged with a constant less than 1/2, then it is a bi-Lipschitz homeomorphism. Amazingly the proximal operator of a convex function has its modulus of averagedness less than 1/2 if and only if the function is Lipschitz smooth. Some results on the averagedness of operator compositions are obtained. Explicit formulae for calculating the modulus of averagedness of resolvents and proximal operators in terms of various values associated with the maximally monotone operator or subdifferential are also given. Examples are provided to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Minimization of Degenerate Nonlinear Functionals under Radial Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the minimization of nonlinear functionals in dimension $d\geq 1$ that depend on a degenerate radial weight $w$. Our goal is to prove the existence of minimizers in a suitable functional class here introduced and to establish that the minimizers of such functionals, which exhibit $p$-growth with $1 &lt; p &lt; +\infty$, are radially symmetric. In our analysis, we adopt the approach developed in [Chiad\`o Piat, De Cicco and Melchor Hernandez, NoDEA $2025$, De Cicco and Serra Cassano, ESAIM:COCV $2024$], where $w$ does not satisfy classical assumptions such as doubling or Muckenhoupt conditions. The core of our method relies on proving the validity of a weighted Poincar\'e inequality involving a suitably constructed auxiliary weight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every real-valued Lipschitz function on a subset of a metric space can be extended to the whole space while preserving the slope and, up to a small error, the global Lipschitz constant. This answers a question posed by Di Marino, Gigli, and Pratelli, who established the analogous property for the asymptotic Lipschitz constant. We also prove the same result for the ascending slope and for the descending slope.</description>

      <title>Peripheral Poisson Boundary: Extensions and Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this article is to explore the possibility of extending the notion of peripheral Poisson boundary of unital completely positive (UCP) maps to contractive completely positive (CCP) maps and to unital and non-unital contractive quantum dynamical semigroups on von Neumann algebras. We observe that the theory extends easily in the setting of von Neumann algebras and normal maps. Surprisingly, the peripheral Poisson boundary is unital, whenever it is nontrivial, even for contractive semigroups. The strong operator limit formula for computing the extended Choi-Effros product remains intact. However, there are serious obstacles in the framework of $C^*$-algebras, and we are unable to define the extended Choi-Effros product in such generality. We provide several intriguing examples to illustrate this.</description>

      <title>Notes on a special order on $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1958, Helson and Lowdenslager extended the theory of analytic functions to a general class of groups with ordered duals. In this context, analytic functions on such a group $G$ are defined as the integrable functions whose Fourier coefficients lie in the positive semigroup of the dual of $G$. In this paper, we found some applications of their theory to infinite-dimensional complex analysis. Specifically, we considered a special order on $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$ and corresponding analytic continuous functions on $\mathbb{T}^\omega$, which serves as the counterpart of the disk algebra in infinitely many variables setting. By characterizing its maximal ideals, we have generalized the following theorem to the infinite-dimensional case: For a positive function $w$ that is integrable and log-integrable on $\mathbb{T}^d$, there exists an outer function $g$ such that $w=|g|^2$ if and only if the support of $\hat{\log w}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}^d\cap (-\mathbb{N})^d$. Furthermore, we have found the counterpart of the above function algebra in the closed right half-plane, and the representing measures of each point in the right half-plane for this algebra. As an application of the order, we provided a new proof of the infinite-dimensional Szeg\"{o}'s theorem.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E_1, \ldots, E_m$ be (non necessarily Archimedean) Riesz spaces, let $F$ be an Archimedean Riesz space and let $A \colon E_1 \times \cdots \times E_m \to F$ be a regular disjointness preserving $m$-linear operator. We prove that all Arens extensions of $A$ are disjointness preserving if either $A$ has finite rank or the spaces are Banach lattices and $F^*$ has a Schauder basis consisting of disjointness preserving functionals.</description>

      <title>How orthogonality influences geometric constants?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, based on isosceles orthogonality, we have found equivalent definitions for three constants: A2(X) proposed by Baronti in 2000 [J. Math. Anal. Appl. 252(2000), 124- 146], CNJ(X) introduced by Alonso et al. in 2008 [Stud. Math. 188(2008), 135-150], and LYJ(X) put forward by Liu et al. in 2022 [Bull. Malays. Math. Sci. Soc., 45(2022), 307-321]. A core commonality among these three constants is that they are all restricted to the unit sphere. This finding provides us with an insight: could it be that several constants defined over the entire space, when combined with orthogonality conditions, are equivalent to being restricted to the unit sphere?</description>

      <title>Quantitative nonembeddability of groups of polynomial growth into uniformly convex spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonabelian simply connected nilpotent Lie groups and not virtually abelian finitely generated groups of polynomial growth do not quasi-isometrically embed into uniformly convex Banach spaces. We quantify this fact by showing that a ball of radius $r\ge 2$ in the aforementioned groups must incur bilipschitz distortion at least a constant multiple of $(\log r)^{1/q}$ into a $q(\ge 2)$-uniformly convex Banach space. This bound is sharp for the $L^p$ ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) spaces. We prove this by establishing ``vertical versus horizontal inequalities'' for functions from the aforementioned groups into uniformly convex spaces, using the vector-valued Littlewood--Paley--Stein theory approach of Lafforgue and Naor (2012). These inequalities are quantitative nonembeddability statements that any Lipschitz mapping from the aforementioned groups into a uniformly convex space quantitatively collapses along certain central subgroups.
  In the special case of mappings of Carnot groups into the $L^p$ ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$) spaces, we prove that the quantitative collapse occurs on the commutator subgroup; this is in line with the qualitative Pansu--Semmes nonembeddability argument given by Cheeger and Kleiner (2006) and Lee and Naor (2006). We prove this by establishing a version of the classical Dorronsoro theorem on Carnot groups. Previously, in the setting of Heisenberg groups, F\"assler and Orponen (2019) established a one-sided Dorronsoro theorem with a restriction $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$ on the range of exponents $\alpha$ of the Laplacian; this restriction does not appear in the commutative setting and is caused by their use of horizontal polynomials as approximants. We identify the correct class of approximant polynomials and prove the two-sided Dorronsoro theorem with the full range $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\infty$ of exponents in the general setting of Carnot groups, thus strengthening and extending the work of F\"assler and Orponen.</description>

      <title>Wave packet analysis of semigroups generated by quadratic differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a phase space analysis of evolution equations associated with the Weyl quantization $q^{\mathrm{w}}$ of a complex quadratic form $q$ on $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$ with non-positive real part. In particular, we obtain pointwise bounds for the matrix coefficients of the Gabor wave packet decomposition of the generated semigroup $e^{tq^{\mathrm{w}}}$ if $\mathrm{Re} (q) \le 0$ and the companion singular space associated is trivial. This result is then leveraged to achieve a comprehensive analysis of the phase regularity of $e^{tq^{\mathrm{w}}}$ with $\mathrm{Re} (q) \le 0$, thereby extending the $L^2$ analysis of quadratic semigroups initiated by Hitrik and Pravda-Starov to general modulation spaces $M^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$, $1 \le p \le \infty$, with optimal explicit bounds.</description>

      <title>Error Exponents for Quantum Packing Problems via An Operator Layer Cake Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove a one-shot random coding bound for classical-quantum channel coding, a problem conjectured by Burnashev and Holevo in 1998. By choosing the optimal input distribution, we recover the optimal error exponent (i.e., the reliability function) of classical-quantum channels for rates above the critical rate. Our result extends to various quantum packing-type problems, including classical communication over any fully quantum channel with or without entanglement-assistance, constant composition codes, and classical data compression with quantum side information via fixed-length or variable-length coding.
  Our technical ingredient is to establish an operator layer cake theorem - the directional derivative of an operator logarithm admits an integral representation of certain projections. This shows that a kind of pretty-good measurement is equivalent to a randomized Holevo-Helstrom measurement, which provides an operational explanation of why the pretty-good measurement is pretty good.</description>
