      <title>The Rise of UAV Fleet Technologies for Emergency Wireless Communications in Harsh Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For unforeseen emergencies, such as natural disasters and pandemic events, it is highly demanded to cope with the explosive growth of mobile data traffic in extremely critical environments. An Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) fleet is an effective way to facilitate the Emergency wireless COmmunication NETwork (EcoNet). In this article, a MUlti-tier Heterogeneous UAV Network (MuHun), which is with different UAV fleets in different altitudes, is proposed to flexibly serve various emergencies. We refresh the key performance indicators of full coverage, network capacity, low latency, and energy efficiency in harsh environments. Then, we present the special challenges regarding shadowing-dominated complex channel model, energy supply limited short-endurance, various communication mechanisms coexistence, and communication island for underground users in UAV-based EcoNet, followed by the MuHun-based EcoNet architecture and its advantages. Furthermore, some potential solutions such as the new hybrid-channel adapted resource allocation, reconfigurable intelligent surface assisted UAV communications, competitive heterogenous-networks, and magnetic induction based air-to-ground/underground communications are discussed to effectively achieve full coverage, high capacity, high energy efficiency, and diverse qualities of services for EcoNets in harsh environments.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Analytical Design Procedure for Distributed Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a simple while comprehensive analytical design procedure for distributed amplifiers. Distributed amplifiers are attractive for designers due to their wideband capability. When designing a distributed amplifier, the first question that comes to mind is how wide the bandwidth can be. This paper answers this question by using the self-matching and low-pass properties of a distributed amplifier. Self-matching property of a distributed power amplifier is an interesting point that distinguishes it from other types of power amplifiers that are usually based on input and output matching networks. Here the estimation of the bandwidth of a distributed amplifier structure is discussed. The equations that are used in this paper can bring good insight and they can assist designers. Furthermore, we have explained the frequency behavior of a tapered distributed amplifier analytically for the first time. In order to validate the approach presented here, we have used published designs including our previously published design as practical examples. The flowchart of the design procedure is also provided.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Machine Learning in Mental Health: A Survey of Data, Algorithms, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of machine learning (ML) in detecting, diagnosing, and treating mental health disorders is garnering increasing attention. Traditionally, research has focused on single modalities, such as text from clinical notes, audio from speech samples, or video of interaction patterns. Recently, multimodal ML, which combines information from multiple modalities, has demonstrated significant promise in offering novel insights into human behavior patterns and recognizing mental health symptoms and risk factors. Despite its potential, multimodal ML in mental health remains an emerging field, facing several complex challenges before practical applications can be effectively developed. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the data availability and current state-of-the-art multimodal ML applications for mental health. It discusses key challenges that must be addressed to advance the field. The insights from this survey aim to deepen the understanding of the potential and limitations of multimodal ML in mental health, guiding future research and development in this evolving domain.</description>

      <title>Quanv4EO: Empowering Earth Observation by means of Quanvolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant amount of remotely sensed data is generated daily by many Earth observation (EO) spaceborne and airborne sensors over different countries of our planet. Different applications use those data, such as natural hazard monitoring, global climate change, urban planning, and more. Many challenges are brought by the use of these big data in the context of remote sensing applications. In recent years, employment of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)-based algorithms have allowed a more efficient use of these data but the issues in managing, processing, and efficiently exploiting them have even increased since classical computers have reached their limits. This article highlights a significant shift towards leveraging quantum computing techniques in processing large volumes of remote sensing data. The proposed Quanv4EO model introduces a quanvolution method for preprocessing multi-dimensional EO data. First its effectiveness is demonstrated through image classification tasks on MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, and later on, its capabilities on remote sensing image classification and filtering are shown. Key findings suggest that the proposed model not only maintains high precision in image classification but also shows improvements of around 5\% in EO use cases compared to classical approaches. Moreover, the proposed framework stands out for its reduced parameter size and the absence of training quantum kernels, enabling better scalability for processing massive datasets. These advancements underscore the promising potential of quantum computing in addressing the limitations of classical algorithms in remote sensing applications, offering a more efficient and effective alternative for image data classification and analysis.</description>

      <title>The Questionable Influence of Entanglement in Quantum Optimisation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is promising compared to other quantum algorithms, but also depends significantly on the appropriate design of the underlying quantum circuit. Recent research by Bowles, Ahmend \&amp; Schuld, 2024 [1] raises questions about the effectiveness of entanglement in circuits for quantum machine learning algorithms. In our paper we want to address questions about the effectiveness of state preparation via Hadamard gates and entanglement via CNOT gates in the realm of quantum optimisation. We have constructed a total of eight different circuits, varying in implementation details, solving a total of 100 randomly generated MaxCut problems. Our results show no improvement with Hadamard gates applied at the beginning of the circuits. Furthermore, also entanglement shows no positive effect on the solution quality in our small scale experiments. In contrast, the investigated circuits that used entanglement generally showed lower, as well as deteriorating results when the number of circuit layers is increased. Based on our results, we hypothesise that entanglement can play a coordinating role, such that changes in individual parameters are distributed across multiple qubits in quantum circuits, but that this positive effect can quickly be overdosed and turned negative. The verification of this hypothesis represents a challenge for future research and can have a considerable influence on the development of new hybrid algorithms.</description>

      <title>Sparks of Quantum Advantage and Rapid Retraining in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize various fields by solving complex problems more efficiently than classical computers. Despite this promise, practical quantum advantage is hindered by current hardware limitations, notably the small number of qubits and high noise levels. In this study, we leverage adiabatic quantum computers to optimize Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, a powerful neural network architecture for representing complex functions with minimal parameters. By modifying the network to use Bezier curves as the basis functions and formulating the optimization problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem, we create a fixed-sized solution space, independent of the number of training samples. Our approach demonstrates sparks of quantum advantage through faster training times compared to classical optimizers such as the Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adaptive Gradient, and simulated annealing. Additionally, we introduce a novel rapid retraining capability, enabling the network to be retrained with new data without reprocessing old samples, thus enhancing learning efficiency in dynamic environments. Experimental results on initial training of classification and regression tasks validate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing significant speedups and comparable performance to classical methods. While experiments on retraining demonstrate a sixty times speed up using adiabatic quantum computing based optimization compared to that of the gradient descent based optimizers, with theoretical models allowing this speed up to be even larger! Our findings suggest that with further advancements in quantum hardware and algorithm optimization, quantum-optimized machine learning models could have broad applications across various domains, with initial focus on rapid retraining.</description>

      <title>Artificial Agency and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The arrival of Large Language Models (LLMs) has stirred up philosophical debates about the possibility of realizing agency in an artificial manner. In this work we contribute to the debate by presenting a theoretical model that can be used as a threshold conception for artificial agents. The model defines agents as systems whose actions and goals are always influenced by a dynamic framework of factors that consists of the agent's accessible history, its adaptive repertoire and its external environment. This framework, in turn, is influenced by the actions that the agent takes and the goals that it forms. We show with the help of the model that state-of-the-art LLMs are not agents yet, but that there are elements to them that suggest a way forward. The paper argues that a combination of the agent architecture presented in Park et al. (2023) together with the use of modules like the Coscientist in Boiko et al. (2023) could potentially be a way to realize agency in an artificial manner. We end the paper by reflecting on the obstacles one might face in building such an artificial agent and by presenting possible directions for future research.</description>
