      <title>Rovibrational computations for the He$_2$ a $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{u}^+$ state including non-adiabatic, relativistic, and QED corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A potential energy curve (PEC) accurate to a fraction of 1 ppm ($1:10^6$) is computed for the $^3\Sigma_\mathrm{u}^+$ state of He$_2$ endowed with relativistic and QED corrections. The nuclear Schr\"odinger equation is solved on this PEC with diagonal Born-Oppenheimer and non-adiabatic mass corrections to obtain highly accurate rotational-vibrational levels. The computed rovibrational intervals and fine-structure splittings, spanning over several orders of magnitude in energy, are found to be in remarkable agreement with available high-resolution spectroscopy data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the potential energy curve, the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer, non-adiabatic mass, relativistic, and leading-order QED corrections for the ground electronic state of the helium dimer cation; the higher-order QED and finite-nuclear size effects are also estimated. The computations are carried out with an improved error control and over a much broader configuration range compared to earlier work [D. Ferenc, V. I. Korobov, and E. M\'atyus, Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 213001 (2020)]. As a result, all rovibrational bound states are reported with an estimated accuracy of 0.005 cm$^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work compiles the spin-dependent leading-order relativistic and quantum electrodynamical corrections to the electronic structure of atoms and molecules within the non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics framework. We report the computation of perturbative corrections using an explicitly correlated Gaussian basis set, which allows high-precision computations for few-electron systems. In addition to numerical tests for triplet Be, triplet H$_2$, and triplet H$_3^+$ states and comparison with no-pair Dirac-Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian energies, numerical results are reported for electronically excited states of the triplet helium dimer, He$_2$, for which the present implementation delivers high-precision magnetic coupling curves necessary for a quantitative understanding of the fine structure of its high-resolution rovibronic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Imaging valence electron rearrangement in a chemical reaction using hard X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have observed the signatures of valence electron rearrangement in photoexcited ammonia using ultrafast hard X-ray scattering. Time-resolved X-ray scattering is a powerful tool for imaging structural dynamics in molecules because of the strong scattering from the core electrons localized near each nucleus. Such core-electron contributions generally dominate the differential scattering signal, masking any signatures of rearrangement in the chemically important valence electrons. Ammonia represents an exception to the typically high core-to-valence electron ratio. We measured 9.8 keV X-ray scattering from gas-phase deuterated ammonia following photoexcitation via a 200 nm pump pulse to the 3s Rydberg state. We observed changes in the recorded scattering patterns due to the initial photoexcitation and subsequent deuterium dissociation. Ab initio calculations confirm that the observed signal is sensitive to the rearrangement of the single photoexcited valence electron as well as the interplay between adiabatic and nonadiabatic dissociation channels. The use of ultrafast hard X-ray scattering to image the structural rearrangement of single valence electrons constitutes an important advance in tracking valence electronic structure in photoexcited atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>AI-assisted prediction of catalytically reactive hotspots in nanoalloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoalloys offer a unique opportunity to tailor chemical properties through changes in composition, shape, and size. However, this flexibility introduces complexity that challenges both experimental and conventional theoretical methods. In this work, we present an AI-assisted framework for predicting reactive hotspots in nanoalloys. First, we use a Metropolis Monte Carlo method with a lattice-based machine learning potential, trained on 2NN-MEAM data, to rapidly identify thermodynamically stable nanoparticle structures, demonstrated for Pt-Ni homotops. This approach yields core-shell geometries with Ni-rich cores and Pt-enriched surfaces. To predict catalytic activity, we exploit the correlation between reactivity and d-band centers. Rather than relying on costly DFT calculations, we employ a multiscale method using SCC-DFTB and machine learning to efficiently and accurately map d-band centers across a wide range of nanoalloy sizes and compositions. The framework is validated on Pt-Ni nanoparticles of experimental relevance and is readily extendable to other nanoalloy systems.</description>

      <title>Block Tensor Decomposition: A dual grid scheme with formal O(N3) for THC decomposition of molecular systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and fast treatment of electron-electron interactions remains a central challenge in electronic structure theory because post-Hartree-Fock methods often suffered from the computational cost for 4-index electron repulsion integrals (ERIs). Low-rank approaches such as tensor hyper-contraction (THC) and interpolative separable density fitting (ISDF) have been proposed for Hartree-Fock exchange and correlation's calculations. Their application to molecular systems remains inefficient due to the construction of THC kernel whose time scale increases as quartic with the number of basis functions. In this work, we present an algorithm named block tensor decomposition (BTD) based on a dual grid scheme that combines Hilbert sort and pivoted Cholesky decomposition to generate compact interpolative grids, allowing strict $O(N^3)$ scaling for THC/ISDF kernel construction. The key parameters in BTD are optimized via differential evolution, balancing efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, we apply BTD in scaled opposite-spin MP2 (SOS-MP2), leveraging sparse mapping in real space to achieve quadratic scaling for electron correlation calculation and linear scaling for exchange calculation. This work advances low-scaling THC/ISDF methodologies for molecular systems, offering a robust framework for efficient and accurate electronic structure computations.</description>

      <title>Operator Forces For Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations extend the length and time scale of atomistic simulations by replacing groups of correlated atoms with CG beads. Machine-learned coarse-graining (MLCG) has recently emerged as a promising approach to construct highly accurate force fields for CG molecular dynamics. However, the calibration of MLCG force fields typically hinges on force matching, which demands extensive reference atomistic trajectories with corresponding force labels. In practice, atomistic forces are often not recorded, making traditional force matching infeasible on pre-existing datasets. Recently, noise-based kernels have been introduced to adapt force matching to the low-data regime, including situations in which reference atomistic forces are not present. While this approach produces force fields which recapitulate slow collective motion, it introduces significant local distortions due to the corrupting effects of the noise-based kernel. In this work, we introduce more general kernels based on normalizing flows that substantially reduce these local distortions while preserving global conformational accuracy. We demonstrate our method on small proteins, showing that flow-based kernels can generate high-quality CG forces solely from configurational samples.</description>

      <title>Strong Correlations, Green's Function Zeros and Topological Transitions in Orbital-Symmetry-Controlled Chemical Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We integrate concepts from topological band theory and strong-correlation physics with the principle of orbital symmetry conservation, which characterizes reactions as symmetry allowed or forbidden based on whether molecular orbitals cross along the reaction coordinate. Using a $4\pi$ electrocyclization as an example, we show how Green's functions generalize the concepts of symmetry allowed and symmetry forbidden reactions even in the presence of strong multi-reference correlations. We demonstrate how symmetry forbidden reactions are characterized by strong multi-reference correlations, resulting in crossings of Green's function zeros rather than poles as MO-theory would predict. Taking into account Green's functions zeros, a topological invariant is introduced that captures symmetry protected crossings of poles or zeros. We discuss the effects of symmetry breaking and outline generalizations of our approach to reactions without any conserved spatial symmetries along the reaction path. Our work lays the groundwork for systematic application of modern topological methods to chemical reactions and can be generalized to reactions involving different spin states or to excited states.</description>

      <title>Optimized auxiliary functions for robust mitigation of finite-size errors in periodic hybrid density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When calculating properties of periodic systems at the thermodynamic limit (TDL), the dominant source of finite size error (FSE) arises from the long-range Coulomb interaction, and can manifest as a slowly converging quadrature error when approximating an integral in the reciprocal space by a finite sum. The singularity subtraction (SS) method offers a systematic approach for reducing this quadrature error and thus the FSE. In this work, we first investigate the performance of the SS method in the simplest setting, aiming at reducing the FSE in exact exchange calculations by subtracting the Coulomb contribution with a single, adjustable Gaussian auxiliary function. We demonstrate that a simple fitting method can robustly estimate the optimal Gaussian width and leads to rapid convergence toward the TDL. Furthermore, we suggest new forms of the auxiliary function, whose optimal parameters could also be determined through least-squares fitting. For a range of semiconductors and insulators, the proposed auxiliary functions achieve robust, millihartree-level accuracy in hybrid density functional theory calculations, including cases with sparse k-meshes and large basis sets.</description>

      <title>Exchange-correlation torques from gauge symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of predicting accurate exchange-correlation (xc) spin-torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is extraneous to SDFT. Furthermore, SDFT does not apply in the presence of vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the physical implications of the U(1)xSU(2) gauge invariance of the xc energy in SpinCurrent-DFT. We derive explicit xc torque expressions based on meta-generalized-gradient approximations in the framework of the generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) formulation. One key term represents an xc-torque involving the GKS spin-kinetic energy density; and another term resembles the phenomenological spin current of the Landau-Lifshitz equations: both are derived from first-principles. We also show that the functional form ensures that the GKS particle- and spin-currents are identical, in form, to their interacting counterparts. Non-collinear equilibrium conditions and adiabatic dynamics are thus derived that resolve longstanding issues.</description>

      <title>Massive Atomic Diversity: a compact universal dataset for atomistic machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of machine-learning models for atomic-scale simulations has benefited tremendously from the large databases of materials and molecular properties computed in the past two decades using electronic-structure calculations. More recently, these databases have made it possible to train universal models that aim at making accurate predictions for arbitrary atomic geometries and compositions. The construction of many of these databases was however in itself aimed at materials discovery, and therefore targeted primarily to sample stable, or at least plausible, structures and to make the most accurate predictions for each compound - e.g. adjusting the calculation details to the material at hand. Here we introduce a dataset designed specifically to train machine learning models that can provide reasonable predictions for arbitrary structures, and that therefore follows a different philosophy. Starting from relatively small sets of stable structures, the dataset is built to contain massive atomic diversity (MAD) by aggressively distorting these configurations, with near-complete disregard for the stability of the resulting configurations. The electronic structure details, on the other hand, are chosen to maximize consistency rather than to obtain the most accurate prediction for a given structure, or to minimize computational effort. The MAD dataset we present here, despite containing fewer than 100k structures, has already been shown to enable training universal interatomic potentials that are competitive with models trained on traditional datasets with two to three orders of magnitude more structures. We describe in detail the philosophy and details of the construction of the MAD dataset. We also introduce a low-dimensional structural latent space that allows us to compare it with other popular datasets and that can be used as a general-purpose materials cartography tool.</description>

      <title>From Brownian dynamics to Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations: multi-resolution simulations of ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting with a microscopic (individual-based) Brownian dynamics model of charged particles (ions), its macroscopic description is derived as a system of partial differential equations that govern the evolution of ion concentrations in space and time. The macroscopic equations are obtained in the form of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck system. A multi-resolution method for simulating charged particles is then developed, combining the detailed Brownian dynamics model in a part of the computational domain with coarser macroscopic equations in the remainder. The strengths, limitations, and applicability of microscopic, macroscopic, and multi-resolution simulation approaches are demonstrated through an illustrative model comprising a system of Na$^+$ and Cl$^-$ ions.</description>

Abstract: Given the power of large language and large vision models, it is of profound and fundamental interest to ask if a foundational model based on data and parameter scaling laws and pre-training strategies is possible for learned simulations of chemistry and materials. The scaling of large and diverse datasets and highly expressive architectures for chemical and materials sciences should result in a foundation model that is more efficient and broadly transferable, robust to out-of-distribution challenges, and easily fine-tuned to a variety of downstream observables, when compared to specific training from scratch on targeted applications in atomistic simulation. In this Perspective we aim to cover the rapidly advancing field of machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIP), and to illustrate a path to create chemistry and materials MLIP foundation models at larger scale.</description>

      <title>Theoretical insights into the role of lattice fluctuations on the excited behavior of lead halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites have been extensively studied as a class of materials with unique optoelectronic properties. A fundamental aspect that governs optical and electronic behaviors within these materials is the intricate coupling between charges and their surrounding lattice. Unravelling the role of charge-lattice interactions on the optoelectronic properties in lead halide perovskites is necessary to understand their photophysics. Unlike traditional semiconductors where a harmonic approximation often suffices to capture lattice fluctuations, lead halide perovskites have a significant anharmonicity attributed from the rocking and tilting motions of inorganic framework. Thus, while there is broad consensus on the importance of the structural deformations and polar fluctuations on the behavior of charge carriers and quasiparticles, the strongly anharmonic nature of these fluctuations and their strong interactions render theoretical descriptions of lead halides perovskites challenging. In this Account, we review our recent efforts to understand how the soft, polar lattice of this class of materials alter their quasiparticle binding energies and fine structure, charge mobilities, and lifetimes of phonons and excess charges. Throughout, these are aimed at characterizing the interplay between lattice fluctuations and optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites and are reviewed in the context of the effective models we have built, and the novel theoretical methods we have developed to understand bulk crystalline materials, as well as nanostructures, and lower dimensionality lattices. By integrating theoretical advances with experimental observations, the perspective we detail in this account provides a comprehensive picture that serves as both design principles for optoelectronic materials and a set of theoretical tools to study them when charge-lattice interactions are important.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning models have become indispensable tools in applications across the physical sciences. Their training is often time-consuming, vastly exceeding the inference timescales. Several protocols have been developed to perturb the learning process and improve the training, such as shrink and perturb, warm restarts, and stochastic resetting. For classifiers, these perturbations have been shown to result in enhanced speedups or improved generalization. However, the design of such perturbations is usually done ad hoc by intuition and trial and error. To rationally optimize training protocols, we frame them as first-passage processes and consider their response to perturbations. We show that if the unperturbed learning process reaches a quasi-steady state, the response at a single perturbation frequency can predict the behavior at a wide range of frequencies. We employ this approach to a CIFAR-10 classifier using the ResNet-18 model and identify a useful perturbation and frequency among several possibilities. We demonstrate the transferability of the approach to other datasets, architectures, optimizers and even tasks (regression instead of classification). Our work allows optimization of perturbations for improving the training of machine learning models using a first-passage approach.</description>
