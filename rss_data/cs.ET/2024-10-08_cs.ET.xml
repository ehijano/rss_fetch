      <title>OmniBuds: A Sensory Earable Platform for Advanced Bio-Sensing and On-Device Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensory earables have evolved from basic audio enhancement devices into sophisticated platforms for clinical-grade health monitoring and wellbeing management. This paper introduces OmniBuds, an advanced sensory earable platform integrating multiple biosensors and onboard computation powered by a machine learning accelerator, all within a real-time operating system (RTOS). The platform's dual-ear symmetric design, equipped with precisely positioned kinetic, acoustic, optical, and thermal sensors, enables highly accurate and real-time physiological assessments. Unlike conventional earables that rely on external data processing, OmniBuds leverage real-time onboard computation to significantly enhance system efficiency, reduce latency, and safeguard privacy by processing data locally. This capability includes executing complex machine learning models directly on the device. We provide a comprehensive analysis of OmniBuds' design, hardware and software architecture demonstrating its capacity for multi-functional applications, accurate and robust tracking of physiological parameters, and advanced human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>Applying Quantum Autoencoders for Time Series Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection is an important problem with applications in various domains such as fraud detection, pattern recognition or medical diagnosis. Several algorithms have been introduced using classical computing approaches. However, using quantum computing for solving anomaly detection problems in time series data is a widely unexplored research field.
  This paper explores the application of quantum autoencoders to time series anomaly detection. We investigate two primary techniques for classifying anomalies: (1) Analyzing the reconstruction error generated by the quantum autoencoder and (2) latent representation analysis. Our simulated experimental results, conducted across various ansaetze, demonstrate that quantum autoencoders consistently outperform classical deep learning-based autoencoders across multiple datasets. Specifically, quantum autoencoders achieve superior anomaly detection performance while utilizing 60-230 times fewer parameters and requiring five times fewer training iterations. In addition, we implement our quantum encoder on real quantum hardware. Our experimental results demonstrate that quantum autoencoders achieve anomaly detection performance on par with their simulated counterparts.</description>

      <title>Grover Speedup from Many Forms of the Zeno Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11146v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has previously been established that adiabatic quantum computation, operating based on a continuous Zeno effect due to dynamical phases between eigenstates, is able to realise an optimal Grover-like quantum speedup. In other words is able to solve an unstructured search problem with the same $\sqrt{N}$ scaling as Grover's original algorithm. A natural question is whether other manifestations of the Zeno effect can also support an optimal speedup in a physically realistic model (through direct analog application rather than indirectly by supporting a universal gateset). In this paper we show that they can support such a speedup, whether due to measurement, decoherence, or even decay of the excited state into a computationally useless state. Our results also suggest a wide variety of methods to realise speedup which do not rely on Zeno behaviour. We group these algorithms into three families to facilitate a structured understanding of how speedups can be obtained: one based on phase kicks, containing adiabatic computation and continuous-time quantum walks; one based on dephasing and measurement; and finally one based on destruction of the amplitude within the excited state, for which we are not aware of any previous results. These results suggest that there may be exciting opportunities for new paradigms of analog quantum computing based on these effects.</description>
