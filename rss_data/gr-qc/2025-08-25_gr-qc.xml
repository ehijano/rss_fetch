      <title>Parameter Estimation of Magnetised Kerr Black Holes Using Their Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the shadow features of magnetized Kerr black holes (MKBHs) using a deviation parameter \( B \) that captures the effect of an external magnetic field on spacetime geometry. These spacetimes, of Petrov type \( D \), are asymptotically non-flat. We use the separability of the Hamilton--Jacobi equation to generate null geodesics and examine the crucial impact parameters for unstable photon orbits that define the black hole shadow. We carefully study how the magnetic field intensity \( B \) and spin parameter \( a \) influence shadow morphology, discovering that increasing \( B \) enlarges the shadow while also introducing additional distortions, especially at high spins. We compute the shadow observables -- area \( A \) and oblateness \( D \) -- and create contour plots in the parameter space \[(a/M, \, BM)\] to facilitate parameter estimation. We also investigate the dependence of the shadow on observer position, specifically altering the radial coordinate \( r_{\mathrm{O}} \) and inclination angle \( \theta \). The results reveal that as \( B \) increases, so does the shadow size, and the distortion is affected by both spin and observer orientation. For far observers, the shadow approaches its asymptotic shape, but finite-distance observers perceive substantial deviations. Our findings demonstrate that MKBH shadows encode clear imprints of magnetic deviations, thereby offering a potential avenue to distinguish Kerr from non-Kerr spacetimes and to probe magnetic effects in the strong-gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Negative potential-induced scalarization in the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a negative potential-induced scalarization of the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg (EEH) black hole in the EEH-scalar (EEHS) theory, characterized by mass $M$, Euler-Heisenberg parameter $\mu$, and magnetic charge $q$. Within this framework, the charge $q$ can exceed the extremal bound $q/M &gt; 1$, and a single event horizon is maintained provided the parameter $\mu$ exceeds the $\mu_{\text{max}} = 0.019$, with the ADM mass fixed at $M = 1/2$. We obtain a single branch of scalarized EEH (sEEH) black holes for $q &gt; 0$ which is considered as the simplest model for scalarization of EEH black holes. We found that this class of hairy black holes is not thermodynamically favored, and their quasinormal modes indicate they are dynamically unstable. An interesting feature is that when $q &lt; 1/2$, the scalar charge varies only slightly with $q$ for a fixed mass. In contrast, for $q&gt;1/2$, the scalar charge increases more rapidly as $q$ increases. This distinct behavior suggests that the scalar charge exhibits the characteristics of a primary charge for $q &lt; 1/2$, and of a secondary charge for $q &gt; 1/2$. This finding reveals notable features of hairy black holes in EEH theory, specifically in the overcharging regime.</description>

      <title>Interacting Scalar Field Cosmology from Full Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relational cosmological dynamics emerging from interacting group field theory (GFT) models minimally coupled to a massless clock scalar field and a self-interacting scalar field. We focus on two broad classes of GFT interactions - pseudosimplicial and pseudotensorial - which generalize simplicial and tensorial interactions, respectively. Treating these interactions perturbatively, we extract the effective cosmological dynamics using mean-field techniques. In the geometric sector, we identify appropriate classical limits of the resulting dynamics, characterized by the emergence of a cosmological constant term in pseudotensorial models and of dynamical dark energy in pseudosimplicial ones. In the matter sector, we find that quantum gravity interactions induce a mass term and modify the classical symmetries of the scalar field dynamics, allowing for a consistent classical matter-geometry description only for specific forms of the effective scalar field potential. Finally, we show that these quantum gravity compatibility conditions on the effective potentials can be relaxed by allowing for a scale-dependent gravitational coupling, and that this running is uniquely fixed once the classical scalar field potential is specified.</description>

      <title>Non-flat Universe with Tsallis holographic dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated evolution of metric and density perturbations for Tsallis model of holographic dark energy with energy density $\sim L^{2\gamma - 4}$, where $L$ is length of event horizon or inverse Hubble parameter and $\gamma$ is parameter of non-additivity close to $1$. Because holographic dark energy is not an ordinary cosmological fluid but a phenomena caused by boundaries of the universe, the ordinary analysis for perturbations is not suitable. One needs to consider perturbations of the future event horizon. For realistic values of parameters it was discovered that perturbations of dark energy don't grow infinitely but vanish or freeze. We also considered the case of realistic interaction between holographic dark energy and matter and showed that in this case perturbations also can asymptotically freeze with time.</description>

      <title>A generalized static spherically symmetric anisotropic compact star model in isotropic coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, an exact solution of Einstein's field equations for spherically symmetric anisotropic matter distributions in isotropic coordinates is obtained. For this, the solution has been obtained by using a generalized physically significant metric potential B(r) and a specific choice of the anisotropy. This new class of generalized solutions is singularity-free, which can be used to describe relativistic compact stars.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic compact star model with quadratic equation of state in paraboloidal spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report a new exact solution of Einstein's field equations for static spherically symmetric anisotropic matter distributions on the background of paraboloidal spacetime by assuming a quadratic equation of state. The model parameters were found by matching the interior spacetime metric with the Schwarzschild exterior metric. The new exact solution is non-singular and meets all of the physical plausibility conditions for a realistic compact star. The detailed physical analysis of the model reveals that the gravitational potentials and matter variables are well-behaved throughout the distribution. The stability of the model has been analyzed under various conditions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the extreme mass-ratio inspiral population from LISA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), the inspirals of stellar-mass compact objects into massive black holes, are predicted to be observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). A sufficiently large number of EMRI observations will provide unique insights into the massive black hole population. We have developed a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework capable of constraining the parameters of the EMRI population, accounting for selection biases. We leverage the capacity of a feed-forward neural network as an emulator, enabling detectability calculations of $\sim10^5$ EMRIs in a fraction of a second, speeding up the likelihood evaluation by $\gtrsim6$ orders of magnitude. We validate our framework on a phenomenological EMRI population model. This framework enables studies of how well we can constrain EMRI population parameters, such as the slope of both the massive and stellar-mass black hole mass spectra and the branching fractions of different formation channels, allowing further investigation into the evolution of massive black holes.</description>

      <title>A new solution of Einstein-Maxwell field equations in isotropic coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a novel exact solution to the Einstein-Maxwell field equations in isotropic coordinates for charged anisotropic matter distribution, achieved by considering one of the metric potentials as well as a particular form of pressure anisotropy and electric field. We analysed all physical features of a realistic star to ensure the model's viability, and we observed that it met all the physical plausibility conditions. The gravitational potentials and matter variables are well-behaved and regular throughout the distribution. All energy conditions have been verified using graphical representations. The stability criteria of the model have been discussed via different conditions. A detailed physical analysis of the star 4U 1538-52 demonstrates that our model is viable.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical polymer field with a cubic potential in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the semiclassical dynamics of a polymer quantized scalar field with a cubic potential in cosmology. The cosmological spacetime is chosen to be homogeneous and isotropic, and we work in the polymer quantization scheme where the field operator does not exist directly. The dynamics are studied in the `e-fold' time gauge, where a choice of time gauge fixing, in terms of the scale factor, is made at the classical level. The cubic potential is interesting to study because it is unbounded from below. We find that polymer quantization regularizes this potential, and leads to periods of slow-roll as well as exactly de-Sitter inflation.</description>

      <title>Einstein@Home all-sky "bucket" search for continuous gravitational waves in LIGO O3 public data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves using LIGO O3 public data from the Hanford and Livingston detectors. We search for nearly-monochromatic signals with frequencies $30\, \text{Hz} \leq f \leq 250\, \text{Hz}$ and spin-down $-2.7 \times 10^{-9}\, \text{Hz/s} \leq \dot{f} \leq 0.2 \times 10^{-9}\, \text{Hz/s}$. We deploy this search on the Einstein@Home volunteer-computing project and on three super computer clusters; the Atlas supercomputer at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, and the two high performance computing systems Raven and Viper at the Max Planck Computing and Data Facility. Our results are consistent with a non-detection. We set upper limits on the gravitational wave amplitude $h_{0}$, and translate these to upper limits on the neutron star ellipticity and on the r-mode amplitude. The most stringent upper limits are at 173 Hz with $h_{0} = 6.5\times 10^{-26}$, at the 90% confidence level.</description>

      <title>ACT-Era Constraints on Single-Field Inflation in $f(T)$ Teleparallel Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reassess single-field slow-roll inflation in teleparallel gravity with $f(T)=C\,T^{2\delta+1}$, motivated by recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) that indicate a modest upward shift in the scalar spectral index $n_s$. Using analytic approximations together with high-precision numerical calculations, we compute primordial predictions for representative potentials: power-law monomials, hilltop models, and $E$-type plateaus. We find that torsional corrections controlled by $\delta$ generically suppress $r$ while keeping $n_s$ near its slow-roll value. As a result, modest positive $\delta$ can restore viability to sub-quadratic monomials and hilltop models that are disfavored in general relativity (GR), whereas $E$-type plateaus remain compatible only in a limited range of $\delta$: small $\delta$ may improve the fit but moderate $\delta$ drives the dynamics toward quadratic-like behaviour and increases $r$. These signatures are observationally testable: improved cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode measurements will further discriminate among potential classes and place quantitative bounds on torsional deviations from GR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay of relativistic fluid dynamics and spacetime geometry is discussed in the regime of small wave numbers and frequencies. A combination of gravitational Ward identities and fluid dynamic equations of motion in the Mueller-Israel-Stewart formulation is used to explicitly determine the retarded linear response of the energy-momentum tensor to metric perturbations. We also discuss applications to gravitational wave production and the damping of gravitational waves in a relativistic fluid.</description>

      <title>A Theory of the Big Bang in McTaggart's Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are long standing questions about the Big Bang What were its properties? Was there nothing before it? Was the universe always here? Many conceptual issues revolve around time. This paper gives a novel model based on McTaggarts temporal distinction between the A-series future-present-past and B-series earlier-times to later times. These series are useful while situated in a Presentist and Fragmentalist account of quantum mechanics, one in which the consistency with the Special Relativity in particular the relativity of simultaneity will be made explicit section 6. This allows us to make a fruitful distinction between two pertinent questions what happens as we go to earlier times toward the Big Bang? And: what happens as we go further into the past toward the Big Bang?</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensates in Astrophysics and Cosmology: From Quantum Statistics to Cosmic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and their manifestations in astrophysical and cosmological contexts. Building upon the foundations of quantum statistics in curved spacetime, we derive the conditions for BEC formation under extreme gravitational fields and explore their implications for compact objects and early universe physics. Through rigorous mathematical treatment incorporating general relativistic corrections to the Bose-Einstein distribution, we demonstrate that BEC phenomena may play crucial roles in neutron star interiors, primordial black hole formation, and dark matter halos. Our analysis reveals that the critical temperature for condensation exhibits non-trivial dependence on spacetime curvature, with corrections of order O(GM/rc2) becoming significant near compact objects. We further show that axion dark matter, if it exists, naturally forms a cosmic BEC with coherence length {\lambda}dB ~ 10^-3 pc for ma ~ 10^-22 eV, potentially explaining the observed core-cusp problem in galactic dark matter profiles. These findings suggest that quantum coherence effects at macroscopic scales may be more prevalent in the universe than previously recognized, with profound implications for our understanding of cosmic structure formation and the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Analytic Tools for Harvesting Magic Resource in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum vacuum is not really empty; it is a reservoir of operationally accessible non-classical resources. Understanding how to extract these resources to fuel information processing is a core objective in quantum technologies and lies at the heart of relativistic quantum information (RQI). While earlier studies of quantum resource harvesting protocols relied primarily on numerical methods, we present, for the first time, exact analytic results for the transition probability and coherence of a qutrit Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a scalar field in anti-de Sitter spacetime of arbitrary dimension. Leveraging these results, we analytically investigate the harvesting of non-stabilizerness and demonstrate that stronger spacetime curvature and higher dimensionality significantly suppress the amount of extractable magic resource from the vacuum. Our analytic framework is readily applicable to other scenarios, laying the groundwork for further analytic studies in RQI.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Targeted Searches for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first catalog of targeted searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) from 114 active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may host supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), using the NANOGrav 15 yr data set. By incorporating electromagnetic priors on sky location, distance, redshift, and CW frequency, our strain and chirp mass upper limits are on average 2.6$\times$ more constraining than sky-averaged limits. Bayesian model comparisons against a common uncorrelated red noise for the gravitational wave background (GWB) disfavor a CW signal for almost all targets, yielding a mean Bayes factor of $0.87 \pm 0.31$. There are two notable exceptions: SDSS J153636.22+044127.0, ``Rohan'' with $\mathrm{BF} = 3.37(5)$, and SDSS J072908.71+400836.6, ``Gondor'' with $\mathrm{BF} = 2.44(3)$. These Bayes factors correspond to p-values of $0.01$--$0.03$ ($1.9\sigma$--$2.3\sigma$) and $0.05$--$0.08$ ($1.4\sigma$--$1.6\sigma$), respectively, depending on the empirical null distribution. We outline the beginnings of a detection protocol by identifying and carrying out a battery of tests on Rohan and Gondor to verify their binary nature. Notably, when replacing the common uncorrelated red noise model with a Hellings--Downs correlated GWB, Rohan's Bayes factor drops to $1.25(7)$, while Gondor's increases to $3.2(1)$. Both have rich electromagnetic datasets, including optical and infrared variability and spectroscopic features that support their classification as SMBHB candidates, though this was discovered after the targeted searches were complete. Our results suggest more simulations are needed to confirm or refute the nature of these and future SMBHB candidates, while creating a roadmap for targeted CW detection.</description>

      <title>Probing Reheating in a Decaying Oscillatory Inflationary Model with Latest ACT Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) indicate a moderate upward shift in the scalar spectral index $n_s$ compared to Planck $2018$, thereby placing tighter constraints on inflationary scenarios. Motivated by these results, we investigate a decaying oscillatory Inflationary model inspired by minimal no-scale supergravity, characterized by the potential $V(\phi) = \lambda \phi^{2n} \sin^2(l/\phi^n)$. We perform a numerical analysis of the background dynamics and reheating process across a range of model parameters. The model yields robust predictions for $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, in excellent agreement with current ACT data. Successful reheating in this model requires a large effective equation-of-state parameter approaching unity, consistent with both cosmic microwave background (CMB) and big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints. The corresponding number of inflationary $e$-folds increases with $n$ and is weakly sensitive to $l$. Overall, the model offers a simple yet predictive framework that captures both inflationary dynamics and post-inflationary reheating, and remains viable under the latest high-precision observations.</description>

      <title>The essential regularity of singular connections in Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we accomplish three things: (i) We discover the geometric (true) regularity of affine connections, their essential (highest possible) regularity, a geometric property independent of starting atlas. (ii) We give a checkable necessary and sufficient condition for determining whether or not connections are at their essential regularity, based on the relative regularity of the connection and its Riemann curvature. (iii) We introduce a computable procedure for lifting any $L^p$ affine connection in an atlas ($p&gt;n$), to a new atlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity. To accomplish this, we prove that the RT-equations, originally designed by the authors to locally lift the regularity of singular connections by just one derivative, surprisingly, also induce an implicit hidden regularization of the Riemann curvature tensor, together with a global regularization of transition maps between regularizing coordinate charts. From this we deduce a multi-step regularization of the connection, and construct a new atlas in which the connection exhibits its essential regularity. The present paper is a culmination of the theory of the RT-equations which provides a definitive theory for determining whether or not singularities in an $L^p$ affine connection ($p&gt;n$) are essential or removable by coordinate transformation, together with an explicit procedure for lifting removable singularities to their essential regularity, both locally and globally. This includes GR shock wave singularities and cusp singularities (continuous metrics with infinite gradients), both obstacles to numerical simulation. We propose the essential regularity of a connection to be the point where an intrinsic level of regularity enters the subject of Geometry.</description>

      <title>Accurate waveforms for eccentric, aligned-spin binary black holes: The multipolar effective-one-body model SEOBNRv5EHM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of orbital eccentricity in gravitational-wave (GW) signals will provide unique insights into the astrophysical origin of binary systems, while ignoring eccentricity in waveform models could introduce significant biases in parameter estimation and tests of General Relativity. Upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs are expected to detect a subpopulation of eccentric signals, making it vital to develop accurate waveform models for eccentric orbits. Here, employing recent analytical results through the third post-Newtonian order, we develop SEOBNRv5EHM: a new time-domain, effective-one-body, multipolar waveform model for eccentric binary black holes with spins aligned (or antialigned) with the orbital angular momentum. Besides the dominant (2,2) mode, the model includes the (2,1), (3,3), (3,2), (4,4) and (4,3) modes. We validate the model's accuracy by computing its unfaithfulness against 99 (28 public and 71 private) eccentric numerical-relativity (NR) simulations, produced by the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes Collaboration. Importantly, for NR waveforms with initial GW eccentricities below 0.5, the maximum (2,2)-mode unfaithfulness across the total mass range 20-200 $M_\odot$ is consistently below or close to $1 \%$, with a median value of $ \sim 0.02 \% $, reflecting an accuracy improvement of approximately an order of magnitude compared to the previous-generation SEOBNRv4EHM and the state-of-the-art TEOBResumS-Dal\'i eccentric model. In the quasi-circular-orbit limit, SEOBNRv5EHM is in excellent agreement with the highly accurate SEOBNRv5HM model. The accuracy, robustness, and speed of SEOBNRv5EHM make it suitable for data analysis and astrophysical studies. We demonstrate this by performing a set of recovery studies of synthetic NR-signal injections, and parameter-estimation analyses of the events GW150914 and GW190521, which we find to have no eccentricity signatures.</description>

      <title>Third post-Newtonian dynamics for eccentric orbits and aligned spins in the effective-one-body waveform model SEOBNRv5EHM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate waveform models for coalescing binaries on eccentric orbits are crucial for avoiding biases in the analysis of eccentric gravitational-wave signals. The effective-one-body (EOB) formalism combines various analytical approximation methods with information derived from numerical-relativity simulations, and it has proven reliable in modeling the inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform of binaries on generic orbits. In this work, we derive new analytical results within the EOB formalism, specifically addressing eccentric, aligned-spin binaries. For the first time, we obtain EOB results for eccentric orbits that are accurate up to the third post-Newtonian (PN) order for the complete far-zone energy and angular-momentum fluxes, the radiation-reaction (RR) force, and waveform modes (including memory contributions). We obtain these results by deriving transformations from the harmonic to EOB coordinates and from the quasi-Keplerian to the Keplerian parametrization, that properly account for the spin-supplementary condition, post-adiabatic contributions, and the gauge freedom in the RR force. We employ these findings to build the inspiral part of the SEOBNRv5EHM waveform model, which includes the 3PN eccentricity contributions in the RR force and waveform modes using the Keplerian parametrization, and augments the EOB equations of motion with PN evolution equations for the Keplerian parameters. The new SEOBNR model achieves much better accuracy than its predecessor SEOBNRv4EHM and other eccentric models, even for eccentricities as high as $\lesssim 0.5$.</description>

      <title>Tidal Love Numbers of Neutron Stars in Horndeski Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision measurements of the gravitational wave signal from compact binary inspirals allow us to constrain the internal structure of those objects via physical parameters such as the tidal Love numbers. In scalar-tensor theories, one typically finds new types of Love numbers that are usually not considered or simply absent in General Relativity, which further allows us to constrain deviations from General Relativity. Building upon previous results, we present the linear perturbation equations necessary to calculate static and even-parity tidal Love numbers in Horndeski theories, the most general scalar-tensor theories with second-order field equations of motion. We further focus on the quadrupolar Love numbers and demonstrate how these can be extracted from the asymptotic expansion of the perturbation fields. We find that there is a potential ambiguity in extracting the Love numbers in this way, which we resolve by performing supplementary calculations in the effective field theory framework. We show that, in the case of scalar-tensor theories, the tidal Love numbers are not directly given by the $1/r^3$ term in the asymptotic expansion of the perturbation fields, as there is an additional contribution to this term independent of the Love numbers. We calculate such a contribution for a minimally coupled scalar field and also for the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese model. For the latter, we find that the Love numbers can differ by $\mathcal{O}(1 \sim 10)\,\%$, if this additional contribution is not taken into account.</description>

      <title>Superconvergent Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the Scalar Teukolsky Equation on Hyperboloidal Domains: Efficient Waveform and Self-Force Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-time evolution of extreme mass-ratio inspiral systems requires minimal phase and dispersion errors to accurately compute far-field waveforms, while high accuracy is essential near the smaller black hole (modeled as a Dirac delta distribution) for self-force computations. Spectrally accurate methods, such as nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, are well suited for these tasks. Their numerical errors typically decrease as $\propto (\Delta x)^{N+1}$, where $\Delta x$ is the subdomain size and $N$ is the polynomial degree of the approximation. However, certain DG schemes exhibit superconvergence, where truncation, phase, and dispersion errors can decrease as fast as $\propto (\Delta x)^{2N+1}$. Superconvergent numerical solvers are, by construction, extremely efficient and accurate. We theoretically demonstrate that our DG scheme for the scalar Teukolsky equation with a distributional source is superconvergent, and this property is retained when combined with the hyperboloidal layer compactification technique. This ensures that waveforms, total energy and angular-momentum fluxes, and self-force computations benefit from superconvergence. We empirically verify this behavior across a family of hyperboloidal layer compactifications with varying degrees of smoothness. Additionally, we show that self-force quantities for circular orbits, computed at the point particle's location, also exhibit a certain degree of superconvergence. Our results underscore the potential benefits of numerical superconvergence for efficient and accurate gravitational waveform simulations based on DG methods.</description>

Abstract: At the extreme densities in neutron stars, a phase transition to deconfined quark matter is anticipated. Yet masses, radii and tidal deformabilities offer only indirect measures of a first-order phase transition, requiring many detections to resolve or being ineffective observables if the discontinuity exists at lower densities. We report on a smoking-gun gravitational-wave signature of a first-order transition: the resonant tidal excitation of an interface mode. Using relativistic perturbation theory with an equation-of-state family informed by chiral effective field theory, we show that such a resonance may be detectable with next-generation interferometers and possibly already with LIGO A+ for sufficiently loud events.</description>

Abstract: The existence of Traversable Wormhole (TW) in the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4D-EGB) gravity is explored with phenomenological Bose-Einstein Condensates (BEC) dark matter density profile. In the framework of 4D EGB gravity, which one obtains by regularizing the higher-dimensional EGB gravity in the limit $D \to 4$ is considered to obtain a spherically symmetric TW. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter ($\alpha$) in this case is rescaled to $\alpha \to \frac{\alpha}{D-4}$. Considering the energy density profile of non-relativistic BEC matter, the shape function of the WH geometry and the Null energy condition (NEC) are determined with a constant redshift function. The applicability of realistic flaring-out condition and asymptotic flatness conditions are studied here and the domain of model parameters for realistic scenario is determined. We analyze the embedding diagram of the WH obtained here with proper radial distance, volume integral quantifier, and anisotropy. We obtained WH which is stable at the throat when $\alpha = -0.0512471$ for a set of model parameters, which is estimated from sound speed measurement. The energy conditions are investigated, and it is noted that there is a range of Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter $\alpha \in [-4,-4.222]$, at which the energy conditions, including NEC, are obeyed at the throat. We explore NEC for other values of $\alpha$ and found that it is not satisfied. The other energy conditions are also violated. A new result is thus obtained with 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with BEC Dark Matter profile. We determine the parameter space for which the WH solution exists in the proposed modified gravity model.</description>

      <title>PINCH: Pipeline-Informed Noise Characterization in LIGO's Third Observing Run</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method to identify and categorize gravitational wave candidate triggers identified by matched filtering gravitational wave searches (pipelines) caused by transient noise (glitches) in gravitational wave detectors using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Our approach involves training SVM models on pipeline triggers which occur outside periods of excess noise to distinguish between triggers caused by random noise and those induced by glitches. This method is applied independently to the triggers produced by the GstLAL search pipeline on data from the LIGO Hanford and Livingston observatories during the second half of the O3 observing run. The trained SVM models assign scores to ambiguous triggers, quantifying their similarity to triggers caused by random fluctuations, with triggers with scores above a defined threshold being classified as glitch-induced. Analysis of these triggers reveals the distinct impact of different glitch classes on the search pipeline, including their distribution in relevant parameter spaces. We use metrics such as the Bhattacharyya coefficient and an over-representation ratio to quantify the consistency and prevalence of glitch impacts over time and across parameter spaces. Our findings indicate that some glitch types consistently produce triggers in specific regions of the parameter space, while others generate triggers that are more widely distributed. We observe that Scattered Light glitches appear differently in the search pipeline before and after a commissioning change, demonstrating how such detector changes appear in the pipeline's response to certain glitch classes. This method provides a framework for understanding and mitigating the influence of non-Gaussian transients on gravitational wave search pipelines, with implications for improving detection sensitivity and better understanding noise populations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the dynamical behavior of the accelerated expansion of the universe is discuss within the framework of $f(T)$ gravity, considering power law functional form of $ f(T)=\alpha (-T)^{n}$. Two distinct redshift-dependent parameterization of the deceleration parameter such as $q(z)=q_{0}+ q_{1}\left(\frac{ \ln(N+z)}{z+1}-\ln N \right)$ and $ q(z)=\frac{1}{2}+ \frac{q_{1}z+ q_{2}}{(1+z)^2} $ are considered. We have derived the Hubble parameter in terms of redshift and discussed its effect on other cosmological parameters. Using Bayesian statistical analysis and $\chi^2$-minimization, the median values of the model parameters for both the cosmic chronometer(CC) and the joint(CC + Pantheon) dataset have been determined. Further, energy density, pressure, the equation of state for Dark Energy, Energy condition and statefinder diagnostics are analyzed. The current age of the universe is also computed for these models.</description>

      <title>Black holes of multiple horizons without mass inflation</title>

Abstract: Mass inflation is a phenomenon happened in the vicinity of inner horizon in two-horizon spacetime. It is shown that the mass of initially small perturbations will grow exponentially as they approach the inner horizon. This implies that black hole inner horizon is unstable to the perturbations. In view of the fact that the mass inflation is determined by the surface gravity of inner horizon, Carballo-Rubio et al. showed that if one makes the surface gravity of inner horizon vanish, then the exponential growth character of mass inflation is not present. Basing on this conclusion, we look for the black hole solutions of multiple horizons with nonlinear Maxwell field. Then we make the inner horizons to coincide with each other such that the surface gravities of every inner horizon vanish. By this way, black holes of multiple horizons without mass inflation are constructed.</description>

      <title>Quantum spacetime from constraints: wave equations and fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous works, we showed that both time and space can emerge from entanglement within a globally constrained quantum Universe, with no background coordinates. By extending the Page and Wootters quantum time formalism to include both quantum clocks and rods, and imposing global constraints on total energy and momentum, we constructed a fully relational model of quantum spacetime. Here we take a further step: working in 1+1 dimensions, we show that the standard wave equations governing quantum particles (the Schr\"odinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations) emerge naturally from this framework. The solutions of the equations are derived directly from the constraints, without assuming any external spacetime structure. The second quantization formalism is also implemented and discussed. Our results provide further support for the idea that quantum dynamics in spacetime may emerge from entanglement and constraints.</description>

      <title>MaxWave: Rapid Maximum Likelihood Wavelet Reconstruction of Non-Gaussian features in Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors have increased the detection rate of transient astrophysical signals. We improve the existing BayesWave initialization algorithm and present a rapid, low-latency approximate maximum likelihood solution for reconstructing non-Gaussian features. We include three enhancements: (1) using a modified wavelet basis to eliminate redundant inner product calculations; (2) shifting from traditional time-frequency-quality factor (TFQ) wavelet transforms to time-frequency-time extent (TF$\tau$) transforms to optimize wavelet subtractions; and (3) implementing a downsampled heterodyned wavelet transform to accelerate initial calculations. Our model can be used to denoise long-duration signals, which include the stochastic gravitational-wave background from numerous unresolved sources and continuous wave signals from isolated sources such as rotating neutron stars. Through our model, we can also aid machine learning applications that aim to classify and understand glitches by providing non-whitened, time and frequency domain, Gaussian-noise-free reconstructions of any glitch.</description>

      <title>Dilatons Improve (Non)-Goldstones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shift symmetry forbids conformal coupling of Goldstone bosons from internal symmetries, but not for spontaneously broken conformal symmetry. Its Goldstone boson, the dilaton $D$, admits and indeed requires, an improvement term $ {\cal L}_R \propto R e^{-2D/F_D}$ as it realises the Goldstone matrix element in the effective theory. The improvement, combined with Weyl-gauging, enables conformal coupling to Goldstone bosons and other particles of arbitrary Weyl-weight. While improvement does not affect scattering amplitudes in flat space, it impacts gravitational form factors decisively, giving rise to the dilaton pole in the spin-zero channel. We compute leading-order scalar, fermion, pion, and dilaton form factors, confirming low-energy constraints. The dilaton decoupling limit further implies that the operator driving spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking has scaling dimension $\Delta= d-2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the possibility of a past and future eternal universe, constructing geodesically complete inflating, loitering, and bouncing spacetimes. We identify the constraints energy conditions in General Relativity place on the building of eternal cosmological models. Inflationary and bouncing behavior are shown to be essential ingredients in all significant examples. Non-trivial complete flat spacetimes are shown to violate the null energy condition (NEC) for at least some amount of time. Ignoring the intractable subtleties introduced by quantum considerations, such as rare tunneling events and Boltzmann brains, we demonstrate that these universes need not have had a beginning or an end.</description>

      <title>Configuration Requirements for 21-cm Forest Background Quasar Searches with the Moon-based Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest offers a powerful cosmological probe of the thermal history and small-scale structure of the intergalactic medium during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Its success, however, critically depends on the availability of high-redshift radio-loud quasars (HzRLQs) as background sources. In this work, we investigate the configuration requirements for a Moon-based low-frequency radio interferometer aimed at maximizing the detection of HzRLQs for future 21-cm forest studies. Building upon a previously developed quasar luminosity function (QLF), we forecast HzRLQ abundances under various array configurations. Assuming a total survey area of $10^4\,\mathrm{deg}^2$ and 1 year of observation, we compare continuum surveys with 10 MHz bandwidth and 21-cm forest surveys with 5 kHz resolution. Our results show that a minimum collecting area of $\sim$6 500 m$^2$ enables detection at $z \sim 6$, while SKA-like arrays ($N_{\mathrm{st}} = 512$) extend the detection limit to $z \sim 10$ for 21-cm forest survey and $z \sim 16$ for continuum survey. Larger arrays with $N_{\mathrm{st}} = 2048$ can reach $z \sim 11$ in 21-cm forest mode. We also explore configurations that maintain fixed collecting areas while increasing the number to enhance survey efficiency. This boosts source detection but significantly increases the data volume and computational demands. These results underscore the importance of optimizing array design for different survey goals and balancing sensitivity, spectral resolution, and data management. A well-designed Moon-based array could open a new observational window on reionization and early cosmic structure formation.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of effective actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17851v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the same quantum field theory distinct effective actions can be obtained by coupling sources to different choices of field variables. This is the same as considering effective actions for theories related by a change of variables and thus differ only by the values of so called inessential couplings. The effective actions will appear quite different since they generate correlation functions of different operators. Here we show that the effective actions are related by an implicit change of variables of the mean field, i.e. the argument of the effective action. Conversely, one can go the other way: by making a change of variables of the mean variable we obtain a new effective action which generates correlation functions of an implicitly defined composite field. The existence of the implicit transformations in both cases rests on the existence of solutions to initial value problems where the ``time'' parameter is an inessential coupling. Non-perturbatively the solutions may only exist for some non-zero amount of this time. However, at each order in perturbation theory one obtains linear equations which implies that unique solutions exist. We then show that scattering amplitudes are independent of inessential couplings without use of perturbation theory. For gauge theories we expect our correspondence to extend to effective actions which differ by a choice of gauge.</description>

      <title>Implications of pulsar timing arrays for Gauss-Bonnet Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlated time-of-arrival measurements by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have provided a new means of constraining astrophysical or cosmological models that produce a gravitational wave (GW) background. For this work, we discuss the implications of PTA observations for Gauss-Bonnet (GB) inflationary models through the production and propagation of inflationary GWs. We show that our GB inflationary scenario is consistent with present PTA and cosmological data. A blue-tilted tensor power spectrum supported by PTAs can be naturally accommodated in GB inflation. Using observational constraints, we derive general conditions for the inflaton potential and the GB coupling function, suggesting that in GB inflation, the inflaton must climb up the potential before rolling downhill and reaching the end of inflation. We provide two concrete GB inflationary models to demonstrate the viability of this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Holographic Extended Thermodynamics of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase structure of a deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, generated via the gravitational decoupling (GD) method as a minimal geometric deformation. In the bulk canonical ensemble, our results exhibit a van der Waals-type first-order phase transition in addition to the Hawking-Page transition, in the suitable parameter regime. Further, we compute the critical exponents characterising the bulk transition, confirming their consistency with mean-field theory predictions. Exploiting the exact holographic dictionary between extended black hole thermodynamics and the dual conformal field theory (CFT), we extend this analysis to the boundary and uncover a rich array of phase transitions and critical phenomena across three distinct thermodynamic ensembles. In particular, for an ensemble of fixed volume and central charge, the dual CFT displays a van der Waals-like phase structure. Throughout, we emphasise the pivotal influence of the GD deformation parameter on the thermodynamic behaviour, and we elucidate its role in the confinement-deconfinement transitions characteristic of the deformed AdS-Schwarzschild geometry.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $\Delta N_{eff}$ Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $&gt;3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.</description>
