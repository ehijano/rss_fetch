      <title>An Adaptive Genetic Algorithm for determining optimal structures for atomic clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of adaptive genetic algorithms (AGA) for optimization problems has proven to be superior than many other methods due to its nature of producing more robust and high quality solutions. Considering the complexity involved in many-body simulations, a novel AGA is proposed for applications to such systems and is specifically used to determine the lowest energy structures of various sized atomic clusters. For demonstrative purposes, we apply our method to various sized Lennard-Jones clusters and show that our results are more accurate than those found in the literature employing different methods.</description>

      <title>Exponential speed up in Monte Carlo sampling through Radial Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very recently it has been shown that the hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm is guaranteed to converge exponentially to a given target probability distribution $p(x)\propto e^{-V(x)}$ on non-compact spaces if augmented by an appropriate radial update. In this work we present a simple way to derive efficient radial updates meeting the necessary requirements for any potential $V$. We reduce the task to finding a substitution of the radial direction $||x||=f(z)$ so that the effective potential $V(f(z))$ grows exponentially with $z\rightarrow\pm\infty$. Any additive update of $z$ then leads to the desired convergence. We show that choosing this update from a normal distribution with standard deviation $\sigma\approx 1/\sqrt{d}$ in $d$ dimensions yields very good results. We further generalise the previous results on radial updates to a wide class of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms beyond the HMC and we quantify the convergence behaviour of MCMC algorithms with badly chosen radial update. Finally, we apply the radial update to the sampling of heavy-tailed distributions and achieve a speed up of many orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as intelligent computing technique for solving partial differential equations: Limitation and Future prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a representative method for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with neural networks. PINNs provide a novel approach to solving PDEs through optimization algorithms, offering a unified framework for solving both forward and inverse problems. However, some limitations in terms of solution accuracy and generality have also been revealed. This paper systematically summarizes the limitations of PINNs and identifies three root causes for their failure in solving PDEs: (1) Poor multiscale approximation ability and ill-conditioning caused by PDE losses; (2) Insufficient exploration of convergence and error analysis, resulting in weak mathematical rigor; (3) Inadequate integration of physical information, causing mismatch between residuals and iteration errors. By focusing on addressing these limitations in PINNs, we outline the future directions and prospects for the intelligent computing of PDEs: (1) Analysis of ill-conditioning in PINNs and mitigation strategies; (2) Improvements to PINNs by enforcing temporal causality; (3) Empowering PINNs with classical numerical methods.</description>

      <title>PHOENIX -- Paderborn highly optimized and energy efficient solver for two-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with integrated extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce PHOENIX, a highly optimized explicit open-source solver for two-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with extensions. The nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and its extensions (Gross-Pitaevskii equation) are widely studied to model and analyze complex phenomena in fields such as optics, condensed matter physics, fluid dynamics, and plasma physics. It serves as a powerful tool for understanding nonlinear wave dynamics, soliton formation, and the interplay between nonlinearity, dispersion, and diffraction. By extending the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, various physical effects such as non-Hermiticity, spin-orbit interaction, and quantum optical aspects can be incorporated. PHOENIX is designed to accommodate a wide range of applications by a straightforward extendability without the need for user knowledge of computing architectures or performance optimization. The high performance and power efficiency of PHOENIX are demonstrated on a wide range of entry-class to high-end consumer and high-performance computing GPUs and CPUs. Compared to a more conventional MATLAB implementation, a speedup of up to three orders of magnitude and energy savings of up to 99.8% are achieved. The performance is compared to a performance model showing that PHOENIX performs close to the relevant performance bounds in many situations. The possibilities of PHOENIX are demonstrated with a range of practical examples from the realm of nonlinear (quantum) photonics in planar microresonators with active media including exciton-polariton condensates. Examples range from solutions on very large grids, the use of local optimization algorithms, to Monte Carlo ensemble evolutions with quantum noise enabling the tomography of the system's quantum state.</description>

      <title>Analytic Continuation by Feature Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytic continuation aims to reconstruct real-time spectral functions from imaginary-time Green's functions; however, this process is notoriously ill-posed and challenging to solve. We propose a novel neural network architecture, named the Feature Learning Network (FL-net), to enhance the prediction accuracy of spectral functions, achieving an improvement of at least $20\%$ over traditional methods, such as the Maximum Entropy Method (MEM), and previous neural network approaches. Furthermore, we develop an analytical method to evaluate the robustness of the proposed network. Using this method, we demonstrate that increasing the hidden dimensionality of FL-net, while leading to lower loss, results in decreased robustness. Overall, our model provides valuable insights into effectively addressing the complex challenges associated with analytic continuation.</description>

      <title>From quantum enhanced to quantum inspired Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of the quantum-enhanced Monte Carlo method [Nature, 619, 282-287 (2023)], aimed at identifying the optimal working point of the algorithm. We observe an optimal mixing Hamiltonian strength and analyze the scaling of the total evolution time with the size of the system. We also explore extensions of the circuit, including the use of time-dependent Hamiltonians and reverse digitized annealing. Additionally, we propose that classical, approximate quantum simulators can be used for the proposal step instead of the original real-hardware implementation. We observe that tensor-network simulators, even with unconverged settings, can maintain a scaling advantage over standard classical samplers. This may extend the utility of quantum enhanced Monte Carlo as a quantum-inspired algorithm, even before the deployment of large-scale quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Learning Mean First Passage Time: Chemical Short-Range Order and Kinetics of Diffusive Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-timescale processes pose significant challenges in atomistic simulations, particularly for phenomena such as diffusion and phase transitions. We present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based computational framework, combined with a temporal difference (TD) learning method, to simulate long-timescale atomic processes of diffusive relaxation. We apply it to study the emergence of chemical short-range order (SRO) in medium- and high-entropy alloys (MEAs/HEAs), which plays a crucial role in unlocking unique material properties, and find that the proposed method effectively maps the relationship between time, temperature, and SRO change. By accelerating both the sampling of lower-energy states and the simulation of transition kinetics, we identify the thermodynamic limit and the role of kinetic trapping in the SRO. Furthermore, learning the mean first passage time to a given, target SRO relaxation allows capturing realistic timescales in diffusive atomistic rearrangements. This method offers valuable guidelines for optimizing material processing and extends atomistic simulations to previously inaccessible timescales, facilitating the study of slow, thermally activated processes essential for understanding and engineering material properties.</description>

      <title>Density-Functionalized QM/MM Delivers Chemical Accuracy For Solvated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a reformulation of QM/MM as a fully quantum mechanical theory of interacting subsystems, all treated at the level of density functional theory (DFT). For the MM subsystem, which lacks orbitals, we assign an ad hoc electron density and apply orbital-free DFT functionals to describe its quantum properties. The interaction between the QM and MM subsystems is also treated using orbital-free density functionals, accounting for Coulomb interactions, exchange, correlation, and Pauli repulsion. Consistency across QM and MM subsystems is ensured by employing data-driven, many-body MM force fields that faithfully represent DFT functionals. Applications to water-solvated systems demonstrate that this approach achieves unprecedented, very rapid convergence to chemical accuracy as the size of the QM subsystem increases. We validate the method with several pilot studies, including water bulk, water clusters (prism hexamer and pentamers), solvated glucose, a palladium aqua ion, and a wet monolayer of MoS$_2$.</description>

      <title>PyMatterSim: a Python Data Analysis Library for Computer Simulations of Materials Science, Physics, Chemistry, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computer simulation has become one of the most important tools in scientific research in many disciplines. Benefiting from the dynamical trajectories regulated by versatile interatomic interactions, various material properties can be quantitatively characterized at the atomic scale. This greatly deepens our understanding of Nature and provides incredible insights supplementing experimental observations. Hitherto, a plethora of literature discusses the computational discoveries in studying glasses in which positional disorder is inherent in their configurations. Motivated by active research and knowledge sharing, we developed a data analysis library in Python for computational materials science research. We hope to help promote scientific progress and narrow some technical gaps for the wide communities. The toolkit mainly focuses on physical analyses of glassy properties from the open-source simulator LAMMPS. Nevertheless, the code design renders high flexibility, with functionalities extendable to other computational tools. The library provides data-driven insights for different subjects and can be incorporated into advanced machine-learning workflows. The scope of the data analysis methodologies applies not only to materials science but also to physics, chemistry, and beyond.</description>

      <title>SPARC-X-API: Versatile Python Interface for Real-space Density Functional Theory Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the de facto workhorse for large-scale electronic structure calculations in chemistry and materials science. While plane-wave DFT implementations remain the most widely used, real-space DFT provides advantages in handling complex boundary conditions and scaling to very large systems by allowing for the efficient use of large-scale supercomputers and linear-scaling methods that circumvent the cubic scaling bottleneck. The SPARC-X project (https://github.com/SPARC-X) provides highly efficient and portable real-space DFT codes for a wide range of first principle applications, available in both Matlab (M-SPARC) and C/C++ (SPARC). The rapid growth of SPARC's feature set has created the need for a fully functional interface to drive SPARC in high-throughput calculations. Here we introduce SPARC-X-API, a Python package designed to bridge the SPARC-X project with broader computational frameworks. Built on the atomic simulation environment (ASE) standard, the SPARC-X-API allows users to handle SPARC file formats and run SPARC calculations through the same interface as with other ASE-compatible DFT packages. Beyond standard ASE capabilities, SPARC-X-API provides additional features including 1) support of SPARC-specific setups, including complex boundary conditions and unit conversion, 2) a JSON schema parsed from SPARC's documentation for parameter validation and compatibility checks, and 3) a comprehensive socket communication layer derived from the i-PI protocol facilitating message passing between low-level C code and the Python interface. The goal of the SPARC-X-API is to provide an easy-to-use interface for users with diverse needs and levels of expertise, allowing for minimal effort in adapting SPARC to existing computational workflows, while also supporting developers of advanced real-space methods.</description>

      <title>MeltpoolINR: Predicting temperature field, melt pool geometry, and their rate of change in laser powder bed fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven, differentiable neural network model designed to learn the temperature field, its gradient, and the cooling rate, while implicitly representing the melt pool boundary as a level set in laser powder bed fusion. The physics-guided model combines fully connected feed-forward neural networks with Fourier feature encoding of the spatial coordinates and laser position. Notably, our differentiable model allows for the computation of temperature derivatives with respect to position, time, and process parameters using autodifferentiation. Moreover, the implicit neural representation of the melt pool boundary as a level set enables the inference of the solidification rate and the rate of change in melt pool geometry relative to process parameters. The model is trained to learn the top view of the temperature field and its spatiotemporal derivatives during a single-track laser powder bed fusion process, as a function of three process parameters, using data from high-fidelity thermo-fluid simulations. The model accuracy is evaluated and compared to a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network model, demonstrating strong generalization ability and close agreement with high-fidelity data.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Deep Learning-based Prediction of Lattice Thermal Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning promises to accelerate the material discovery by enabling high-throughput prediction of desirable macro-properties from atomic-level descriptors or structures. However, the limited data available about precise values of these properties have been a barrier, leading to predictive models with limited precision or the ability to generalize. This is particularly true of lattice thermal conductivity (LTC): existing datasets of precise (ab initio, DFT-based) computed values are limited to a few dozen materials with little variability. Based on such datasets, we study the impact of transfer learning on both the precision and generalizability of a deep learning model (ParAIsite). We start from an existing model (MEGNet~\cite{Chen2019}) and show that improvements are obtained by fine-tuning a pre-trained version on different tasks. Interestingly, we also show that a much greater improvement is obtained when first fine-tuning it on a large datasets of low-quality approximations of LTC (based on the AGL model) and then applying a second phase of fine-tuning with our high-quality, smaller-scale datasets. The promising results obtained pave the way not only towards a greater ability to explore large databases in search of low thermal conductivity materials but also to methods enabling increasingly precise predictions in areas where quality data are rare.</description>

      <title>Advancing Natural Orbital Functional Calculations Through Deep Learning-Inspired Techniques for Large-Scale Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural orbital functional (NOF) theory offers a promising approach for studying strongly correlated systems at an affordable computational cost, with an accuracy comparable to highly demanding wavefunction-based methods. However, its widespread adoption in cases involving a large number of correlated electrons has been limited by the extensive iterations required for convergence. In this work, we present a disruptive approach that embeds the techniques used for optimization in deep learning within the NOF calculation, representing a substantial advance in the scale of accessible systems. The revamped procedure is based on the adaptive momentum technique for orbital optimization, alternated with the optimization of the occupation numbers, significantly improving the computational feasibility of challenging calculations. We demonstrate this with three examples that involve a large number of electrons: (i) the symmetric dissociation of a large hydrogen cluster, (ii) an analysis of occupancies distribution in fullerenes, and (iii) a study of the singlet-triplet energy gap in linear acenes. Notably, the first example serves as an ideal model for a strongly correlated Mott insulator, featuring 1000 electrons and illustrating a metal-to-insulator transition, surpassing the largest calculations of strongly correlated electrons reported to date. We anticipate that this work will enable the practical application of NOFs to increasingly complex and intriguing systems, leveraging the method's inherent scalability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Effect of Bariatric Surgery on Gastric Digestion in the Stomach: Insights from Multiphase Flow Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometry and motility of the stomach play a critical role in the digestion of ingested liquid meals. Sleeve gastrectomy, a common type of bariatric surgery used to reduce the size of the stomach, significantly alters the stomach's anatomy and motility, which impacts gastric emptying and digestion. In this study, we use an imaging data-based computational model, StomachSim, to investigate the consequences of sleeve gastrectomy. The pre-operative stomach anatomy was derived from imaging data and the post-sleeve gastrectomy shapes were generated for different resection volumes. We investigate the effect of sleeve sizes and motility patterns on gastric mixing and emptying. Simulations were conducted using an immersed-boundary flow solver, modeling a liquid meal to analyze changes in gastric content mixing and emptying rates. The results reveal that different degrees of volume reduction and impaired gastric motility have complex effects on stomach's mixing and emptying functions, which are important factors in gastric health of the patient. These findings provide insights into the biomechanical effects of sleeve gastrectomy on gastric digestion and emptying functions, highlighting the potential of computational models to inform surgical planning and post-operative management.</description>

      <title>TorchOptics: An open-source Python library for differentiable Fourier optics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TorchOptics is an open-source Python library for differentiable Fourier optics simulations, developed using PyTorch to enable GPU-accelerated tensor computations and automatic differentiation. It provides a comprehensive framework for modeling, analyzing, and designing optical systems using Fourier optics, with applications in imaging, diffraction, holography, and signal processing. The library leverages PyTorch's automatic differentiation engine for gradient-based optimization, enabling the inverse design of complex optical systems. TorchOptics supports end-to-end optimization of hybrid models that integrate optical systems with machine learning architectures for digital post-processing. The library includes a wide range of optical elements and spatial profiles, and supports simulations with polarized light and fields with arbitrary spatial coherence.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field dependence of spin-phonon relaxation and dephasing due to g-factor fluctuations from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin relaxation of electrons in materials involve both reversible dephasing and irreversible decoherence processes. Their interplay leads to a complex dependence of spin relaxation times on the direction and magnitude of magnetic fields, relevant for spintronics and quantum information applications. Here, we use real-time first-principles density matrix dynamics simulations to directly simulate Hahn echo measurements, disentangle dephasing from decoherence, and predict T1, T2 and T2* spin lifetimes. We show that g-factor fluctuations lead to non-trivial magnetic field dependence of each of these lifetimes in inversion-symmetric crystals of CsPbBr3 and silicon, even when only intrinsic spin-phonon scattering is present. Most importantly, fluctuations in the off-diagonal components of the g-tensor lead to a strong magnetic field dependence of even the T1 lifetime in silicon. Our calculations elucidate the detailed role of anisotropic g-factors in determining the spin dynamics even in simple, low spin-orbit coupling materials such as silicon.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the optimization process of Physics Informed Neural Networks: How accurate and competitive can PINNs be?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential accuracy boundaries of physics-informed neural networks, contrasting their approach with previous similar works and traditional numerical methods. We find that selecting improved optimization algorithms significantly enhances the accuracy of the results. Simple modifications to the loss function may also improve precision, offering an additional avenue for enhancement. Despite optimization algorithms having a greater impact on convergence than adjustments to the loss function, practical considerations often favor tweaking the latter due to ease of implementation. On a global scale, the integration of an enhanced optimizer and a marginally adjusted loss function enables a reduction in the loss function by several orders of magnitude across diverse physical problems. Consequently, our results obtained using compact networks (typically comprising 2 or 3 layers of 20-30 neurons) achieve accuracies comparable to finite difference schemes employing thousands of grid points. This study encourages the continued advancement of PINNs and associated optimization techniques for broader applications across various fields.</description>

      <title>Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for transport models in porous materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) are a machine learning tool that can be used to solve direct and inverse problems related to models described by Partial Differential Equations. This paper proposes an adaptive inverse PINN applied to different transport models, from diffusion to advection-diffusion-reaction problems. Once a suitable PINN is established to solve the forward problem, the transport parameters are added as trainable parameters. We find that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the different components of the loss function (data misfit, initial conditions, boundary conditions and residual of the transport equation) need to be weighted adaptively as a function of the training iteration (epoch). Similarly, gradients of trainable parameters are scaled at each epoch accordingly. Several examples are presented for different test cases to support our PINN architecture and its scalability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise modeling through Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the current era of quantum computing, robust and efficient tools are essential to bridge the gap between simulations and quantum hardware execution. In this work, we introduce a machine learning approach to characterize the noise impacting a quantum chip and emulate it during simulations. Our algorithm leverages reinforcement learning, offering increased flexibility in reproducing various noise models compared to conventional techniques such as randomized benchmarking or heuristic noise models. The effectiveness of the RL agent has been validated through simulations and testing on real superconducting qubits. Additionally, we provide practical use-case examples for the study of renowned quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Competition between simple and complex contagion on temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavioral adoptions are influenced by peers in different ways. While some individuals may change after a single incoming influence, others need multiple cumulated attempts. These two mechanism, known as the simple and the complex contagions, often occur together in social phenomena alongside personal factors determining individual adoptions. Here we aim to identify, which of these contagion mechanism dominate a spreading process propagated by time-varying interactions. We consider three types of spreading scenarios: ones pre-dominated by simple or complex contagion, and mixed dynamics where the dominant mechanism changes during the unfolding of the spreading process. We propose different methods to analytically identify the transitions between these three scenarios and compare them with numerical simulations. This work offers new insights into social contagion dynamics on temporal networks, without assuming prior knowledge about individual's contagion mechanism driving their adoption decisions.</description>
