      <title>Combining Audio and Non-Audio Inputs in Evolved Neural Networks for Ovenbird</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last several years the use of neural networks as tools to automate species classification from digital data has increased. This has been due in part to the high classification accuracy of image classification through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). In the case of audio data CNN based recognizers are used to automate the classification of species in audio recordings by using information from sound visualization (i.e., spectrograms). It is common for these recognizers to use the spectrogram as their sole input. However, researchers have other non-audio data, such as habitat preferences of a species, phenology, and range information, available that could improve species classification. In this paper we present how a single-species recognizer neural network's accuracy can be improved by using non-audio data as inputs in addition to spectrogram information. We also analyze if the improvements are merely a result of having a neural network with a higher number of parameters instead of combining the two inputs. We find that networks that use the two different inputs have a higher classification accuracy than networks of similar size that use only one of the inputs.</description>

      <title>Emoanti: audio anti-deepfake with refined emotion-guided representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio deepfake is so sophisticated that the lack of effective detection methods is fatal. While most detection systems primarily rely on low-level acoustic features or pretrained speech representations, they frequently neglect high-level emotional cues, which can offer complementary and potentially anti-deepfake information to enhance generalization. In this work, we propose a novel audio anti-deepfake system that utilizes emotional features (EmoAnti) by exploiting a pretrained Wav2Vec2 (W2V2) model fine-tuned on emotion recognition tasks, which derives emotion-guided representations, then designing a dedicated feature extractor based on convolutional layers with residual connections to effectively capture and refine emotional characteristics from the transformer layers outputs. Experimental results show that our proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the ASVspoof2019LA and ASVspoof2021LA benchmarks, and demonstrates strong generalization on the ASVspoof2021DF dataset. Our proposed approach's code is available at Anonymous GitHub1.</description>

      <title>STASE: A spatialized text-to-audio synthesis engine for music generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many text-to-audio systems produce monophonic or fixed-stereo outputs, generating audio with user-defined spatial properties remains a challenge. Existing deep learning-based spatialization methods often rely on latent-space manipulations, which can limit direct control over psychoacoustic parameters critical to spatial perception. To address this, we introduce STASE, a system that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) as an agent to interpret spatial cues from text. A key feature of STASE is the decoupling of semantic interpretation from a separate, physics-based spatial rendering engine, which facilitates interpretable and user-controllable spatial reasoning. The LLM processes prompts through two main pathways: (i) Description Prompts, for direct mapping of explicit spatial information (e.g., "place the lead guitar at 45{\deg} azimuth, 10 m distance"), and (ii) Abstract Prompts, where a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module retrieves relevant spatial templates to inform the rendering. This paper details the STASE workflow, discusses implementation considerations, and highlights current challenges in evaluating generative spatial audio.</description>

      <title>ENJ: Optimizing Noise with Genetic Algorithms to Jailbreak LSMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread application of Large Speech Models (LSMs) has made their security risks increasingly prominent. Traditional speech adversarial attack methods face challenges in balancing effectiveness and stealth. This paper proposes Evolutionary Noise Jailbreak (ENJ), which utilizes a genetic algorithm to transform environmental noise from a passive interference into an actively optimizable attack carrier for jailbreaking LSMs. Through operations such as population initialization, crossover fusion, and probabilistic mutation, this method iteratively evolves a series of audio samples that fuse malicious instructions with background noise. These samples sound like harmless noise to humans but can induce the model to parse and execute harmful commands. Extensive experiments on multiple mainstream speech models show that ENJ's attack effectiveness is significantly superior to existing baseline methods. This research reveals the dual role of noise in speech security and provides new critical insights for model security defense in complex acoustic environments.</description>

      <title>An Entropy-Guided Curriculum Learning Strategy for Data-Efficient Acoustic Scene Classification under Domain Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) faces challenges in generalizing across recording devices, particularly when labeled data is limited. The DCASE 2024 Challenge Task 1 highlights this issue by requiring models to learn from small labeled subsets recorded on a few devices. These models need to then generalize to recordings from previously unseen devices under strict complexity constraints. While techniques such as data augmentation and the use of pre-trained models are well-established for improving model generalization, optimizing the training strategy represents a complementary yet less-explored path that introduces no additional architectural complexity or inference overhead. Among various training strategies, curriculum learning offers a promising paradigm by structuring the learning process from easier to harder examples. In this work, we propose an entropy-guided curriculum learning strategy to address the domain shift problem in data-efficient ASC. Specifically, we quantify the uncertainty of device domain predictions for each training sample by computing the Shannon entropy of the device posterior probabilities estimated by an auxiliary domain classifier. Using entropy as a proxy for domain invariance, the curriculum begins with high-entropy samples and gradually incorporates low-entropy, domain-specific ones to facilitate the learning of generalizable representations. Experimental results on multiple DCASE 2024 ASC baselines demonstrate that our strategy effectively mitigates domain shift, particularly under limited labeled data conditions. Our strategy is architecture-agnostic and introduces no additional inference cost, making it easily integrable into existing ASC baselines and offering a practical solution to domain shift.</description>

      <title>WeaveMuse: An Open Agentic System for Multimodal Music Understanding and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic AI has been standardized in industry as a practical paradigm for coordinating specialized models and tools to solve complex multimodal tasks. In this work, we present WeaveMuse, a multi-agent system for music understanding, symbolic composition, and audio synthesis. Each specialist agent interprets user requests, derives machine-actionable requirements (modalities, formats, constraints), and validates its own outputs, while a manager agent selects and sequences tools, mediates user interaction, and maintains state across turns. The system is extendable and deployable either locally, using quantization and inference strategies to fit diverse hardware budgets, or via the HFApi to preserve free community access to open models. Beyond out-of-the-box use, the system emphasizes controllability and adaptation through constraint schemas, structured decoding, policy-based inference, and parameter-efficient adapters or distilled variants that tailor models to MIR tasks. A central design goal is to facilitate intermodal interaction across text, symbolic notation and visualization, and audio, enabling analysis-synthesis-render loops and addressing cross-format constraints. The framework aims to democratize, implement, and make accessible MIR tools by supporting interchangeable open-source models of various sizes, flexible memory management, and reproducible deployment paths.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Meter Tracking in Carnatic Music using Deep Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beat and downbeat tracking, jointly referred to as Meter Tracking, is a fundamental task in Music Information Retrieval (MIR). Deep learning models have far surpassed traditional signal processing and classical machine learning approaches in this domain, particularly for Western (Eurogenetic) genres, where large annotated datasets are widely available. These systems, however, perform less reliably on underrepresented musical traditions. Carnatic music, a rich tradition from the Indian subcontinent, is renowned for its rhythmic intricacy and unique metrical structures (t\=alas). The most notable prior work on meter tracking in this context employed probabilistic Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). The performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning models on Carnatic music, however, remains largely unexplored.
  In this study, we evaluate two models for meter tracking in Carnatic music: the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), a lightweight architecture that has been successfully adapted for Latin rhythms, and Beat This!, a transformer-based model designed for broad stylistic coverage without the need for post-processing. Replicating the experimental setup of the DBN baseline on the Carnatic Music Rhythm (CMR$_f$) dataset, we systematically assess the performance of these models in a directly comparable setting. We further investigate adaptation strategies, including fine-tuning the models on Carnatic data and the use of musically informed parameters. Results show that while off-the-shelf models do not always outperform the DBN, their performance improves substantially with transfer learning, matching or surpassing the baseline. These findings indicate that SOTA deep learning models can be effectively adapted to underrepresented traditions, paving the way for more inclusive and broadly applicable meter tracking systems.</description>

      <title>FuseCodec: Semantic-Contextual Fusion and Supervision for Neural Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech tokenization enables discrete representation and facilitates speech language modeling. However, existing neural codecs capture low-level acoustic features, overlooking the semantic and contextual cues inherent to human speech. While recent efforts introduced semantic representations from self-supervised speech models or incorporated contextual representations from pre-trained language models, challenges remain in aligning and unifying the semantic and contextual representations. We introduce FuseCodec, which unifies acoustic, semantic, and contextual representations through strong cross-modal alignment and globally informed supervision. We propose three complementary techniques: (i) Latent Representation Fusion, integrating semantic and contextual features directly into the encoder latent space for robust and unified representation learning; (ii) Global Semantic-Contextual Supervision, supervising discrete tokens with globally pooled and broadcasted representations to enhance temporal consistency and cross-modal alignment; and (iii) Temporally Aligned Contextual Supervision, strengthening alignment by dynamically matching contextual and speech tokens within a local window for fine-grained token-level supervision. We further introduce FuseCodec-TTS, demonstrating our methodology's applicability to zero-shot speech synthesis. Empirically, FuseCodec achieves state-of-the-art performance in LibriSpeech, surpassing EnCodec, SpeechTokenizer, and DAC in transcription accuracy, perceptual quality, intelligibility, and speaker similarity. Results highlight the effectiveness of contextually and semantically guided tokenization for speech tokenization and downstream tasks. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/mubtasimahasan/FuseCodec.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Overspecification in Electronic Dance Music Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic Dance Music (EDM) classification typically relies on industry-defined taxonomies with numerous subgenres, yet the acoustic basis for these distinctions remains unclear. Current approaches use supervised learning with prescribed genre labels, assuming their validity without systematic evaluation. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to discover the natural acoustic structure of EDM independent of commercial labels. Our method combines novel tempogram-based features capturing EDM's layered rhythmic patterns with multi-criteria feature selection. To validate that our findings reflect genuine acoustic structure rather than methodological artifacts, we compare our results against state-of-the-art pre-trained audio embeddings (MERT and CLAP). Both our feature space and embedding representations converge to 19-23 natural acoustic families compared to the prescribed 35, providing consistent evidence of significant overspecification in current EDM taxonomy by approximately one-third.</description>

      <title>Scaling to Multimodal and Multichannel Heart Sound Classification: Fine-Tuning Wav2Vec 2.0 with Synthetic and Augmented Biosignals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year. Early detection is critical, creating a demand for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Deep learning has recently been applied to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using synchronised phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, as well as multichannel PCG (mPCG). However, state-of-the-art architectures remain underutilised due to the limited availability of synchronised and multichannel datasets. Augmented datasets and pre-trained models provide a pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling transformer-based architectures to be trained effectively. This work combines traditional signal processing with denoising diffusion models, WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier on multimodal and multichannel heart sound datasets. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. On the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 dataset of single channel PCG, accuracy, unweighted average recall (UAR), sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) reach 92.48\%, 93.05\%, 93.63\%, 92.48\%, 94.93\% and 0.8283, respectively. Using the synchronised PCG and ECG signals of the training-a dataset from CinC, 93.14\%, 92.21\%, 94.35\%, 90.10\%, 95.12\% and 0.8380 are achieved for accuracy, UAR, sensitivity, specificity and MCC, respectively. Using a wearable vest dataset consisting of mPCG data, the model achieves 77.13\% accuracy, 74.25\% UAR, 86.47\% sensitivity, 62.04\% specificity, and 0.5082 MCC. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of transformer-based models for CVD detection when supported by augmented datasets, highlighting their potential to advance multimodal and multichannel heart sound classification.</description>

      <title>Neural Audio Codecs for Prompt-Driven Universal Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-guided source separation supports flexible audio editing across media and assistive applications, but existing models like AudioSep are too compute-heavy for edge deployment. Neural audio codec (NAC) models such as CodecFormer and SDCodec are compute-efficient but limited to fixed-class separation. We introduce CodecSep, the first NAC-based model for on-device universal, text-driven separation. CodecSep combines DAC compression with a Transformer masker modulated by CLAP-derived FiLM parameters. Across six open-domain benchmarks under matched training/prompt protocols, \textbf{CodecSep} surpasses \textbf{AudioSep} in separation fidelity (SI-SDR) while remaining competitive in perceptual quality (ViSQOL) and matching or exceeding fixed-stem baselines (TDANet, CodecFormer, SDCodec). In code-stream deployments, it needs just 1.35~GMACs end-to-end -- approximately $54\times$ less compute ($25\times$ architecture-only) than spectrogram-domain separators like AudioSep -- while remaining fully bitstream-compatible.</description>

      <title>PoolingVQ: A VQVAE Variant for Reducing Audio Redundancy and Boosting Multi-Modal Fusion in Music Emotion Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal music emotion analysis leverages audio and MIDI modalities to enhance performance. While mainstream approaches focus on complex feature extraction networks, we posit that shortening the length of audio sequence features to mitigate redundancy, especially in contrast to MIDI's compact representation, may effectively boost task performance. To achieve this, we developed PoolingVQ by combining Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) with spatial pooling, which directly compresses audio feature sequences through local aggregation to reduce redundancy, then devised a two-stage co-attention approach to fuse audio and MIDI information. Experimental results on the public datasets EMOPIA and VGMIDI demonstrate that our multimodal framework achieves state-of-the-art overall performance, with PoolingVQ yielding some improvement.</description>

      <title>Improving Out-of-Domain Audio Deepfake Detection via Layer Selection and Fusion of SSL-Based Countermeasures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio deepfake detection systems based on frozen pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) encoders show a high level of performance when combined with layer-weighted pooling methods, such as multi-head factorized attentive pooling (MHFA). However, they still struggle to generalize to out-of-domain (OOD) conditions. We tackle this problem by studying the behavior of six different pre-trained SSLs, on four different test corpora. We perform a layer-by-layer analysis to determine which layers contribute most. Next, we study the pooling head, comparing a strategy based on a single layer with automatic selection via MHFA. We observed that selecting the best layer gave very good results, while reducing system parameters by up to 80%. A wide variation in performance as a function of test corpus and SSL model is also observed, showing that the pre-training strategy of the encoder plays a role. Finally, score-level fusion of several encoders improved generalization to OOD attacks.</description>

      <title>Sound Matching an Analogue Levelling Amplifier Using the Newton-Raphson Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation through digital signal processing algorithms for virtual analogue modelling has recently gained popularity. These algorithms are typically more computationally efficient than black-box neural networks that rely on dense matrix multiplications. Due to their differentiable nature, they can be integrated with neural networks and jointly trained using gradient descent algorithms, resulting in more efficient systems. Furthermore, signal processing algorithms have significantly fewer parameters than neural networks, allowing the application of the Newton-Raphson method. This method offers faster and more robust convergence than gradient descent at the cost of quadratic storage. This paper presents a method to emulate analogue levelling amplifiers using a feed-forward digital compressor with parameters optimised via the Newton-Raphson method. We demonstrate that a digital compressor can successfully approximate the behaviour of our target unit, the Teletronix LA-2A. Different strategies for computing the Hessian matrix are benchmarked. We leverage parallel algorithms for recursive filters to achieve efficient training on modern GPUs. The resulting model is made into a VST plugin and is open-sourced at https://github.com/aim-qmul/4a2a.</description>

      <title>Local Density-Based Anomaly Score Normalization for Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art anomalous sound detection (ASD) systems in domain-shifted conditions rely on projecting audio signals into an embedding space and using distance-based outlier detection to compute anomaly scores. One of the major difficulties to overcome is the so-called domain mismatch between the anomaly score distributions of a source domain and a target domain that differ acoustically and in terms of the amount of training data provided. A decision threshold that is optimal for one domain may be highly sub-optimal for the other domain and vice versa. This significantly degrades the performance when only using a single decision threshold, as is required when generalizing to multiple data domains that are possibly unseen during training while still using the same trained ASD system as in the source domain. To reduce this mismatch between the domains, we propose a simple local-density-based anomaly score normalization scheme. In experiments conducted on several ASD datasets, we show that the proposed normalization scheme consistently improves performance for various types of embedding-based ASD systems and yields better results than existing anomaly score normalization approaches.</description>

      <title>Length-Aware Rotary Position Embedding for Text-Speech Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many recent text-to-speech (TTS) systems are built on transformer architectures and employ cross-attention mechanisms for text-speech alignment. Within these systems, rotary position embedding (RoPE) is commonly used to encode positional information in text and speech representations. In this work, we introduce length-aware RoPE (LARoPE), a simple yet effective extension of RoPE that improves text-speech alignment. Unlike RoPE, which relies on absolute indices, LARoPE computes relative distances between query and key positions using length-normalized indices. Experimental results show that LARoPE consistently outperforms RoPE, offering faster loss convergence, more accurate text-speech alignment, and higher overall TTS quality. Furthermore, LARoPE demonstrates greater resilience to variations in utterance duration and maintains stable performance in extended speech generation up to 30 seconds, whereas RoPE suffers from notable degradation. Notably, our method achieves a state-of-the-art word error rate on a standard zero-shot TTS benchmark.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Analysis of Text-Conditioned AI-Generated Music: A Case Study with Suno and Udio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online AI platforms for creating music from text prompts (AI music), such as Suno and Udio, are now being used by hundreds of thousands of users. Some AI music is appearing in advertising, and even charting, in multiple countries. How are these platforms being used? What subjects are inspiring their users? This article answers these questions for Suno and Udio using a large collection of songs generated by users of these platforms from May to October 2024. Using a combination of state-of-the-art text embedding models, dimensionality reduction and clustering methods, we analyze the prompts, tags and lyrics, and automatically annotate and display the processed data in interactive plots. Our results reveal prominent themes in lyrics, language preference, prompting strategies, as well as peculiar attempts at steering models through the use of metatags. To promote the musicological study of the developing cultural practice of AI-generated music we share our code and resources.</description>

      <title>MusicSwarm: Biologically Inspired Intelligence for Music Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that coherent, long-form musical composition can emerge from a decentralized swarm of identical, frozen foundation models that coordinate via stigmergic, peer-to-peer signals, without any weight updates. We compare a centralized multi-agent system with a global critic to a fully decentralized swarm in which bar-wise agents sense and deposit harmonic, rhythmic, and structural cues, adapt short-term memory, and reach consensus. Across symbolic, audio, and graph-theoretic analyses, the swarm yields superior quality while delivering greater diversity and structural variety and leads across creativity metrics. The dynamics contract toward a stable configuration of complementary roles, and self-similarity networks reveal a small-world architecture with efficient long-range connectivity and specialized bridging motifs, clarifying how local novelties consolidate into global musical form. By shifting specialization from parameter updates to interaction rules, shared memory, and dynamic consensus, MusicSwarm provides a compute- and data-efficient route to long-horizon creative structure that is immediately transferable beyond music to collaborative writing, design, and scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>CoPlay: Audio-agnostic Cognitive Scaling for Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic sensing manifests great potential in various applications that encompass health monitoring, gesture interface and imaging by leveraging the speakers and microphones on smart devices. However, in ongoing research and development in acoustic sensing, one problem is often overlooked: the same speaker, when used concurrently for sensing and other traditional applications (like playing music), could cause interference in both making it impractical to use in the real world. The strong ultrasonic sensing signals mixed with music would overload the speaker's mixer. To confront this issue of overloaded signals, current solutions are clipping or down-scaling, both of which affect the music playback quality and also sensing range and accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose CoPlay, a deep learning based optimization algorithm to cognitively adapt the sensing signal. It can 1) maximize the sensing signal magnitude within the available bandwidth left by the concurrent music to optimize sensing range and accuracy and 2) minimize any consequential frequency distortion that can affect music playback. In this work, we design a deep learning model and test it on common types of sensing signals (sine wave or Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave FMCW) as inputs with various agnostic concurrent music and speech. First, we evaluated the model performance to show the quality of the generated signals. Then we conducted field studies of downstream acoustic sensing tasks in the real world. A study with 12 users proved that respiration monitoring and gesture recognition using our adapted signal achieve similar accuracy as no-concurrent-music scenarios, while clipping or down-scaling manifests worse accuracy. A qualitative study also manifests that the music play quality is not degraded, unlike traditional clipping or down-scaling methods.</description>

Abstract: Imagine placing your smartphone on a table in a noisy restaurant and clearly capturing the voices of friends seated around you, or recording a lecturer's voice with clarity in a reverberant auditorium. We introduce SonicSieve, the first intelligent directional speech extraction system for smartphones using a bio-inspired acoustic microstructure. Our passive design embeds directional cues onto incoming speech without any additional electronics. It attaches to the in-line mic of low-cost wired earphones which can be attached to smartphones. We present an end-to-end neural network that processes the raw audio mixtures in real-time on mobile devices. Our results show that SonicSieve achieves a signal quality improvement of 5.0 dB when focusing on a 30{\deg} angular region. Additionally, the performance of our system based on only two microphones exceeds that of conventional 5-microphone arrays.</description>

Abstract: Research on generative systems in music has seen considerable attention and growth in recent years. A variety of attempts have been made to systematically evaluate such systems.
  We present an interdisciplinary review of the common evaluation targets, methodologies, and metrics for the evaluation of both system output and model use, covering subjective and objective approaches, qualitative and quantitative approaches, as well as empirical and computational methods. We examine the benefits and limitations of these approaches from a musicological, an engineering, and an HCI perspective.</description>

      <title>Enkidu: Universal Frequential Perturbation for Real-Time Audio Privacy Protection against Voice Deepfakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of voice deepfake technologies has raised serious concerns about user audio privacy, as attackers increasingly exploit publicly available voice data to generate convincing fake audio for malicious purposes such as identity theft, financial fraud, and misinformation campaigns. While existing defense methods offer partial protection, they face critical limitations, including weak adaptability to unseen user data, poor scalability to long audio, rigid reliance on white-box knowledge, and high computational and temporal costs during the encryption process. To address these challenges and defend against personalized voice deepfake threats, we propose Enkidu, a novel user-oriented privacy-preserving framework that leverages universal frequential perturbations generated through black-box knowledge and few-shot training on a small amount of user data. These highly malleable frequency-domain noise patches enable real-time, lightweight protection with strong generalization across variable-length audio and robust resistance to voice deepfake attacks, all while preserving perceptual quality and speech intelligibility. Notably, Enkidu achieves over 50 to 200 times processing memory efficiency (as low as 0.004 gigabytes) and 3 to 7000 times runtime efficiency (real-time coefficient as low as 0.004) compared to six state-of-the-art countermeasures. Extensive experiments across six mainstream text-to-speech models and five cutting-edge automated speaker verification models demonstrate the effectiveness, transferability, and practicality of Enkidu in defending against both vanilla and adaptive voice deepfake attacks. Our code is currently available.</description>

      <title>Progressive Facial Granularity Aggregation with Bilateral Attribute-based Enhancement for Face-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For individuals who have experienced traumatic events such as strokes, speech may no longer be a viable means of communication. While text-to-speech (TTS) can be used as a communication aid since it generates synthetic speech, it fails to preserve the user's own voice. As such, face-to-voice (FTV) synthesis, which derives corresponding voices from facial images, provides a promising alternative. However, existing methods rely on pre-trained visual encoders, and finetune them to align with speech embeddings, which strips fine-grained information from facial inputs such as gender or ethnicity, despite their known correlation with vocal traits. Moreover, these pipelines are multi-stage, which requires separate training of multiple components, thus leading to training inefficiency. To address these limitations, we utilize fine-grained facial attribute modeling by decomposing facial images into non-overlapping segments and progressively integrating them into a multi-granular representation. This representation is further refined through multi-task learning of speaker attributes such as gender and ethnicity at both the visual and acoustic domains. Moreover, to improve alignment robustness, we adopt a multi-view training strategy by pairing various visual perspectives of a speaker in terms of different angles and lighting conditions, with identical speech recordings. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations confirm that our approach substantially enhances face-voice congruence and synthesis stability.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Rhythm Feature Performance Evaluation for Category and Class Level Audio Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next to decision tree and k-nearest neighbours algorithms deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used to classify audio data in many domains like music, speech or environmental sounds. To train a specific CNN various spectral and rhythm features like mel-scaled spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), cyclic tempograms, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) chromagrams, constant-Q transform (CQT) chromagrams and chroma energy normalized statistics (CENS) chromagrams can be used as digital image input data for the neural network. The performance of these spectral and rhythm features for audio category level as well as audio class level classification is investigated in detail with a deep CNN and the ESC-50 dataset with 2,000 labeled environmental audio recordings using an end-to-end deep learning pipeline. The evaluated metrics accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for multiclass classification clearly show that the mel-scaled spectrograms and the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) perform significantly better then the other spectral and rhythm features investigated in this research for audio classification tasks using deep CNNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores integrating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) into natural language query systems to improve weather forecasting efficiency for Korean meteorologists. We address challenges in developing ASR systems for the Korean weather domain, specifically specialized vocabulary and Korean linguistic intricacies. To tackle these issues, we constructed an evaluation dataset of spoken queries recorded by native Korean speakers. Using this dataset, we assessed various configurations of a multilingual ASR model family, identifying performance limitations related to domain-specific terminology. We then implemented a simple text-to-speech-based data augmentation method, which improved the recognition of specialized terms while maintaining general-domain performance. Our contributions include creating a domain-specific dataset, comprehensive ASR model evaluations, and an effective augmentation technique. We believe our work provides a foundation for future advancements in ASR for the Korean weather forecasting domain.</description>

      <title>YuE: Scaling Open Foundation Models for Long-Form Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We tackle the task of long-form music generation--particularly the challenging \textbf{lyrics-to-song} problem--by introducing YuE, a family of open foundation models based on the LLaMA2 architecture. Specifically, YuE scales to trillions of tokens and generates up to five minutes of music while maintaining lyrical alignment, coherent musical structure, and engaging vocal melodies with appropriate accompaniment. It achieves this through (1) track-decoupled next-token prediction to overcome dense mixture signals, (2) structural progressive conditioning for long-context lyrical alignment, and (3) a multitask, multiphase pre-training recipe to converge and generalize. In addition, we redesign the in-context learning technique for music generation, enabling versatile style transfer (e.g., converting Japanese city pop into an English rap while preserving the original accompaniment) and bidirectional generation. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that YuE matches or even surpasses some of the proprietary systems in musicality and vocal agility. In addition, fine-tuning YuE enables additional controls and enhanced support for tail languages. Furthermore, beyond generation, we show that YuE's learned representations can perform well on music understanding tasks, where the results of YuE match or exceed state-of-the-art methods on the MARBLE benchmark.
