      <title>Exceptional pairs on del Pezzo surfaces and spaces of compatible Feigin-Odesskii brackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every relatively prime pair of integers $(d,r)$ with $r&gt;0$, there exists an exceptional pair $({\mathcal O},V)$ on any del Pezzo surface of degree 4, such that $V$ is a bundle of rank $r$ and degree $d$. As an application, we prove that every Feigin-Odesskii Poisson bracket on a projective space can be included into a 5-dimensional linear space of compatible Poisson brackets. We also construct new examples of linear spaces of compatible Feigin-Odesskii Poisson brackets of dimension $&gt;5$, coming from del Pezzo surfaces of degree $&gt;4$.</description>

      <title>Toric Exoflops and Categorical Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the exoflop introduced by Aspinwall. Here, an exoflop takes a gauged Landau-Ginzburg (LG) model, partially compactifies it, and then performs certain birational transformations on it. When certain criteria hold, this can provide a crepant categorical resolution or equivalence of derived categories associated to the gauged LG models. We provide sufficient criteria for when this provides categorical resolutions for (or equivalences between) certain complete intersections in toric stacks.</description>

      <title>Optimal upper bounds for anti-canonical volumes of singular toric Fano varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix two positive integers $d\geq3$ and $q$. We give an upper bound for anti-canonical volumes of $d$-dimensional $\frac{1}{q}$-lc toric Fano varieties, which corresponds to an upper bound for the dual normalized volumes of the associated $d$-dimensional $\frac{1}{q}$-lc Fano polytopes. And we also construct examples to show that these upper bounds are optimal. Besides, we provide an optimal upper bound for volumes of $d$-dimensional lattice simplices $S$ such that $\frac{1}{q}S$ has exactly one interior lattice point.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of schemes from their \'{e}tale topoi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field that is finitely generated over its prime field. In Grothendieck's anabelian letter to Faltings, he conjectured that sending a $k$-scheme to its \'{e}tale topos defines a fully faithful functor from the localization of the category of finite type $k$-schemes at the universal homeomorphisms to a category of topoi. We prove Grothendieck's conjecture for infinite fields of arbitrary characteristic. In characteristic $0$, this shows that seminormal finite type $k$-schemes can be reconstructed from their \'{e}tale topoi, generalizing work of Voevodsky. In positive characteristic, this shows that perfections of finite type $k$-schemes can be reconstructed from their \'{e}tale topoi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A field $k$ is called geometrically $C_1$ if every smooth projective separably rationally connected $k$-variety has a $k$-rational point. Given a henselian valued field of equal characteristic $0$ with divisible value group, we show that the property of being geometrically $C_1$ lifts from the residue field to the valued field. We also prove that algebraically maximal valued fields with divisible value group and finite residue field are geometrically $C_1$. In particular, any maximal totally ramified extension of a local field is geometrically $C_1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the tropical Tevelev degrees, $\mathsf{Tev}_g^{trop}$, as the degree of a natural finite morphism between certain tropical moduli spaces, in analogy to the algebraic case. We develop an explicit combinatorial construction that computes $\mathsf{Tev}_g^{trop} = 2^g$. We prove that these tropical enumerative invariants agree with their algebraic counterparts, giving an independent tropical computation of the algebraic degrees $Tev_g$.</description>

      <title>Castelnuovo bound for curves in projective 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Castelnuovo bound conjecture, which is proposed by physicists, predicts an effective vanishing result for Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of Calabi-Yau 3-folds of Picard number one. Previously, it is only known for a few cases and all the proofs rely on the Bogomolov-Gieseker conjecture of Bayer-Macr\`i-Toda.
  In this paper, we prove the Castelnuovo bound conjecture for any Calabi-Yau 3-folds of Picard number one, up to a linear term and finitely many degree, without assuming the conjecture of Bayer-Macr\`i-Toda. Furthermore, we prove an effective vanishing theorem for surface-counting invariants of Calabi-Yau 4-folds of Picard number one. We also apply our techniques to study low-degree curves on some explicit Calabi-Yau 3-folds.
  Our approach is based on a general iterative method to obtain upper bounds for the genus of one-dimensional closed subschemes in a fixed 3-fold, which is a combination of classical techniques and the wall-crossing of weak stability conditions on derived categories, and works for any projective 3-fold with at worst isolated singularities over any algebraically closed field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide several families of compact complex curves embedded in smooth complex surfaces such that no neighborhood of the curve can be embedded in an algebraic surface. Different constructions are proposed, by patching neighborhoods of curves in projective surfaces, and blowing down exceptional curves. These constructions generalize examples recently given by S. Lvovski. One of our non algebraic argument is based on an extension theorem of S. Ivashkovich.</description>

      <title>On orthogonal decompositions of hermitian Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An hermitian Higgs bundle is a triple $({\mathfrak E},h) = (E,\Phi, h)$, where ${\mathfrak E}=(E,\Phi)$ is a Higgs bundle \cite{Simpson} and $(E,h)$ is a holomorphic hermitian vector bundle \cite{Kobayashi}. As it is well known, several results on holomorphic vector bundles can be extended to the Higgs bundles setting. In this article we show that some classical propositions, involving orthogonal decompositions of holomorphic hermitian vector bundles and the second fundamental form of its holomorphic subbundles, can be extended to hermitian Higgs bundles. The extended results concerning orthogonal decompositions have immediate applications in Higgs bundles, and we include them in the form of two corollaries. The extended results concerning the second fundamental form are previously known in literature \cite{Bruzzo-Granha}. Here we revisit these results and include alternative proofs without using local computations.</description>

      <title>The Basic Theory of Clifford-Bianchi Groups for Hyperbolic n-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a $\mathbb{Q}$-Clifford algebra associated to an $(n-1)$-ary positive definite quadratic form and let $\mathcal{O}$ be a maximal order in $K$. A Clifford-Bianchi group is a group of the form $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathcal{O})$ with $\mathcal{O}$ as above. The present paper is about the actions of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathcal{O})$ acting on hyperbolic space $\mathcal{H}^{n+1}$ via M\"{o}bius transformations $x\mapsto (ax+b)(cx+d)^{-1}$.
  We develop the general theory of orders exhibiting explicit orders in low dimensions of interest. These include, for example, higher-dimensional analogs of the Hurwitz order. We develop the abstract and computational theory for determining their fundamental domains and generators and relations (higher-dimensional Bianchi-Humbert Theory). We make connections to the classical literature on symmetric spaces and arithmetic groups and provide a proof that these groups are $\mathbb{Z}$-points of a $\mathbb{Z}$-group scheme and are arithmetic subgroups of $\operatorname{SO}_{1,n+1}(\mathbb{R})^{\circ}$ with their M\"{o}bius action. We report on our findings concerning certain Clifford-Bianchi groups acting on $\mathcal{H}^4$, $\mathcal{H}^5$, and $\mathcal{H}^6$ .</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A "tensor space" is a vector space equipped with a finite collection of multi-linear forms. In previous work, we showed that (for each signature) there exists a universal homogeneous tensor space, which is unique up to isomorphism. Here we generalize that result: we show that each Zariski class of tensor spaces contains a weakly homogeneous space, which is unique up to isomorphism; here, we say that two tensor spaces are "Zariski equivalent" if they satisfy the same polynomial identities. Our work relies on the theory of $\mathbf{GL}$-varieties developed by Bik, Draisma, Eggermont, and Snowden.</description>

Abstract: We study the asymptotic growth of the number of rational points of bounded height on smooth projective split toric varieties with Picard rank 2 over number fields, with respect to Arakelov height functions associated with big metrized line bundles. We show that these varieties can be naturally decomposed into a finite disjoint union of subvarieties, where explicit asymptotic formulas for the number of rational points of bounded height can be given. Additionally, we present various examples, including the case of Hirzebruch surfaces.</description>

      <title>Dimers and M-Curves: Limit Shapes from Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general approach for the study of dimer model limit shape problems via variational and integrable systems techniques. In particular we deduce the limit shape of the Aztec diamond and the hexagon for quasi-periodic weights through purely variational techniques.
  Putting an M-curve at the center of the construction allows one to define weights and algebro-geometric structures describing the behavior of the corresponding dimer model. We extend the quasi-periodic setup of our previous paper [7] to include a diffeomorphism from the spectral data to the liquid region of the dimer.
  Our novel method of proof is purely variational and exploits a duality between the dimer height function and its dual magnetic tension minimizer and applies to dimers with gas regions. We apply this to the Aztec diamond and hexagon domains to obtain explicit expressions for the complex structure of the liquid region of the dimer as well as the height function and its dual.
  We compute the weights and the limit shapes numerically using the Schottky uniformization technique. Simulations and predicted results match completely.</description>

      <title>The Rees algebra and analytic spread of a divisorial filtration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate some properties of Rees algebras of divisorial filtrations and their analytic spread. A classical theorem of McAdam shows that the analytic spread of an ideal $I$ in a formally equidimensional local ring is equal to the dimension of the ring if and only if the maximal ideal is an associated prime of $R/\overline{I^n}$ for some $n$. We show in Theorem 1.6 that McAdam's theorem holds for $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtrations in an equidimensional local ring which is essentially of finite type over a field. This generalizes an earlier result for $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtrations in an equicharacteristic zero excellent local domain by the author. This theorem does not hold for more general filtrations.
  We consider the question of the asymptotic behavior of the function $n\mapsto \lambda_R(R/I_n)$ for a $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtration $\mathcal I=\{I_n\}$ of $m_R$-primary ideals on a $d$-dimensional normal excellent local ring. It is known from earlier work of the author that the multiplicity $$ e(\mathcal I)=d! \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\lambda_R(R/I_n)}{n^d} $$ can be irrational. We show in Lemma 4.1 that the limsup of the first difference function $$ \limsup_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\lambda_R(I_n/I_{n+1})}{n^{d-1}} $$ is always finite for a $\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtration. We then give an example in Section 4 showing that this limsup may not exist as a limit.
  In the final section, we give an example of a symbolic filtration $\{P^{(n)}\}$ of a prime ideal $P$ in a normal two dimensional excellent local ring which has the property that the set of Rees valuations of all the symbolic powers $P^{(n)}$ of $P$ is infinite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the monodromy of certain $\ell$-adic local systems attached to the generalized Kloosterman sheaves constructed by Yun and calculate their Euler characteristics under standard representations in the cases of symplectic and split/quasi-split orthogonal groups. This provides evidence for the conjectural description of their Swan conductors at $\infty$ which is predicted by Reeder-Yu on the Langlands parameters attached to the epipelagic representations.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial and Algebraic Mutations of Toric Fano 3-folds and Mass Deformations of 2d (0,2) Quiver Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that algebraic and combinatorial polytope mutations of Fano 3-folds can be identified with mass deformations of associated 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories realized by brane brick models. These are Type IIA brane configurations that realize a large family of 2d worldvolume theories on probe D1-branes at toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds. We show that brane brick models that are related by mass deformations associated to algebraic and combinatorial polytope mutations of Fano 3-folds have mesonic moduli spaces with the same number of generators. We show that mesonic flavor charges of these generators form convex reflexive lattice polytopes that are dual to the toric diagrams of the Fano 3-folds. The generating function of mesonic gauge invariant operators, also known as the Hilbert series of the mesonic moduli space, appears to be identical for such brane brick models under a particular refinement originating from the U(1)_R charges in the brane brick model following the mass deformation.</description>

      <title>The Product of Moment Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the product $s\odot t := (s_\alpha\cdot t_\alpha)_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}_0^n}$ of two sequences $s = (s_\alpha)_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}_0^n}$ and $t = (t_\alpha)_{\alpha\in\mathbb{N}_0^n}$. If $s$ is represented by a measure $\mu$ and $t$ by a measure $\nu$, i.e., both are moment sequences, then we give an explicit measure $\mu\odot\nu$ that represents $s\odot t$, i.e., $s\odot t$ is a moment sequence. We pick a result from \emph{Moment-sequence transforms} (J.\ Eur.\ Math.\ Soc.\ \textbf{24} (2022), 3109--3160) and show how the multiplication $s\odot t$ of moment sequences simplifies the proof and also gives deeper insight by providing the representing measure $\mu\odot\nu$.</description>

      <title>Drinfeld-Lau Descent over Fibered Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.14075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let ${\mathcal X}$ be a category fibered in groupoids over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $k$ be an algebraically closed field containing $\mathbb{F}_q$. Denote by $\phi_k\colon {\mathcal X}_k\to {\mathcal X}_k$ the arithmetic Frobenius of ${\mathcal X}_k/k$ and suppose that ${\mathcal M}$ is a stack over $\mathbb{F}_q$ (not necessarily in groupoids). Then there is a natural functor $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}\colon{\mathcal M}({\mathcal X})\to{\mathcal M}({\mathbf D_k}({\mathcal X}))$, where ${\mathcal M}({\mathbf D_k}({\mathcal X}))$ is the category of $\phi_k$-invariant maps ${\mathcal X}_k\to {\mathcal M}$. A version of Drinfeld's lemma states that if ${\mathcal X}$ is a projective scheme and ${\mathcal M}$ is the stack of quasi-coherent sheaves of finite presentation, then $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}$ is an equivalence.
  We extend this result in several directions. For proper algebraic stacks or affine gerbes ${\mathcal X}$, we prove Drinfeld's lemma and deduce that $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}$ is an equivalence for very general algebraic stacks ${\mathcal M}$.
  For arbitrary ${\mathcal X}$, we show that $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}$ is an equivalence when ${\mathcal M}$ is the stack of immersions, the stack of quasi-compact separated \'etale morphisms or any quasi-separated Deligne-Mumford stack with separated diagonal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The affine Grassmannian associated to a reductive group $\mathbf{G}$ is an affine analogue of the usual flag varieties. It is a rich source of Poisson varieties and their symplectic resolutions. These spaces are examples of conical symplectic resolutions dual to the Nakajima quiver varieties. We study the cohomological stable envelopes of D. Maulik and A. Okounkov [arXiv:1211.1287] in this family. We construct an explicit recursive relation for the stable envelopes in the $\mathbf{G} = \mathbf{PSL}_2$ case and compute the first-order correction in the general case. This allows us to write an exact formula for multiplication by a divisor.</description>

Additionally we derive some results concerning sums of squares of $k$-regulous functions; in particular we show that every positive semi-definite regular function on a non-singular affine variety can be written as a sum of squares of locally Lipschitz regulous functions.</description>

We prove the regularity of the difference divisors, find the formally smooth locus of both the special cycles and the difference divisors, by a purely deformation-theoretic approach.</description>

      <title>On the Balmer spectrum of the Morel-Voevodsky category</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Morava-isotropic stable homotopy category and, more generally, the stable homotopy category of an extension $E/k$. These "local" versions of the Morel-Voevodsky stable ${\Bbb{A}}^1$-homotopy category $SH(k)$ are analogues of local motivic categories introduced in [22], but with a substantially more general notion of "isotropy". This permits to construct the, so-called, isotropic Morava points of the Balmer spectrum $\operatorname{Spc}(SH^c(k))$ of (the compact part of) the Morel-Voevodsky category. These analogues of topological Morava points are parametrized by the choice of Morava K-theory and a $K(p,m)$-equivalence class of extensions $E/k$. This provides a large supply of new points, and substantially improves our understanding of the spectrum. An interesting new feature is that the specialization among isotropic points behaves differently than in topology.</description>

Abstract: The motivation for this paper is to detect when an irreducible projective variety V is not toric. We do this by analyzing a Lie group and a Lie algebra associated to V. If the dimension of V is strictly less than the dimension of the above mentioned objects, then V is not a toric variety. We provide an algorithm to compute the Lie algebra of an irreducible variety and use it to provide examples of non-toric statistical models in algebraic statistics.</description>

      <title>On rigidity of Pham-Brieskorn surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that, over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero, for any three integers $a,b,c\geq 2$, any Pham-Brieskorn surface $B_{(a,b,c)}:= k[X,Y,Z]/(X^a + Y^b + Z^c)$ is rigid when at most one of $a,b,c$ is 2 and stably rigid when $\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{c}\leq 1$. In this paper we consider Pham-Brieskorn domains over an arbitrary field $k$ of characteristic $p\geq 0$ and give sufficient conditions on $(a,b,c)$ for which any Pham-Brieskorn domain $B_{(a,b,c)}$ is rigid. This gives an alternative approach to showing that there does not exist any non-trivial exponential map on $k[X,Y,Z,T]/(X^mY+T^{p^rq} + Z^{p^e})= k[x,y,z,t]$, for $m,q&gt;1$, $p\nmid mq$ and $e&gt;r\geq 1$, fixing $y$, a crucial result used in the paper "On the cancellation problem for the affine space $\mathbb{A}^3$ in characteristic $p$" by first author, to show that the Zariski Cancellation Problem (ZCP) does not hold for the affine $3$-space.
  We also provide a sufficient condition for $B_{(a,b,c)}$ to be stably rigid. Along the way we prove that for integers $a,b,c\geq 2$ with $gcd(a,b,c) = 1$ and for $F(Y)\in k[Y]$, the ring $k[X,Y,Z]/(X^aY^b + Z^c+ F(Y))$ is a rigid domain.</description>

Abstract: We begin the study of Lipschitz saturation for germs of toric singularities. By looking at their associated analytic algebras, we prove that if (X,0) is a germ of toric singularity with smooth normalization then its Lipschitz saturation is again toric. Finally we show how to calculate the Lipschitz saturation for some families of toric singularities starting from the semigroup that defines them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the enumerativity of Gromov-Witten invariants where the domain curve is fixed in moduli and required to pass through the maximum possible number of points. We say a Fano manifold satisfies asymptotic enumerativity if such invariants are enumerative whenever the degree of the curve is sufficiently large. Lian and Pandharipande speculate that every Fano manifold satisfies asymptotic enumerativity. We give the first counterexamples, as well as some new examples where asymptotic enumerativity holds. The negative examples include special hypersurfaces of low Fano index and certain projective bundles, and the new positive examples include many Fano threefolds and all smooth hypersurfaces of degree $d \leq (n+3)/3$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$.</description>

This is applied to fully describe the exceptional set and, more generally, the hyper-bitangency set, of a plane curve with three components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a reductive group $G$, we prove that complex irreducible rigid $G$-local systems with quasi-unipotent monodromies and finite order abelianization on a smooth curve are motivic, generalizing a theorem of Katz for $GL_n$. We do so by showing that the Hecke eigensheaf corresponding to such a local system is itself motivic. Unlike other works in the subject, we work entirely over the complex numbers. In the setting of de Rham geometric Langlands, we prove the existence of Hecke eigensheaves associated to any irreducible $G$-local system with regular singularities. We also provide a spectral decomposition of a naturally defined automorphic category over the stack of regular singular local systems with prescribed eigenvalues of the local monodromies at infinity. Finally, we establish a relationship between rigidity for complex local systems and automorphic rigidity, answering a conjecture of Yun in the tame complex setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19795v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the minimal plus-one generated curves and prove a result explaining why they are the closest relatives of the free curves, after the nearly free curves. Then we look at the projective closures of the general and of the special fibers of some Brian\c{c}on-type polynomials constructed by E. Artal Bartolo, Pi. Cassou-Nogu\`es and I. Luengo Velasco. They yield new examples of free, nearly free or minimal plus-one generated curves, as well as counter-examples to the conjecture saying that a supersolvable curve is free. In the final section we give a characterization of plus-one generated curves in terms of eigenscheme ideals, similar to the characterization of free curves given by R. Di Gennaro, G. Ilardi, R.M. Mir\'o-Roig, H. Schenck and J. Vall\`es in a recent paper. Then we apply this result to the construction of minimal plus-one generated curves obtained by putting together at least two members in a pencil of curves related to Brian\c{c}on-type polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for studying special subsets of rational points on an algebraic variety, termed $\mathcal{M}$-points. The notion of $\mathcal{M}$-points generalizes the concepts of integral points, Campana points and Darmon points. We introduce and study $M$-approximation over number fields and function fields, which is a notion that generalizes weak and strong approximation. We show that this property implies that the set of $\mathcal{M}$-points is not thin. We then give a simple characterisation of when a split toric variety satisfies $M$-approximation, generalizing work of Nakahara and Streeter. Further, we determine when the set of $\mathcal{M}$-points on a split toric variety is thin.</description>

      <title>On an example of Aspinwall, Morrison, and Szendr\H{o}i</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cohomology of a 1-parameter family Y_t of Calabi-Yau 3-folds introduced by Aspinwall and Morrison, related to the mirror quintic family. Szendr\H{o}i proved that Y_t, Y_{xi t}, ..., Y_{xi^4 t}, where xi is a fifth root of unity, have the same rational Hodge structure but are not isomorphic, and conjectured that they are not birational or even derived equivalent. We confirm this by proving that their integral Hodge structures are different, and discuss how this fits with known Torelli-type theorems and counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Equivariant ($K$-)homology of affine Grassmannian and Toda lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0306413</link>
      <description>arXiv:math/0306413v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an almost simple complex algebraic group $G$ with affine Grassmannian $Gr_G= G(C((t)))/G(C[[t]])$ we consider the equivariant homology $H^{G(C[[t]])}(Gr_G)$, and $K$-theory $K^{G(C[[t]])}(Gr_G)$. They both have a commutative ring structure, with respect to convolution. We identify the spectrum of homology ring with the universal group-algebra centralizer of the Langlands dual group $\check G$, and we relate the spectrum of $K$-homology ring to the universal group-group centralizer of $G$ and of $\check G$. If we add the loop-rotation equivariance, we obtain a noncommutative deformation of the ($K$)-homology ring, and thus a Poisson structure on its spectrum. We identify this structure with the standard one on the universal centralizer. The commutative subring of $G(C[[t]])$-equivariant homology of the point gives rise to a polarization which is related to Kostant's Toda lattice integrable system. We also compute the equivariant $K$-ring of the affine Grassmannian Steinberg variety. The equivariant $K$-homology of $Gr_G$ is equipped with a canonical base formed by the classes of simple equivariant perverse coherent sheaves. Their convolution is again perverse and is related to the Feigin-Loktev fusion product of $G(C[[t]])$-modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the category of quasi-tempered automorphic D-modules, which is a rather natural class of D-modules from the point of view of geometric Langlands. We provide a characterization of this category in terms of singular support, and as a consequence, we obtain certain microlocal categorical K\"unneth formulas.</description>

      <title>Regular models of modular curves in prime level over ${\mathbb Z}_p^{\mathrm{ur}}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give regular models for modular curves associated with (normalizer of) split and non-split Cartan subgroups of ${\mathrm{GL}}_2 ({\mathbb F}_p )$ (for $p$ any prime, $p\ge 5$). We then compute the group of connected components of the fiber at $p$ of the N\'eron model of their Jacobians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $O$ be an order of odd discriminant $D$ in an imaginary quadratic field $K$. Let $Cl(O)$ be the group of proper $O$-ideals and $Cl(O)[2]$ the kernel of multiplication by $2$ in $Cl(O)$. We describe explicitly the group $Cl(O)[2]$. In particular, we prove that its order is
  $2^{s_D-1}$ where $s_D$ is the number of prime divisors of $D$.</description>

      <title>Projective rigidity of point-line configurations in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a general setup for studying incidence-preserving motions of projective geometric configurations of points and lines via a "projective rigidity matrix". The spaces of infinitesimal motions of a point-line configuration and dependencies amongst the point-line incidences can be interpreted as the kernel and co-kernel of this projective rigidity matrix, respectively. We also introduce a symmetry-adapted projective rigidity matrix for analysing symmetric configurations and their symmetry-preserving motions. The symmetry may be a point group or a more general symmetry, such as an autopolarity.</description>
