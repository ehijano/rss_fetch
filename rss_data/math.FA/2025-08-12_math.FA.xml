      <title>Entropy-, Approximation- and Kolmogorov Numbers on Quasi-Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this bachelor's thesis we introduce three quantities for linear and bounded operators on quasi-Banach spaces which are entropy numbers, approximation numbers and Kolmogorov numbers. At first we establish the three quantities with some basic properties and try to modify known content from the Banach space case. We compare each one of them, with the corresponding other two and give estimates concerning the mean values and limits. As an example, we analyze the identity operator between finite dimensional $\ell_{p}$ spaces $\mbox{id : }\left(\ell_{p}^{n}\rightarrow\ell_{q}^{n}\right)$ for $0&lt;p,q\leq\infty$ and give sharp estimates for entropy numbers. Furthermore we add some known estimates for approximation numbers and Kolmogorov numbers. At last we examine some renowned connections of these quantities to spectral theory on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, which are the inequality of Carl and the inequality of Weyl.</description>

      <title>On a novel approach to nonexpansive mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper seeks to advance the theory of nonexpansive mappings by introducing and exploring a novel class of nonexpansive type mappings, which we aptly designate as perimetric nonexpansive mappings. We establish that the collection of mappings we propose is considerably larger than the existing classes of nonexpansive and quasi-nonexpansive mappings. We also establish fixed point existence findings by examining the connection between periodic points and fixed points in the context of normed linear spaces. Finally, we establish a significant result by proving that every perimetric nonexpansive mapping on a closed bounded convex subset of a Hilbert space necessarily has a fixed point.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Solow-Swan model with nonlocal fractional derivative operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Solow-Swan equation is a foundational model in the evolution of modern economic growth theory. It offers key insights into the long-term behaviour of capital accumulation and output. Since its inception, the model has served as a cornerstone for understanding macroeconomic dynamics and has inspired a vast body of subsequent research. However, traditional formulations of the Solow-Swan model rely on integer-order derivatives, which may not fully capture the memory and hereditary properties often observed in real-world economic systems. In this paper, we extend the classical Solow-Swan framework by incorporating memory effects through the use of fractional calculus. The fractional model accounts for the influence of past states on the present rate of capital change, a feature not accommodated in the standard model. We present a comparative analysis of the capital dynamics under both the classical and fractional-order formulations of the Solow-Swan equation.</description>

      <title>Skew von Neumann constant in Weak Orlicz Spaces and Weak Lebesgue Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper defines the skew von Neumann constant in quasi-Banach spaces. Meanwhile, we obtain two constants. It presents the upper and lower bounds of two constants. Subsequently, it deduces the lower bound of the skew von Neumann constant within weak Orlicz spaces. Then, leveraging the relationship between weak Orlicz spaces and weak Lebesgue spaces, the lower bound of the skew von Neumann - Jordan constant in weak Lebesgue spaces is established. Meanwhile, in this paper, we also generalize the skew von Neumann constant. Then we present the lower bounds for the $p$-th von Neumann constant in weak Orlicz spaces and weak Lebesgue spaces.</description>

      <title>Logically Contractive Mappings: Fixed Points and Event-Indexed Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce "logically contractive mappings" nonexpansive self-maps that contract along a subsequence of iterates and prove a fixed-point theorem that extends Banach's principle. We obtain event-indexed convergence rates and, under bounded gaps between events, explicit iteration-count rates. A worked example shows a nonexpansive map whose square is a strict contraction, and we clarify relations to Meir--Keeler and asymptotically nonexpansive mappings. We further generalize to variable-factor events and show that $\prod_k \lambda_k = 0$ (equivalently $\sum_k -\ln \lambda_k = \infty$) implies convergence. These results unify several generalized contraction phenomena and suggest new rate questions tied to event sparsity.</description>

      <title>Designing optimal dual frames for $\ell^p-$average error optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigates the problem of optimal dual frame selection for signal reconstruction in the presence of erasures. Unlike traditional approaches relying on left inverses, we evaluate performance through the norms of error operators, using the Frobenius norm, spectral radius, and numerical radius as measures. Our central focus is the characterization of dual frames that minimize the $\ell^p-$average under these error operator measurements over all possible erasure patterns. We provide conditions under which the canonical dual frame is uniquely optimal and extend our results to multiple erasures. In the Frobenius norm case, we offer a complete characterization for any number of erasures in uniform tight frames. The paper also examines interconnections between optimality criteria across different norm measures and gives sufficient conditions ensuring uniqueness of the optimal dual.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Coorbit Spaces over Local Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies wavelet coorbit spaces on disconnected local fields $K$, associated to the quasi-regular representation of $G = K \rtimes K^*$ acting on $L^2(K)$. We show that coorbit space theory applies in this context, and identify the homogeneous Besov spaces $\dot{B}_{\alpha,s,t}(K)$ as coorbit spaces. We identify a particularly convenient space $\mathcal{S}_0(K)$ of wavelets that give rise to tight wavelet frames via the action of suitable, easily determined discrete subsets $R \subset G$, and show that the resulting wavelet expansions converge simultaneously in the whole range of coorbit spaces. For orthonormal wavelet bases constructed from elements of $\mathcal{S}_0(K)$, the associated wavelet bases turn out to be unconditional bases for all coorbit spaces. We give explicit constructions of tight wavelet frames and wavelet orthonormal bases to which our results apply.</description>

      <title>Best $m$-term trigonometric approximation in weighted Wiener spaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study best $m$-term trigonometric approximation of functions belonging to multivariate weighted Wiener spaces. It has {recently been observed} that best $m$-term trigonometric widths in the uniform and Wiener norm together with nonlinear recovery algorithms stemming from compressed sensing serve to control the optimal sampling recovery error in various relevant spaces of multivariate functions. We use a collection of old and new tools as well as novel findings to extend these recovery bounds. In addition, by establishing embeddings of classical smoothness spaces into weighted Wiener spaces we extend recovery bounds to classical multivariate smoothness spaces.</description>

      <title>Dilations of non-Markovian dynamical systems on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To generalise evolutions families we consider systems of contractions $\{\varphi(u, v)\}_{(u, v) \in E}$ defined on the edges of a graph $\mathcal{G} = (\Omega, E)$. In this setup the Markov property, or \emph{divisibility}, can be modelled via $\varphi(u, v)\varphi(v, w) = \varphi(u, w)$ for edges $(u, v), (v, w), (u, w) \in E$. We obtain results in three settings: 1) contractive Banach space operators; 2) positive unital maps on $C^{\ast}$-algebras}; and 3) CPTP-maps on trace class operators on a Hilbert space. In the discrete setting we are able to dilate possibly indivisible families of contractions to divisible families of operators with 'nice' properties (viz. surjective isometries resp. $C^{\ast}$-algebraic automorphisms resp. unitary representations). In the special case of linearly ordered graphs equipped with the order topology, we establish sufficient conditions for strongly continuous dilations of possibly indivisible families in the Banach space and $C^{\ast}$-algebra contexts. To achieve these results we work with string-rewriting systems, and make use of and extend dilation theorems of Stroescu [42], Kraus [23, 24], and vom Ende--Dirr [46].</description>

      <title>On Hodge Laplacians on General Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Laplacians on general countable weighted simplicial complexes from a conceptual point of view. These operators will first be introduced formally before showing that those formal operators coincide with self-adjoint realizations of operators arising from quadratic forms. A major conceptual perspective is the correspondence to signed Schr\"odinger operators unveiling the Forman curvature. The main results are criteria for essential self-adjointness via lower bounded Forman curvature and a Gaffney type result via completeness. Finally, we study spectral relations between these Laplacians.</description>

      <title>Characterisations of Sobolev spaces and constant functions over metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ``defect'', that the fractional Sobolev norm $\|f\|_{\dot W^{s,p}}$, for $s\in(0,1)$, fails to converge to the first-order Sobolev norm $\|f\|_{\dot W^{1,p}}$ as $s\to 1$, is a source of two types of substitute results: (1) characterisations of constant functions by integral conditions obtained by na\"ive substitution of $s=1$ into the formula of $\|f\|_{\dot W^{s,p}}$, and (2) derivative-free characterisations of $\dot W^{1,p}$ by suitable modifications of the said formula. In this paper, we obtain extensions of both types of results for the versions of these function spaces over any complete doubling metric measure space $(X,\rho,\mu)$ supporting a $(1,p)$-Poincar\'e inequality. As a key tool of independent potential, we introduce a new ``macroscopic'' Poincar\'e inequality, whose right-hand side has oscillations of the same form as the left-hand side, but at a smaller macroscopic scale $r\in(0,R)$. Besides intrinsic interest, these results are motivated by applications to quantitative compactness properties of commutators $[T,f]$ of singular integrals and pointwise multipliers. With pivotal use of the present results, a characterisation of commutator mapping properties, over the same class of general domains $(X,\rho,\mu)$, is obtained in a companion paper.</description>

Abstract: We show that the quasi-local algebra of a coarse disjoint union of expander graphs does not contain a Cartan subalgebra isomorphic to $\ell_\infty$. N. Ozawa has recently shown that these algebras are distinct from the uniform Roe algebras of expander graphs, and our result describes a further difference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let \( P \) and \( Q \) be the quantum-mechanical momentum and position operators on \( L^2(\R) \). Let $\zeta&gt;0.$ We provide estimates for the {\it Riesz means} $\varkappa(\lambda)$ associated with the system of eigenvalues of the operator
  \begin{align} H(\zeta) = \e^{-bP} + \e^{bP} + \e^{2\pi b Q} + \zeta \e^{-2\pi b Q} = U + U^{-1} + V + \zeta V^{-1}, \end{align} when $\lambda\rightarrow\infty.$ This operator arises in the quantisation of the local {\it del Pezzo Calabi-Yau threefold}, defined as the total space of the anti-canonical bundle over the {\it Hirzebruch surface} \( S = \mathbb{P}^{1} \times \mathbb{P}^{1} \). Our approach is motivated by the spectral analysis of $\varkappa(\lambda)$ in the framework developed by Laptev, Schimmer and Takhtajan in [13].</description>

      <title>Noncommutative ergodic theorems for action of semisimple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected simple Lie group of real rank one and finite center, and let $K$ be a maximal compact subgroup. We study the families of spherical, ball, and uniform averages $(\sigma_t)_{t&gt;0}$, $(\beta_t)_{t&gt;0}$, and $(\mu_t)_{t&gt;0}$ on $G$ induced by the canonical $G$-invariant metric on $G/K$, in the setting where $G$ acts by trace-preserving $*$-automorphisms on a finite von Neumann algebra $(\mathcal M,\tau)$. For the associated noncommutative $L_p$-spaces $L_p(\mathcal M)$, we consider both local and global noncommutative maximal inequalities for these averages, and corresponding pointwise ergodic theorems in the sense of bilateral almost uniform convergence. Our approach combines a noncommutative Calder\'on transfer principle, spectral analysis for the Gelfand pair $(G,K)$ via Harish--Chandra's spherical functions, fractional integration methods, and Littlewood--Paley $g$-function estimates. This work is complemented by our results for higher-rank semisimple Lie groups, where the presence of Property~(T) and associated spectral gaps serve as the key tools in establishing Wiener-type noncommutative pointwise ergodic theorems and noncommutative $L_p$-maximal inequalities for ball and spherical averages on $G/K$ for certain class of semisimple Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Propagation of weak log-concavity along generalised heat flows via Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known consequence of the Pr{\'e}kopa-Leindler inequality is the preservation of logconcavity by the heat semigroup. Unfortunately, this property does not hold for more general semigroups. In this paper, we exhibit a slightly weaker notion of log-concavity that can be propagated along generalised heat semigroups. As a consequence, we obtain logsemiconcavity properties for the ground state of Schr{\"o}dinger operators for non-convex potentials, as well as propagation of functional inequalities along generalised heat flows. We then investigate the preservation of weak log-concavity by conditioning and marginalisation, following the seminal works of Brascamp and Lieb. To our knowledge, our results are the first of this type in non log-concave settings. We eventually study generation of log-concavity by parabolic regularisation and prove novel two-sided log-Hessian estimates for the fundamental solution of parabolic equations with unbounded coefficients, which can be made uniform in time. These properties are obtained as a consequence of new propagation of weak convexity results for quadratic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. The proofs rely on a stochastic control interpretation combined with a second order analysis of reflection coupling along HJB characteristics.</description>

Abstract: We develop a general comparison result for inf convolution operators related to rearrangement. As a consequence we derive comparison results under spherically symmetric rearrangement for Laplace and polar transforms.

Abstract: We establish an additive kinematic formula for the functional Minkowski vectors using mixed Monge-Amp\`ere measures. These vectors, recently introduced and characterized by the author and F. Mussnig, form a natural family of vector-valued valuations on the space of convex functions.

      <title>Structure of Metric $1$-currents: approximation by normal currents and representation results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the $1$-dimensional flat chain conjecture in any complete and quasiconvex metric space, namely that metric $1$-currents can be approximated in mass by normal $1$-currents. The proof relies on a new Banach space isomorphism theorem, relating metric $1$-currents and their boundaries to the Arens-Eells space. As a by-product, any metric $1$-current in a complete and separable metric space can be represented as the integral superposition of oriented $1$-rectifiable sets, thus dropping a finite dimensionality condition from previous results of Schioppa [Schioppa Adv. Math. 2016, Schioppa J. Funct. Anal. 2016]. The connection between the flat chain conjecture and the representation result is provided by a structure theorem for metric $1$-currents in Banach spaces, showing that any such current can be realised as the restriction to a Borel set of a boundaryless normal $1$-current. This generalizes, to any Banach space, the $1$-dimensional case of a recent result of Alberti-Marchese in Euclidean spaces [Alberti-Marchese 2023]. The argument of Alberti-Marchese requires the strict polyhedral approximation theorem of Federer for normal $1$-currents, which we obtain in Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of one-dimensional metric currents: SBV-representations, connectedness and the flat chain conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of one-dimensional metric currents and their relationship to the geometry of metric spaces is presented. We resolve the one-dimensional flat chain conjecture in this general setting, by proving that its validity is equivalent to a simple geometric connectedness property. More precisely, we prove that metric currents can be approximated in the mass norm by normal currents if and only if every $1$-rectifiable set can be covered by countably many Lipschitz curves up to an $\mathscr{H}^1$-negligible set. Building on this, we demonstrate that any $1$-current in a Banach space can be completed into a cycle by a rectifiable current, with the added mass controlled by the Kantorovich--Rubinstein norm of its boundary. We further refine our approximation result by showing that these currents can be approximated by polyhedral currents modulo a cycle. Finally, in arbitrary complete metric spaces, we establish a Smirnov-type decomposition for one-dimensional currents. This decomposition expresses such currents as a superposition, without mass cancellation, of currents associated with curves of bounded variation that have a vanishing Cantor part.</description>

      <title>Order isomorphisms of sup-stable function spaces: continuous, Lipschitz, c-convex, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There have been many parallel streams of research studying order isomorphisms of some specific sets $G$ of functions from a set $X$ to $\mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}$, such as the sets of convex or Lipschitz functions. We develop in this article a unified approach inspired by $c$-convex functions. Our results are obtained highlighting the role of inf and sup-irreducible elements of $G$ and the usefulness of characterizing them, to subsequently derive the structure of order isomorphisms, and in particular of those commuting with the addition of scalars. We show that in many cases all these isomorphisms $J:G\to G$ are of the form $Jf=g+f\circ \phi$ for a translation $g:X\to\mathbb{R}$ and a bijective reparametrization $\phi:X \to X$. Given a reference anti-isomorphism, this characterization then allows to recover all the other anti-isomorphisms. We apply our theory to the sets of $c$-convex functions on compact Hausdorff spaces, to the set of lower semicontinuous (convex) functions on a Hausdorff topological vector space and to 1-Lipschitz functions of complete metric spaces. The latter application is obtained using properties of the horoboundary of a metric space.</description>

Abstract: This paper is about the maximally monotone and quasidense subsets of the product of a real Banach space and its dual. We discuss six subclasses of the maximal monotone sets that are equivalent to the quasidense ones. We define the Gossez extension to the dual of a maximally monotone set, and give nine equivalent characterizations of an element of this set in the quasidense case. We discuss maximally monotone sets of ``type (NI)'' (one of the six classes referred to above) and we show that the ``tail operator'' is not of type (NI), but it is the Gossez extension of a maximally monotone set that is of type (NI). We generalize Rockafellar's surjectivity theorem for maximally monotone subsets of reflexive Banach spaces to maximally monotone subsets of type (NI) of general Banach spaces. We discuss a generalization of the Brezis-Browder theorem on monotone linear subspaces of reflexive spaces to the nonreflexive situation. We also discuss briefly maximally monotone subsets of ``type (D)'' and ``type (WD)'' (two more of the six classes referred to above).</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the weakest possible conditions for fixed point theorems concerning two types of mappings: Kannan and Chatterjea. We employ the so-called CJM condition, which has been successfully applied to the classical Banach-type mappings by \'Ciri\'c [5]. We show that the CJM condition is nearly the weakest possible to have a fixed point even for these two types of mappings, and that those slight modifications yield the weakest condition.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space-Valued LQ Mean Field Games: An Infinite-Dimensional Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01012v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, generalizing the classic LQ MFG theory to scenarios involving $N$ agents with dynamics governed by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, both state and control processes of each agent take values in separable Hilbert spaces. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population which appears in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. Specifically, the dynamics of each agent incorporates an infinite-dimensional noise, namely a $Q$-Wiener process, and an unbounded operator. The diffusion coefficient of each agent is stochastic involving the state, control, and average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of $N$ coupled semilinear infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations establishing the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. We then specialize to $N$-player LQ games described above and study the asymptotic behaviour as the number of agents, $N$, approaches infinity. We develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash Certainty Equivalence principle and characterize a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting MFG. Finally, we study the connections between the $N$-player game and the limiting MFG, demonstrating that the empirical average state converges to the mean field and that the resulting limiting best-response strategies form an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the $N$-player game in Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03609v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Derived from the results in [Giang et al.: \emph{Convolutions for the Fourier transforms with geometric variables and applications}, Math. Nachr. 283(12) (2010), 1758--1770], in this paper, we devoted to studying the boundedness properties for the Fourier-cosine convolution weighted by a Gaussian function of the form $\gamma =\exp(-\frac{1}{2}y^2)$ via Young's type theorem and Saitoh's type inequality. New norm estimations in the weighted space are obtained, and the application of the corresponding class of convolutions in Fredholm's second kind of integral equation is discussed. The conditions for the solvability of this equation on the $L_1$ space are also found, along with the analysis of an illustrative numerical example, which exemplifies that the present object and method solve cases that are not under the conditions of previously known techniques.</description>

      <title>Hyperrigidity II: $R$-dilations, ideals and decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hyperrigidity of subsets of unital $C^*$-algebras annihilated by states (or, more generally, by completely positive maps). This is closely related to the concept of rigidity at $0$ introduced by G. Salomon, who studied hyperrigid subsets of Cuntz and Cuntz-Krieger algebras. The absence of the unit in a hyperrigid set allows for the existence of $R$-dilations with non-isometric $R$. The existence of such an $R$-dilation forces the state annihilating the hyperrigid set to be a character. Using a dilation-theoretic approach, we provide multiple equivalent criteria for hyperrigidity involving intertwining relations for representations, valid in both commutative and noncommutative settings. We develop structural models for such dilations via orthogonal decompositions into two or three components, determined by defect operators and generalized eigenspaces associated with underlying representations.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Optimal Transport (OTIKIN) -- Part 1: Second-Order Discrepancies Between Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first part of a general description in terms of mass transport for time-evolving interacting particles systems, at a mesoscopic level. Beyond kinetic theory, our framework naturally applies in biology, computer vision, and engineering.
  The central object of our study is a new discrepancy $\mathsf d$ between two probability distributions in position and velocity states, which is reminiscent of the $2$-Wasserstein distance, but of second-order nature. We construct $\mathsf d$ in two steps. First, we optimise over transport plans. The cost function is given by the minimal acceleration between two coupled states on a fixed time horizon $T$. Second, we further optimise over the time horizon $T&gt;0$.
  We prove the existence of optimal transport plans and maps, and study two time-continuous characterisations of $\mathsf d$. One is given in terms of dynamical transport plans. The other one -- in the spirit of the Benamou--Brenier formula -- is formulated as the minimisation of an action of the acceleration field, constrained by Vlasov's equations. Equivalence of static and dynamical formulations of $\mathsf d$ holds true. While part of this result can be derived from recent, parallel developments in optimal control between measures, we give an original proof relying on two new ingredients: Galilean regularisation of Vlasov's equations and a kinetic Monge--Mather shortening principle.
  Finally, we establish a first-order differential calculus in the geometry induced by $\mathsf d$, and identify solutions to Vlasov's equations with curves of measures satisfying a certain $\mathsf d$-absolute continuity condition. One consequence is an explicit formula for the $\mathsf d$-derivative of such curves.</description>

      <title>SVarM: Linear Support Varifold Machines for Classification and Regression on Geometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite progress in the rapidly developing field of geometric deep learning, performing statistical analysis on geometric data--where each observation is a shape such as a curve, graph, or surface--remains challenging due to the non-Euclidean nature of shape spaces, which are defined as equivalence classes under invariance groups. Building machine learning frameworks that incorporate such invariances, notably to shape parametrization, is often crucial to ensure generalizability of the trained models to new observations. This work proposes \textit{SVarM} to exploit varifold representations of shapes as measures and their duality with test functions $h:\mathbb{R}^n \times S^{n-1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. This method provides a general framework akin to linear support vector machines but operating instead over the infinite-dimensional space of varifolds. We develop classification and regression models on shape datasets by introducing a neural network-based representation of the trainable test function $h$. This approach demonstrates strong performance and robustness across various shape graph and surface datasets, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>Metric dimension reduction modulus for superlogarithmic distortion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The metric dimension reduction modulus $k^\alpha_n(\ell_\infty)$ is the smallest $k$ such that every $n$--point metric space can be embedded into some $k$-dimensional normed space, with bi--Lipschitz distortion at most $\alpha$. Determining sharp asymptotics for $k^\alpha_n(\ell_\infty)$ is a fundamental task in metric geometry, with $\alpha=\Theta(\log n)$ bearing particular interest. A line of advances over the past decades has led to an upper bound on $k^{\alpha}_n(\ell_\infty)$ for $\alpha = \Omega(\log n)$, but a matching lower bound has remained open. We close this gap, establishing: for every fixed $\beta &gt; 0$, $$ k^{\alpha}_n(\ell_\infty) =\Theta\bigg(\frac{\log n}{\log(\frac{\alpha}{\log n}+1)}\bigg)\quad \mbox{for every $\alpha\geq \beta \log n$}. $$ This resolves a question from Naor's 2018 ICM plenary lecture. Our result is obtained by characterizing the minimum dimension $d$ for which, with high probability, a random regular graph admits an $\alpha$--embedding into some $d$--dimensional normed space.</description>

Abstract: We provide weak-type bounds for a family of bilinear fractional integrals that arise in the study of Euler-Riesz systems. These bounds are uniform in the natural parameter that describes the family and are sharp, in the sense that they do not hold for any larger set of indices.</description>
