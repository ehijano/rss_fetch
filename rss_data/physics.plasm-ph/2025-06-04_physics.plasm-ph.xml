      <title>Magnetic field dynamics in presence of Hall conductivity, and thermodiffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This anisotropy of kinetic coefficients in presence of a magnetic field is
  represented by so-called Hall currents, which appear in a collisional medium due to action of the Lorentz force on the charged particles between collisions. In many papers the Hall currents had been considered in different approximate approaches.
  We derive equations, describing dynamics of the magnetic field in presence of Hall currents, using a standard electrodynamic consideration. We consider collisional media, and take into account a temperature gradients, which create thermodiffusional electric current, in presence of the Hall component. The influence of the Hall currents on the magnetic field structure and damping is considered in simple models. In presence of thermodiffusion the condition for creation of the seed magnetic field in the non-magnetized media is found, which is needed for the action of the mechanism, known as "Biermann battery".</description>

      <title>Particle-in-Cell Simulations of Burning ICF Capsule Implosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomalies observed in the neutron spectral shift of high-yield shots at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) suggest the presence of suprathermal ions, implying that kinetic effects play a significant role in burning inertial confinement fusion (ICF) plasmas. Furthermore, recent measurements of reaction-in-flight (RIF) neutrons offer a direct probe of the stopping power in the burning fuel region of high energy alpha particles and up-scattered fuel ions. We have developed the particle-in-cell code PICNIC, an exactly energy-conserving particle-in-cell Monte-Carlo collision (PIC-MCC) code to simulate the burn stage in ICF. We present results from 1D spherical simulations of NIF shot N210808. We find that the suprathermal ions generated by large-angle Rutherford and nuclear elastic scattering (NES) with fusion alphas produce an alpha knock-on neutron (AKN) signal consistent with experiments. We also find that the inclusion of large-angle scattering physics does not explain the anomalously large spectral shift observed in experiment.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic local Gauss's law preserving PIC method: A self-consistent field-particle update scheme for plasma simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to perform physically faithful particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, the Gauss's law stands as a critical requirement, since its violation often leads to catastrophic errors in long-term plasma simulations. This work proposes a novel method that intrinsically enforces the Gauss's law for the Vlasov-Amp\`ere/Vlasov-Poisson system without requiring auxiliary field corrections or specialized current deposition techniques. The electric field is managed to get updated locally and consistently with the motion of particles via splitting the motion into sub-steps along each dimension of the computational mesh. To further obtain a curl-free electric field, a local update scheme is developed to relax the electric-field free energy subject to the Gauss's law. The proposed method avoids solving the Poisson's or Amp\`ere's equation, resulting in a local algorithm of linear complexity for each time step which can be flexibly combined with various temporal discretization for particle motion in PIC simulations. Theoretical analysis verifies that the proposed method indeed maintains the discrete Gauss's law exactly. Numerical tests on classical benchmarks, including the Landau damping, two-stream instability and Diocotron instability, demonstrate the key advantages of the proposed method. It is expected that the local nature of the proposed method makes it a promising tool in parallel simulations of large-scale plasmas.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing the impact of relativistically intense prepulse on few-picosecond timeframes for short scale length laser-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of multi-petawatt (MPW) lasers globally, a new era of high-energy density science promises to emerge within the next decade. However, precise control over how light at these ultra-relativistic intensities interacts with matter (especially with solid-density targets) will be crucial to fully realize the cutting-edge scientific advancements and technological breakthroughs that the MPW regime promises to unlock. In this manuscript, we present experimental results, supported by numerical simulations, which show how intense prepulse activity on few-ps ($10^{-12}$ s) timescales leads to rapid shifts in the steepness of the preplasma generated on the surface of ultra-thin nanofoil targets. By combining a single-shot frequency resolved optical gating (FROG) autocorrelation device to diagnose on-shot incident laser pulse contrast, with coherent synchrotron emission (CSE) from relativistic laser plasmas as a probe for evolving plasma-scale length conditions, we provide an experimental benchmark for laser contrast on forthcoming MPW facilities, where high contrast on few-ps timescales will be essential for the next generation of laser-solid interactions.</description>

      <title>Testing strong-field QED with the avalanche precursor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-beam high-power laser facility is essential for the study of one of the most captivating phenomena predicted by strong-field quantum electrodynamics (QED) and yet unobserved experimentally: the avalanche-type cascade. In such a cascade, the energy of intense laser light can be efficiently transformed into high-energy radiation and electron-positron pairs. The future 50-petawatt-scale laser facility NSF OPAL will provide unique opportunities for studying such strong-field QED effects, as it is designed to deliver two ultra-intense, tightly focused laser pulses onto the interaction point. In this work, we investigate the potential of such a facility for studying elementary particle and plasma dynamics deeply in the quantum radiation-dominated regime, and the generation of QED avalanches. With 3D particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that QED avalanche precursors can be reliably triggered under realistic laser parameters and layout (namely, focusing $f/2$, tilted optical axes, and non-ideal co-pointing) with the anticipated capabilities of NSF OPAL. We demonstrate that seed electrons can be efficiently injected into the laser focus by using targets of three types: a gas of heavy atoms, an overcritical plasma, and a thin foil. A strong positron and high-energy photon signal is generated in all cases. The cascade properties can be identified from the final particle distributions, which have a clear directional pattern. At increasing laser field intensity, such distributions provide signatures of the transition, first, to the radiation-dominated interaction regime, and then to a QED avalanche. Our findings can also be used for designing related future experiments.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Magnetic Reconnection in Astrophysical Plasmas: A Powerful Mechanism of Nonthermal Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection -- a fundamental plasma physics process, where magnetic field lines of opposite polarity annihilate -- is invoked in astrophysical plasmas as a powerful mechanism of nonthermal particle acceleration, able to explain fast-evolving, bright high-energy flares. Near black holes and neutron stars, reconnection occurs in the ``relativistic'' regime, in which the mean magnetic energy per particle exceeds the rest mass energy. This review reports recent advances in our understanding of the kinetic physics of relativistic reconnection: (1) Kinetic simulations have elucidated the physics of plasma heating and nonthermal particle acceleration in relativistic reconnection; (2) The physics of radiative relativistic reconnection, with its self-consistent interplay between photons and reconnection-accelerated particles -- a peculiarity of luminous, high-energy astrophysical sources -- is the new frontier of research; (3) Relativistic reconnection plays a key role in global models of high-energy sources, both in terms of global-scale layers, as well as of reconnection sites generated as a byproduct of local magnetohydrodynamic instabilities. We summarize themes of active investigation and future directions, emphasizing the role of upcoming observational capabilities, laboratory experiments, and new computational tools.</description>

      <title>Collisionless relaxation to quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos: origin of the universal NFW profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of these attractor states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation is not well understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating by an initially cored halo develops an $r^{-1}$ cusp in the density profile of the accreted material, with $r$ the halocentric radius. Subsequent accretion and relaxation around this $r^{-1}$ cusp develops an $r^{-3}$ fall-off, establishing the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile, a quasi-steady state attractor of collisionless relaxation that is not particularly sensitive to initial conditions. Given enough time though, the halo tends to Maxwellianize and develop an isothermal sphere profile. We demonstrate for the first time that the universal NFW profile emerges as an attractor solution to a self-consistent theory for collisionless relaxation.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and conservation laws in discrete spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noether's theorem connects symmetries to invariants in continuous systems, however its extension to discrete systems has remained elusive. Recognizing the lowest-order finite difference as the foundation of local continuity, a viable method for obtaining discrete conservation laws is developed by working in exact analogy to the continuous Noether's theorem. A detailed application is given to electromagnetism, where energy-momentum conservation laws are rapidly obtained in highly generalized forms that disrupt conventional notions regarding conservative algorithms. Field-matter couplings and energy-momentum tensors with optional deviations at the discreteness scale properly reduce in the continuous limit. Nonlocal symmetries give rise to an additional conservation channel for each spacetime displacement, permitting generalized nonlocal couplings. Prescriptions for conservative particle integrators emerge directly from field-matter coupling terms, enabling the development of fully explicit, energy-conserving particle-in-cell algorithms. The demonstration of exact conservation laws in discrete spacetime that preserve canonical structure has deep implications for numerical algorithms and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>How does ion temperature gradient turbulence depend on magnetic geometry? Insights from data and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic geometry has a significant effect on the level of turbulent transport in fusion plasmas. Here, we model and analyze this dependence using multiple machine learning methods and a dataset of &gt; 200,000 nonlinear simulations of ion-temperature-gradient turbulence in diverse non-axisymmetric geometries. The dataset is generated using a large collection of both optimized and randomly generated stellarator equilibria. At fixed gradients, the turbulent heat flux varies between geometries by several orders of magnitude. Trends are apparent among the configurations with particularly high or low heat flux. Regression and classification techniques from machine learning are then applied to extract patterns in the dataset. Due to a symmetry of the gyrokinetic equation, the heat flux and regressions thereof should be invariant to translations of the raw features in the parallel coordinate, similar to translation invariance in computer vision applications. Multiple regression models including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and decision trees can achieve reasonable predictive power for the heat flux in held-out test configurations, with highest accuracy for the CNNs. Using Spearman correlation, sequential feature selection, and Shapley values to measure feature importance, it is consistently found that the most important geometric lever on the heat flux is the flux surface compression in regions of bad curvature. The second most important feature relates to the magnitude of geodesic curvature. These two features align remarkably with surrogates that have been proposed based on theory, while the methods here allow a natural extension to more features for increased accuracy. The dataset, released with this publication, may also be used to test other proposed surrogates, and we find many previously published proxies do correlate well with both the heat flux and stability boundary.</description>

      <title>The EMPI Code for Plasma-Induced Effects on Radio Waves I: Non-Magnetized Media and Applications to Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic waves undergo modifications as they propagate through plasma. We present EMPI (ElectroMagnetic-wave Plasma Interaction), a three-dimensional numerical framework designed to simulate the interaction between radio signals and cold plasma. With input plasma density profiles, intrinsic radio signals, and the time and frequency resolutions of the telescope, the code synthesizes observed signals using first-principles calculations. EMPI is capable of modeling a wide range of plasma distributions, spanning analytically described smooth functions (e.g., Gaussian or exponential profiles), statistical models (e.g., turbulent screens), and discrete macroscopic structures like isolated plasma clumps, which are difficult to model both analytically and statistically. Validation tests demonstrate excellent agreement with established plasma propagation effects, such as dispersion, lensing, scintillation, and scattering. This code provides an efficient method for handling both analytical and statistical scenarios, bridging the gap between these descriptions. Thanks to its comprehensive capabilities, EMPI is particularly useful for studying radio sources with cosmological origin, especially pulse-like signals such as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). As these signals travel through diverse and complex plasma environments across the universe, their properties are inevitably altered, resulting in observable changes. In this context, EMPI serves as a valuable tool for studying the propagation effects of these sources, helping to advance the understanding of their essence and the intervening plasma environments.</description>
