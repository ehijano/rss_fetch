      <title>Relativistic Toda lattice and equivariant $K$-homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon known as ``quantum equals affine'' in the setting of $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-theory of the flag variety $G/B$, as established by Kato for any semisimple algebraic group $G$. In particular, we focus on the $K$-Peterson isomorphism between the $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-ring $QK_T(SL_n(\mathbb{C})/B)$ and the $T$-equivariant $K$-homology ring $K_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_{SL_n})$ of the affine Grassmannian, after suitable localizations on both sides. Building on an earlier work by Ikeda, Iwao, and Maeno, we present an explicit algebraic realization of the $K$-Peterson map via a rational substitution that sends the generators of the quantum $K$-theory ring to explicit rational expressions in the fundamental generators of $K_*^T(\mathrm{Gr}_{SL_n})$, thereby matching the Schubert bases on both sides. Our approach builds on recent developments in the theory of $QK_T(SL_n(\mathbb{C})/B)$ by Maeno, Naito, and Sagaki, as well as the theory of $K$-theoretic double $k$-Schur functions introduced by Ikeda, Shimozono, and Yamaguchi. This concrete formulation provides new insight into the combinatorial structure of the $K$-Peterson isomorphism in the equivariant setting. As an application, we establish a factorization formula for the $K$-theoretic double $k$-Schur function associated with the maximal $k$-irreducible $k$-bounded partition.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of affine Hecke algebras with unequal parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a $K$-theoretic realization of all affine Hecke algebras with two unequal parameters including exceptional types. This extends the celebrated work of Kazhdan and Lusztig, who gave a $K$-theoretic realization of affine Hecke algebras with equal parameters, and complements results of Kato, who extended this construction to the three-parameter affine Hecke algebra of type $C$. A key idea behind our new construction is to exploit the reducibility of the adjoint representation in small characteristic. We also show that under suitable geometric conditions, our construction leads to a Deligne-Langlands style classification of simple modules. We verify these geometric conditions for $G_2$ thereby obtaining a full geometric classification of the simple modules for the affine Hecke algebra of $G_2$ with two parameters away from roots of unities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the action of the Serre functor on the subcategory of projective-injective modules in a parabolic BGG category $\mathcal O$ of a quasi-reductive finite dimensional Lie superalgebra is given by tensoring with the top component of the symmetric power of the odd part of our superalgebra. As an application, we determine, for all strange Lie suepralgebras, when the subcategory of projective injective modules in the parabolic category $\mathcal O$ is symmetric.</description>

      <title>The first Brauer-Thrall conjecture for extriangulated length categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{A},\Theta)$ be an extriangulated length category of finite type. Using a combinatorial invariant known as the Gabriel-Roiter measure, we prove that $\mathcal{A}$ has an infinite number of pairwise nonisomorphic indecomposable objects if and only if it has indecomposable objects of arbitrarily large length. That is, the first Brauer-Thrall conjecture holds.</description>

      <title>Direct Sum Structure of the Super Virasoro Algebra and a Fermion Algebra Arising from the Quantum Toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that the $q$-deformed Virasoro algebra can be constructed from a certain representation of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_1$ algebra. In this paper, we apply the same construction to the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ and study the properties of the resulting generators $W_i(z)$ ($i=1,2$). The algebra generated by $W_i(z)$ can be regarded as a $q$-deformation of the direct sum $\mathsf{F} \oplus \mathsf{SVir}$, where $\mathsf{F}$ denotes the free fermion algebra and $\mathsf{SVir}$ stands for the $N=1$ super Virasoro algebra, also referred to as the $N=1$ superconformal algebra or the Neveu-Schwarz-Ramond algebra. Moreover, we find that the generators $W_i(z)$ admit two screening currents, whose degeneration limits coincide with the screening currents of $\mathsf{SVir}$. We also establish the quadratic relations satisfied by the $W_i(z)$ and show that they generate a pair of commuting $q$-deformed Virasoro algebras, which degenerate into two nontrivial commuting Virasoro algebras included in $\mathsf{F} \oplus \mathsf{SVir}$.</description>

      <title>Rings for Which f.g. Projective Modules Have the FI-extending Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A right $R$-module $M$ is said to be {\it FI-extending} if any fully invariant submodule of $M$ is essential in a direct summand of $M$. In this short note we prove that if $R$ has ACC on the right annihilators, then $R_R$ is FI-extending if, and only if, every f.g. projective module is too FI-extending. This is an affirmative answer to the question raised by Birkenmeier-Park-Rizvi in Commun. Algebra on 2002 (see \cite{2}).</description>

      <title>Shifted twisted Yangians and finite $W$-algebras of classical type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce parabolic presentations of twisted Yangians of types AI and AII, interpolating between the R-matrix presentation and the Drinfeld presentation. Then we formulate and provide parabolic presentations for the shifted twisted Yangians. We define quotient algebras known as truncated shifted twisted Yangians and equip them with baby comultiplications, generalizing the work of Brundan and Kleshchev. PBW bases for all (truncated) shifted twisted Yangians of type AI and AII are established along the way. Applying the theory of universal equivariant quantizations of conic symplectic singularities we show that the truncated twisted shifted Yangian is isomorphic to the finite $W$-algebra which quantizes a suitable Slodowy slice. This provides a presentation of the finite $W$-algebra associated with every even nilpotent element in type {\sf B} and {\sf C}, as well as every nilpotent element with two Jordan blocks in type {\sf D}. Finally we make a conjecture which would supply presentations in the remaining even cases in type {\sf D}.</description>

      <title>Clusters, twistors and stability conditions I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a quiver $Q$ of ADE type and use cluster combinatorics to define two complex manifolds $\mathcal S$ and $\mathcal L$. The space $\mathcal S$ can be identified with a quotient of the space of stability conditions on the CY$_3$ category associated to $Q$. The space $\mathcal L$ has a canonical map to the complex cluster Poisson space $\mathcal X_{\mathbb C}$ which we prove to be a local homeomorphism. When $Q$ is of type $A$, we give a geometric description of the spaces $\mathcal S$ and $\mathcal L$ as moduli spaces of meromorphic quadratic differentials and projective structures respectively. In the sequel paper we will introduce a space $Z\to \mathbb C$ whose fibre over over a point $\epsilon\in \mathbb C$ is isomorphic to $\mathcal S$ when $\epsilon=0$ and to $\mathcal L$ otherwise. The problem of constructing sections of this map gives a geometric approach to the Riemann-Hilbert problems defined by the Donaldson-Thomas invariants.</description>

      <title>Sheaves of modules on atomic sites and discrete representations of topological groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.13600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.13600v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to establish close relations among sheaves of modules on atomic sites, representations of categories, and discrete representations of topological groups. We characterize sheaves of modules on atomic sites as saturated representations, which are precisely representations right perpendicular to torsion representations in the sense of Geigle and Lenzing. Consequently, the category of sheaves is equivalent to the Serre quotient of the category of presheaves by the category of torsion presheaves. We also interpret the sheaf cohomology functors as derived functors of the torsion functor and for some special cases as the local cohomology functors. These results as well as a classical theorem of Artin provides us a new approach to study discrete representations of topological groups. In particular, by importing established facts in representation stability theory, we explicitly classify simple or indecomposable injective discrete representations of some topological groups such as the infinite symmetric group, the infinite general or special linear group over a finite field, and the automorphism group of the linearly ordered set $\mathbb{Q}$. We also show that discrete representations $V$ of these topological groups satisfy a certain stability property.</description>

      <title>On a specialization of Toda eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies rational functions $\mathfrak{J}_\alpha(q)$, which depend on a positive element $\alpha$ of the root lattice of a root system. These functions arise as Shapovalov pairings of Whittaker vectors in Verma modules of highest weight $-\rho$ for quantum groups and as Hilbert series of Zastava spaces, and are related to the Toda system. They are specializations of multivariate functions more commonly studied in the literature. We investigate the denominator of these rational functions and give an explicit combinatorial formula for the numerator in type A. We also propose a conjectural realization of the numerator as the Poincar\'e polynomial of a smooth variety in type A.</description>

      <title>A Jordan-Chevalley decomposition beyond algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.02637v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a decomposition of definable groups in o-minimal structures generalizing the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of linear algebraic groups. It follows that any definable linear group G is a semidirect product of its maximal normal definable torsion-free subgroup N(G) and a definable subgroup P, unique up to conjugacy, definably isomorphic to a semialgebraic group.
  Along the way, we establish two other fundamental decompositions of classical groups in arbitrary o-minimal structures: 1) a Levi decomposition and 2) a key decomposition of disconnected groups, relying on a generalization of Frattini's argument to the o-minimal setting. In o-minimal structures, together with p-groups, 0-groups play a crucial role. We give a characterization of both classes and show that definable p-groups are solvable, like finite p-groups, but they are not necessarily nilpotent. Furthermore, we prove that definable p-groups (p=0 or p prime) are definably generated by torsion elements and, in definably connected groups, 0-Sylow subgroups coincide with p-Sylow subgroups for each p prime.</description>
