      <title>The positioning of stress fibers in contractile cells minimizes internal mechanical stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanics of animal cells is strongly determined by stress fibers, which are contractile filament bundles that form dynamically in response to extracellular cues. Stress fibers allow the cell to adapt its mechanics to environmental conditions and to protect it from structural damage. While the physical description of single stress fibers is well-developed, much less is known about their spatial distribution on the level of whole cells. Here, we combine a finite element method for one-dimensional fibers embedded in an elastic bulk medium with dynamical rules for stress fiber formation based on genetic algorithms. We postulate that their main goal is to achieve minimal mechanical stress in the bulk material with as few fibers as possible. The fiber positions and configurations resulting from this optimization task alone are in good agreement with those found in experiments where cells in 3D-scaffolds were mechanically strained at one attachment point. For optimized configurations, we find that stress fibers typically run through the cell in a diagonal fashion, similar to reinforcement strategies used for composite material.</description>

      <title>Relaxation and noise-driven oscillations in a model of mitotic spindle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During cell division, the mitotic spindle moves dynamically through the cell to position the chromosomes and determine the ultimate spatial position of the two daughter cells. These movements have been attributed to the action of cortical force generators which pull on the astral microtubules to position the spindle, as well as pushing events by these same microtubules against the cell cortex and plasma membrane. Attachment and detachment of cortical force generators working antagonistically against centring forces of microtubules have been modelled previously (Grill et al. 2005, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94:108104) via stochastic simulations and mean-field Fokker-Planck equations (describing random motion of force generators) to predict oscillations of a spindle pole in one spatial dimension. Using systematic asymptotic methods, we reduce the Fokker-Planck system to a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), consistent with a set proposed by Grill et al., which can provide accurate predictions of the conditions for the Fokker-Planck system to exhibit oscillations. In the limit of small restoring forces, we derive an algebraic prediction of the amplitude of spindle-pole oscillations and demonstrate the relaxation structure of nonlinear oscillations. We also show how noise-induced oscillations can arise in stochastic simulations for conditions in which the mean-field Fokker-Planck system predicts stability, but for which the period can be estimated directly by the ODE model and the amplitude by a related stochastic differential equation that incorporates random binding kinetics.</description>
