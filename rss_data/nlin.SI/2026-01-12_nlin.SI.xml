      <title>On consistency around a $3 \times 3\times 3$ cube and Q3 analogue of the lattice Boussinesq equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two new aspects of lattice Boussinesq (BSQ) equations. First, we show that the lattice potential BSQ (lpBSQ) equation defined on a nine-point square lattice admits a natural extension of three-dimensional consistency to a $3\times 3\times 3$ cube\textemdash a cubic sublattice consisting of $27$ vertices. This extends the standard notion of three-dimensional consistency (defined on an elementary $2\times 2\times 2$ vertex cube for quadrilateral equations) to the non-quadrilateral, nine-point setting. Second, we construct a new three-component system which is referred to as the {\em lattice BSQ-Q3 system}, serving as the BSQ analogue of the Q3($\delta$) equation in the Adler-Bobenko-Suris (ABS) classification. The construction relies on a gauge transformation between Lax pairs of lpBSQ with the parameter $\delta$ arising from a $GL_3$ action. In a degeneration form, the system yields a $PGL_3$-invariant integrable lattice equation that generalises the $PGL_2$-invariant Schwarzian BSQ equation.</description>

      <title>On an integrable 2+1-dimensional extended Dym equation: Lax pair, $\bar{\partial}$-dressing scheme and modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1+1-dimensions, an extension of the canonical solitonic Dym equation has previously been derived both in a geometric torsion evolution context and in the analysis of peakon solitonic phenomena in hydrodynamics. Here, a novel 2+1-dimensional S-integrable extended Dym-type equation is introduced. As Lax pair is constructed and an associated $\bar{\partial}$-dressing scheme detailed. Integrable modulated versions of the 2+1-dimensional extended Dym equation are generated via application of a class of involutory transformations with genesis in classical Ermakov theory.</description>

      <title>The Self-Duality Equations on a Riemann Surface and Four-Dimensional Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a Lagrangian formulation of Hitchin's self-duality equations on a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ using potentials for the connection and Higgs field. This two-dimensional action is then obtained from a four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory on $\Sigma\times \mathbb{CP}^1$ with an appropriate choice of meromorphic 1-form on $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and boundary conditions at its poles. We show that the symplectic structure induced by the four-dimensional theory coincides with the canonical symplectic form on the Hitchin moduli space in the complex structure corresponding to the moduli space of Higgs bundles. We further provide a direct construction of Hitchin Hamiltonians in terms of the four-dimensional gauge field. Exploiting the freedom in the choice of the meromorphic one-form, we construct a family of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theories depending on a $\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter. Upon reduction to two dimensions, these descend to a corresponding family of two-dimensional actions on $\Sigma$ whose field equations are again Hitchin's equations. Furthermore, we obtain a family of symplectic structures from our family of four-dimensional theories and show that they agree with the hyperk\"ahler family of symplectic forms on the Hitchin moduli space, thereby identifying the $\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter with the twistor parameter of the Hitchin moduli space. Our results place Hitchin's equations and their integrable structure within the framework of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory and make the role of the twistor parameter manifest.</description>

      <title>Closed real plane curves of hyperelliptic solutions of focusing gauged modified KdV equation of genus $g$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18285</link>

Abstract: The real part of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation defined over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ is reduced to the focusing gauged MKdV (FGMKdV) equation. In this paper, we construct the real hyperelliptic solutions of FGMKdV equation in terms of data of the hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ and demonstrate the closed hyperelliptic plane curves of genus $g=5$ whose curvature obeys the FGMKdV equation by extending the previous results of genus three (Matsutani, {\it{J. Geom. Phys}} {\bf{215}} (2025) 105540). These are a generalization of Euler's elasticae.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory for self-adjoint Dirac operators with periodic potentials and inverse scattering transform for the defocusing nonlinear Schroedinger equation with periodic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inverse spectral theory for a self-adjoint one-dimensional Dirac operator associated periodic potentials is formulated via a Riemann-Hilbert problem approach. The resulting formalism is also used to solve the initial value problem for the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. A uniqueness theorem for the solutions of the Riemann-Hilbert problem is established, which provides a new method for obtaining the potential from the spectral data. Two additional, scalar Riemann-Hilbert problems are also formulated that provide conditions for the periodicity in space and time of the solution generated by arbitrary sets of spectral data. The formalism applies for both finite-genus and infinite-genus potentials. The formalism also shows that only a single set of Dirichlet eigenvalues is needed in order to uniquely reconstruct the potential of the Dirac operator and the corresponding solution of the defocusing NLS equation, in contrast with the representation of the solution of the NLS equation via the finite-genus formalism, in which two different sets of Dirichlet eigenvalues are used.</description>
