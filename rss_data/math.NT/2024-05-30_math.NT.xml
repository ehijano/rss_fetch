      <title>Asymptotic expansion for the Fourier coefficients associated with the inverse of the modular discriminant function $\Delta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been a plethora of investigations carried out in studying inequalities for the Fourier coefficients of weakly holomorphic modular forms, for example, on the partition function. Recently, Bringmann, Kane, Rolen, and Tripp studied asymptotics for the $k$-colored partition function and more generally, for the fractional partitions arising from the Nekrasov-Okounkov formula which in turn allowed them to prove generalized multiplicative inequalities. Motivated by their idea to find interesting inequalities for the $k$-colored partition functions, denoted by $p_k(n)$, in this paper, we prove a family of inequalities for the $p_{24}(n)$. The main aim of this paper is to study the asymptotic expansion with an effective estimate for the error bound regarding the Fourier coefficients of the modular form $1/\Delta$ (up to a constant $c$ and a power of $q$), where $\Delta$ is the modular discriminant function and a well-known combinatorial interpretation for the associated coefficient sequence is called $24$-colored partitions, denoted by $p_{24}(n)$. Consequently, we show that $p_{24}(n)$ satisfies $2$-$\log$-concavity, Tur\'{a}n inequality of order $3$, and Laguerre inequalities of order $m$ with $2\le m\le 8$ eventually. Our method of estimations for the error term of the asymptotic expansion for $p_{24}(n)$ can be adapted in a more general paradigm where the Fourier coefficients of a certain class of Dedekind-eta quotients which are essentially a modular form of negative weight, admit a Rademacher type exact formula involving the $I$-Bessel function of positive order.</description>

      <title>Codes with Hierarchical Locality on Artin-Schreier Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we construct codes with hierarchical locality using natural geometric structures in Artin-Schreier surfaces of the form $y^p-y=f(x,z)$. Our main theorem describes the codes, their hierarchical structure and recovery algorithms, and gives parameters. We also develop a family of examples using codes defined over $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$ on the surface $y^p-y=x^{p+1}z^2+x^2z^{p+1}$. We count the $\mathbb{F}_{p^2}$-rational points on the surface, a topic of more general number theoretic interest, and provide more explicit parameters a better bound on minimum distance for these codes. An additional example and some generalizations are also considered.</description>

      <title>On the Serre conjecture for Artin characters in the geometric case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $A$ be a regular local ring on which $G$ acts. Under certain assumptions on $A$ and the action, Serre defined a function $a_G\colon G\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ which can be viewed as a higher dimensional analogue of Artin character, and conjectured that it is associated to a $\mathbb{Q}_\ell$-rational representation of $G$ for any prime $\ell$ invertible in $A$. We prove this conjecture in the equal characteristic case.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime. For any $b,c\in\mathbb{Z}$, Z.-W. Sun introduced the new-type determinant $$D_p(b,c)=|(i^2+bij+cj^2)^{p-2}|_{1\leqslant i,j\leqslant p-1},$$ and studied its arithmetic properties. In this paper we mainly prove that $$\left(\frac{D_p(b,1)}{p}\right)=\left(\frac{2b}{p}\right)$$ when $(\frac{b^2-4}{p})=-1$ and $p\equiv1\pmod 4$. As an application of our result, we confirm several conjectures of Sun.</description>

      <title>Spanning isogeny classes of principally polarized abelian surfaces with RM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe how isogenies between principally polarized abelian surfaces (PPAS) with real multiplication (RM) can be decomposed into elementary isogeny types. This leads to a strategy for enumerating the isogeny class of a given PPAS with RM. This note is part of an ongoing work with R. van Bommel, S. Chidambaram, and E. Costa and is not indended for separate publication.</description>

      <title>On the $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules corresponding to crystalline representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a mixed characteristic complete discrete valuation field with perfect residue field of characteristic $p$. We construct a new linear category called the category of crystalline $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over $\widetilde{\mathbb{A}}_K^{+}$ and show that it is equivalent to the category of crystalline $\mathbb{Z}_p$-representations of the absolute Galois group of $K$. In other words, we determine the $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules over $\widetilde{\mathbb{A}}_K$ which correspond to crystalline representations. In a sense, this can be seen as a generalization of Wach modules in the ramified case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Manin's conjecture for split smooth quintic del Pezzo surfaces over arbitrary number fields with respect to fairly general anticanonical height functions. After passing to universal torsors, we first show that we may restrict the torsor variables to their typical sizes, and then we can solve the counting problem in the framework of o-minimal structures.</description>

      <title>Martingale central limit theorem for random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ be a Steinhaus or a Rademacher random multiplicative function. For a wide class of multiplicative functions $f$ we prove that the sum $\sum_{n \le x}\alpha(n) f(n)$, normalised to have mean square $1$, has a limiting distribution. The limiting distribution we find is a Gaussian times the square-root of the total mass of a random measure associated with $f$.
  Our result applies to $d_z$, the $z$-th divisor function, as long as $z$ is strictly between $0$ and $\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. Other examples of admissible $f$-s include any multiplicative indicator function with the property that $f(p)=1$ holds for a set of primes of density strictly between $0$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}$.</description>

Abstract: For a finite set $A\subset\mathbb{N}$ and $k\in \mathbb{N}$, let $\omega_k(A) = \sum_{i\in A, i\neq k}1$. For each $n\in \mathbb{N}$, define $$a_{k, n}\ =\ |\{E\subset \mathbb{N}\,:\, E = \emptyset\mbox{ or } \omega_k(E) &lt; \min E\leqslant \max E\leqslant n\}|.$$ First, we prove that $$a_{k,k+\ell} \ =\ 2F_{k+\ell},\mbox{ for all }\ell\geqslant 0\mbox{ and }k\geqslant \ell+2,$$ where $F_n$ is the $n$th Fibonacci number. Second, we show that $$|\{E\subset \mathbb{N}\,:\, \max E = n+1, \min E &gt; \omega_{2,3}(E), \mbox{ and }|E|\neq 2\}|\ =\ F_{n},$$ where $\omega_{2,3}(E) = \sum_{i\in E, i\neq 2, 3}1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an interesting connection between the family of CMC surfaces of revolution in $\mathbb E_1^3$ and some specific families of elliptic curves. As a consequence of this connection, we show in the class of spacelike CMC surfaces of revolution in the $\mathbb E_1^3$, only spacelike cylinders and standard hyperboloids are algebraic. We also show that a similar connection exists between CMC surfaces of revolution in $\mathbb E^3$ and elliptic curves. Further, we use this to reestablish the fact that the only CMC algebraic surfaces of revolution in $\mathbb E^3$ are spheres and right circular cylinders.</description>

      <title>Mixed radix numeration bases: H\"orner's rule, Yang-Baxter equation and Furstenberg's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed radix bases in numeration is a very old notion but it is rarely studied on its own or in relation with concrete problems related to number theory. Starting from the natural question of the conversion of a basis to another for integers as well as polynomials, we use mixed radix bases to introduce two-dimensional arrays with suitable filling rules. These arrays provide algorithms of conversion which uses only a finite number of euclidean division to convert from one basis to another; it is interesting to note that these algorithms are generalizations of the well-known H\"orner's rule of quick evaluation of polynomials. The two-dimensional arrays with local transformations are reminiscent from statistical mechanics models: we show that changes between three numeration basis are related to the set-theoretical Yang-Baxter equation and this is, up to our knowledge, the first time that such a structure is described in number theory. As an illustration, we reinterpret well-known results around Furstenberg's conjecture in terms of Yang-Baxter transformations between mixed radix bases, hence opening the way to alternative approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish that any finite extension of function fields of genus greater than 1 whose relative class group is trivial is Galois and cyclic. This depends on a result from a preceding paper which establishes a finite list of possible Weil polynomials for both fields. Given this list, we analyze most cases by computing options for the splittings of low-degree places in the extension, then consider the effect of these options on the Weil polynomials of certain isogeny factors of the Jacobian of the Galois closure. In one case, we use instead an analysis based on principal polarizations, modeled on an argument of Howe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X/K$ be a smooth projective variety defined over a number field, and let $f:X\to{X}$ be a morphism defined over $K$. We formulate a number of statements of varying strengths asserting, roughly, that if there is at least one point $P_0\in{X(K)}$ whose $f$-orbit $\mathcal{O}_f(P_0):=\bigl\{f^n(P):n\in\mathbb{N}\bigr\}$ is Zariski dense, then there are many such points. For example, a weak conclusion would be that $X(K)$ is not the union of finitely many (grand) $f$-orbits, while a strong conclusion would be that any set of representatives for the Zariski dense grand $f$-orbits is Zariski dense. We prove statements of this sort for various classes of varieties and maps, including projective spaces, abelian varieties, and surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed positive integer $e$, we describe an algorithm for computing, for all primes $p \leq X$, the mod-$p^e$ reduction of the trace of Frobenius at $p$ of a fixed hypergeometric motive over $\mathbb{Q}$ in time quasilinear in $X$. This extends our previous work for the mod-$p$ reduction, again combining the Beukers--Cohen--Mellit trace formula with average polynomial time techniques of Harvey and Harvey--Sutherland; the key new ingredient is an expanded version of Harvey's "generic prime" construction, making it possible to incorporate certain $p$-adic transcendental functions into the computation. One of these is the $p$-adic Gamma function, whose average polynomial time computation is an intermediate step which may be of independent interest. We also provide an implementation in Sage and discuss the remaining computational issues around computing hypergeometric $L$-series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractions $\frac{p}{q} \in [0,1)$ with prime denominator $q$ written in decimal have a curious property described by Midy's Theorem, namely that two halves of their period (if it is of even length $2n$) sum up to $10^n-1$. A number of results generalise Midy's theorem to expansions of $\frac{p}{q}$ in different integer bases, considering non-prime denominators, or dividing the period into more than two parts. We show that a similar phenomena can be studied even in the context of numeration systems with non-integer bases, as introduced by R\'enyi. First we define the Midy property for a general real base $\beta &gt;1$ and derive a necessary condition for validity of the Midy property. For $\beta =\frac12(1+\sqrt5)$ we characterize prime denominators $q$, which satisfy the property.</description>

      <title>Geometric interpretation of quantitative instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01475v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a real algebraic group $G$ acting on a linear space $V$, a vector $v\in V$ is called unstable if $0\in \overline{Gv}-Gv$, where the closure is taken with respect to the Zariski topology. A fundamental theorem of Kempf in geometric invariant theory states that $v$ is unstable if and only if there is a one-parameter subgroup $A$ of $G$ such that $Av$ is unstable. Assuming $G$ is a semisimple real algebraic $\mathbb{Q}$-group, we give a new proof to this result using a geometric interpretation of the setting. In the process, we also give a new proof of an effective version of this result by Shah and Yang. Our interpretation involves relating the length of vectors under a linear action to convex functions on certain $\cat$-spaces, and bound the later from below by Busemann functions.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic CFTs have central charges c = 8$\mathbb{N}$: a proof based on the MLDE approach and Rademacher series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we present a simple and elementary proof that meromorphic conformal field theories (CFTs) have central charges of the form: $c=8N$ with $N\in\mathbb{N}$ (the set of natural numbers) using the modular linear differential equations (MLDEs) approach. We first set up the 1-character MLDE for arbitrary value of the Wronskian index: $\ell$. From this we get the general form of the meromorphic CFT's character. We then study its modular transformations and the asymptotic value of it's Fourier coefficients -- using Rademacher series -- to conclude that odd values of $\ell$ make the character in-admissible implying that the central charge for admissible character has to be a multiple of 8.</description>

Abstract: We study the limiting spectral measure of large random Helson matrices and large random matrices of certain patterned structures.
  Given a real random variable $X \in L^{2+ \varepsilon}(\mathbb{P}) $ for some $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $\mathrm{Var}(X) = 1$. For the Helson matrices generated by the independent copies of $X$, scaling the eigenvalues by $\sqrt{n}$, we prove the almost sure weak convergence of the spectral measure to the standard semi-circular law. Similar results are established for large random matrices with certain general patterned structures.</description>
