      <title>Test results of the LQXFA/B02 and LQXFA/B03 cryo-assemblies for the High Luminosity LHC upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The US High-Luminosity LHC Accelerator Upgrade Project (AUP) is responsible for delivering cryo-assemblies for the Q1/Q3 quadrupole optical components of the High Luminosity LHC upgrade at CERN. Total of 10 cryo-assemblies containing two Nb3Sn quadrupole magnets per cold mass will be delivered within this program. After the successful test of the first pre-series cryo-assembly in 2023, two more cryo-assemblies were tested at Fermilab's horizontal test facility. Production overview and the test results of the LQXFA/B02 and LQXFA/B03 cryo-assemblies are summarized in this paper. After the first test, to increase the capability of the horizontal test facility, various improvements have been made. These improvements are also described in this paper.</description>

      <title>Booster Cavity Damper Redesign for PIP-II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new Higher Order Mode (HOM) damper was designed and tested for the Booster accelerator cavity at Fermilab. In anticipation of the PIP-II upgrade, it was discovered that the higher beam intensity of PIP-II may cause beam instability due to an excited mode at 105 MHz. This unfortunately corresponds with the cavity's 2nd order harmonic mode, which will sweep from 86-105.7 MHz. The new damper is a modification of an existing damper that was designed to reduce an existing static HOM at 83 MHz, with the new design intending to cover the 2nd order HOM as well. The existing damper uses an inductive coupling loop to extract RF energy from the cavity which then goes through a filter in order to reflect the fundamental frequency back into the cavity while passing HOMs to a dump load. The new damper intends to replace the filter portion of the system with a wider band variant while also changing the topology from a coaxial cable loop filter to a componentized PCB-based design. Primary design challenges include bandwidth coverage, impedance matching of the various modes, long term thermal and mechanical stability, radiation hardness, and high voltage handling. Initial designs achieved the desired damping but were found to quickly succumb to destructive arcing due to the voltages present. More finalized designs intend to address this problem through circuit redesigns and the use of hardier components.</description>

      <title>Consideration of REBCO rapid-cycling diploe magnet for staged muon acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A possible application of the HTS (ReBCO) rapid-cycling dipole magnet [1] in the first stages of muon acceleration consisting of Recirculating Linear Accelerator (RLA) and followed-up first Rapid Cycling Synchrotron (RCS-1) is presented. The projected ReBCO magnet hysteresis loss is discussed in terms of the liquid helium coolant choice and the option with the striated ReBCO conductor for the further significant reduction of the hysteresis power loss.</description>

      <title>Performance Enhancement of Medium-Temperature Baked Niobium SRF Cavity by Surface Contamination Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medium temperature (mid-T) baking, typically conducted at 300 350 C, enhances the quality factor of niobium (Nb) superconducting radio frequency cavities. High vacuum furnace baking is commonly preferred for its practicality in large-scale processing. However, surface contamination, such as niobium carbide formed during vacuum furnace baking, can limit the quench field and degrade the quality factor of the cavity. To investigate this effect, a 1.3 GHz single-cell Nb cavity underwent mid-T baking, followed by a chemical treatment to remove the surface contaminants. Post-treatment measurements revealed a significant improvement in both the quality factor and the quench field.</description>

      <title>Supersonic gas curtain based real-time ionization profile monitor for hadron therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate control and monitoring of the beam is essential for precise dose delivery to tumor tissues during radiotherapy. Real-time monitoring of ion beam profiles and positions improves beam control, patient safety, and treatment reliability by providing immediate feedback. This becomes even more critical in FLASH therapy, where the short corrective window during high-dose delivery demands precise beam control. Existing devices are often limited to in vitro calibration or focus on monitoring a single parameter during treatment. This study aims to develop a device that can simultaneously monitor beam position, profile, current, and energy in real-time, without perturbing the beam, using a supersonic gas curtain system. A supersonic gas curtain beam profile monitor was developed at the Cockcroft Institute to assess its performance and suitability for applications in hadron-beam therapy. The system was integrated with one of the beamlines of the Pelletron accelerator at the Dalton Cumbrian Facility, UK and 2D profile measurements of carbon beams were conducted. The monitor successfully measured the beam profiles within 100ms to 1s across various beam currents (1 - 100 nA), energies (12 - 24 MeV), and charge states (2-5) of carbon. Recorded data was used to estimate detector performance by introducing a parameter called detection limit to quantify sensitivity of the monitor, identifying the threshold number of ions required for detection onset. A method to quantify sensitivity under different beam conditions is then discussed in detail, illustrated with an example case of FLASH beam parameters. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the performance of the gas curtain-based ionization profile monitor for 2D transverse beam profile measurement of carbon ions. The sensitivity is quantified and evaluated against an example case for FLASH conditions.</description>

      <title>Multi-color XFEL pulses with variable color separation and time delay for multi-frame diffraction imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) of high brightness have opened new opportunities for exploring ultrafast dynamical processes in matter, enabling imaging and movies of single molecules and particles at atomic resolution. In this paper, we present a straightforward method for multi-frame diffraction imaging, using the same electron beam to generate four-color XFEL pulses with adjustable wavelength separation and time delay. The optical klystron scheme is introduced to enhance FEL intensity and reduce the total length of undulators. The time delay is tuned via a magnetic chicane between the undulators with various colors. Using parameters of SHINE, start-to-end simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and tunability of our method, achieving representative results such as time delays of hundreds of femtoseconds and four-color XFEL pulses spanning 1.8 to 2.7 nm with 0.3 nm intervals. The proposed scheme enables the recording of multi-frame diffraction images in a single exposure, providing a new perspective for ultrafast molecular and atomic dynamics studies.</description>
