      <title>Modelling hydrogen integration in energy system models: Best practices for policy insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of hydrogen in long-term energy strategies requires a broad understanding on how hydrogen is currently modelled in national energy system models. This study provides a review on hydrogen representation within selected energy system models that are tailored towards providing policy insights. The paper adopts a multi-layered review approach and selects eleven notable models for the review. The review covers hydrogen production, storage, transportation, trade, demand, modeling strategies, and hydrogen policies. The review suggests existing models would often opt for a simplified representation that can capture each stage of the hydrogen supply chain. This approach allows models to strike a balance between accuracy and preserving computational resources. The paper provides several suggestions for modeling hydrogen in national energy system models.</description>

      <title>Instant Runoff Voting and the Reinforcement Paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the susceptibility of instant runoff voting (IRV) to a lesser-studied paradox known as a reinforcement paradox, which occurs when candidate X wins under IRV in two distinct elections but X loses in the combined election formed by merging the ballots from the two elections. For three-candidate IRV elections we provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which there exists a partition of the ballot set into two sets of ballots such that a given losing candidate wins each of the sub-elections. Using these conditions, we use Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the frequency with which such partitions exist under various models of voter behavior. We also analyze the frequency with which the paradox in a large dataset of real-world ranked-choice elections to provide empirical probabilities. Our general finding is that IRV is highly susceptible to this paradox in three-candidate elections.</description>

      <title>Banning short-haul flights and investing in high-speed railways for a sustainable future?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-distance mobility sustainability, high-speed railways (HSR) decarbonization effect, and bans for short-haul flights are debated in Europe. Yet, holistic environmental assessments on these topics are scarce. A comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted on the Paris-Bordeaux transportation options in France: HSR, plane, coach, personal car, and carpooling. The overall ranking on four environmental indicators, from best to worst, is as follows: coach, HSR, carpooling, private car, and plane. Scenario analyses showed that increasing train occupancy decreases the environmental impact of the mode (-12%), while decreasing speed does not. Moreover, worldwide carbon footprints of electric HSR modes range 30-120 gCO2eq per passenger-kilometer traveled. Finally, a consequential LCA highlighted carbon paybacks of the HSR project. Under a business-as-usual trip substitution scenario, the HSR gets net-zero 60 years after construction. With a short-haul flight ban, it occurs after 10 years. This advocates for generalizing short-haul flight bans and investing in HSR infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Integrating social capital with urban infrastructure networks for more resilient cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than half of the world's population now lives in urban environments, which concentrate services and infrastructure to satisfy the material needs of a growing number of inhabitants. The interdependencies between physical infrastructure systems are required for cities to function efficiently, but simultaneously expose cities to new hazards. Failures that emerge from one infrastructure system and cascade through these interdependencies are becoming larger and more frequent due to climate change and growing urban environments. Because of the uneven distribution of resources and basic services, cascade failures often exacerbate pre-existing socioeconomic inequalities. Human communities rely on both social capital and infrastructure services to prepare for, manage, and recover from these challenging scenarios, but the overlap between social and physical infrastructure creates unpredictable feedback dynamics. While prior research has focused on either social capital or physical infrastructure in urban disaster management, an integrative view of these two perspectives is seldom explored. In this paper, the feedback mechanisms between the physical and social layers of different urban designs are identified and analyzed to optimize relief response. Methodologically, we identify cities with high accessibility that have undergone disasters. From these cities, we measure their physical and social resilience indicators before and after disaster as a means to evaluate the impact of accessibility on disaster relief and preparedness. We will supplement this empirical analysis with a simulation that captures a cascade failure/disaster through a multilayer infrastructure and social network model.</description>

      <title>Incivility and Contentiousness Spillover between COVID-19 and Climate Science Engagement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Affective polarization and its accompanying cleavage-based sorting drives incivility and contentiousness around climate change and other science-related issues. Looking at the COVID-19 period, we study cross-domain spillover of incivility and contentiousness in public engagements with climate change and climate science on Twitter and Reddit. We find strong evidence of the signatures of affective polarization surrounding COVID-19 spilling into the climate change domain. Across different social media systems, COVID-19 content is associated with incivility and contentiousness in climate discussions. These patterns of increased antagonism were responsive to pandemic events that made the link between science and public policy more salient. We also show that the observed spillover activated along pre-pandemic political cleavages, specifically anti-internationalist populist beliefs, that linked climate policy opposition to vaccine hesitancy. Our findings highlight the dangers of entrenched cross-domain polarization manifesting as spillover of antagonistic behavior.</description>

      <title>Open Data in the Digital Economy: An Evolutionary Game Theory Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open data, as an essential element in the sustainable development of the digital economy, is highly valued by many relevant sectors in the implementation process. However, most studies suppose that there are only data providers and users in the open data process and ignore the existence of data regulators. In order to establish long-term green supply relationships between multi-stakeholders, we hereby introduce data regulators and propose an evolutionary game model to observe the cooperation tendency of multi-stakeholders (data providers, users, and regulators). The newly proposed game model enables us to intensively study the trading behavior which can be realized as strategies and payoff functions of the data providers, users, and regulators. Besides, a replicator dynamic system is built to study evolutionary stable strategies of multi-stakeholders. In simulations, we investigate the evolution of the cooperation ratio as time progresses under different parameters, which is proved to be in agreement with our theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we explore the influence of the cost of data users to acquire data, the value of open data, the reward (penalty) from the regulators, and the data mining capability of data users to group strategies and uncover some regular patterns. Some meaningful results are also obtained through simulations, which can guide stakeholders to make better decisions in the future.</description>

      <title>An Evolutionary Game With the Game Transitions Based on the Markov Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The psychology of the individual is continuously changing in nature, which has a significant influence on the evolutionary dynamics of populations. To study the influence of the continuously changing psychology of individuals on the behavior of populations, in this paper, we consider the game transitions of individuals in evolutionary processes to capture the changing psychology of individuals in reality, where the game that individuals will play shifts as time progresses and is related to the transition rates between different games. Besides, the individual's reputation is taken into account and utilized to choose a suitable neighbor for the strategy updating of the individual. Within this model, we investigate the statistical number of individuals staying in different game states and the expected number fits well with our theoretical results. Furthermore, we explore the impact of transition rates between different game states, payoff parameters, the reputation mechanism, and different time scales of strategy updates on cooperative behavior, and our findings demonstrate that both the transition rates and reputation mechanism have a remarkable influence on the evolution of cooperation. Additionally, we examine the relationship between network size and cooperation frequency, providing valuable insights into the robustness of the model.</description>

      <title>The exponential distribution of the orders of demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frequency of the preferred order for a noun phrase formed by demonstrative, numeral, adjective and noun has received significant attention over the last two decades. We investigate the actual distribution of the preferred 24 possible orders. There is no consensus on whether it can be well-fitted by an exponential or a power law distribution. We find that an exponential distribution is a much better model. This finding and other circumstances where an exponential-like distribution is found challenge the view that power-law distributions, e.g., Zipf's law for word frequencies, are inevitable. We also investigate which of two exponential distributions gives a better fit: an exponential model where the 24 orders have non-zero probability or an exponential model where the number of orders that can have non-zero probability is variable. When parsimony and generalizability are prioritized, we find strong support for the exponential model where all 24 orders have non-zero probability. This finding suggests that there is no hard constraint on word order variation and then unattested orders merely result from undersampling, consistently with Cysouw's view.</description>

      <title>Hinderance of cooperation by individual solutions: Evolutionary dynamics of three-strategy games combining the prisoner's dilemma and stag hunt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We considered a three-strategy game with the characteristics of the prisoner's dilemma and stag hunt games. This game was inspired by recent experimental studies that elucidated the role of individual solutions. People who adopt individual solutions do not free-ride on the cooperative efforts of others, but instead attempt to solve the problem only to the extent necessary to prevent an impact on themselves. We argue that individual solutions play a role similar to that of defection in the stag hunt game, and this study examined the effects of orthodox free-riding and the individual solution on the evolution of cooperation. Our analysis revealed that a state in which all of the agents adopt the individual solution is the only stable equilibrium in the well-mixed population. Interactions on a square lattice led to modest improvements in cooperation levels, which were mainly sustained by cyclic dominance. Payoff values favorable to cooperation resulted in full cooperation, but rare mutations could hamper the cooperative equilibrium and support the dominance of the individual solution. Our analysis echoed experimental observations and illustrated that overcoming the reliance on individual solutions is critical in understanding the evolution of cooperation.</description>

      <title>Spatial Pattern Formation in Eco-Evolutionary Games with Environment-Driven Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sustainable management of common resources often leads to a social dilemma known as the tragedy of the commons: individuals benefit from rapid extraction of resources, while communities as a whole benefit from more sustainable extraction strategies. Such a social dilemma can be further complicated by the role played by space for both resources and harvesters, where spatial diffusion of resources and directed motion of harvesters can potentially feature the emergence of clusters of environmental resource and sustainable harvesting strategies. In this paper, we explore a PDE model of evolutionary game theory with environmental feedback, describing how the spatial distribution of resource extraction strategies and environmental resources can change due to both local eco-evolutionary dynamics and environmental-driven directed motion of harvesters. Through linear stability analysis, we show that this biased motion towards higher-quality environments can lead to spatial patterns in the distribution of extraction strategies, creating local regions with improved environmental quality and increase payoff for resource extractors. However, by measuring the average payoff and environmental quality across the spatial domain, we see that this pattern-forming mechanism can actually decrease the overall success of the population relative to the equilibrium outcome in the absence of spatial motion. This suggests that environmental-driven motion can produce a spatial social dilemma, in which biased motion towards more beneficial regions can produce emergent patterns featuring a worse overall environment for the population.</description>

      <title>Structural Changes and Percolation Transition in Networks after Aging Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In social networking services, users constantly change, and the network structure changes simultaneously. As the network structure changes, so does the word-of-mouth within it. To study how information transfer on the network changes with the aging of the network, we investigated the relation of the structure and the percolation in the aged networks. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barab\'{a}si model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We introduced two tunable parameters, the deleting parameter $\alpha$ and the adding parameter $\beta$, and observed the aging behavior for the various parameter sets. We found that the network did not reach its steady state depending on the parameters. We also found that when the network is stable, there is a parameter region where the degree distribution changes from power-law to exponential decay. We performed the percolation analyses and found that the behavior of the percolation probability changes simultaneously with changes in the network's structure. This study is expected to help control network structure in steady-state aged networks.</description>
