      <title>Solitary waves in a Two Parameter Family of Generalized Nonlinear Dirac Equations in $1+1$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain exact solutions of the nonlinear Dirac equation in 1+1 dimension of the form $\Psi(x,t) = \Phi(x) e^{-i \omega t}$ where the nonlinear interactions are a combination of vector-vector (V-V) and scalar-scalar (S-S) interactions with the interaction Lagrangian given by $L_I= \frac{g^2}{(\kappa+1)}(\bar{\psi} \psi)^{\kappa+1} -\frac{g^2}{p(\kappa+1)}[\bar{\psi} \gamma_{\mu} \psi \bar{\psi} \gamma^{\mu} \psi]^{(\kappa+1)/2}$. This generalizes the model of ABS (N.V. Alexeeva, I.V. Barashenkov and A. Saxena, Annals Phys. {\bf 403}, 198, (2019)) by having the arbitrary nonlinearity parameter $\kappa&gt;0$ and by replacing the coefficient of the V-V interaction by the arbitrary positive parameter $p&gt;1$ which alters the relative weights of the vector-vector and the scalar-scalar interactions. We show that the solitary wave solutions exist in the entire allowed $(\kappa,p)$ plane for $\omega/m &gt; 1/p^{1/(\kappa+1)} $, for frequency $\omega$ and mass $m$. These solutions have the property that their energy divided by their charge is $\it {independent} $ of the coupling constant $g$. As $\omega$ increases, there is a transition from the double humped to the single humped solitons. We discuss the regions of stability of these solutions as a function of $\omega,p,\kappa$ using the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion. Finally we discuss the non-relativistic reduction of the 2-parameter family of generalized ABS models to a modified nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) and discuss the stability of the solitary waves in the domain of validity of the modified NLSE.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Limited Aggregation in Ants Biting off Wall Paint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) is a well studied phenomenon in which diffusing particles cumulatively aggregate on a starting fixed seed point, forming a pattern which is fractal in structure. Here we report an interesting DLA process arising from ants biting off wall paint. The structures arising from this long process are analyzed and found to have a fractional dimension between 1 and 2. The DLA formations observed in nature are mostly a result of various kinds of inanimate particles diffusing and aggregating. What makes the present observation interesting is that it involves live beings which may be guided by sight, smell etc. A simple theoretical model of the process is simulated, and the results agree well with the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Radial Basis Function Techniques for Neural Field Models on Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical framework for solving neural field equations on surfaces using Radial Basis Function (RBF) interpolation and quadrature. Neural field models describe the evolution of macroscopic brain activity, but modeling studies often overlook the complex geometry of curved cortical domains. Traditional numerical methods, such as finite element or spectral methods, can be computationally expensive and challenging to implement on irregular domains. In contrast, RBF-based methods provide a flexible alternative by offering interpolation and quadrature schemes that efficiently handle arbitrary geometries with high-order accuracy. We first develop an RBF-based interpolatory projection framework for neural field models on general surfaces. Quadrature for both flat and curved domains are derived in detail, ensuring high-order accuracy and stability as they depend on RBF hyperparameters (basis functions, augmenting polynomials, and stencil size). Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate the convergence of our method, highlighting its advantages over traditional approaches in terms of flexibility and accuracy. We conclude with an exposition of numerical simulations of spatiotemporal activity on complex surfaces, illustrating the method's ability to capture complex wave propagation patterns.</description>

      <title>Narrow light beams with linear polarization in a Kerr medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the curl-curl type vector equation describing a monochromatic light wave in a focusing Kerr medium, the transverse structure of extremely narrow, linearly polarized self-focused optical beams is found numerically with a high accuracy. For such two-dimensional spatial solitons with their width as just about one wavelength, all the three components of electric field are essential. Since the solitons are ``saddle points'' of some functional, the numerical method used here is a relaxation procedure, with the functional being minimized on stable modes, and maximized on almost all unstable modes. The only remaining unstable mode of common amplitude is stabilized by fixing the energy flux across the beam cross-section.</description>
