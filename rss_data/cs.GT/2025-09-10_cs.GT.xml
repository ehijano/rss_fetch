      <title>Persuading Agents in Opinion Formation Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prominent opinion formation models such as the one by Friedkin and Johnsen (FJ) concentrate on the effects of peer pressure on public opinions. In practice, opinion formation is also based on information about the state of the world and persuasion efforts. In this paper, we analyze an approach of Bayesian persuasion in the FJ model. There is an unknown state of the world that influences the preconceptions of n agents. A sender S can (partially) reveal information about the state to all agents. The agents update their preconceptions, and an equilibrium of public opinions emerges. We propose algorithms for the sender to reveal information in order to optimize various aspects of the emerging equilibrium. For many natural sender objectives, we show that there are simple optimal strategies. We then focus on a general class of range-based objectives with desired opinion ranges for each agent. We provide efficient algorithms in several cases, e.g., when the matrix of preconceptions in all states has constant rank, or when there is only a polynomial number of range combinations that lead to positive value for S. This generalizes, e.g., instances with a constant number of states and/or agents, or instances with a logarithmic number of ranges. In general, we show that subadditive range-based objectives allow a simple n-approximation, and even for additive ones, obtaining an $n^{1-c}$-approximation is NP-hard, for any constant $c &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>City Sampling for Citizens' Assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In citizens' assemblies, a group of constituents is randomly selected to weigh in on policy issues. We study a two-stage sampling problem faced by practitioners in countries such as Germany, in which constituents' contact information is stored at a municipal level. As a result, practitioners can only select constituents from a bounded number of cities ex post, while ensuring equal selection probability for constituents ex ante.
  We develop several algorithms for this problem. Although minimizing the number of contacted cities is NP-hard, we provide a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm and an additive 1-approximation, both based on separation oracles for a linear programming formulation. Recognizing that practical objectives go beyond minimizing city count, we further introduce a simple and more interpretable greedy algorithm, which additionally satisfies an ex-post monotonicity property and achieves an additive 2-approximation. Finally, we explore a notion of ex-post proportionality, for which we propose two practical algorithms: an optimal algorithm based on column generation and integer linear programming and a simple heuristic creating particularly transparent distributions. We evaluate these algorithms on data from Germany, and plan to deploy them in cooperation with a leading nonprofit organization in this space.</description>

      <title>Inference of Intrinsic Rewards and Fairness in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From altruism to antagonism, fairness plays a central role in social interactions. But can we truly understand how fair someone is, especially without explicit knowledge of their preferences? We cast this challenge as a multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning problem, explicitly structuring rewards to reflect how agents value the welfare of others. We introduce novel Bayesian strategies, reasoning about the optimality of demonstrations and characterisation of equilibria in general-sum Markov games. Our experiments, spanning randomised environments and a collaborative cooking task, reveal that coherent notions of fairness can be reliably inferred from demonstrations. Furthermore, when isolating fairness components, we obtain a disentangled understanding of agents preferences. Crucially, we unveil that by placing agents in different groups, we can force them to exhibit new facets of their reward structures, cutting through ambiguity to answer the central question: who is being fair?</description>

      <title>Smart Fast Finish: Preventing Overdelivery via Daily Budget Pacing at DoorDash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a budget pacing feature called Smart Fast Finish (SFF). SFF builds upon the industry standard Fast Finish (FF) feature in budget pacing systems that depletes remaining advertising budget as quickly as possible towards the end of some fixed time period. SFF dynamically updates system parameters such as start time and throttle rate depending on historical ad-campaign data. SFF is currently in use at DoorDash, one of the largest delivery platforms in the US, and is part of its budget pacing system. We show via online budget-split experimentation data and offline simulations that SFF is a robust solution for overdelivery mitigation when pacing budget.</description>

      <title>Language Self-Play For Data-Free Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven baselines.</description>

      <title>Multi-Topic Projected Opinion Dynamics for Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a model of opinion formation on resource allocation among multiple topics by multiple agents, who are subject to hard budget constraints. We define a utility function for each agent and then derive a projected dynamical system model of opinion evolution assuming that each agent myopically seeks to maximize its utility subject to its constraints. Inter-agent coupling arises from an undirected social network, while inter-topic coupling arises from resource constraints. We show that opinions always converge to the equilibrium set. For special networks with very weak antagonistic relations, the opinions converge to a unique equilibrium point. We further show that the underlying opinion formation game is a potential game. We relate the equilibria of the dynamics and the Nash equilibria of the game and characterize the unique Nash equilibrium for networks with no antagonistic relations. Finally, simulations illustrate our findings.</description>

      <title>Stackelberg-Pareto Synthesis with Quantitative Reachability Objectives</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we deepen the study of two-player Stackelberg games played on graphs in which Player $0$ announces a strategy and Player $1$, having several objectives, responds rationally by following plays providing him Pareto-optimal payoffs given the strategy of Player $0$. The Stackelberg-Pareto synthesis problem, asking whether Player $0$ can announce a strategy which satisfies his objective, whatever the rational response of Player $1$, has been recently investigated for $\omega$-regular objectives. We solve this problem for weighted graph games and quantitative reachability objectives such that Player $0$ wants to reach his target set with a total cost less than some given upper bound. We show that it is NEXPTIME-complete, as for Boolean reachability objectives.</description>

      <title>Is Your LLM Overcharging You? Tokenization, Transparency, and Incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State-of-the-art large language models require specialized hardware and substantial energy to operate. As a consequence, cloud-based services that provide access to large language models have become very popular. In these services, the price users pay for an output provided by a model depends on the number of tokens the model uses to generate it -- they pay a fixed price per token. In this work, we show that this pricing mechanism creates a financial incentive for providers to strategize and misreport the (number of) tokens a model used to generate an output, and users cannot prove, or even know, whether a provider is overcharging them. However, we also show that, if an unfaithful provider is obliged to be transparent about the generative process used by the model, misreporting optimally without raising suspicion is hard. Nevertheless, as a proof-of-concept, we develop an efficient heuristic algorithm that allows providers to significantly overcharge users without raising suspicion. Crucially, we demonstrate that the cost of running the algorithm is lower than the additional revenue from overcharging users, highlighting the vulnerability of users under the current pay-per-token pricing mechanism. Further, we show that, to eliminate the financial incentive to strategize, a pricing mechanism must price tokens linearly on their character count. While this makes a provider's profit margin vary across tokens, we introduce a simple prescription under which the provider who adopts such an incentive-compatible pricing mechanism can maintain the average profit margin they had under the pay-per-token pricing mechanism. Along the way, to illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with several large language models from the $\texttt{Llama}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$ and $\texttt{Ministral}$ families, and input prompts from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform.</description>

      <title>Achieving Equitability with Subsidy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fair allocation problem of indivisible items with subsidy. In this paper, we focus on the notion of fairness - equitability (EQ), which requires that items be allocated such that all agents value the bundle they receive equally. First, we study the upper bounds of the minimum required subsidy to achieve EQ in different item settings and provide the corresponding lower bounds. Second, we consider the bounded subsidy for achieving EQ and another popular notion of fairness - envy-freeness (EF), and give a characterization of allocations that can achieve both EQ and EF. Finally, we analyze the bounds of subsidy of allocations achieving fairness and efficiency (utilitarian social welfare or Nash welfare) and design several polynomial-time algorithms to compute the desired allocation.</description>

      <title>Online Fair Allocations with Binary Valuations and Beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an online fair allocation problem, a sequence of indivisible items arrives online and needs to be allocated to offline agents immediately and irrevocably. In our paper, we study the online allocation of either goods or chores. We employ popular fairness notions, including envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and maximin share fairness (MMS) to capture fairness, and utilitarian social welfare (USW) to measure efficiency. For both settings of items, we present a series of positive results regarding the existence of fair and efficient allocations with widely studied classes of additive binary and personalized bi-valued valuation/cost functions. Furthermore, we complement our results by constructing counterexamples to establish our results as among the best guarantees possible.</description>

      <title>Personalized Pricing Through Strategic User Profiling in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional user profiling techniques rely on browsing history or purchase records to identify users' willingness to pay. This enables sellers to offer personalized prices to profiled users while charging only a uniform price to non-profiled users. However, the emergence of privacy-enhancing technologies has caused users to actively avoid on-site data tracking. Today, major online sellers have turned to public platforms such as online social networks to better track users' profiles from their product-related discussions. This paper presents the first analytical study on how users should best manage their social activities against potential personalized pricing, and how a seller should strategically adjust her pricing scheme to facilitate user profiling in social networks. We formulate a dynamic Bayesian game played between the seller and users under asymmetric information. The key challenge of analyzing this game comes from the double couplings between the seller and the users as well as among the users. Furthermore, the equilibrium analysis needs to ensure consistency between users' revealed information and the seller's belief under random user profiling. We address these challenges by alternately applying backward and forward induction, and successfully characterize the unique perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE) in closed form. Our analysis reveals that as the accuracy of profiling technology improves, the seller tends to raise the equilibrium uniform price to motivate users' increased social activities and facilitate user profiling. However, this results in most users being worse off after the informed consent policy is imposed to ensure users' awareness of data access and profiling practices by potential sellers. This finding suggests that recent regulatory evolution towards enhancing users' privacy awareness may have unintended consequences of reducing users' payoffs.</description>
