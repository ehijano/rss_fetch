      <title>Using Protected Attributes to Consider Fairness in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fairness in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has been extensively studied, particularly in reward distribution among agents in scenarios such as goods allocation, resource division, lotteries, and bargaining systems. Fairness in MAS depends on various factors, including the system's governing rules, the behaviour of the agents, and their characteristics. Yet, fairness in human society often involves evaluating disparities between disadvantaged and privileged groups, guided by principles of Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI). Taking inspiration from the work on algorithmic fairness, which addresses bias in machine learning-based decision-making, we define protected attributes for MAS as characteristics that should not disadvantage an agent in terms of its expected rewards. We adapt fairness metrics from the algorithmic fairness literature -- namely, demographic parity, counterfactual fairness, and conditional statistical parity -- to the multi-agent setting, where self-interested agents interact within an environment. These metrics allow us to evaluate the fairness of MAS, with the ultimate aim of designing MAS that do not disadvantage agents based on protected attributes.</description>

      <title>See Behind Walls in Real-time Using Aerial Drones and Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents ARD2, a framework that enables real-time through-wall surveillance using two aerial drones and an augmented reality (AR) device. ARD2 consists of two main steps: target direction estimation and contour reconstruction. In the first stage, ARD2 leverages geometric relationships between the drones, the user, and the target to project the target's direction onto the user's AR display. In the second stage, images from the drones are synthesized to reconstruct the target's contour, allowing the user to visualize the target behind walls. Experimental results demonstrate the system's accuracy in both direction estimation and contour reconstruction.</description>

      <title>MobA: A Two-Level Agent System for Efficient Mobile Task Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current mobile assistants are limited by dependence on system APIs or struggle with complex user instructions and diverse interfaces due to restricted comprehension and decision-making abilities. To address these challenges, we propose MobA, a novel Mobile phone Agent powered by multimodal large language models that enhances comprehension and planning capabilities through a sophisticated two-level agent architecture. The high-level Global Agent (GA) is responsible for understanding user commands, tracking history memories, and planning tasks. The low-level Local Agent (LA) predicts detailed actions in the form of function calls, guided by sub-tasks and memory from the GA. Integrating a Reflection Module allows for efficient task completion and enables the system to handle previously unseen complex tasks. MobA demonstrates significant improvements in task execution efficiency and completion rate in real-life evaluations, underscoring the potential of MLLM-empowered mobile assistants.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Incentives and Fairness in Ordered Weighted Average for Facility Location Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facility location games provide an abstract model of mechanism design. In such games, a mechanism takes a profile of $n$ single-peaked preferences over an interval as an input and determines the location of a facility on the interval. In this paper, we restrict our attention to distance-based single-peaked preferences and focus on a well-known class of parameterized mechanisms called ordered weighted average methods, which is proposed by Yager in 1988 and contains several practical implementations such as the standard average and the Olympic average. We comprehensively analyze their performance in terms of both incentives and fairness. More specifically, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions on their parameters to achieve strategy-proofness, non-obvious manipulability, individual fair share, and proportional fairness, respectively.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Resilient Output Optimization of Multiagent via Self-Triggered Hybrid Detection Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How to achieve precise distributed optimization despite unknown attacks, especially the Byzantine attacks, is one of the critical challenges for multiagent systems. This paper addresses a distributed resilient optimization for linear heterogeneous multi-agent systems faced with adversarial threats. We establish a framework aimed at realizing resilient optimization for continuous-time systems by incorporating a novel self-triggered hybrid detection approach. The proposed hybrid detection approach is able to identify attacks on neighbors using both error thresholds and triggering intervals, thereby optimizing the balance between effective attack detection and the reduction of excessive communication triggers. Through using an edge-based adaptive self-triggered approach, each agent can receive its neighbors' information and determine whether these information is valid. If any neighbor prove invalid, each normal agent will isolate that neighbor by disconnecting communication along that specific edge. Importantly, our adaptive algorithm guarantees the accuracy of the optimization solution even when an agent is isolated by its neighbors.</description>

      <title>EFX Exists for Three Types of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of finding an envy-free allocation of indivisible goods among multiple agents. EFX, which stands for envy-freeness up to any good, is a well-studied relaxation of the envy-free allocation problem and has been shown to exist for specific scenarios. For instance, EFX is known to exist when there are only three agents [Chaudhury et al, EC 2020], and for any number of agents when there are only two types of valuations [Mahara, Discret. Appl. Math 2023].
  We show that EFX allocations exist for any number of agents when there are at most three types of additive valuations.</description>

      <title>Rapid and Automated Alloy Design with Graph Neural Network-Powered LLM-Driven Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multi-agent AI model is used to automate the discovery of new metallic alloys, integrating multimodal data and external knowledge including insights from physics via atomistic simulations. Our multi-agent system features three key components: (a) a suite of LLMs responsible for tasks such as reasoning and planning, (b) a group of AI agents with distinct roles and expertise that dynamically collaborate, and (c) a newly developed graph neural network (GNN) model for rapid retrieval of key physical properties. A set of LLM-driven AI agents collaborate to automate the exploration of the vast design space of MPEAs, guided by predictions from the GNN. We focus on the NbMoTa family of body-centered cubic (bcc) alloys, modeled using an ML-based interatomic potential, and target two key properties: the Peierls barrier and solute/screw dislocation interaction energy. Our GNN model accurately predicts these atomic-scale properties, providing a faster alternative to costly brute-force calculations and reducing the computational burden on multi-agent systems for physics retrieval. This AI system revolutionizes materials discovery by reducing reliance on human expertise and overcoming the limitations of direct all-atom simulations. By synergizing the predictive power of GNNs with the dynamic collaboration of LLM-based agents, the system autonomously navigates vast alloy design spaces, identifying trends in atomic-scale material properties and predicting macro-scale mechanical strength, as demonstrated by several computational experiments. This approach accelerates the discovery of advanced alloys and holds promise for broader applications in other complex systems, marking a significant step forward in automated materials design.</description>

      <title>Transformer Guided Coevolution: Improved Team Formation in Multiagent Adversarial Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of team formation within multiagent adversarial games. We propose BERTeam, a novel algorithm that uses a transformer-based deep neural network with Masked Language Model training to select the best team of players from a trained population. We integrate this with coevolutionary deep reinforcement learning, which trains a diverse set of individual players to choose teams from. We test our algorithm in the multiagent adversarial game Marine Capture-The-Flag, and we find that BERTeam learns non-trivial team compositions that perform well against unseen opponents. For this game, we find that BERTeam outperforms MCAA, an algorithm that similarly optimizes team formation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LLM Trading Performance with Fact-Subjectivity Aware Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While many studies prove more advanced LLMs perform better on tasks such as math and coding, we notice that in cryptocurrency trading, stronger LLMs work worse than weaker LLMs often. To study how this counter-intuitive phenomenon occurs, we examine the LLM reasoning processes on making trading decisions. We find that separating the reasoning process into factual and subjective components can lead to higher profits. Building on this insight, we introduce a multi-agent framework, FS-ReasoningAgent, which enables LLMs to recognize and learn from both factual and subjective reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this framework enhances LLM trading performance in cryptocurrency markets. Additionally, an ablation study reveals that relying on subjective news tends to generate higher returns in bull markets, whereas focusing on factual information yields better results in bear markets. Our code and data are available at \url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FS-ReasoningAgent-B55F/}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional safety is a critical aspect of automotive engineering, encompassing all phases of a vehicle's lifecycle, including design, development, production, operation, and decommissioning. This domain involves highly knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper introduces Aegis: An Advanced LLM-Based Multi-Agent for Intelligent Functional Safety Engineering. Aegis is specifically designed to support complex functional safety tasks within the automotive sector. It is tailored to perform Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment(HARA), document Functional Safety Requirements(FSR), and plan test cases for Automatic Emergency Braking(AEB) systems. The most advanced version, Aegis-Max, leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) and reflective mechanisms to enhance its capability in managing complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. Additionally, targeted prompt refinement by professional functional safety practitioners can significantly optimize Aegis's performance in the functional safety domain. This paper demonstrates the potential of Aegis to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of functional safety processes in automotive engineering.</description>

      <title>3D Guidance Law for Flexible Target Enclosing with Inherent Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of enclosing an arbitrarily moving target in three dimensions by a single pursuer while ensuring the pursuer's safety by preventing collisions with the target. The proposed guidance strategy steers the pursuer to a safe region of space surrounding and excluding the target, allowing it to maintain a certain distance from the latter while offering greater flexibility in positioning and converging to any orbit within this safe zone. We leverage the concept of the Lyapunov Barrier Function as a powerful tool to constrain the distance between the pursuer and the target within asymmetric bounds, thereby ensuring the pursuer's safety within the predefined region. Further, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed guidance law in managing arbitrarily maneuvering targets and other uncertainties (such as vehicle/autopilot dynamics and external disturbances) by enabling the pursuer to consistently achieve stable global enclosing behaviors by switching between stable enclosing trajectories within the safe region whenever necessary, even in response to aggressive target maneuvers. To attest to the merits of our work, we conduct experimental tests with various plant models, including a high-fidelity quadrotor model within Software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, encompassing various challenging target maneuver scenarios and requiring only relative information for successful execution.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Agents for Collaborative Task under Information Asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MAS) have achieved great progress in solving complex tasks. It performs communication among agents within the system to collaboratively solve tasks, under the premise of shared information. However, when agents' collaborations are leveraged to perform multi-person tasks, a new challenge arises due to information asymmetry, since each agent can only access the information of its human user. Previous MAS struggle to complete tasks under this condition. To address this, we propose a new MAS paradigm termed iAgents, which denotes Informative Multi-Agent Systems. In iAgents, the human social network is mirrored in the agent network, where agents proactively exchange human information necessary for task resolution, thereby overcoming information asymmetry. iAgents employs a novel agent reasoning mechanism, InfoNav, to navigate agents' communication toward effective information exchange. Together with InfoNav, iAgents organizes human information in a mixed memory to provide agents with accurate and comprehensive information for exchange. Additionally, we introduce InformativeBench, the first benchmark tailored for evaluating LLM agents' task-solving ability under information asymmetry. Experimental results show that iAgents can collaborate within a social network of 140 individuals and 588 relationships, autonomously communicate over 30 turns, and retrieve information from nearly 70,000 messages to complete tasks within 3 minutes.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Target Assignment and Path Finding for Intelligent Warehouse: A Cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent target assignment and path planning (TAPF) are two key problems in intelligent warehouse. However, most literature only addresses one of these two problems separately. In this study, we propose a method to simultaneously solve target assignment and path planning from a perspective of cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (RL). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to model the TAPF problem for intelligent warehouse to cooperative multi-agent deep RL, and the first to simultaneously address TAPF based on multi-agent deep RL. Furthermore, previous literature rarely considers the physical dynamics of agents. In this study, the physical dynamics of the agents is considered. Experimental results show that our method performs well in various task settings, which means that the target assignment is solved reasonably well and the planned path is almost shortest. Moreover, our method is more time-efficient than baselines.</description>
