      <title>Multi-Scale Irregularities Product: a data product utilizing the high-resolution Swarm plasma density data for space weather applications</title>

Abstract: We use the high-resolution Swarm faceplate plasma density data at 16 Hz to develop a set of parameters that can characterize multi-scale ionospheric structures and irregularities along the Swarm orbit. We present the methods for calculating density gradients over different window sizes, rate of change of density index, power spectral density and the spectral slope at both low and high latitudes. The faceplate plasma data are not continuously available through the years. However, about 8 years of data from Swarm A are processed from late 2014 to the end of 2025. Some statistical results from Swarm A are presented. The variations of plasma structures and irregularities are dependent on solar activity, season, local time and geomagnetic activities, and the variations show different patterns between low and high latitudes. For example, the high-latitude ionosphere is characterized by persistent ionospheric structures and irregularities poleward of 60 magnetic latitude, while the low-latitude ionospheric irregularities are only dominant during 19-01 local time near the magnetic equator. The occurrence of steep spectral slope at high latitudes shows clear seasonal variations, i.e., it maximizes during local summer and minimizes during local winter in both hemispheres. However, the occurrence of steep spectral slope at low latitudes is only sensible when significant plasma structures and irregularities are present. We further calculate the histogram of spectral slopes at low latitudes when the rate of change of density index is enhanced. The histogram resembles a Gaussian distribution with an expected value of 1.97. The processed data are available to the wider community. Given the high resolution, this new data product will be useful for the scientific communities that are interested in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling and near-Earth space environment.</description>

      <title>On flying through the base of a pseudo-streamer</title>

Abstract: Near the 10 solar radius perihelion of Parker Solar Probe orbit 24, a confined region containing an enhanced plasma density of 25,000 particles per cubic centimeter and broadband electrostatic waves was encountered. The solar wind velocity of 200 kilometers per second and ion temperature of 25 eV were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. These anomalous plasma conditions were observed on closed magnetic field lines, as determined from observations of the suprathermal electron strahl. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed through the base of a pseudo-streamer whose structure extended out to 10 solar radii. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii.</description>
