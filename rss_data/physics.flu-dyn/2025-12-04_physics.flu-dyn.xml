      <title>Role of boundary conditions and wall orientation on the transport of settling inertial particles in wall-bounded flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational settling affects particle transport in turbulent flows in two ways; explicitly, by introducing a finite settling velocity, and implicitly, by modifying how the particles interact with the flow field. For wall-bounded flows, when the wall is horizontal (gravity perpendicular to the wall) both the explicit and implicit effects of settling impact the particle transport towards the wall, whereas when the wall is vertical (gravity parallel to the wall) only the implicit effect plays a role. Surprisingly, it was recently demonstrated that even when the settling parameter $Sv$ is very small, settling can play a very significant role in controlling the near-wall transport in a horizontal channel. In this paper, we use direct numerical simulations to explore how this finding is affected by the particle boundary conditions and whether it also occurs in vertical channels where only the implicit effect of settling plays a role. We show that the sensitivity of the particle transport to $Sv$ depends upon the particle boundary conditions, with elastic-collisions (that generate a zero mean particle flux) and absorbing-wall conditions (that generate a negative mean particle flux) exhibiting qualitatively and quantitatively different sensitivities to $Sv$. It is found that for vertical channels the impact of settling on the particle transport is in fact negligible if $Sv$ is small, and only becomes significant when $Sv\geq O(1)$. Finally, we examine the physical mechanisms governing the settling velocity of particles in vertical channel flows, and find that low-speed streaks can play a significant role in suppressing the settling velocity of the particles near the walls, in contrast to the core region where the preferential sweeping mechanism leads to an enhancement of their settling velocity.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Adaptive Feedback Control of a Supersonic Dual-Stream Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive control is applied to a supersonic dual-stream jet flow comprised of Mach 1.6 core and Mach 1.0 bypass streams that mix to form a supersonic shear layer. The vortices shed are the source of a high-frequency tone that persists throughout the flow. The intricate flow dynamics motivates the need for an elaborate and efficient actuation system to suppress the tone and weaken the propagating shock train. The present work utilizes online dynamic mode decomposition, which estimates the system dynamics as a locally linear evolution. Snapshot matrices are constructed using sensor measurements, facilitating economical and real-time computations, which are continuously updated and used in a feedback control model. Adaptive control is found to efficiently target the resonant tone with little disturbance to the mean features. The framework is not sensitive to sensor placements, enabling actuator design under physically realizable spatial locations in practical implementation. To reflect physical limitations, constraints are imposed on the controller model. It is found that the restricted controller yields greater vortex suppression due to repeated transitory stabilization of the shear layer instability. Statistical analysis reveals intermittent low-pressure events are responsible for the characteristic frequency, which are largely suppressed by adaptive feedback control.</description>

      <title>Models of Flow through Porous Media of Polar Fluids with Pressure-Dependent Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equations governing the flow of a polar fluid, with pressure-dependent Newtonian viscosity, through a variable-porosity medium are developed. Averaged equations are obtained using intrinsic volume averaging. A drag function is introduced to account for the interactions of the fluid with the porous matrix. Darcy and Forchheimer generalized terms are included in the model equations for both granular and consolidated media to account for the effects of the porous microstructure.</description>

      <title>Self-Tuning Dynamic Explicit Modal Filtering Based on Local Flow Characteristics for Large-Eddy Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work improves upon our previously introduced explicit dynamic modal filter (DEMF) within the framework of the discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) by introducing a mechanism for self-tuning of the model parameters. The new self-tuning dynamic explicit modal filter (STDEMF) also extends the methodology for obtaining modal values from nodal values beyond Chebyshev grids and polynomials to general collocation points and orthogonal polynomial bases by leveraging orthogonality. The generated modes are used to remove the built-up energy due to unresolved sub-grid scales (SGS) in large-eddy simulation (LES) of turbulent flows. The STDEMF improves the performance of DEMF in two ways. First, the filter kernel applied to the modes is adapted from a cut-off kernel to a hyperbolic tangent shape, which automatically adjusts the model for different polynomial orders. Second, the cut-off mode is computed dynamically for each element as a function of local flow characteristics, including the local Kolmogorov length scale and the second invariants of the strain and rotation rate tensors. The suggested formulation for the cut-off mode treats unresolved elements distinctly and improves performance by avoiding under- or over-dissipation. Moreover, the cut-off mode evolves over time within the same element as turbulent characteristics vary. The model is evaluated on three flows, homogeneous isotropic decaying, the Taylor-Green vortex, and periodic channel flow, each with distinct turbulent characteristics. Comparisons of the results show that the STDEMF model outperforms the DEMF model and the Smagorinsky eddy viscosity model.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of nanofluid boundary-layer flow over a flat plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear stability of nanofluid boundary-layer flow over a flat plate is investigated using a two-phase model that incorporates Brownian motion and thermophoresis, building upon the earlier work of Buongiorno (2006). Solutions to the steady boundary-layer equations reveal a thin nanoparticle concentration layer near the plate surface, with a characteristic thickness of $O({\Rey}^{-1/2}{Sc}^{-1/3})$, for a Reynolds number $\Rey$ and Schmidt number $Sc$. When Brownian motion and thermophoresis are neglected, this nanoparticle concentration layer disappears, resulting in a uniform concentration across the boundary layer. Neutral stability curves and critical conditions for the onset of the Tollmien--Schlichting wave are computed for a range of nanoparticle materials and volume concentrations. Results indicate that while the effects of Brownian motion and thermophoresis are negligible, the impact of nanoparticle density is significant. Denser nanoparticles, such as silver (Ag) and copper (Cu), destabilise the Tollmien--Schlichting wave, whereas lighter nanoparticles, like aluminium (Al) and silicon (Si), establish a small stabilising effect. Additionally, stability characteristics are influenced by the viscosity model. Finally, a high-Reynolds number asymptotic analysis is undertaken for the lower branch of the neutral stability curve.</description>

      <title>Fast directional transport of Leidenfrost droplets on spiked surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Leidenfrost effect enables droplets to levitate above a solid surface, significantly reducing the resistance to droplet motion. In this study, a spiked surface is utilized to achieve fast directional transport of Leidenfrost droplets, with a maximum average speed reaching 8.36 m per second over a 10 cm distance,far exceeding the previously reported maximum speeds for droplet transport. When a droplet falls onto a substrate heated above the Leidenfrost temperature, it becomes trapped between spikes and levitates. The sides and bottom surface of the droplet undergo vaporization, creating a gas film between the solid wall and the droplet. However, this gas film is unstable and prone to rupture at certain points, causing the droplet to come into contact with the solid surface. Therefore, the droplets undergo violent boiling, leading to intense compression and bursting into smaller daughter droplets, which are then propelled rapidly along the substrate. Additionally, the asymmetric geometry of the spikes ensures that droplets move unidirectionally along the longitudinal direction. This study proposes a novel droplet self-propulsion mechanism, pioneering new strategies for enhancing droplet transport speed..</description>

      <title>Drag reduction via separation control using plasma actuators on a truck cabin side</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the drag reduction on a heavy-duty vehicle by means of dielectric-barrier discharge plasma actuators located on the A-pillars. An experimental campaign is carried out on a generalized truck model, the Ground Transportation System (GTS). Measurements were performed for several values of the side-wind angle, up to 7.5\deg. Actuation was performed individually on the leeward and windward side as well as simultaneously. We measured both axial and side force components with a load cell. A laminar separation bubble on both sides of the truck's cabin is identified with particle image velocimetry. The plasma actuators effectively reduce the axial force on the GTS, and higher force reduction is achieved with symmetric actuation. The leeward actuation is found to have a greater control authority than the windward one; at large side-wind angle the latter has a negligible effect on the axial force. Concerning the side force, the leeward actuation produces a drop in its magnitude while windward actuation produces an increase. Interestingly, actuating symmetrically also augments the side force. The plasma actuator causes a reduction in the length and width of the separation bubble on the cabin side, reducing the apparent frontal area of the truck and thus its drag. Under side wind conditions, the leeward actuator has stronger authority since reduces the size of the larger separation bubble. The side force is also weakened via the diminution of the larger recirculation region, reducing its lateral suction force.</description>

      <title>Linking Aneurysmal Geometry and Hemodynamics Using Computational Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development and progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are related to complex flow patterns and wall-shear-driven mechanobiological stimuli, yet the quantitative relationship between aneurysmal geometry and hemodynamics remains poorly defined. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive hemodynamic analysis of 74 patient-specific abdominal aortas, representing one of the largest Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) cohorts reported to date. A multiscale framework coupling 0D-1D systemic circulation models with 3D stabilized finite-element simulations is used to generate physiologically consistent boundary conditions and high-fidelity flow fields. From each model, we extract Time Averaged Wall Shear Stress (TAWSS), Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), Relative Residence Time (RRT) and Local Normalized Helicity (LNH) indicators alongside an extended set of geometric descriptors characterizing diameter, curvature and torsion. This study provides a clear and comprehensive view of how aneurysm shape influences blood-flow behavior, supported by one of the largest systematically analyzed CFD datasets of AAAs to date. Our results show that specific geometric features reliably shape shear-stress patterns, suggesting that these geometry-driven flow signatures could serve as valuable biomarkers for patient-specific risk assessment. Together, these insights highlight the potential of incorporating detailed geometric descriptors into future models that aim to predict AAA growth and rupture.</description>

      <title>Intermittency from Instanton Calculus at the Transition to Turbulence and Fusion Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding intermittency of turbulent systems from the underlying differential equations is an outstanding problem in fluid dynamics. Here, in the example of Burgers turbulence, we introduce a method that yields structure function exponents by combining instanton calculus and fusion rule predictions. We use instantons to evaluate velocity gradient (VG) moments at the onset of intermittency, and then infer scaling exponents in fully developed turbulence via fusion rules. We show that the method captures the phase transition at $\mathrm{Re}_\lambda \approx 1$ in the VG moment scaling, highlight the necessity of including fluctuations around instantons, and discuss future extensions.</description>

      <title>Stratification, turbulence organization, and pressure-strain effects on surface-layer turbulence anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At large scales, the Reynolds stress tensor exhibits notable anisotropy, a key feature of all wall-bounded turbulent flows. Yet, how the drivers of this anisotropy evolve with shearing and thermal stratification in the atmospheric surface layer (ASL) remains a daunting challenge for theory and models alike. Here, the velocity variance budgets are used to explore the evolution of anisotropy in the daytime ASL close to the surface, region known to be problematic for large eddy simulations. A special focus is placed on the importance of slow and rapid pressure-strain correlations and the role of transport on partitioning the turbulent kinetic energy among the velocity components. Results obtained from near-surface observations of four datasets over flat and horizontally homogeneous terrain show persistent anisotropy over a wide range of flux Richardson numbers $R_{if}$ and wall-normal distances, and highlight the importance of different processes in three distinct flow regimes, roughly related to dynamic ($|R_{if}|\ll1$), dynamic-convective ($|R_{if}|\sim1$) and convective ($|R_{if}|\gg1$) regimes of the ASL. In particular, close to the surface in the dynamic-convective regime, a drop in wall-normal velocity variance and a substantial increase of spanwise velocity variance are shown to result from the increasing role of pressure transport and rapid distortion, related to turbulence organization. This behaviour is not captured by the classic Rotta closure but requires the inclusion of both rapid pressure-strain and transport terms. In all regimes wall blocking is found to influence turbulence close to the surface, thus requiring the adoption of an anisotropic Rotta model to accommodate its effects.</description>

      <title>Vortex Dynamics from Burst-and-Coast Motion of Anguilliform and Carangiform Swimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fish perform various propulsive maneuvers while swimming by generating traveling waves along their bodies and producing thrust through tail strokes. Anguilliform swimmers spread motion along the body, while carangiform swimmers' motion is more prominent near their tails. Many species also switch between continuous undulation and intermittent swimming, such as burst-and-coast maneuver, which can save energy but can also change the wake structure and hydrodynamic forces. Our current study aims at explaining} how duty cycle (DC), undulatory gaits, and Strouhal number (St), shape the near-body vortices, overall wakes, and the hydrodynamic forces. We carry out three-dimensional simulations at Re = 3000 for flows around an eel (anguilliform) and a Jack Fish (carangiform) for DC = 0.2-1.0 and St = 0.30 and 0.40. Our results reveal that the burst-and-coast motion for both swimmer produce bow-shaped wakes, the two rows of which on the sides approach each other to form a more coherent wake as DC is increased to 1.0 that corresponds to the wake of continuously undulating swimmers. It is also found that the intermittent motion at a higher Strouhal number produces more drag, contrary to the continuous undulatory kinematics. We further investigate this behavior by quantifying the strengths of vortices produced around the two swimmers and their instantaneous kinematic metrics. A detailed analysis for the role of different body sections in the production of unsteady streamwise forces is also presented. These insights provide important connections between the swimmers' physiologies, their kinematics, and the governing vortex dynamics to attain certain hydrodynamic metrics for designing next-generation autonomous bio-inspired underwater robots.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the different scaling regimes of the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang--Burgers equation using the functional renormalisation group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03937v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is a celebrated non-linear stochastic equation featuring non-equilibrium scaling. Although in one dimension, its statistical properties are very well understood, a new scaling regime has been reported in recent numerical simulations. This new regime is characterised by a dynamical exponent $z=1$, markedly different from the expected one $z=3/2$ for the KPZ universality class, and it emerges when approaching the inviscid limit. The origin of this scaling has been traced down to the existence of a new fixed point, termed the inviscid Burgers (IB) fixed point, which was uncovered using the functional renormalisation group (FRG). The FRG equations can be solved analytically in the asymptotic regime of vanishing viscosity and large momenta, showing that indeed $z=1$ exactly at the IB fixed point. In this work, we set up an advanced method to numerically solve the full FRG flow equations in a certain approximation, which allows us to determine in a unified way the correlation function over the whole range of momenta, not restricted to some particular regime. We analyse the crossover between the different fixed points, and quantitatively determine the extent of the IB regime.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Extension for Multiscale Analysis and Modeling Near Boundaries, with an Ocean Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Treatment of fields near domain boundaries is a long-standing problem in signal processing that has come into renewed focus following recent efforts in convolution-based multiscale coarse-graining and in machine-learned parameterizations due to ocean boundary artifacts. Here, we propose a general method for extending fields beyond the domain boundaries by solving a Laplace boundary-value problem. Construction of the harmonic extension is well-posed, including uniqueness, and is consistent with the boundary conditions by design. The formulation applies to irregular boundaries such as discretized coastlines. The harmonic extension is physically desirable since it has minimum spatial variability among all admissible extensions satisfying the boundary conditions. The method is simple to implement using well-established numerical approaches, and is broadly applicable to extending oceanic variables over land boundaries. Other applications include machine learning parametrization and subgrid modeling of wall-bounded flows and multiphase flows. We demonstrate the method by extending sea-surface temperature (SST) over land using fixed temperature (Dirichlet) and no-flux (Neumann) boundary conditions: the land-filled solution is smooth with SST values between the coastal minimum and maximum.</description>

      <title>Enhanced magnetostrophic waves with magnetic field orthogonal to the rotation axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03120v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an isolated Gaussian velocity vortex perturbation in an otherwise quiescent, electrically conducting, and rotating fluid permeated by a uniform magnetic field $\bf{B}$. Studies suggest a presence of strong azimuthal wave motions on the timescale of centuries within the Earth's liquid outer core at higher latitudes. To understand these long-period oscillations, we focus on magnetostrophic waves, a slow component of magnetic-Coriolis waves with $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned with the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, which replicate the field lines in the azimuthal direction. We present an analytical solution to the magnetic-Coriolis wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. Later, with numerical solution, we validate our analytical estimates and show that magnetostrophic waves travel relatively faster along the magnetic field when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$ compared with the case when both are aligned. The study confirms that with a magnetic field $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned to the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, wave vectors satisfying the condition $\bf{\Omega}\cdot\bf{k} \approx 0$, travel with Alfv\'en velocities along the magnetic field lines as a component of inertial-Alfv\'en waves. The timescales on which Alfv\'en waves travel are relatively short, and it is also less likely that inertial-Alfv\'en waves will be sustained inside the core at higher latitudes \citep{Davidson2017}. This study shows that, excluding the inertial-Alfv\'en waves contribution ($k_z\neq 0$), there exists intensified magnetostrophic wave propagation when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$, which can explain the strong periodic oscillations on the time scales of centuries along the azimuthal field at higher latitudes. Results show persistence of the magnetostrophic waves despite the lower Lehnert number $Le$, suggesting the plausible existence of a low-intensity azimuthal magnetic field in the Earth's core.</description>

      <title>Magic of the Well: assessing quantum resources of fluid dynamics data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum resource requirements of a dataset generated from simulations of two-dimensional, periodic, incompressible shear flow, aimed at training machine learning models. By measuring entanglement and non-stabilizerness on MPS-encoded functions, we estimate the computational complexity encountered by a stabilizer or a tensor network solver applied to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations across different flow regimes. Our analysis reveals that, under specific initial conditions, the shear width identifies a transition between resource-efficient and resource-intensive regimes for non-trivial evolution. Furthermore, we find that the two resources qualitatively track each other in time, and that the mesh resolution along with the sign structure play a crucial role in determining the resource content of the encoded state. These findings offer useful guidelines for the development of scalable, quantum-inspired approaches to fluid dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental method to fabricate centimetric thin elastic capsules with highly uniform thickness and negligible bending stiffness using silicone elastomers. In our experiments, the capsules thickness is tunable at fabrication, while internal pressure and hoop (circumferential) stress are adjustable via hydrostatic inflation once the capsules are filled and immersed in water. Capsules mechanics are probed through hydro-elastic waves generated by weak mechanical perturbations at the capsule interface. By analyzing the surface wave dynamics in the Fourier domain, we extract the in-plane stress and demonstrate that the hydro-elastic waves are exclusively governed by hoop stress. This establishes a direct analogy with liquid drops characterised by an effective surface tension, allowing the capsules to be modeled as large-scale "elasto-drops" with an inflation and thickness tunable effective surface tension. Our work demonstrates that elasto-drops serve as a robust model system for parametric studies of large-scale liquid drops with experimentally adjustable surface tension.</description>

      <title>A novel multiscale modelling for the hemodynamics in retinal microcirculation with an analytic solution for the capillary-tissue coupled system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical modelling of the microcirculatory hemodynamics in the retina is an essential tool for understanding various diseases of the retina, yet remains challenging due to the multiscale nature of the retinal vasculature and its coupling to surrounding tissue. To address this, we develop a multiscale model that couples retinal vasculature across scales with interstitial tissue. Our model combines the one-dimensional (1D) model for arteries and veins with the coupled Darcy equations for capillaries and tissue. The model uses an analytic solution for capillary-tissue coupled system that provides a simple interpretation of the results along with much faster computation. The analytic solution implies a dynamic coupling condition that links the capillary bed with upstream arterial and downstream venous flows. The model is mathematically robust, demonstrated through analysis of the solution's truncation error and convergence. Its predictive accuracy is verified against experimental data and other models, making it useful in interpreting experimental results. Finally, the role of various parameters in controlling retinal hemodynamics is explored.</description>

Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a unified hydrodynamic and Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the screened Stokes equations of the membrane--subphase composite, we derive the real-space incompressible Green's tensor, obtain its near- and far-field asymptotics, and construct the resulting dipolar velocity and stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of $N$ dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. Exploiting this structure, we simulate ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the $1/r$ near-field kernel and the subphase screened $1/r^{3}$ far-field kernel. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations.</description>

      <title>An end-to-end quantum algorithm for nonlinear fluid dynamics with bounded quantum advantage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a cornerstone of classical scientific computing, and there is growing interest in whether quantum computers can accelerate such simulations. To date, the existing proposals for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for CFD have almost exclusively been based on the Carleman embedding method, used to encode nonlinearities on a quantum computer. In this work, we begin by showing that these proposals suffer from a range of severe bottlenecks that negate conjectured quantum advantages: lack of convergence of the Carleman method, prohibitive time-stepping requirements, unfavorable condition number scaling, and inefficient data extraction. With these roadblocks clearly identified, we develop a novel algorithm for the incompressible lattice Boltzmann equation that circumvents these obstacles, and then provide a detailed analysis of our algorithm, including all potential sources of algorithmic complexity, as well as gate count estimates. We find that for an end-to-end problem, a modest quantum advantage may be preserved for selected observables in the high-error-tolerance regime. We lower bound the Reynolds number scaling of our quantum algorithm in dimension $D$ at Kolmogorov microscale resolution with $O(\mathrm{Re}^{\frac{3}{4}(1+\frac{D}{2})} \times q_M)$, where $q_M$ is a multiplicative overhead for data extraction with $q_M = O(\mathrm{Re}^{\frac{3}{8}})$ for the drag force. This upper bounds the scaling improvement over classical algorithms by $O(\mathrm{Re}^{\frac{3D}{8}})$. However, our numerical investigations suggest a lower speedup, with a scaling estimate of $O(\mathrm{Re}^{1.936} \times q_M)$ for $D=2$. Our results give robust evidence that small, but nontrivial, quantum advantages can be achieved in the context of CFD, and motivate the need for additional rigorous end-to-end quantum algorithm development.</description>

      <title>Applied Neural Network-Based Active Control for Vortex-Induced Vibrations Suppression in a Two-Degree-of-Freedom Cylinder</title>

Abstract: Vortex-Induced Vibrations (VIVs) of cylindrical structures present significant challenges in various engineering applications, including marine risers, tall buildings, and renewable energy systems. Hence, it is vital to control Vortex-Induced Vibrations of cylindrical structures. For this purpose, in this study a novel approach is introduced to VIV control, based on a model-based active control strategy integrated with a Neural Network (NN) in the presence of uncertainty modeling. The proposed method utilizes a closed-loop control system, where feedback from the system's dynamic state is used to generate adaptive control commands, enabling the system to respond to changing flow conditions and nonlinearities. Then, the controllability analysis is conducted to assess the efficiency of the control strategy in mitigating VIV. Two control approaches are implemented: simple learning and composite learning. Both strategies significantly enhance vibration suppression, achieving up to 99% reduction in vibrations despite uncertainties in the system. The results demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to enhance the efficiency, stability, and lifespan of structures subject to VIV.</description>

Abstract: Porous media are ubiquitous in energy storage and conversion, catalysis, biomechanics, hydrogeology, as well as many other fields. These materials possess high surface-to-volume ratios and their complex channels can restrict and guide the flow. However, optimizing design parameters for specific applications remains challenging due to the intricate structure of porous media. Pore-resolved CFD reveals the effects of their structure on flow characteristics, but is limited by the performance of mesh generation algorithms for such complex geometries. To alleviate this issue, we use a sharp immersed boundary method which enables usage of Cartesian, non-conformal grids, within a massively parallel finite element framework. This method preserves the order convergence of the scheme and allows for adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). We introduce a radial basis function-based representation of solids that allows to solve the flow through complex geometries with precision. We verify the method using the method of manufactured solutions. We validate it using pressure drop measurements through porous silicone monoliths digitized by X-ray computed microtomography, for pore Reynolds numbers up to 30. Simulations are conducted using grids of 200M cells distributed over 8k cores, which would require 16 times more cells without AMR. Results reveal that pore network structure is the principal factor describing pressure evolution and that preferential channels are dominant at this scale. In this work, we demonstrate a robust and efficient workflow for pore-resolved simulations of porous monoliths. This work bridges the gap between sub-millimetric flow and macroscopic properties, which will open the door to design and optimize processes through the usage of physics-based digital twins of complex porous media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13126v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating massively separated turbulent flows over bodies is one of the major applications for large-eddy simulation (LES). In the current work, we propose a machine-learning-based LES framework for the rapid simulation of turbulent flows over periodic hills using a hybrid U-Net and Fourier neural operator (HUFNO) framework. The newly proposed HUFNO model integrates the strengths of both the convolutional neural network (CNN) and Fourier neural operator (FNO) in a novel way that the FNO is applied in the periodic directions of the flow field while the non-periodicity is handled by the CNN-based U-Net framework. In the numerical tests, compared to the original FNO and the U-Net framework, the HUFNO model shows a higher accuracy in the predictions of the velocity field and Reynolds stresses. Further numerical experiments in the LES show that the HUFNO framework outperforms the traditional Smagorinsky (SMAG) model and the wall-adapted local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model in the predictions of the turbulence statistics, the energy spectrum, the invariant characteristics of velocity gradients, the wall stresses and the flow separation structures, with much lower computational cost. Importantly, the accuracy and efficiency are transferable to unseen initial conditions, Reynolds number and hill shapes, underscoring its great potentials for the fast prediction of strongly separated turbulent flows over curved boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence is a complex system exhibiting both universal statistical features and prominent coherent structures. We model turbulence using coherent vortices distributed within a multi-scale statistical framework, termed `woven turbulence'. These entangled vortices are generated based on fractional Brownian bridges, with scale-dependent parameters set by dimensional analysis and geometric similarity. By integrating statistical and structural modeling, our approach naturally captures both the universal statistical features of turbulence and its coherent vortex structures. The spatial filling fraction of vortices in woven turbulence, termed `vortex density', is tunable, enabling us to investigate the statistical-structural interaction and uncover two concise physical insights of turbulence. First, the invariance of the hierarchical vortex density across scales corresponds to Kolmogorov's $-5/3$ law in the inertial range. Second, there exists a critical total vortex density at which the intermittency of woven turbulence closely matches that of real turbulence, and this critical density converges to a finite value in the inviscid limit. Deviating from this critical density reveals a negative correlation between intermittency and total vortex density. In addition, woven turbulence also serves as a fast turbulence synthesis method, requiring only the Taylor-Reynolds number as input and exhibiting an extremely low computational cost proportional to the grid size. It generates instantaneous turbulent fields at Taylor-Reynolds numbers of order $10^3$ on $4096^3$ grid points, with computational cost over five orders of magnitude lower than that of direct numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Augmenting a pure and hybrid vertical equilibrium scheme via data-driven surrogate modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertical equilibrium (VE) models have been introduced as computationally efficient alternatives to traditional mass and momentum balance equations for fluid flow in porous media. Since VE models are only accurate in regions where phase equilibrium holds, while traditional simulations are computationally demanding, hybrid methods have been proposed to combine the accuracy of the full-dimensional approach with the efficiency of VE model. However, coupling both models introduces computational overhead that can make hybrid simulations slower than fully traditional ones. To address this, we introduce data-driven surrogates to predict the gas plume distance and coarse-level mobilities in the VE model, as well as predictors to accelerate the coupling scheme. We focus on surrogate models with short inference times to minimize computational overhead during frequent function calls. The proposed approach preserves key physical properties, such as mass conservation, while substantially reducing simulation runtimes. Overall, combining data-driven methods with the hybrid VE scheme yields an enhanced model that outperforms traditional simulations in speed while introducing only negligible errors.</description>

      <title>Cross-Field Interface-Aware Neural Operators for Multiphase Flow Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiphase flow simulation is critical in science and engineering but incurs high computational costs due to complex field discontinuities and the need for high-resolution numerical meshes. While Neural Operators (NOs) offer an efficient alternative for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), they struggle with two core challenges unique to multiphase systems: spectral bias caused by spatial heterogeneity at phase interfaces, and the persistent scarcity of expensive, high-resolution field data. This work introduces the Interface Information Aware Neural Operator (IANO), a novel architecture that mitigates these issues by leveraging readily obtainable interface data (e.g., topology and position). Interface data inherently contains the high-frequency features not only necessary to complement the physical field data, but also help with spectral bias. IANO incorporates an interface-aware function encoding mechanism to capture dynamic coupling, and a geometry-aware positional encoding method to enhance spatial fidelity for pointwise super-resolution. Empirical results across multiple multiphase flow cases demonstrate that IANO achieves significant accuracy improvements (up to $\sim$10\%) over existing NO baselines. Furthermore, IANO exhibits superior generalization capabilities in low-data and noisy settings, confirming its utility for practical, data-efficient $\text{AI}$-based multiphase flow simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework where the dissipative structures of turbulence emerge from microscopic path uncertainty. By modeling fluid parcels as stochastic tracers governed by the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) variational principle, we demonstrate that the Navier--Stokes viscous term is a natural linear, second-order macroscopic operator consistent with isotropic microscopic diffusion. We derive two foundational pillars of turbulence from this single principle. First, we show that the Kolmogorov scale $\eta \sim (\nu^3/\epsilon)^{1/4}$ is not merely a dimensional necessity but a geometric diffusion horizon: it is the scale at which the kinetic energy of a fractal trajectory, scaling as $k \sim \nu/\tau$, balances the macroscopic dissipation rate. Second, we show that the universal law of the wall is the stationary solution to this stochastic process under no-slip constraints. The logarithmic mean profile arises from the scale invariance of the turbulent diffusivity, while finite-Reynolds-number corrections emerge as controlled asymptotic expansions of the stochastic variance. This framework offers a physically grounded derivation of turbulent scaling laws that complements and extends purely phenomenological dimensional analysis.</description>

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach for solving complex fluid dynamics problems, yet their application to fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems with moving boundaries remains largely unexplored. This work addresses the critical challenge of modeling FSI systems with moving interfaces, where traditional unified PINN architectures struggle to capture the distinct physics governing fluid and structural domains simultaneously. We present an innovative Eulerian-Lagrangian PINN architecture that integrates immersed boundary method (IBM) principles to solve FSI problems with moving boundary conditions. Our approach fundamentally departs from conventional unified architectures by introducing domain-specific neural networks: an Eulerian network for fluid dynamics and a Lagrangian network for structural interfaces, coupled through physics-based constraints. Additionally, we incorporate learnable B-spline activation functions with SiLU to capture both localized high-gradient features near interfaces and global flow patterns. Empirical studies on a 2D cavity flow problem involving a moving solid structure show that while baseline unified PINNs achieve reasonable velocity predictions, they suffer from substantial pressure errors (12.9%) in structural regions. Our Eulerian-Lagrangian architecture with learnable activations (EL-L) achieves better performance across all metrics, improving accuracy by 24.1-91.4% and particularly reducing pressure errors from 12.9% to 2.39%. These results demonstrate that domain decomposition aligned with physical principles, combined with locality-aware activation functions, is essential for accurate FSI modeling within the PINN framework.</description>

      <title>Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Topological Gas Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01884v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a thermodynamic phase transition in chiral active matter. Low-frequency disorder triggers global synchronisation and energy dissipation, while high disorder activates a topological heat pump, generating an inverse energy cascade. This drives the system towards an Onsager dipole, which can be arrested into a metastable vortex glass if dispersion is insufficient to overcome the defect lattice. We propose topological gas dynamics as a universality class governed by the interplay of active disorder and topological sorting, unifying active swarms and classical inviscid fluids.</description>
