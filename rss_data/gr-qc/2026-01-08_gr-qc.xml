      <title>Reconstructing Minkowski geometry from causal separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aleksandrov, and then Zeeman, showed that the causal relations among the set of points in a Minkowski space of dimension greater than 2 determine the Minkowski space structure of the set up to a global conformal factor. We show that in any dimension the distances between causally related pairs of points determine the distances between spatially related pairs of points, and thus completely determine the Minkowski space structure of the set. This is a step in the direction of proving that causal sets arising from a Poisson process in a Lorentzian manifold determine that manifold up to the degree of approximation inherent in the intensity of the Poisson process -- the Hauptvermutung of causal set theory.</description>

      <title>From Loop Quantum Gravity to a Theory of Everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Witten described how a path integral quantization of Wilson Loop observables will define Jones polynomial type of link invariants, using the Chern-Simons gauge theory in $\mathbb{R}^3$. In this gauge theory, a compact Lie group ${\rm G}$, together with a representation of its Lie Algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, describe the symmetry group and fundamental forces acting on the particles respectively. However, it appears that this theory might be part of a bigger theory.
  We will incorporate this theory into the Einstein-Hilbert theory, which when reformulated and quantized using a ${\rm SU}(2) \times {\rm SU}(2)$ gauge group, gives us a quantized theory of gravity in $\mathbb{R}^4$. In this theory, we can quantize area, volume and curvature into quantum operators. By using both the Chern-Simons and Einstein-Hilbert action, we will write down a path integral expression, and compute the Wilson Loop observable for a time-like hyperlink in $\mathbb{R}^4$, each component loop is coloured with a representation for the Lie Algebra $\mathfrak{g} \times [\mathfrak{su}(2) \times \mathfrak{su}(2)]$, unifying the fundamental forces with gravity. This Wilson Loop observable can be computed using link diagrams, and it can be written as a state model, satisfying a Homfly-type skein relations.
  We will show that the Wilson Loop observable remains an eigenstate for the quantum operators corresponding to spin curvature, but it is not an eigenstate for the area and volume quantized operators, unless the representation for $\mathfrak{g}$ is trivial. This implies that in the Planck scale where quantum gravity is important, we see that all the particles are indistinguishable, hence the fundamental forces disappear and only interaction between matter and space-time remains.</description>

      <title>Cosmologically Coupled Black Holes with Regular Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the most general and exact solution of Einstein's gravity sourced by an anisotropic fluid describing the cosmological embedding (CE) of a static and spherically-symmetric object, including black holes (BHs) or exotic compact objects, without radial energy influx and in an arbitrary Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology. This is done fully considering backreaction of the local geometry on the cosmological dynamics. Our solution is free of curvature singularities at the would-be BH event horizon, thus solving a main issue of the CE of BH solutions proposed so far. As a byproduct, we derive a new CE of the Schwarzschild BH - distinct from McVitties's original proposal - that is regular everywhere except at the central singularity.</description>

      <title>Fast frequency-domain phenomenological modeling of eccentric aligned-spin binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the IMRPhenomXE frequency-domain phenomenological waveform model for the dominant mode of inspiral-merger-ringdown non-precessing binary black holes in elliptical orbits. IMRPhenomXE extends the quasi-circular IMRPhenomXAS waveform model for the dominant $(\ell, |m|) =$ (2,2) modes to eccentric binaries. For the inspiral part, orbit-averaged equations of motion within the quasi-Keplerian parametrization up to third post-Newtonian order, including spin effects, are evolved, and the waveform modes are computed using the stationary phase approximation on eccentricity expanded expressions up to $\mathcal{O}(e^{12})$. The model assumes circularization at merger-ringdown, where it adopts the underlying quasicircular IMRPhenomXAS baseline. We show that IMRPhenomXE reduces to the accurate IMPhenomXAS model in the quasi-circular limit. Compared against 186 public numerical relativity waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog with initial eccentricities up to $~0.8$, IMRPhenomXE provides values of unfaithfulness below $3\%$ for $72\%$ of simulations with initial eccentricities below 0.4. For larger eccentricities, the unfaithfulness degrades up to $\gtrsim 10\%$ due to the underlying small eccentricity expansions and additional modelling approximations. In terms of speed, IMRPhenomXE outperforms any of the existing inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric waveform models. We demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and modularity of IMRPhenomXE through injections into zero noise and parameter-estimation analyses of gravitational-wave events, showing that IMRPhenomXE is a ready-to-use waveform model for gravitational-wave astronomy in the era of rapidly growing event catalogs.</description>

      <title>Probing beyond-vacuum general relativistic effects with extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) as probes of beyond-vacuum general relativistic effects, accounting for both astrophysical environments and scalar Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) gravity. In beyond-vacuum scenarios, the evolution of an EMRI immersed in a cold dark matter environment modifies the gravitational wave flux and introduces additional dissipative effects such as dynamical friction. In parallel, in the beyond-general relativistic settings such as in sGB gravity, the inspiraling object carries an effective scalar charge and emits scalar radiation. Both environmental and modified-gravity effects modify the flux-balance law, thereby inducing changes in the EMRI dynamics. Using a two-timescale analysis within the fixed-frequency formalism, we compute leading-order corrections to the energy fluxes for quasi-circular, equatorial orbits in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes and construct the corresponding gravitational waveforms, which are used to quantify the accumulated gravitational wave dephasing and waveform mismatch relative to the vacuum general relativistic case. We further perform the Fisher Information Matrix analysis to estimate parameter correlations and the ability of future space-based detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) to disentangle environmental and modified gravity effects. Our results show that both dark matter and scalar field effects can leave measurable imprints on EMRI waveforms and that a consistent beyond-vacuum treatment is essential for robust tests of gravity.</description>

      <title>Superradiant scattering by rotating black-bounce black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate superradiant scattering off a rotating regular black hole described by a black-bounce metric which generalizes the Kerr spacetime of mass $M$ and specific angular momentum $a$ through a regularization parameter $p$ and two deformation exponents $(k,n)$. Focusing on massless $(\ell,m)=(1,1)$ scalar modes, we explore the parameter space and compute amplification factors by numerically integrating the separated radial Klein-Gordon equation. We track the peak amplification and the corresponding frequency across the $(a/M,p/M)$ parameter space for several combinations of $k$ and $n$. We find that increasing $n$ systematically enhances superradiance, whereas increasing $k$ tends to suppress it. In particular, certain configurations yield amplification levels up to 98% larger than the maximum amplification for standard Kerr black holes.</description>

      <title>Constraining Lorentz and parity violations in gravity with multiband gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study evaluates the capability of future multi-band observations of gravitational waves emitted from binary black hole coalescences, utilizing joint third-generation ground-based (CE, ET) and space-based (LISA, Taiji, TianQin) detector networks, to constrain parity and Lorentz symmetry violations in the gravitational sector. We model these effects through a parameterized waveform framework that incorporates a set of parameters that quantify potential deviations from general relativity. The frequency-dependence of their effects is described by power-law indices $\beta$ (i.e., $\beta_{\bar \nu}$, $\beta_{\bar \mu}$, $\beta_{\nu}$, and $\beta_{\mu}$). By analyzing events such as a high-signal noise ratio (SNR) "golden event" like GW250114 and a massive binary system like GW231123 (total mass $190-265 M_\odot$) using two networks of ground- and space-based detectors, we demonstrate that multi-band observations can significantly improve the current constraints on Lorentz and parity violations by several order of magnitude, for both high-frequency ($\beta &gt; 0$) and low-frequency ($\beta &lt; 0$) modifications. Our Bayesian analysis reveals that while the exceptional SNR of the GW250114-like event yields superior constraints for high-frequency modifications ($\beta &gt; 0$), the massive nature of GW231123 provides more stringent limits for low-frequency effects ($\beta &lt; 0$). This work highlights the critical value of future multi-band gravitational wave astronomy for conducting precision tests of general relativity across diverse binary populations.</description>

      <title>Limits on the mass of compact objects in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that there exist theoretical limits on the mass of compact objects in general relativity. One is the Buchdahl limit for an object with an arbitrary equation-of-state that turns out to be the limit for an object with uniform density. Another one is the causal limit that is stronger than the Buchdahl limit and is related to the speed of sound inside an object. Similar theoretical limits on the mass of compact objects in deformed Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz (HL) gravity are found in this \paper. Interestingly, the both curves of the uniform density limit and the sound speed limit meet the horizon curve at the minimum of the horizon, where a black hole becomes extremal, i.e., $M=q$, considering the Kehagias-Sfetsos vacuum that is an asymptotic flat solution in the HL gravity.</description>

      <title>Motions of spinning particles and chaos bound in Reissner-Nordstr\"om spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03751v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate Lyapunov exponents of classical chaos of spinning particles orbiting a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole and examine whether the values of the exponents exceed the chaos bound. For the neutral particle, when its spin magnitude surpasses a specific threshold, the value of the exponent exceeds the surface gravity, resulting in a violation. Given a fixed total angular momentum of the particle, its spin direction opposite to the angular momentum direction leads to a greater exponent value than when the two directions are aligned. For the charged particle, taking into account the influence of the electromagnetic force, we find that, for relatively large angular momenta, although the electromagnetic force does not change the trend of the exponent's variation with respect to spin and angular momentum and only modifies the specific values of the exponent, it still leads to violations of the bound. Therefore, the chaos bound is violated in the spinor field.</description>

      <title>Combining simulation-based inference and universal relations for precise and accurate neutron star science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach for identifying, constructing, and validating precise and accurate universal relations for neutron star bulk quantities. A central element is simulation-based inference (SBI), which we adopt to treat uncertainties due to the unknown nuclear equation of state (EOS) as intrinsic non-trivial noise. By assembling a large set of bulk properties of non-rotating neutron stars across multiple state-of-the-art EOS models, we are able to systematically explore universal relations in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our framework further identifies the most promising parameter combinations, enabling a more focused and traditional construction of explicit universal relations. At the same time, SBI does not rely on explicit relations; instead, it directly provides predictive distributions together with a quantitative measure of systematic uncertainties, which are not captured by conventional approaches. As an example, we report a new universal relation that allows us to obtain the radius as a function of mass, fundamental mode, and one pressure mode. Our analysis shows that SBI can surpass the predictive power of this universal relation while also mitigating systematic errors. Finally, we demonstrate how universal relations can be further calibrated to mitigate systematic errors accurately.</description>

      <title>Observational Signatures of Accretion Disks around a Schwarzschild Black Hole in a Hernquist Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how a Hernquist type dark matter (DM) halo, parametrized by its core radius $r_{s}$ and central density $\rho_{s}$, influences both the gravitational wave (GW) emission from timelike periodic orbits and the electromagnetic appearance of a thin accretion disk around a Schwarzschild black hole (BH). By analyzing the effective potential for timelike geodesics, we show that the DM halo shifts the marginally bound orbit (MBO) and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) outward, reflecting its modification of the spacetime geometry and the energy-angular momentum structure of particle motion. Employing a semi-analytical method, we compute orbital trajectories and the associated GW waveforms, revealing that the DM halo alters the characteristic zoom-whirl dynamics and induces measurable changes in waveform morphology. Furthermore, we generate direct and secondary images of the accretion disk across various observer inclinations and find that increasing $r_{s}$ or $\rho_{s}$ results in cooler, dimmer disks with modified flux distributions. Our results demonstrate that the presence of a DM halo imprints distinct signatures in both gravitational and electromagnetic observables, offering a multimessenger pathway to probe DM environments near BHs.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of cosmological perturbations: The residual low multipole ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cosmology, long-wavelength modes are related to large-gauge transformations (LGT), i.e. changes of coordinates that modify the physical geometry of the cosmological patch. These LGTs stand as bona-fide symmetries of cosmological perturbation theory with various applications, from consistency relations constraining cosmological correlators to non-linear conservation laws in the separate-universe approach. In this work, we revisit LGTs and derive two new results. First, we show that the global symmetries already identified in the literature can be extended to local infinite-dimensional symmetries. The associated generators depend on arbitrary functions of time, and generate low-multipole modes that modify the mean curvature energy and the angular momentum of the patch, demonstrating their physical nature. We propose to interpret these low-multipole soft modes as a new cosmological-frame ambiguity that needs to be fixed prior to evaluating cosmological observables. Second, we demonstrate that the adiabatic cosmological perturbations generated by LGTs deform but preserve all the explicit and hidden Killing symmetries of the background geometry. As such, long-wavelength modes stand as a concrete example of algebraically-special cosmological perturbations of Petrov-type O, and inherit the conformal group as isometries and a set of four deformed Killing-Yano tensors and their associated Killing tensors. This opens the possibility to study their effect on cosmological observables in a fully analytic manner.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating Dark Photon Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for the generation of gravitationally bound dark photon halos during the matter-dominated era. Coupled to an ultralight axion field through a parity-violating Chern-Simons term, dark photons can be produced by the tachyonic instability of axion coherent oscillation. The dark photons with a net helicity lead to a metric vorticity and can generate chiral substructures. For axion masses in the range $10^{-28} \, \mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-22} \, \mathrm{eV}$, the resulting inhomogeneities collapse to form halos with masses spanning $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$ to $10^{11} \, M_{\odot}$, with halo sizes ranging from $O(1)$ to $O(10^{6}) \, \mathrm{pc}$. During halo collapse, the induced vorticity could mediate efficient angular-momentum transport, which enables monolithic collapse and provides primordial seeds for the early formation of supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to global visibility of singularities in asymptotically flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an $(N+1)$-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetime and a future-directed, affinely parametrized outgoing null generator $\gamma$ of an achronal boundary $\partial J^+(S_\varepsilon)$, where $\{S_\varepsilon\}$ is a nested family of smooth compact codimension $2$ surfaces approaching a singular boundary set $S$ in the past. In the twist-free case and under the null energy condition, the Raychaudhuri equation on the $m:=N-1$ dimensional screen bundle reads, $$ \theta'=-\frac1m\theta^2-\|\sigma\|^2-\mathrm{Ric}(k,k), $$ where $k$ is the tangent to $\gamma$. This equation linearizes, via the rescaling $u:=A^{1/m}$ with $A := |\det D|$ the Jacobi-map $m$-volume, to the Sturm-type ODE $$ u''+\frac1m f\,u=0,\qquad f:=\|\sigma\|^2+\mathrm{Ric}(k,k)\ge 0. $$ We develop two purely generator-wise criteria forcing a first zero of $u$: (i) an exact Volterra identity combined with concavity leads to a barrier-weighted integral inequality, and (ii) Sturm comparison and a Pr\"ufer-angle estimate yields failure of disconjugacy whenever $\int_c^d \sqrt{f/m}\,d\lambda&gt;\pi$ on a subinterval. We prove that $u(\lambda_\ast)=0$ is equivalent to the existence of a focal (conjugate) point and implies $\theta= m u'/u\to-\infty$ at $\lambda_\ast$. Using the standard structure of achronal boundaries, this yields a geodesic-wise obstruction: if every generator that could reach $\mathscr I^+$ satisfies one of the above conditions in the regular spacetime region, then $J^+(S_\varepsilon)\cap \mathscr I^+=\emptyset$, and hence $S$ is not globally visible. As an application, we illustrate one of these criteria in the Einstein-massless scalar field collapse model of Christodoulou.</description>

      <title>A framework for LISA population inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04168v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to have a source rich data stream containing signals from large numbers of many different types of source. This will include both individually resolvable signals and overlapping stochastic backgrounds, a regime intermediate between current ground-based detectors and pulsar timing arrays. The resolved sources and backgrounds will be fitted together in a high dimensional Global Fit. To extract information about the astrophysical populations to which the sources belong, we need to decode the information in the Global Fit, which requires new methodology that has not been required for the analysis of current gravitational wave detectors. Here, we %start that development, presenting present a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the properties of astrophysical populations directly from the output of a LISA Global Fit, consistently accounting for information encoded in both the resolved sources and the unresolved background. Using a simplified model of the Global Fit, we illustrate how the interplay between resolved and unresolved components affects population inference and highlight the impact of data analysis choices, such as the signal-to-noise threshold for resolved sources, on the results. Our approach provides a practical foundation for population inference using LISA data.</description>

      <title>Late-time Background Constraints on Linear and Non-linear Interacting Dark Energy after DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present observational constraints on a class of phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) models that admit analytical solutions for the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. We consider a set of five linear and three non-linear IDE scenarios, encompassing both interactions proportional to the dark matter and/or dark energy densities, as well as non-linear combinations of the two. For all eight IDE models, we find a better fit than $\Lambda$CDM from a $\Delta\chi^2$ analysis for both combinations of datasets considered. When using the Akaike Information Criterion ($\Delta$AIC), we find a similarly improved fit in all cases, except for one dataset combination in $Q=3H\delta\rho_{\rm de}$. Our analysis also shows a preference for sign-switching interactions, with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter at low redshift, reversing direction at higher redshift. These results should be interpreted with caution, as the latter direction of energy transfer is accompanied by negative dark energy densities in the past, which may be unphysical. Models that do not allow sign-changing behaviour instead show a preference for energy flow from dark matter to dark energy, and hence negative dark energy densities. The only exceptions are $Q=3H\delta\rho_{\rm de}$ and $Q=3H\delta\left(\tfrac{\rho_{\rm de}^2}{\rho_{\rm dm}+\rho_{\rm de}}\right)$, which exhibit energy flow in the opposite direction. Furthermore, for all interactions considered, we find a phantom-divide crossing in the effective dark energy equation of state $w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}$, with the dark energy density decreasing ($w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}&gt;-1$) at present and at low redshift, while increasing ($w^{\rm eff}_{\rm de}&lt;-1$) in the past at high redshift. These results highlight the promising, but problematic, nature of dark sector interactions, as well as the need to extend the analysis using early-time physics and datasets.</description>

      <title>Cavity Multimodes as an Array for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave cavities operated in the presence of a background magnetic field provide a promising avenue for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs). We demonstrate for the first time that the distinct antenna patterns of multiple electromagnetic modes within a single cavity enable localization and reconstruction of key properties of an incoming HFGW signal, including its polarization ratio and frequency drift rate. Using a 9-cell cavity commonly employed in particle accelerators as a representative example, we analyze the time-domain response of 18 nearly degenerate modes, which can be sequentially excited by a frequency-drifting signal. The sensitivity is further enhanced by the number of available modes, in close analogy to the scaling achieved by a network of independent detectors, enabling sensitivity to astrophysically plausible binary sources.</description>

      <title>Curvatures and Non-metricities in the Non-Relativistic Limit of Bosonic Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a diffeomorphism-covariant formulation of the non-relativistic (NR) limit of bosonic supergravity. This formulation is particularly useful for decomposing relativistic tensors, such as powers of the Riemann tensor, in a manifest covariant form with respect to the NR degrees of freedom. The construction is purely geometrical and is based on a torsionless connection. The non-metricities are associated with the gravitational fields of the theory, $\tau_{\mu\nu}, h_{\mu\nu}, \tau^{\mu\nu}$ and $h^{\mu\nu}$, and are fixed by requiring compatibility with the relativistic metric. We provide a fully covariant decomposition of the relativistic Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, and scalar curvature. Our results establish an equivalence between the proposed construction and the intrinsic torsion framework of string Newton-Cartan geometry. We also discuss potential applications, including a manifestly diffeomorphism-covariant rewriting of the two-derivative finite bosonic supergravity Lagrangian under the NR limit, a powerful simplification in deriving bosonic $\alpha'$-corrections under the same limit, and extensions to more general $f(R,Q)$ Newton-Cartan geometries.</description>

      <title>Mind the peak: improving cosmological constraints from GWTC-4.0 spectral sirens using semiparametric mass models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave spectral sirens can provide cosmological constraints by using the shape of the binary black hole (BBH) mass distribution (MD). However, the precision and accuracy of these constraints depends critically on the capturing all the MD features. In this work, we analyze 137 BBH events from the latest GWTC-4.0 with a novel data-driven semiparametric approach based on \textsc{Bspline} that adaptively places knots around the most informative structures in the MD, while keeping the dimensionality of the parameter space moderate. Our flexible models resolve three distinct peaks at $\sim10$, $18$, and $33\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and are statistically preferred over standard parametric models, with Bayes factors up to 226. Because these features are correlated with $H_0$, the semiparametric model yields, under different prior assumptions, 12%-21% improvement in the precision of $H_0$ relative to parametric models, providing $H_0 = 57.8^{+21.9}_{-20.6}\,\mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ in the best case. Our results demonstrate that capturing the full complexity of the BBH mass distribution is essential for realizing the cosmological potential of spectral sirens as gravitational wave catalogs continue to grow.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamics at null infinity. Part 1: Dual Generalized Second Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized second law (GSL) of black hole thermodynamics asserts the monotonic increase of the generalized entropy combining the black hole area and the entropy of quantum fields outside the horizon. Modern proofs of the GSL rely on information theoretic methods and are typically formulated using algebras of observables defined on the event horizon together with a vacuum state invariant under horizon symmetries, inducing a geometric modular flow. In this work, we formulate a dual version of the generalized second law from the perspective of asymptotic observers at future null infinity, who do not have access to the black hole area. Our approach exploits the dependence of the second law on the choice of algebra of observables and of a reference state invariant under suitable symmetries, in close analogy with open quantum thermodynamics. Using algebraic quantum field theory and modular theory, we analyze several physically motivated vacuum states, including the Hartle Hawking state and two classes of regularized vacua. We show that, at null infinity, the monotonic quantity governing an irreversible evolution is no longer the generalized entropy, but rather a thermodynamic potential constructed from asymptotic observables. Depending on the chosen vacuum, this potential takes the form of the free energy or of a generalized grand potential built from the Bondi mass and additional (angular) mode dependent chemical potentials. The resulting inequalities define a dual generalized second law at future null infinity, which can be consistently combined with the standard GSL involving variations of the black hole area.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamics at null infinity. Part 2: Open systems, Markovian dynamics and work extraction from non-rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole thermodynamics provides a unique setting in which general relativity, quantum field theory, and statistical mechanics converge. In semiclassical gravity, this interplay culminates in the generalized second law (GSL), whose modern proofs rely on information theoretic techniques applied to algebras of observables defined on null hypersurfaces. These proofs exhibit close structural parallels with the thermodynamics of open quantum systems governed by Markovian dynamics. In this work, we draw parallels between the dynamics of quantum fields in regions bounded by non expanding causal horizons and the thermodynamics of quantum systems weakly coupled to equilibrium reservoirs. We introduce a dictionary relating late time boundary conditions to the choice of reservoir, vacuum states to fixed points of the dynamics, and modular Hamiltonians to thermodynamic potentials. Building on results from a companion paper on dual generalized second laws at future null infinity, we show that additional terms appearing in the associated thermodynamic potentials admit a natural interpretation as work contributions. We demonstrate that certain non thermal vacuum states at null infinity allow for the operation of autonomous thermal engines and enable work extraction from the radiation. Extending the analysis to the Unruh vacuum in Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds, we obtain generalized grand potential type laws incorporating grey body effects and angular momentum fluxes. Altogether, our results clarify the thermodynamic description of black hole dynamics and place it within the broader framework of open quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>The steep redshift evolution of the hierarchical merger rate may cause the $z$-$\chi_{\rm eff}$ correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is growing evidence from gravitational-wave observations that some merging black holes are created from previous mergers. Using the prediction that these hierarchically-merged black holes have dimensionless spin magnitudes of $\chi \approx 0.69$, we identify a subpopulation in the gravitational-wave data consistent with a hierarchical-merger origin in dense star clusters. This subpopulation's primary mass distribution peaks at $16.7^{+3.1}_{-4.6},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, which is approximately twice as large as its secondary mass distribution's mode ($8.0^{+29.7}_{-2.3},\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and its spin tilt distribution is consistent with isotropy. Our inferred secondary mass distributions imply that isolated binary evolution may still be needed to explain the entirety of the $9\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ peak. Surprisingly, we find that the rate of hierarchical mergers may evolve more steeply with redshift than the rest of the population ($98.5\%$ credibility): the fraction of all binary black holes that are hierarchically formed at $z=0.1$ is $0.05^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$, compared to $0.17^{+0.13}_{-0.12}$ at $z=1$. This provides an explanation for the previously-discovered broadening of the effective spin distribution with redshift. Our results have implications for star cluster formation histories, as they suggest the potential existence of a high-redshift population of massive, compact clusters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regardless of their initial spins, the merger of two roughly equal mass black holes (BHs) produces a remnant BH of dimensionless spin $0.69$. Such remnants can merge with other black holes in dense stellar environments and produce hierarchical mergers. Analyzing the latest catalog binary black hole (BBH) mergers from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detectors, we identify a subpopulation with primary spins consistent with such hierarchical mergers. Consistent with astrophysical expectations for mergers of second generation BHs with first generation BHs, we find that this subpopulation has mass ratios below $0.59^{+0.18}_{-0.23}$. We also infer that $19$-$88\%$ of the BBH population below this mass ratio is consistent with belonging to the hierarchically-merged population. Our results offer a natural explanation for the narrowing of the effective inspiral spin distribution with mass ratio observed in other studies.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (deBroglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance of the quantum state in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\"odinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.</description>

      <title>Real-time Gravitational Wave Response in Thermal Spinning fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the spin content of the thermal plasmas affects the propagation of gravitational waves in a radiation-dominated universe. As a simple but representative setup, we consider conformal scalar, Weyl fermion, and Maxwell fields that provide the background radiation, and we ask whether the resulting damping and phase shift of gravitational waves retain any memory of their spins. We revisit this question in a real-time quantum-field-theoretic framework, where the stress tensor splits into a background part, a dynamical (history-dependent) response, and local contact terms, with an additional on-shell projection fixed by the Friedmann equation. We find that the dynamical spin-dependent response arises on a short time scale characterized by the radiation temperature, which is exactly canceled by the local responses. As a result, the remaining long-time response is universal and consistent with kinetic theory in the hard thermal limit. Although the underlying mechanism exhibits strong spin dependence, it leaves no observable imprint on the large-scale effective dynamics of gravitational waves in this setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Chern-Simons-like formulation of 3D MMG-like massive gravity models that are "third-way consistent". Building on previous work on exotic massive gravities, we analyze a class of MMG-like theories characterized by a specific parity structure and an auxiliary field hierarchy. Focusing on the simplest non-trivial case, we solve the full set of field equations, determine the AdS background solutions, compute the central charges of the dual CFT, and perform a linearized analysis to obtain the mass spectrum. Along the chiral line, the linearized mass operator develops a rank-2 Jordan block, signaling logarithmic behavior of massive modes in the dual two-dimensional CFT. At a special degenerate point, this structure is enhanced to a rank-3 Jordan block, giving rise to two logarithmic partners and an ultra-logarithmic sector in the boundary theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Freelance holography program is an extension of gauge/gravity correspondence, where the gravity theory is defined on a portion of AdS with an arbitrary timelike boundary, with any desired boundary conditions. It is also known that gauge/gravity correspondence admits a fluid/gravity correspondence limit, where the gauge theory side is well described by a fluid. In this work, combining the two, we work through ``freelance fluid/gravity''. In particular, we study in detail the 2d fluid (3d Einstein gravity) case, where one has a good analytical control over the bulk equations due to their integrability and absence of viscosity in the 2d fluid. We study consistency and validity requirements for the freelance fluid/gravity and how the fluid changes along the renormalization group (RG) flow. We prove the $v_g$-theorem, stating that the group velocity of fluid waves $v_g$ is a decreasing function as we move toward the infrared region along the RG flow, regardless of the adopted boundary conditions. We also study examples of holographic fluid with various asymptotic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>From Penrose to Melrose: Computing Scattering Amplitudes at Infinity for Unbounded Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a method to compute scattering amplitudes for the Helmholtz equation in variable, unbounded media with possibly long-range asymptotics. Combining Penrose's conformal compactification and Melrose's geometric scattering theory, we formulate the time-harmonic scattering problem on a compactified manifold with boundary and construct a two-step solver for scattering amplitudes at infinity. The construction is asymptotic: it treats a neighborhood of infinity, and is meant to couple to interior solvers via domain decomposition. The method provides far-field data without relying on explicit solutions or Green's function representation. Scattering in variable media is treated in a unified framework where both the incident and scattered fields solve the same background Helmholtz operator. Numerical experiments for constant, short-range, and long-range media with single-mode and Gaussian beam incidence demonstrate spectral convergence of the computed scattering amplitudes in all cases.</description>

      <title>Effect of accretion on scalar superradiant instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superradiance can lead to the formation of a black hole (BH) condensate system. We thoroughly investigate the accretion effect on the evolution of this system, and the gravitational wave signals it emits in the presence of multiple superradiance modes. Assuming the multiplication of the BH mass and scalar mass as a small number, we obtain the analytical approximations of all important quantities, which can be directly applied to phenomenological studies. In addition, we confirm that accretion could significantly enhance the gravitational wave (GW) emission and reduce its duration, and show that the GW beat signature is similarly modified.</description>

      <title>Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit for static and axisymmetric spacetimes: local curvature, matter fields, and quasinormal modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the deflection of photons in the strong deflection limit within static and axisymmetric spacetimes possessing reflection symmetry. As the impact parameter approaches its critical value, the deflection angle exhibits a logarithmic divergence. This divergence is characterized by a logarithmic coefficient and a constant offset, which we express in terms of the coordinate-invariant curvature quantities evaluated at the unstable circular photon orbit. The curvature contribution is encoded in the electric part of the Weyl tensor, reflecting tidal effects, and the matter contribution is encoded in the Einstein tensor, capturing the influence of local energy and pressure. We also express these coefficients using the Newman--Penrose scalars. By exploiting the relationship between the strong deflection limit and the quasinormal modes, we derive a new expression for the quasinormal mode frequency in the eikonal limit in terms of the curvature scalars. Our results provide a unified and coordinate-invariant framework that connects observable lensing features and quasinormal modes to the local geometry and matter distribution near compact objects.</description>

      <title>Corrections of the GR eikonal limit by a class of renormalizable gravity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, the scattering between a light scalar particle $\phi$ and a heavy scalar $\sigma$ in the eikonal limit is considered, for gravity scenarios containing higher order derivatives, such as the ones studied in \cite{stelle1}-\cite{modesto4}. It is suggested that if one of the new gravity scales introduced in the higher order action is smaller than the Planck mass, for instance of the order of $M_{GUT}\sim 10^{15}$ GeV, the functional form of the GR eikonal formulas appears changed by a factor. However, in this situation, the conditions for the eikonal approximation to hold has to be revised, this issue is analyzed in the text. The statements of the present work should be taken with a grain of salt, as the Schwarzschild radius for these polynomials theories is not yet established. The results presented here, in our opinion, are in agreement with the suppression of corrections to GR pointed out in \cite{brandhuber}, \cite{fradkin} and \cite{deser} for the Stelle gravity. The next to leading order approximation and part of the seagull diagrams are estimated. Different to the GR case, this order generically is non vanishing. An explicit regularization scheme is presented, based on Riesz and Hadamard procedures. The need of a regularization is partially expected, as the inclusion of small energy fluctuations may spoil the eikonal approximation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Equilibrium with Steady Flow and Relativistic Local Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with steady flow as well as spherical symmetry is discovered. The energy-momentum tensor contains the contribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an off-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The presence of the off-diagonal component of the metric implies the radial motion of the reference frame, which gives rise to a problem how the relativistic effect is included in thermodynamic observables for such a general relativistic system. This problem is solved by taking an instantaneously rest frame in which geometric thermodynamic observables read as previously and giving them the special relativistic effect emerged from the inverse transformation to the original frame pointwise. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with the laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. Finally the relativistic structure equations for the equilibrium are derived, from which the general relativistic Poisson equation as well as the heat conduction one are developed exactly.</description>

      <title>Stability and collisions of excited spherical boson stars: glimpses of chains and rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar, spherically symmetric, radially excited boson stars were previously shown to be stabilized, against spherical dynamics, by sufficiently strong self-interactions. Here, we further test their stability now in a full 3+1D evolution. We show that the stable stars in the former case become afflicted by a non-spherical instability. Then, we perform head-on collisions of both (stable) fundamental and (sufficiently long-lived) excited boson stars. Depending on the stars chosen, either a black hole or a bosonic remnant are possible. In particular, collisions of excited stars result in a bosonic bound state which resembles a dynamical superposition of chains and rings, akin to the ones found as equilibrium solutions in Liang:2025myf. These evolutions emphasize a key difference concerning the dynamical robustness of fundamental vs. excited spherical boson stars, when generic (beyond spherical) dynamics is considered.</description>

      <title>Dimension of the isometry group in type N vacuum solutions: an IDEAL approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The necessary and sufficient conditions for a type N vacuum solution (with cosmological constant) to admit a group of isometries of dimension $r$ are given in terms of the invariant concomitants of the Weyl tensor. This study requires defining several invariant classes, and for each class, the conditions that determine the dimension are given. Thus, an IDEAL (Intrinsic, Deductive, Explicit and ALgorithmic) characterisation of these spacetimes follows. Some examples show that our algorithmic results can easily be implemented on the \textit{xAct Mathematica} suite of packages. The relation between our classes and already known families of solutions of Einstein equations is outlined.</description>

      <title>Optical appearance of Schwarzschild black holes with optically thin and thick accretion disks at various inclination angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the optical appearance of a Schwarzschild black hole illuminated by three geometrically thin accretion disk models under varying observational inclination angles. Based on the geometric relationship between the black hole and observer, we first divide the accretion disk into co-side and counter-side semi-disks. We then analyze light ray trajectories, and calculate the total number of orbits and transfer functions for both semi-disks. The results reveal distinct inclination-dependence of lensed regions on different semi-disks: as inclination increases, the lensed region contracts for the counter-side semi-disk while expanding for the co-side one. Furthermore, through explicit specification of the emission profiles of the three models, we present optical images for both optically thin and thick disk scenarios at different inclinations. The results demonstrate that: (i) the bright rings in all three models become progressively compressed and deviate from circularity as inclination increases; (ii) for thick disks, partial rings are obscured and the overall intensity is lower than thin disks. These results may advance our understanding of general black hole imaging processes and provide a new approach to test gravitational theories through optical morphology studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of three families of regular black holes, Hayward, Bardeen, and Ayon-Beato-Garc\'ia immersed in a Perfect Fluid Dark Matter (PFDM) background. Using both the sixth-order WKB approximation and the Asymptotic Iteration Method (AIM), we determine the corresponding quasi-normal modes and absorption cross sections. By fixing the horizon radius, we analyze the dependence of the parameters of the black holes and the parameter of PFDM. The computed quasi-normal modes confirm the dynamical stability of the black holes under scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Furthermore, both the real and imaginary parts of the quasi-normal modes increase with the multipole number $l$, corresponding to higher oscillation frequencies and faster damping rates. On the other hand, absorption cross sections are compared under similar parametric conditions. The results demonstrate that PFDM influences the dynamical properties of regular black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a new framework for non-linear perturbations of the Kerr spacetime. This is based on a characterization of the Kerr spacetime in terms of a Killing spinor. On the perturbed spacetime, one can construct an approximation of the Killing spinor. Based on this, a number of quantities are constructed measuring the deviation from Kerr. Evolution equations for these quantities are derived. Approximations of the Killing vectors, the mass and angular momentum parameters etc., are constructed along with a full set of equations for their derivatives. In this setting, we don't need a reference background solution. Instead, we covariantly construct the relevant structures on the perturbed spacetime itself. This can eliminate many issues and allow for a cleaner analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of an ultralight scalar or vector boson, a spinning black hole will be spun down through the superradiant instability. We use spin measurements from gravitational wave observations of binary black holes, in particular the heavy binary black hole merger event GW231123, along with the lower-mass GW190517 event, to constrain the existence of ultralight bosons. We disfavor scalars with masses in the range of $[0.55, 11]\times 10^{-13}$ eV and vectors in the range of $[0.11, 18]\times 10^{-13}$ eV, making only a conservative assumption that the black hole lifetimes are greater than $10^5$ years. The lower ends of these ranges, where the exclusion confidence is the highest, were not previously excluded by spin measurements from electromagnetic or gravitational wave observations. We map these constraints to axion and dark photon models with interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superradiance enables scalar fields to extract energy and angular momentum from a rotating black hole (BH), leading to the formation of a BH-condensate system. Previous studies mainly focus on the phase velocity, which propagates in the azimuthal direction. In this work, we show that the superradiant scalar condensate presents a nontrivial group velocity distribution. In the region sufficiently far from the BH, the condensate exhibits a radial velocity magnitude that approaches $ (r_g\mu/2) \sin (2\omega t-2 \varphi)$, while the polar and azimuthal velocity magnitudes asymptotically decline as $\propto 1/r$.</description>

      <title>GW200105: A detailed study of eccentricity in the neutron star-black hole binary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GW200105_162426 is the first neutron star-black hole merger to be confidently confirmed through either gravitational-wave or electromagnetic observations. Although initially analyzed after detection, the event has recently gained renewed attention following a study [Morras et al. arXiv:2503.15393] that employed a post-Newtonian inspiral-only waveform model and reported strong evidence for orbital eccentricity. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of GW200105 using state-of-the-art effective-one-body waveform models. Importantly, we present the first study of this event utilizing a physically complete model that incorporates both orbital eccentricity and spin precession across the full inspiral, merger, and ringdown stages, along with higher-order gravitational wave modes. Our results support the presence of eccentricity in the signal, with zero eccentricity excluded from the 99% credible interval, but yielding a mass ratio closer to the original LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA analysis, differing from the findings of [Morras et al. arXiv:2503.15393]. Additionally, similar to a previous eccentric-only analysis [de Lluc Planas et al. Astrophys. J. 995, 47 (2025).], we observe a multimodal structure in the eccentricity posterior distribution. We conduct targeted investigations to understand the origin of this multimodality and complement our analysis with numerical relativity simulations to examine how the inclusion of eccentricity impacts the merger dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One or two negative mass singularities are found to occur in static inhomogeneous spatially closed solutions to the Einstein equations. The singularities produce a positive Komar mass, and this decreases the size of the cosmological constant relative to normal matter. The energy density of a perfect fluid vanishes at the singularities and is finite elsewhere. Numerical examples of these static solutions are provided, and their stability properties are found to be similar to the Einstein static universe. In an expanding universe, the effect of the singularities is to push the acceleration towards more positive values. Given the sentiment that naked singularities are to be avoided, we review just how benign the negative mass singularity is.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In k-essence theories within general relativity, where the matter Lagrangian depends on a real scalar field $\phi$ and its kinetic term $X$, static and spherically symmetric compact objects with a positive-definite energy density cannot exist without introducing ghosts. We show that this no-go theorem can be evaded when the k-essence Lagrangian is extended to include a dependence on the field strength $F$ of a $U(1)$ gauge field, taking the general form ${\cal L}(\phi, X, F)$. In Einstein-scalar-Maxwell theories with a scalar-vector coupling $\mu(\phi) F$, we demonstrate the existence of asymptotically flat, charged compact stars whose energy density and pressure vanish at the center. With an appropriate choice of the coupling function $\mu(\phi)$, we construct both electric and magnetic compact objects and derive their metric functions and scalar- and vector-field profiles analytically. We compute their masses and radii, showing that the compactness lies in the range ${\cal O}(0.01)&lt;{\cal C}&lt;{\cal O}(0.1)$. A linear perturbation analysis reveals that electric compact objects are free of strong coupling, ghost, and Laplacian instabilities at all radii for $\mu(\phi)&gt;0$, while magnetic compact objects suffer from strong coupling near the center.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate, for the first time, that arbitrary spherically symmetric metrics can be derived within a framework based on the coupling of two scalar fields and an electromagnetic field. We then specialize to a class of non-stationary spacetimes characterized by analytically tractable global causal structure and trapping horizons, which is particularly suited for investigating black holes and wormholes. Within this framework, we find that the fate of spacetime can be categorized into three distinct classes: those without a globally trapped future; those without a globally trapped future but containing bounded, Cauchy-foliated trapped regions; and those with a future that becomes completely trapped. The evolution of a geometrically Schwarzschild-like black hole and a horizonless wormhole demonstrates these possible fates, thus revealing the globally trapped outcome as a novel theoretical possibility. Finally, we propose that a regular black hole may contain an Unattainable Minimal Throat -- a minimal-radius throat that is causally unreachable -- and refer to it henceforth as the Endless Throat.</description>

      <title>Quasitopological gravity and double-copy formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to the quasitopological theory of gravity based on a modified classical double--copy construction. Focusing on static, spherically symmetric configurations, we show that all vacuum solutions of $D$--dimensional quasitopological gravity can be obtained from an auxiliary non--linear electrodynamics defined in a flat $(D+1)$--dimensional spacetime. The gravitational field equations reduce to an algebraic relation between a primary curvature invariant and the electric field strength, while the remaining dynamics is governed by a Gauss--law constraint for a point--like charge in the auxiliary space. This correspondence provides a transparent interpretation of higher--curvature gravitational interactions in terms of non--linear gauge dynamics and explains the absence of higher--derivative terms in the reduced equations. As illustrative examples, we apply the formalism to Born--Infeld and Hayward--type models, obtaining higher--dimensional regular black--hole solutions with a de~Sitter--like core. Our results extend the scope of the double--copy paradigm beyond Einstein gravity and suggest a unifying framework for a broad class of higher--curvature theories.</description>

      <title>Revisiting particle circular orbits as probes of black hole thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies propose that black hole phase transitions can be encoded in the circular orbit radius of particles. In this paper, we systematically investigate the reliability of this encoding mechanism. We find that this mechanism is highly reliable in the isobaric ensemble, whereas it may break down in the isothermal ensemble. It turns out that the reliability of this mechanism is directly controlled by the first law of black hole thermodynamics. Interestingly, even if this encoding mechanism fails, we prove that, for any black hole exhibiting criticality, the first law can ensure that, near the critical point, the coexistence gap of the circular orbit radius remains a reliable order parameter and yields exactly the same critical exponents as the standard thermodynamic order parameter. Our results provide a potential way to identify the thermodynamic ensemble of a black hole, and reveal a deeper connection between gravitational geometry and thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Physical interpretation of spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions to Einstein's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein's equations of General Relativity form a highly nonlinear system, so most exact solutions rely on symmetry assumptions. Spherically symmetric spacetimes have been particularly important, providing a tractable yet physically rich setting. Despite extensive study, many open questions remain, especially regarding the physical interpretation of perfect fluid solutions. Many such solutions were derived without a specified equation of state or under restrictive or non-physical assumptions, limiting their physical relevance. The aim of this thesis is to study the physical viability of spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions, with extensions to plane and hyperbolic symmetries.
  The first part reviews the hydrodynamic approach, which interprets a perfect fluid energy-momentum tensor as a fluid in local thermal equilibrium. Interpretations as a generic ideal gas, a classical ideal gas, and fluids with transport coefficients are analysed. The framework is extended to the ultrarelativistic Synge gas, and methods to approximate its equation of state are developed.
  These results are applied to three families of solutions: T-models, geodesic R-models with flat synchronisation, and thermodynamic Stephani universes. For each family, general expressions for the fluid flow, energy density, pressure, speed of sound, and admissible thermodynamic schemes are obtained. Physical viability is assessed using standard energy, positivity, and compressibility conditions, with emphasis on compatibility with a generic ideal gas. In all cases, wide spacetime regions are found where the solutions represent physically admissible perfect fluids.
  The thesis concludes with xIdeal, a Mathematica package implementing IDEAL algorithms for the analysis of exact solutions, including spacetime characterisations, a metric database, and examples.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of periodic orbits and gravitational waves in a deformed Schwarzschild black hole spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate periodic orbits of test particles around a deformed Schwarzschild black hole and the resulting gravitational waves. Firstly, we examine the properties of circular orbits and find that circular orbits could disappear when the deformation is large enough. Then, using an orbital taxonomy, we characterize various periodic orbits with a set of triples, which describes the zoom-whirl behaviours. We also calculate the gravitational waveform signals generated by different periodic orbits, revealing the influence of the deformation on the gravitational wave, which can be potentially picked up by future space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Machian Gravity: Modeling Rotation Curves and Radial Acceleration in the SPARC Galaxy Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of Machian Gravity (MG), a five-dimensional theory of gravity, to explain the acceleration law governing rotationally bound systems, in particular spiral galaxies. MG was proposed as a framework capable of accounting for a range of astrophysical and cosmological phenomena -- including galactic rotation curves, mass distributions in galaxy clusters, and cosmic expansion -- without invoking additional dark components. In this study, we apply the MG acceleration law to a large sample of galaxies drawn from the SPARC database. Through a detailed analysis, we determine the optimal MG parameters for each individual galaxy, successfully fitting their observed rotation curves. Similar to Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), our results indicate the existence of a characteristic acceleration scale associated with galactic dynamics, which regulates rotational behavior in the outer regions. Notably, this acceleration scale varies from galaxy to galaxy, but typically remains of order $10^{-8} {\rm cm/s^2}$.</description>

      <title>Counterflow and coflow instabilities in miscible binary superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore instabilities in binary superfluids with a nonvanishing relative superflow, particularly focusing on counterflow and coflow instabilities. We extend recent results on the thermodynamic origin of finite superflow instabilities in single-component superfluids to binary systems and derive a criterion for the onset of instability through a hydrodynamic analysis, which applies to interacting many-body systems at finite temperature. We find that the onset of these instabilities is signaled by the determinant of the Hessian of the thermal free energy diverging and changing sign. We verify this hydrodynamic prediction in a holographic binary superfluid modeled with gauge/gravity duality, which naturally incorporates strong coupling, finite temperature, and dissipation. We also compare to results obtained using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation for weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensates and find that the same criterion continues to apply at zero temperature, where it reduces to evaluating derivatives of the supercurrents with respect to the superfluid velocities. We observe that the critical velocities of these instabilities follow a general scaling law related to the interaction strength between superfluid components. Finally, the nonlinear stages of the instabilities are studied by full time evolution using gauge/gravity duality, where vortex annihilation leads to a decrease of superfluid velocity back to a value where the binary superfluid phase is stable.</description>

      <title>Encrypted Qubits can be Cloned</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that encrypted cloning of unknown quantum states is possible. Any number of encrypted clones of a qubit can be created through a unitary transformation, and each of the encrypted clones can be decrypted through a unitary transformation. The decryption of an encrypted clone consumes the decryption key, i.e., only one decryption is possible, in agreement with the no-cloning theorem. Encrypted cloning represents a new paradigm that provides a form of redundancy, parallelism or scalability where direct duplication is forbidden by the no-cloning theorem. For example, a possible application of encrypted cloning is to enable encrypted quantum multi-cloud storage.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the BMS evolution equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects in asymptotically flat Einstein gravity follow from local Carroll, Weyl, and diffeomorphism invariance at the null conformal boundary, upon providing a minimalistic holographic dictionary as the sole input from the bulk. This result is a significant step in the quest for a flat-space holographic correspondence and offers a geometric implementation of the radiative degrees of freedom that source the boundary theory in the presence of bulk gravitational waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of statistical inhomogeneity and anisotropy in primordial scalar perturbations on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). Assuming inflationary quantum fluctuations originate from a coherent state, the resulting primordial scalar perturbations acquire a non-zero space-dependent mean, violating statistical homogeneity, statistical isotropy, and parity. As a consequence of statistical inhomogeneities, SIGW acquires distinct scale-dependent features in its correlation function. Statistical anisotropies further lead to possible parity violation and correlation between different polarization modes in the tensor perturbations. Therefore, detection of these signatures in the stochastic gravitational wave background would offer probes to the statistical nature of primordial scalar perturbations beyond the scales accessible to CMB observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Klein-Gordon and Dirac equation for a massive charged field in a uniform electric field has a symmetry of two-dimensional global de Sitter (dS) and anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. In the in-out formalism the mean numbers of spinors (spin-1/2 fermions) and scalars (spin-0 bosons) spontaneously produced by the uniform electric field are exactly found from the Bogoliubov relations both in the global and planar coordinates of (A)dS$_2$ space. We show that the uniform electric field enhances the production of charged spinor and scalar pairs in the planar and global dS space while the AdS space reduces the pair production in which weak electric fields below the Breitenlohner-Freedman (BF) bound prohibits pair production. The leading Boltzmann factor in dS space can be written as the Gibbons-Hawking radiation or Schwinger effect enhanced by e-folding factors less than one that give the QED effect or the curvature effect. We observe that dS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ spaces are connected by QED, such as a reciprocal relation between the mean number of spinors and scalars provided that the spacetime curvature is analytically continued. The leading behavior of the mean numbers for spinors and scalars is explained as a residue sum of contour integrals of the frequency or momentum in the phase-integral formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the ladder operators for static tidal perturbations to higher-dimensional black holes. These operators map between solutions of the relevant equation of motion at different multipole orders. We focus on spin 0, 1 and 2 perturbations to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole and on spin 0 perturbations to the 5D Myers-Perry black hole. The ladder structure, used in conjunction with the existence of special ground state solutions, explains why the Love numbers of these higher-dimensional black holes vanish for specific combinations of the multipole moment and number of spacetime dimensions. This generalizes previous work on a ladder symmetry explanation for the vanishing of 4D black hole static Love numbers to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>The impact of non-Gaussianity when searching for Primordial Black Holes with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LISA can observe cosmological millihertz (mHz) gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds that may offer a decisive test for asteroid-mass primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter (DM). In standard scenarios, failing to detect a scalar-induced gravitational wave (SIGW) background would exclude the last viable window for PBH DM formed through critical collapse. We show that this conclusion becomes much weaker in the presence of astrophysical foregrounds and strongly non-Gaussian primordial density perturbations, by studying how these phenomena affect the link between SIGWs and PBHs, and reevaluate LISA's sensitivity to asteroid-mass PBHs. In addition, we analyse the interplay between PBHs and SIGWs to gain further insights into the nature of primordial non-Gaussianity. We find that uncertainties in $f_{\rm NL}$ can induce substantial uncertainties in the PBH abundance, which ultimately limits LISA's capacity to fully probe the asteroid-mass PBH DM window.</description>
