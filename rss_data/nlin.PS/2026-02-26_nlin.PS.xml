      <title>Spectral entropy of the discrete Hasimoto effective potential exposes sub-residue geometric transitions in protein secondary structure</title>

Abstract: Characterizing the geometric boundaries of protein secondary structures is fundamental to understanding macromolecular folding. By applying the discrete Hasimoto map to translate backbone geometry into a one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger potential $V_{\mathrm{re}}[n]$, we establish a frequency-domain framework for protein conformations. Short-time Fourier transform analysis across 320,453 residues from 1,986 non-redundant proteins defines a local spectral entropy $H_{\mathrm{spec}}$ that consistently orders structural states. Helical segments emerge as narrow-band low-entropy regimes dominated by zero-frequency components, whereas coils manifest as broadband noise. We demonstrate that boundaries separating these states exhibit step-like sharpness characteristic of a first-order-like geometric transition with a sub-residue median width of 0.145 residues. This abrupt kinematic transition provides a spatial counterpart to the cooperative Zimm--Bragg thermodynamic model of helix nucleation. The extreme spatial narrowness exposes an intrinsic limitation governed by the Gabor uncertainty principle, explaining why the pointwise integrability residual $E[n]$ acts as an effective high-pass filter for boundary detection. Guided by this limit we introduce a dual-probe approach combining the high-pass residual for local torsion discontinuities with a low-frequency energy ratio $R_{\mathrm{LF}}$ measuring the DC-dominated flatness of helical interiors. Unifying these complementary signals improves the detection area under the curve from 0.783 to 0.815. Because high-entropy broadband regions coincide with the flexible loops and hinges implicated in allostery, the spectral entropy of the Hasimoto potential may serve as a sequence-agnostic geometric proxy for mapping functional dynamics from backbone coordinates.</description>

      <title>Floquet breathers in a modulated nonlinear lattice</title>

Abstract: In this work, we study a space-time modulated electro-mechanical system, consisting of an array of coupled cantilevers with their on-site potential provided by electromagnets driven by AC currents. Model equations are derived, and the effect of the modulation on the dispersion bands is examined. The theory of breather existence and stability is extended to include space-time modulation. We perform numerical simulations in a time-modulated system, showing three types of breather response depending on the driving frequency: (i) the modulation frequency is an integer multiple of the breather frequency or, in other words, this phenomenon corresponds to period doubling, tripling, etc.; (ii) the opposite, that is, the breather frequency is an integer multiple of the modulation frequency, corresponding to period-halving, etc. (iii) the breather and modulation frequencies are commensurate in a different form. We use for all of them the term {\em Floquet breathers} in analogy with Floquet solitons in photonic systems. As there is no dissipation, but periodic forcing, the energy is generally conserved but only at discrete times. There exists in this system a huge variety of breathers, either site-centered, symmetric and antisymmetric, bond centered, in-phase or in-quadrature with the modulation, and we analyze the evolution of stability of some of them as a function of the modulation frequency. The construction of a similar system would be of interest to study the properties of dynamic metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Small-time asymptotics and the emergence of complex singularities for the KdV equation</title>

Abstract: While real-valued solutions of the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) equation have been studied extensively over the past 50 years, much less attention has been devoted to solution behaviour in the complex plane. Here we consider the analytic continuation of real solutions of KdV and investigate the role that complex-plane singularities play in early-time solutions on the real line. We apply techniques of exponential asymptotics to derive the small-time behaviour for dispersive waves that propagate in one direction, and demonstrate how the amplitude, wavelength and speed of these waves depend on the strength and location of double-pole singularities of the initial condition in the complex plane. Using matched asymptotic expansions in the limit $t\rightarrow 0^+$, we show how complex singularities of the time-dependent solution of the KdV equation emerge from these double-pole singularities. Generically, their speed as they move from their initial position is of $\mathcal{O}(t^{-2/3})$, while the direction in which these singularities propagate initially is dictated by a Painlev\'{e} II (P$_{\mathrm{II}}$) problem with decreasing tritronqu\'{e}e solutions. The well-known $N$-soliton solutions of KdV correspond to rational solutions of P$_{\mathrm{II}}$ with a finite number of singularities; otherwise, we postulate that infinitely many complex-plane singularities of KdV solutions are born at each double-pole singularity of the initial condition. We also provide asymptotic results for some non-generic cases in which singularities propagate more slowly than in the generic case. Our study makes progress towards the goal of providing a complete description of KdV solutions in the complex plane and, in turn, of relating this behaviour to the solution on the real line.</description>
