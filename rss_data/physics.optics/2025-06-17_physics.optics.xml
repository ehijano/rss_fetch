      <title>Photonic Contributions to the Apparent Seebeck Coefficient of Plasmonic Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photo-induced charge transport in plasmonic metal nanostructures has garnered significant interest for applications in sensing and power conversion, yet the underlying mechanisms remain debated. Here, we report spatially correlated photovoltage generation in photonically engineered Au nanowires illuminated by focused, milliwatt-level laser excitation. Plasmonic nanodisk antennas placed adjacent to the nanowires created local variations in the photonic environment, resulting in clearly defined regions of enhanced photovoltage. Experimental results and simulations strongly support a thermally driven photothermoelectric (PTE) mechanism, where the local photonic structure modifies the intrinsic Seebeck coefficient of the metal, independent of other electronic structural factors. Our findings highlight photon-electron interactions as critical to the observed transport phenomena, suggesting photonic engineering as a viable strategy to systematically control and optimize thermoelectric performance.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-induced Band Gap Transmission in Dispersive and Flat Band Photonic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear interactions in photonic non-dispersive (flat) bands remain largely unexplored, despite their potential to yield exotic phenomena. Here, we demonstrate nonlinearity-induced transport of light from a boundary waveguide into photonic lattices with dispersive and flat bands. For the one-dimensional lattice supporting a dispersive band, self-focusing Kerr nonlinearity effectively makes the boundary waveguide phase-matched with the lattice modes, enabling efficient energy transfer above a threshold input power. In contrast, such nonlinear transmission to the flat band modes is inhibited, as demonstrated in a rhombic lattice supporting an isolated flat band. Instead, as the nonlinearity increases, light couples periodically to the lattice edge mode and then gradually spreads into the lattice due to the excitation of the lower dispersive band.</description>

      <title>Silicon Nitride Microresonator Raman Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon nitride (SiN) has emerged as a promising platform for integrated nonlinear photonics because of its low propagation loss, wide transparency window, and CMOS compatibility. Nonlinear processes arising from photon-electron interactions, such as Kerr frequency comb generation and second harmonic generation, have been extensively explored. In contrast, photon-phonon interaction-based nonlinearities, such as stimulated Raman scattering, remain largely unexplored in this integrated platform, despite their potential for broadband frequency conversion. Here, we demonstrate efficient Raman lasing in ultra-high-Q SiN microresonators by harnessing the strong intracavity field enhancement and engineering the optical mode to overlap with the Raman-active silica cladding. Through dispersion engineering and waveguide geometry optimization, we suppress competing Kerr nonlinearities while enhancing Raman gain, achieving lasing with sub-2 mW thresholds. We further investigate the trade-off between optical confinement and quality factor, revealing its impact on the overall nonlinear efficiency. Moreover, we also demonstrate broadband tunability of the Raman shift exceeding 120 inverse centimeters, enabled by the wide Raman gain spectrum of silica, offering new flexibility in designing integrated tunable Raman lasers. These results position SiN as a viable platform for chip-scale Raman lasers, expanding the nonlinear optics toolbox of the SiN platform and enabling compact, power-efficient light sources for applications in spectroscopy, optical communications, and quantum photonics.</description>

      <title>Beyond Decoherence: Control the Collective Quantum Dynamics of Quasi Particles in Topological Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long lived coherent quasiparticles are a promising foundation for novel quantum technologies, where maintaining quantum coherence is crucial. Decoherence, driven by finite emitter lifetimes, remains a central challenge in quantum computing. Here, we control the dynamics of spatially separated quantum emitters via preserving their phase information by introducing a topological waveguide as a robust chiral reservoir. Incoherent quantum emitters randomly positioned near a perturbed honeycomb plasmonic interface and couple to the mutual topological interface mode. Using the S3 Stokes parameter, we trace farfield polarization patterns that reflect emitter coherence and spin-momentum locking. We show that even weakly coupled emitters exhibit coherent excitation and imprint phase on the emission. Time domain dynamics reveal signatures of superradiance and subradiance that correlate with spatial interference in S3. These spatial temporal features confirm that the observed polarization patterns arise from coherent quantum manybody dynamics, not classical interference. This challenges the conventional dichotomy between incoherent and coherent regimes, revealing that topological chiral photonic environments mediate long-range quantum correlations beyond standard waveguide QED.</description>

      <title>Tunable plasmon modes and topological transitions in single- and bilayer semi-Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the plasmonic response of single- and bilayer semi-Dirac materials under the influence of a tunable parameter $\delta$ that governs topological transitions via Dirac cone generation/merging and incorporating band inversion terms. For single-layer systems, we demonstrate that the emergence of Dirac cones leads to an enhanced plasmon frequency range and that the plasmonic spectrum exhibits strong anisotropy, especially for finite $\delta$ and vanishing inversion terms. In the bilayer configurations, we uncover a second plasmon mode whose relative phase, with respect to the first mode, can be actively controlled by rotating the upper layer which impacts the symmetry of the charge oscillations across the layers. This tunability enables switching between in- and out-of-phase plasmonic modes, offering a route toward phase-controlled collective excitations. Our results highlight the potential of semi-Dirac systems for topological plasmonics and interferometric applications in next-generation optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Fourier-Based Reflection Spectrum Measurement in Coherence Scanning Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements have extended the capabilities of coherence scanning interferometry (CSI) beyond surface topography measurement to reflectivity spectrum imaging. It is commonly accepted that the one-dimensional(1-D) Fourier magnitude of a pixel-wise CSI signal is proportional to the product of the sample's absolute reflection coefficient spectrum and the light source spectrum. However, this assumption holds true only for low numerical aperture (NA) CSI systems. In this work, we establish a generalized mathematical framework that represents the CSI signal a matrix multiplication of the spectrum measurement matrix with the element-wise product of the reflection spectrum and the light source spectrum, assuming spectral independence from the incident angles. Considering the light source spectrum and wavenumber channel summation, we utilize a reflection spectrum measurement matrix and its conditioned counterpart to linearly relate the CSI signal to the absolute reflection spectrum. Through simulations, we quantitatively analyze the impacts of various error sources, including NA inaccuracy, pupil apodization, height reconstruction errors, spectral inaccuracies of the light source, and phase change on reflection (PCOR) from the sample, on the reconstruction performance of the absolute reflection coefficient spectrum. It is found that the PCOR is the dominant factor influencing the reconstruction of the reflection coefficient spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an approach to the inverse design of scattering systems by modifying the transmission matrix using reinforcement learning. We utilize Proximal Policy Optimization to navigate the highly non-convex landscape of the object function to achieve three types of transmission matrices: (1) Fixed-ratio power conversion and zero-transmission mode in rank-1 matrices, (2) exceptional points with degenerate eigenvalues and unidirectional mode conversion, and (3) uniform channel participation is enforced when transmission eigenvalues are degenerate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the transport of intensity equation (TIE) can be used to reconstruct the spatial phase variations produced by samples such as magnetic materials and biological cells, the impact of complex refractive indices on quantitative phase imaging remains unexplored. To overcome this difficulty, we provide herein a more physically generalized TIE framework that enables the reconstruction of spatial variations in both refractive-index fluctuations and attenuation coefficients. We then demonstrate this method using bright-field microscopy imaging. The results reveal robust performance in retrieving heterogeneous optical structures within measurable parameter regions. Finally, we analyze the symmetry of the attenuation reversal in the TIE framework, thus revealing the invariant nature of the absorptive and scattering properties in the samples of interest.</description>

Abstract: Here, we report a characterization setup for low-loss integrated photonic waveguides in aluminum oxide, tailored for deep UV applications. The setup includes a 261nm UV light source, objective lenses for free-space coupling, an automated stage, and a UV camera.

      <title>Emergence of an Epsilon-Near-Zero Medium from Microscopic Atomic Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that an effective near-zero refractive index can emerge from collective light scattering in a discrete atomic lattice, using essentially exact microscopic simulations. In a 25-layer array, cooperative response leads to over a thirtyfold increase in the effective optical wavelength within the medium, almost eliminating optical phase accumulation, with potential applications in spectroscopy and optical manipulation of quantum emitters. Crucially, the near-zero refractive index arises from first-principles microscopic theory, rather than being imposed through continuous phenomenological effective-medium model - providing conceptually important insight into the emergence of macroscopic electromagnetism from atomic-scale interactions.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength ghost imaging: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ghost imaging (GI) forms images from intensity-correlation data collected by a single-pixel detector, decoupling illumination and sensing. Since its quantum-photon origins, the technique has evolved through classical pseudothermal, computational and deep-learning variants to span an unprecedented spectral range--from extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) to terahertz (THz) waves and even matter waves. This review traces that evolution, highlighting how wavelength dictates modulators, detectors and propagation physics and, in turn, the attainable penetration depth, resolution and dose. We survey X-ray/XUV implementations that deliver low-damage microscopy, visible/near-IR systems that achieve video-rate lidar through fog and water, mid-IR platforms that extract molecular fingerprints in photon-starved conditions, and THz schemes that provide non-destructive inspection of concealed structures. These advances collectively position multi-wavelength GI as a versatile, low-dose alternative wherever conventional focal-plane arrays falter.</description>

      <title>Artificial Gauge Fields and Dimensions in a Polariton Hofstadter Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial gauge fields allow uncharged particles to mimic the behavior of charged particles subjected to magnetic fields, providing a powerful platform for exploring topological physics. Neutral particles, like photons, are typically unaffected by real magnetic fields. However, it is possible to introduce artificial gauge fields that control the effective dynamics of these neutral particles. Topological exciton-polariton lasers have attracted considerable interest, in part due to the wide range of tunable system parameters, but often require strong magnetic fields to realise propagating topological edge states. Here we show, that by using an artificial gauge field the topological Hall effect in a micron-scale micropillar chain is experimentally realised, exploiting the circular polarisation of polaritons as an artificial dimension. By careful rotational alignment of elliptical micropillars, we introduce an effective plaquette phase that induces strictly polarisation-dependent edge-state propagation, demonstrating non-reciprocal transport of the polariton pseudospins. Our results demonstrate that the dimensionality limitation of topological interface states as well as requirements for strong external magnetic fields in coupled topological laser arrays can be overcome by utilizing polarisation effects and careful engineering of the potential landscape. Our results open new ways towards the implementation of topological polariton lattices and related optically active devices with additional artificial dimension.</description>

      <title>Energy and photon centroids of spatiotemporal light pulses and consequences for their intrinsic orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ongoing debate surrounding the intrinsic transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) attributed to spatiotemporal optical vortex (STOV) light pulses has raised the energy and photon-density centroids as two alternative frameworks to define the center of a free electromagnetic wavepacket. We herein derive, within a single formalism, lowest-order expressions for the positions and velocities of both centroids, directly applicable to an arbitrary scalar, near-paraxial and quasi-monochromatic pulse envelope formulated in space-time. Examining pulses with structures including temporal chirp, wavefront rotation, Gaussian-type STOVs and tilted lobulated profiles, we illustrate general principles underlying the shifts and propagation dynamics of the two centroids, and discuss how these properties underpin the value and conservation of intrinsic OAM referenced to either centroid. Finally, despite widespread use of the notion of intrinsic OAM "per photon", we argue that in neither framework could individual STOV photons be said to carry a well-defined quantum of intrinsic transverse OAM, as such quantities do not write as expectation values of a single operator for which STOV states could form a basis of orthogonal eigenmodes. This contrasts with the well-established quantization scheme for the total longitudinal OAM of light in spatial vortex beams, bearing implications for the interpretation of future experiments involving STOV pulses in quantum optics, nonlinear wave-mixing or light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Compensation for Non-Ideal Channels in AWG-Based FBG Interrogator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental study of a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) interrogator based on a silicon oxynitride (SiON) photonic integrated arrayed waveguide grating (AWG). While AWG-based interrogators are compact and scalable, their practical performance is limited by non-ideal spectral responses. To address this, two calibration strategies within a 2.4 nm spectral region were compared: (1) a segmented analytical model based on a sigmoid fitting function, and (2) a machine learning (ML)-based regression model. The analytical method achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.11 pm within the calibrated range, while the ML approach based on exponential regression achieves 3.17 pm. Moreover, the ML model demonstrates generalization across an extended 2.9 nm wavelength span, maintaining sub-5 pm accuracy without re-fitting. Residual and error distribution analyses further illustrate the trade-offs between the two approaches. ML-based calibration provides a robust, data-driven alternative to analytical methods, delivering enhanced accuracy for non-ideal channel responses, reduced manual calibration effort, and improved scalability across diverse FBG sensor configurations.</description>

      <title>In situ Thermal Trimming of Waveguides in a Standard Active Silicon Photonics Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present suspended heater structures fabricated in a standard C- and O-band silicon (Si) photonics platform that can achieve sufficiently high local temperatures to induce effective refractive index trimming of Si and silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides with 30 - 90 mW of applied electrical power. Following thermal trimming at moderate powers ($\leq$ 40 mW), maximum changes in the averaged waveguide effective refractive index of $-5.18 \times 10^{-3}$ and $-7.9 \times 10^{-4}$ are demonstrated in SiN and Si waveguides, respectively, at a wavelength of 1550 nm. At higher powers, SiN waveguides exhibit positive averaged effective index changes up to $\approx$0.02, demonstrating bi-directional index trimming. As an example application, we demonstrate bias point trimming of a carrier injection Mach-Zehnder switch. Through investigations of the origin of the thermal trimming effect, we hypothesize that changes in the silica (SiO$_2$) waveguide cladding may be a primary underlying mechanism at temperatures $\gtrsim$300$^{\circ}$C, with significant trimming of SiN waveguide cores occurring at larger temperatures $\gtrsim$510$^{\circ}$C. As the trimming experiments represent a form of accelerated thermal aging, we estimate the aging behavior of the suspended heaters by fitting and extrapolating the measured datasets to 100 - 200$^{\circ}$C operating temperatures over five years.</description>

      <title>Slanted light-sheet array microscopy for large volume imaging at rates exceeding 100 Hz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-speed image acquisition in light microscopy is essential for a wide range of applications, including observing dynamic biological processes and enabling high-throughput sample analysis. However, traditional imaging speeds are often limited by the scanning mechanisms and the signal-to-noise ratio, and these constraints are further exacerbated by the need for volumetric imaging, optical sectioning, high spatial resolution, and large fields of view. To address these challenges, we have developed a slanted light-sheet array microscope (SLAM), which enables ultrafast volumetric imaging without compromising key technical specifications. SLAM is built on a standard wide-field compound microscope with minimal and straightforward modifications to the illumination path, allowing for easy integration. It can acquire multi-dimensional, high-resolution images at rates exceeding 100 volumes per second across large imaging regions (e.g., exceeding 500 pixels in transverse dimensions and 200 layers in depth). In addition, a deep learning approach based on conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models is proposed to achieve isotropic resolution. Like traditional light-sheet microscopy, SLAM offers intrinsic optical sectioning and localized photochemistry, while its innovative optomechanical design is compatible with most biological samples prepared using conventional protocols. This makes SLAM a versatile and powerful imaging platform that is accessible to the broader biomedical research community.</description>

      <title>Shaping Bulk Fermi Arcs in the Momentum Space of Photonic Crystal Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are special spectral degeneracies of non-Hermitian operators: at the EP, the complex eigenvalues coalesce, i.e., they become degenerate in both their real and imaginary parts. In two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal lattices, these elements can be tailored through structural engineering. In particular, it is known that a quadratic degeneracy in the photonic band structure can be split into a pair of Dirac points (DPs) by breaking one of the unit cell symmetries, and each DP can be further split into a pair of EPs by introducing losses. Each EP of the pair is then connected by an open isofrequency curve, called the bulk Fermi arc (BFA). In this work, we introduce a simplified effective Hamiltonian model accounting for the main physical properties of these EPs and BFAs. Then, we systematically investigate, through numerical simulations, how EPs as well as the related BFA depend on the type and amount of broken symmetries in the given 2D unit cell of a realistic photonic crystal slab implementation. Our results show that it is possible to tailor the position and distance of the EP pair in reciprocal space, as well as the curvature and orientation of the associated BFA, by deterministically tuning the unit cell structure. Importantly, the symmetry-breaking strategy we propose is general and can be applied to a broad range of photonic crystal designs beyond the specific example studied here. This approach opens new possibilities for exploiting EPs in applications involving photonic crystal lattices in, e.g., light-emitting devices or fundamental physics studies.</description>

      <title>Direct visualization of visible-light hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in real space and time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic materials support exotic polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion that enable subdiffraction focusing and enhanced light-matter interactions. Visible-frequency hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) offer significant advantages over hyperbolic phonon polaritons, which operate in the infrared frequency range - namely lower losses and greater technological relevance. However, these HPPs remained experimentally inaccessible until the recent identification of molybdenum(IV) oxychloride (MoOCl$_2$). Here we achieve the first direct real-space and real-time visualization of hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in natural materials using time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy with femtosecond time resolution and nanometer spatial resolution. Our direct imaging enables measurement of HPP propagation velocities and lengths, real-time observation of plasmon-material edge interactions, experimental validation of hyperbolic dispersion through polarization-dependent experiments, and direct visualization of hyperbolic focusing phenomena. This spatiotemporal visualization validates theoretical predictions while establishing an experimental foundation for exploiting these unusual light-matter states in fundamental studies of hyperbolic media and nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Single-photon emission modeling with statistical estimators for the exponential distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon sources are used in numerous quantum technologies, from sensing and imaging to communication, making the accurate modeling of their emissions essential. In this work, we propose a statistical framework for describing single-photon emission processes and implement estimators for the exponential distribution to quantify this phenomenon. Our approach provides a reliable method for estimating the radiative decay time, represented by the inverse rate parameter, which is crucial in quantum optics applications. We explore several statistical estimators, including maximum likelihood estimation, minimum-variance unbiased estimator, and best linear unbiased estimator. To validate our theoretical methods, we test the proposed estimators on experimental data, demonstrating their applicability in real-world settings. We also evaluate the performance of these estimators when dealing with censored data, a frequent limitation in photon emission experiments. The analysis allows us to track the performance of the proposed estimators as the amount of available data decreases, providing insights into their reliability for modeling single-photon emission events under limited resources.</description>

      <title>Physical-Layer Machine Learning with Multimode Interferometric Photon Counting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The learning of the physical world relies on sensing and data post-processing. When the signals are weak, multi-dimensional and correlated, the performance of learning is often bottlenecked by the quality of sensors, calling for integrating quantum sensing into the learning of such physical-layer data. An example of such a learning scenario is the stochastic quadrature displacements of electromagnetic fields, modeling optomechanical force sensing, radiofrequency photonic sensing, microwave cavity weak signal sensing and other applications. We propose a unified protocol that combines machine learning with interferometric photon counting to reduce noise and reveal correlations. By applying variational quantum learning with multimode programmable quantum measurements, we enhance signal extraction. Our results show that multimode interferometric photon counting outperforms conventional homodyne detection proposed in prior works for tasks like principal component analysis (PCA) and cross-correlation analysis (CCA), even below vacuum noise levels. To further enhance the performance, We also integrate entanglement-enhanced modules, in the form of squeezed state distribution and anti-squeezing at detection, into the protocol. Combining the multimode interferometric photon counting and multipartite entanglement, the proposed protocol provides a powerful toolbox for learning weak signals.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton blockade by multi-tone drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiphoton blockade provides an efficient way to achieve entangled photon sources and leads to wide applications in modern quantum technologies. Here, we propose a scheme to realize multiphoton blockade by a multi-tone drive. Specifically, we demonstrate two-photon and three-photon blockades in a single-mode optical Kerr resonator using a two-tone and a three-tone drive, respectively. In comparison with the single-tone drive, except for the blockade of the $(n+1)$th photon excitation due to large detuning, the key mechanism in this scheme is the sequently resonant excitations of all the $m$-photon states ($m\leq n$) by the $n$-tone drive, which lead to the enhancement of photon generation and the demonstration of multiphoton blockade in the weak driving regime. Moreover, the photon distribution within the system can be adjusted on demand by tuning the relative amplitudes of the driving fields for different frequencies. The scheme can be extended to other bosonic systems and be applied to demonstrate other multiphoton physical effects.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Phonon-Induced Dephasing in Gallium Nitride Defect-Based Quantum Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GaN defect based quantum emitters have recently gained attention as promising single photon sources for quantum information applications. However, dephasing processes, manifested as photoluminescence (PL) linewidth broadening, pose a limitation to photon indistinguishability. In this study, we use a custom built confocal scanning microscope to examine the temperature dependent PL spectra of GaN defect quantum emitters integrated with solid immersion lenses, with the goal of elucidating their dephasing mechanisms. Our experimental findings show that at low temperatures, the PL lineshape exhibits a Gaussian profile with a constant, temperature independent linewidth, consistent with spectral diffusion. As the temperature increases, the PL lineshape evolves into a Lorentzian, and the temperature dependent linewidth deviates from the common T3 law. Considering the Debye temperature of GaN (about 600 K), the experimentally observed temperature dependent linewidth can be modeled by the quadratic Stark effect modulated by acoustic phonons in defect rich crystals. Furthermore, this model exhibits a level of accuracy comparable to that of the defect-E2(low) optical phonon coupling model previously reported in the literature. Our work reveals the mechanism of acoustic phonon induced dephasing in GaN defect emitters and demonstrates that both acoustic and optical phonons can contribute to their dephasing.</description>

      <title>Laser ablated sub-wavelength structure anti-reflection coating on an alumina lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13042v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used laser ablation to fabricate sub-wavelength structure anti-reflection coating (SWS-ARC) on a 5 cm diameter alumina lens. With an aspect ratio of 2.5, the SWS-ARC are designed to give a broad-band low reflectance response between 110 and 290 GHz. SWS shape measurements conducted on both sides of the lens give 303 $\mu$m pitch and total height between 750 and 790 $\mu$m, matching or exceeding the aspect ratio design values. Millimeter-wave transmittance measurements in a band between 140 and 260 GHz show the increase in transmittance expected with the ARC when compared to finite element analysis electromagnetic simulations. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of SWS-ARC on an alumina lens, opening the path for implementing the technique for larger diameter lenses.</description>

      <title>Excitation-Pulse Intensity Mediated Coherent Control in V-Type Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V-type three-level systems, where two excited states share a common ground state, serve as fundamental models for exploring coherent light-matter interactions in a range of quantum systems, from atomic gases to semiconductor nanostructures. In this work, we investigate the coherent evolution of such a system under strong femtosecond-pulse excitation by numerically solving the optical Bloch equations. We demonstrate that the coherent evolution of a three-level system critically depends on the product of the excitation-pulse duration and energy separation between the excited states. Using this understanding, we extend our analysis to simulate two-dimensional coherent spectra in a high-intensity regime. We show that by varying the pulse areas of the excitation pulses, one can selectively turn individual spectral features on or off, corresponding to distinct quantum pathways. Moreover, we can precisely adjust the phase of these peaks, illustrating an advanced level of coherent control within the system. Our approach provides a simple and robust framework for achieving advanced coherent control in multilevel systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have been shown to achieve exceptional performance for computer vision tasks like image recognition, segmentation, and reconstruction or denoising. Here, we evaluate the ultimate performance limits of deep convolutional neural network models for image reconstruction, by comparing them against the standard quantum limit set by shot-noise and the Heisenberg limit on precision. We train U-Net models on images of natural objects illuminated with coherent states of light, and find that the average mean-squared error of the reconstructions can surpass the standard quantum limit, and in some cases reaches the Heisenberg limit. Further, we train models on well-parameterized images for which we can calculate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound to determine the minimum possible measurable variance of an estimated parameter for a given probe state. We find the mean-squared error of the model predictions reaches these bounds calculated for the parameters, across a variety of parameterized images. These results suggest that deep convolutional neural networks can learn to become the optimal estimators allowed by the laws of physics, performing parameter estimation and image reconstruction at the ultimate possible limits of precision for the case of classical illumination of the object.</description>

      <title>Controlled manipulation of solitons in a recirculating fiber loop using external potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical solitons are self-sustained wave packets that propagate without distortion due to a balance between dispersion and nonlinearity. Their unique stability underpins key photonic applications while also playing a central role in nonlinear wave physics. However, real-time control over soliton dynamics in non-dissipative systems remains a major challenge, limiting their practical applications in photonic systems. Here, we introduce a fiber-based platform for soliton manipulation, by creating programmable external potentials through synchronous arbitrary phase modulation in a recirculating optical fiber loop. We demonstrate precise soliton trapping, parametric excitation, and coupled multi-soliton interactions, revealing particle-like behavior in excellent agreement with a Hamiltonian description in which solitons are treated as interacting classical particles. The strong analogy with matter-wave solitons in Bose-Einstein condensates highlights the broader implications of our approach, which provides a versatile experimental tool for the study of nonlinear wave dynamics and engineered soliton manipulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.01088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fairly general expression for a light beam is found as a solution of the paraxial Helmholtz equation. It is achieved by exploiting appropriately chosen complex variables which entail the separability of the equation. Next, the expression for the beam is obtained independently by superimposing shifted Gaussian beams, whereby the shift can be made either by a real vector (in which case the foci of the Gaussian beams are located on a circle) or by a complex one. The solutions found depend on several parameters, the specific choice of which allows to obtain beams with quite different properties. For several selected parameter values figures are drawn, demonstrating the spatial distribution of the energy density and phase. In special cases, the effect of a shift of the intensity peak from one branch to another and phase singularities are observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07786v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in high-throughput biomedical applications require real-time, large field-of-view (FOV) imaging. While current 2D lens-free imaging (LFI) systems improve FOV, they are often hindered by time-consuming multi-position measurements, extensive data pre-processing, and strict optical parameterization, limiting their application to static, thin samples. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GenLFI, combining a generative unsupervised physics-informed neural network (PINN) with a large FOV LFI setup for straightforward holographic image reconstruction, without multi-measurement. GenLFI enables real-time 2D imaging for 3D samples, such as droplet-based microfluidics and 3D cell models, in dynamic complex optical fields. Unlike previous methods, our approach decouples the reconstruction algorithm from optical setup parameters, enabling a large FOV limited only by hardware. We demonstrate a real-time FOV exceeding 550 mm$^2$, over 20 times larger than current real-time LFI systems. This framework unlocks the potential of LFI systems, providing a robust tool for advancing automated high-throughput biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Self-referencing photothermal common-path interferometry to measure absorption of Si3N4 membranes for laser-light sails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-light sails are a spacecraft concept wherein lightweight "sails" are propelled by high-intensity lasers. We investigated the near-infrared absorption of free-standing membranes of stoichiometric silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$), a candidate sail material. To resolve the small but non-zero optical loss, we used photothermal common-path interferometry (PCI), for which we developed a self-referencing modality where a PCI measurement is performed twice: once on a bare membrane, and a second time with monolayer graphene deposited on the membrane. The graphene increases the absorption of the sample by orders of magnitude, such that it can be measured by ellipsometry, without significantly affecting the thermal properties. We measured the absorption coefficient of Si$_3$N$_4$ to be (1.5-3) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ cm$^{-1}$ at 1064 nm, making it a suitable sail material for laser intensities as high as ~10 GW/m$^2$. By comparison, silicon-rich "low stress" SiN$_x$ (x~1), with a measured absorption coefficient of approximately 8 cm$^{-1}$, is unlikely to survive such high laser intensities. Our self-referencing technique enables testing of low-loss membranes of various materials for laser sails and other applications.</description>

Abstract: The detection of light of thermal origin is the principal means by which humanity has learned about our world and the cosmos. In optical astronomy, in particular, direct detection of thermal photons and the resolution of their spectra have enabled discoveries of the broadest scope and impact. Such measurements, however, do not capture the phase of the thermal fields--a parameter that has proven crucial to transformative techniques in radio astronomy such as synthetic aperture imaging. Over the last 25 years, tremendous progress has occurred in laser science, notably in the phase-sensitive, broad bandwidth, high resolution, and traceable spectroscopy enabled by the optical frequency comb. In this work, we directly connect the fields of frequency comb laser spectroscopy and passive optical sensing as applied to astronomy, remote sensing, and atmospheric science. We provide fundamental sensitivity analysis of dual-comb correlation spectroscopy (DCCS), whereby broadband thermal light is measured via interferometry with two optical frequency combs. We define and experimentally verify the sensitivity scaling of DCCS at black body temperatures relevant for astrophysical observations. Moreover, we provide comparison with direct detection techniques and more conventional laser heterodyne radiometry. Our work provides the foundation for future exploration of comb-based broadband synthetic aperture hyperspectral imaging across the infrared and optical spectrum.</description>

      <title>Nonsymmetric evanescent coupling in photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymmetrical interactions are ubiquitous in nature, and in physics their study becomes fundamental. Despite the prevalence of evanescent coupling in physics, little attention has been paid to wave function profiles, with symmetrical reciprocal interactions often assumed for practical reasons. This work challenges that assumption by analytically demonstrating the origin of nonsymmetrical coupling in a photonic platform, focusing on the behavior of evanescent tails from adjacent waveguides. We experimentally validate an asymmetrical dynamics by studying detuned photonic directional couplers, fabricated via femtosecond laser writing, and corroborate our findings through continuous numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-slice beam propagation method for imaging multiple-scattering samples on reflective substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffraction tomography (DT) has been widely explored in transmission-mode configurations, enabling high-resolution, label-free 3D imaging. However, adapting DT for reflection-mode measurements presents significant challenges due to strong substrate reflections and complex multiple-scattering effects, particularly in metrology and industrial inspection applications. In this work, we introduce reflection-mode Multi-Slice Fourier Ptychographic Tomography (rMS-FPT) that achieves high-resolution, volumetric imaging of multi-layered, strongly scattering samples on reflective substrates. We develop a reflection-mode multi-slice beam propagation method (rMSBP) to model multiple scattering and substrate interactions, enabling precise 3D reconstruction. By incorporating darkfield measurements, rMS-FPT enhances resolution beyond the traditional brightfield limit and provides sub-micrometer lateral resolution while achieving optical sectioning. We validate rMS-FPT through numerical simulations on a four-layer resolution target and experimental demonstrations using a reflection-mode LED array microscope. Experiments on a two-layer resolution target and a multi-layer scattering sample confirm the method's effectiveness. Our optimized implementation enables rapid imaging, covering a 1.2 mm $\times$ 1.2 mm area in 1.6 seconds, reconstructing over $10^9$ voxels within a 0.4 mm$^3$ volume. This work represents a significant step in extending DT to reflection-mode configurations, providing a robust and scalable solution for 3D metrology and industrial inspection.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Transmission of Analog Radio and Digital Coherent Signals Over Multi-Span Metro and PON for Bandwidth-Efficient Fronthaul in mmWave Centralized RAN Networks [Invited]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17785</link>

Abstract: We experimentally investigate the transparent coexistence of heterogeneous Analog Radio-over-Fiber (ARoF) and Digital Coherent Optical (DCO) signals in a converged metro/PON network. Our streamlined setup employs RF generation via optical heterodyning, so that both carrier and modulated signals can be generated centrally and transmitted to the antenna site, across a metro network and Passive Optical Network (PON). The experiment includes the transmission of 8.8 Gbps mmWave signals and 400 Gbps coherent optical signals within a 68.75 GHz ROADM channel bandwidth and a 1:32 to 1:128 split PON. We also analyze the impact of varying ROADM channel bandwidth, PON split ratios, metro network distance and number of ROADMs traversed, on the performance of DCO and ARoF signals. The results reveal that the error vector magnitude (EVM) of the ARoF signal is significantly influenced by the allocated bandwidth, the number of ROADMs, and the overall network loss, providing insights into optimizations necessary to achieve target EVM levels.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Non-Rayleigh Speckles Generated from Nonlinear Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04816v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically derive an expression for a speckle field's intensity probability density function (PDF) in a nonlinear medium. The analytically driven results are in good agreement with the numerical outcomes. In a focusing nonlinear medium, the local intensity of the speckle is enhanced as manifested through the longer tail of the PDF. In contrast, the local intensity of speckle is reduced in the presence of a defocusing nonlinearity, and the tail of the probability density function also reduces. This change in local intensity of the speckles arises due to the cubic Kerr nonlinearity, which eventually modifies the second-order statistics. Hence, the intensity correlation is altered as per the nature of the associated nonlinearity while the field correlation remains invariant of both types of the nonlinear conditions.</description>

      <title>Highly sensitive temperature sensing via quadratic optomechanical coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective frequency of a mechanical resonator can be tuned via the spring effect induced by quadratic optomechanical (QOM) coupling, and both spontaneous symmetry breaking and anti-parity-time phase transition were predicted in the QOM systems. Here, we show that the mechanical susceptibility can be enhanced significantly by driving the QOM system with a strong external optical field, and divergence will happen as the driving strength approaches the critical point (CP) for spontaneous symmetry breaking. Based on the CP, we propose a highly sensitive temperature sensor with a mechanical resonator quadratically coupled to an optical mode. We find that the sensitivity of the temperature sensor can be enhanced by several orders of magnitude as the driving strength approaches the CP, and the sensitivity of the temperature sensor remains high in the low-temperature limit. Our work provides an effective way to realize highly sensitive temperature sensing at ultra-low temperature in the QOM systems.</description>

      <title>Scalable registration of single quantum emitters within solid immersion lenses through femtosecond laser writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise registration of solid-state quantum emitters to photonic structures is a major technological challenge for fundamental research (e.g. in cavity quantum electrodynamics) and applications to quantum technology. Standard approaches include the complex multi-step fabrication of photonic structures on pre-existing emitters, both registered within a grid of lithographically-defined markers. Here, we demonstrate a marker-free, femtosecond laser writing technique to generate individual quantum emitters within photonic structures. Characterization of 28 defect centers, laser-written at the centers of pre-existing solid immersion lens structures, showed offsets relative to the photonic structure's center of 260~nm in the x-direction and 60~nm in the y-direction, with standard deviations of $\pm 170$~nm and $\pm 90$~nm, respectively, resulting in an average 4.5 times enhancement of the optical collection efficiency. This method is scalable for developing integrated quantum devices using spin-photon interfaces in silicon carbide and is easily extendable to other materials.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence from metal nanostructures -- dependence on size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For decades, there have been multiple seemingly contradicting experimental reports on the dependence of the photoluminescence from metal nanostructures on their size. We reconcile these reports using a simple analytic formula which is found to match well photoluminescence measurements for a range of structures and illumination conditions. Our expression requires only knowledge of the local electric field and temperature, and it points to the physical quantities that determine the emission strength and its dependence on size.</description>
