      <title>Enhancing Recommendation Systems with GNNs and Addressing Over-Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses key challenges in enhancing recommendation systems by leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and addressing inherent limitations such as over-smoothing, which reduces model effectiveness as network hierarchy deepens. The proposed approach introduces three GNN-based recommendation models, specifically designed to mitigate over-smoothing through innovative mechanisms like residual connections and identity mapping within the aggregation propagation process. These modifications enable more effective information flow across layers, preserving essential user-item interaction details to improve recommendation accuracy. Additionally, the study emphasizes the critical need for interpretability in recommendation systems, aiming to provide transparent and justifiable suggestions tailored to dynamic user preferences. By integrating collaborative filtering with GNN architectures, the proposed models not only enhance predictive accuracy but also align recommendations more closely with individual behaviors, adapting to nuanced shifts in user interests. This work advances the field by tackling both technical and user-centric challenges, contributing to the development of robust and explainable recommendation systems capable of managing the complexity and scale of modern online environments.</description>

      <title>Beyond Questions: Leveraging ColBERT for Keyphrase Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While question-like queries are gaining popularity and search engines' users increasingly adopt them, keyphrase search has traditionally been the cornerstone of web search. This query type is also prevalent in specialised search tasks such as academic or professional search, where experts rely on keyphrases to articulate their information needs. However, current dense retrieval models often fail with keyphrase-like queries, primarily because they are mostly trained on question-like ones. This paper introduces a novel model that employs the ColBERT architecture to enhance document ranking for keyphrase queries. For that, given the lack of large keyphrase-based retrieval datasets, we first explore how Large Language Models can convert question-like queries into keyphrase format. Then, using those keyphrases, we train a keyphrase-based ColBERT ranker (ColBERTKP_QD) to improve the performance when working with keyphrase queries. Furthermore, to reduce the training costs associated with training the full ColBERT model, we investigate the feasibility of training only a keyphrase query encoder while keeping the document encoder weights static (ColBERTKP_Q). We assess our proposals' ranking performance using both automatically generated and manually annotated keyphrases. Our results reveal the potential of the late interaction architecture when working under the keyphrase search scenario.</description>

      <title>CAISSON: Concept-Augmented Inference Suite of Self-Organizing Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present CAISSON, a novel hierarchical approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) that transforms traditional single-vector search into a multi-view clustering framework. At its core, CAISSON leverages dual Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to create complementary organizational views of the document space, where each view captures different aspects of document relationships through specialized embeddings. The first view processes combined text and metadata embeddings, while the second operates on metadata enriched with concept embeddings, enabling a comprehensive multi-view analysis that captures both fine-grained semantic relationships and high-level conceptual patterns. This dual-view approach enables more nuanced document discovery by combining evidence from different organizational perspectives. To evaluate CAISSON, we develop SynFAQA, a framework for generating synthetic financial analyst notes and question-answer pairs that systematically tests different aspects of information retrieval capabilities. Drawing on HotPotQA's methodology for constructing multi-step reasoning questions, SynFAQA generates controlled test cases where each question is paired with the set of notes containing its ground-truth answer, progressing from simple single-entity queries to complex multi-hop retrieval tasks involving multiple entities and concepts. Our experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over both basic and enhanced RAG implementations, particularly for complex multi-entity queries, while maintaining practical response times suitable for interactive applications.</description>

      <title>CLAS: A Machine Learning Enhanced Framework for Exploring Large 3D Design Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) objects have wide applications. Despite the growing interest in 3D modeling in academia and industries, designing and/or creating 3D objects from scratch remains time-consuming and challenging. With the development of generative artificial intelligence (AI), designers discover a new way to create images for ideation. However, generative AIs are less useful in creating 3D objects with satisfying qualities. To allow 3D designers to access a wide range of 3D objects for creative activities based on their specific demands, we propose a machine learning (ML) enhanced framework CLAS - named after the four-step of capture, label, associate, and search - to enable fully automatic retrieval of 3D objects based on user specifications leveraging the existing datasets of 3D objects. CLAS provides an effective and efficient method for any person or organization to benefit from their existing but not utilized 3D datasets. In addition, CLAS may also be used to produce high-quality 3D object synthesis datasets for training and evaluating 3D generative models. As a proof of concept, we created and showcased a search system with a web user interface (UI) for retrieving 6,778 3D objects of chairs in the ShapeNet dataset powered by CLAS. In a close-set retrieval setting, our retrieval method achieves a mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of 0.58, top 1 accuracy of 42.27%, and top 10 accuracy of 89.64%.</description>

      <title>Freshness and Informativity Weighted Cognitive Extent and Its Correlation with Cumulative Citation Count</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit cognitive extent, originally defined as the number of unique phrases in a quota. We introduce Freshness and Informative Weighted Cognitive Extent (FICE), calculated based on two novel weighting factors, the lifetime ratio and informativity of scientific entities. We model the lifetime of each scientific entity as the time-dependent document frequency, which is fit by the composition of multiple Gaussian profiles. The lifetime ratio is then calculated as the cumulative document frequency at the publication time $t_0$ divided by the cumulative document frequency over its entire lifetime. The informativity is calculated by normalizing the document frequency across all scientific entities recognized in a title. Using the ACL Anthology, we verified the trend formerly observed in several other domains that the number of unique scientific entities per quota increased gradually at a slower rate. We found that FICE exhibits a strong correlation with the average cumulative citation count within a quota.

      <title>Mathematical Information Retrieval: Search and Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical information is essential for technical work, but its creation, interpretation, and search are challenging. To help address these challenges, researchers have developed multimodal search engines and mathematical question answering systems. This book begins with a simple framework characterizing the information tasks that people and systems perform as we work to answer math-related questions. The framework is used to organize and relate the other core topics of the book, including interactions between people and systems, representing math formulas in sources, and evaluation. We close by addressing some key questions and presenting directions for future work. This book is intended for students, instructors, and researchers interested in systems that help us find and use mathematical information.</description>

      <title>Towards Fair RAG: On the Impact of Fair Ranking in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many language models now enhance their responses with retrieval capabilities, leading to the widespread adoption of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. However, despite retrieval being a core component of RAG, much of the research in this area overlooks the extensive body of work on fair ranking, neglecting the importance of considering all stakeholders involved. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of RAG systems integrated with fair rankings. We focus specifically on measuring the fair exposure of each relevant item across the rankings utilized by RAG systems (i.e., item-side fairness), aiming to promote equitable growth for relevant item providers. To gain a deep understanding of the relationship between item-fairness, ranking quality, and generation quality in the context of RAG, we analyze nine different RAG systems that incorporate fair rankings across seven distinct datasets. Our findings indicate that RAG systems with fair rankings can maintain a high level of generation quality and, in many cases, even outperform traditional RAG systems, despite the general trend of a tradeoff between ensuring fairness and maintaining system-effectiveness. We believe our insights lay the groundwork for responsible and equitable RAG systems and open new avenues for future research. We publicly release our codebase and dataset at https://github.com/kimdanny/Fair-RAG.</description>
