      <title>Comment on "Indefinitely Flat Circular Velocities and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation from Weak Lensing"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent measurements of circular velocity curves from weak lensing of the isolated galaxies lead to a conclusion that the circular velocity curves remain flat well beyond the virial radii of dark matter halos up to 1 Mpc. This is in clear contradiction with the LCDM numerical simulations. We show that the additional cosmic force originating from the geometry of the Universe beyond the Friedmann model increases the circular velocities of the test galactic bodies and avoids a decline of the standard LCDM velocity curves.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields and four interactions in the trigintaduonion spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper aims to apply the trigintaduonion spaces to explore the physical properties of four interactions simultaneously, including the electromagnetic fields, gravitational fields, weak nuclear fields, and strong nuclear fields. J. C. Maxwell first applied the algebra of quaternions to study the physical properties of electromagnetic fields. It inspired some subsequent scholars to introduce the quaternions, octonions, sedenions, and trigintaduonions to research the electromagnetic fields, gravitational fields, weak nuclear fields, strong nuclear fields, quantum mechanics, gauge fields, and curved spaces and so forth. The algebra of trigintaduonions is able to discuss the physical quantities of four interactions, including the field potential, field strength, field source, linear momentum, angular momentum, torque, and force. In the field theories described with the algebra of trigintaduonions, the weak nuclear field is composed of three types of fundamental fields. These three fundamental fields, related to weak nuclear fields, can describe the physical properties of weak nuclear fields collectively. This is consistent with the conclusion of the electroweak theory. Meanwhile the strong nuclear field consists of three types of fundamental fields. These three fundamental fields relevant to strong nuclear fields may investigate the physical properties of strong nuclear fields mutually. It is coincident with the deduction of quark theory. According to the properties of trigintaduonions, one can deduce the Yang-Mills equation related to the gauge fields. It means that the electromagnetic field occupies a quaternion space. The gravitational field owns one different quaternion space. The weak nuclear fields occupy three mutually independent quaternion spaces. The properties of weak nuclear fields are different from those of electromagnetic fields or gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of an $E_8$ model of elementary particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are many ways to embed the Lie groups of the Standard Model of Particle Physics in a Lie group of type $E_8$, but so far there is no convincing demonstration that the finite symmetries (and asymmetries) of weak hypercharge, three generations of electrons, three quarks in a proton, and photon polarisation can also be embedded correctly. I show that there is a unique way to embed these finite symmetries consistently, and that the gauge groups of the Standard Model are then uniquely determined. The model is automatically chiral, and the generation symmetry acts as a rotation in a real 2-space, so that the spinors for three generations have only twice as many degrees of freedom in total as the spinors for a single generation. In fact, two distinct generation symmetries arise from the restriction to the Standard Model, related by the CKM and/or PMNS matrices. It therefore appears that these two matrices are not independent, but at a fundamental level both contain the same underlying information.</description>

      <title>The structure of a fluid in the canonical and in the grand canonical ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ensemble inequivalence in a Coulomb liquid has been known since the years 1960s. The structure described by the canonical ensemble and the grand canonical ensemble are not equivalent. We show that this fact holds true for any long range fluid.</description>

      <title>A String-Graph Approach to Molecular Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduction: molecular geometry, the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms within a molecule, is fundamental to understanding chemical reactivity, physical properties, and biological activity. The prevailing models used to describe molecular geometry include the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, hybridization theory, and molecular orbital theory. While these models provide significant insights, they also have inherent limitations. Applying string theory and graph theory with topological and macrotensorial methods could improve the understanding of molecular behavior. Objective: explore the potential applications of string and graph theory to material science, focusing on molecular geometry, electron domains, and phase changes via symmetries. Molecular geometry: each molecule is associated with a simple graph with an orthonormal representation inducing metrics via the usage of macrotensor operators, allowing the calculation of angles between molecules and following the equations of motion. Phase changes: a series of inequalities are proposed depending on the energy-momentum densities of bonds and the edges of the associated graph where electrons or atoms are located, its topology, and isometries, exploring possible new states of matter. Conclusions: application of macrotensors, graphs, string theory, partitions and correlations functions of dimensions to material science, specifically to molecular geometry and phase changes allows for a more dynamic and flexible description of natural phenomena involving matter and the prediction of possible new states of matter. This presents a different perspective, opening possibilities for experimental confirmation and applications of the approach presented here.</description>
