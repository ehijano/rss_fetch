      <title>Eph-ephrin-mediated differential persistence as a mechanism for cell sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of cell sorting/segregation, by which cells organise spatially into clusters of specific cell type or function, is essential for tissue morphogenesis. This self-organization process involves an interplay between mechanical, biochemical, and cellular mechanisms that act across various spatial and temporal scales. Several mechanisms for cell sorting have been proposed; however, the physical nature of these mechanisms and how they lead to symmetric or asymmetric cell sorting remains unclear. Here, using experimental data from cocultures of genetically modified Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells and numerical simulations, we show the existence of a cell sorting mechanism based on transient increases in the persistence of motion of cells. This mechanism is activated on cells overexpressing the ephrinB1-related receptor EphB2 after their interaction with cells overexpressing ephrinB1. We show that this mechanism is sufficient to cause cell sorting, breaking the symmetry of the sorting dynamics, and show that the duration of this transient differential persistence state is optimal for enhancing sorting. Furthermore, we show that in combination with other interaction mechanisms, such as changes in direction-also known as contact inhibition of locomotion-and adhesion forces, differential persistence significantly reduces the timescale of sorting. Our findings offer insights into the behaviour of cell mixtures, the relevance of non-reciprocal interactions, and may provide insight into developmental processes and tissue patterning.</description>

      <title>How does an embedded spheroid affect the rigidity of extracellular matrix?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In vitro collagen networks and in silico fiber network models are typically used to represent extracellular matrix in tissues. Such networks exhibit the phenomenon of strain-stiffening, or an increase in elastic modulus with increasing strain, both under isotropic expansion and shear. However, the deformations induced in an extracellular matrix environment in the presence of a cellular aggregate are more complex, due to the irregularity of the tissue-environment interface, the mechanisms of force transmission between the tissue and the environment, and the rheology of the tissue itself. Therefore, using a two-dimensional vertex model of a tissue coupled to a surrounding spring network model, both of which can undergo rigidity transitions, we investigate the effects of a cellular aggregate on the rigidity of its environment. We find that the network's rigidity transition alone is sensitive to tissue size, mechanical properties, and surface tension. This sensitivity can, in part, be analytically estimated using a mean-field constraint counting approach to arrive at an effective spring network coordination number to determine how the network rigidity transition location shifts in the presence of the tissue spheroid. Moreover, we find that it is energetically favorable to create a ring of high-tension boundary cells in the tissue spheroid as the spring network rigidifies, as opposed to creating a string of high-tension cells through the bulk. We also find that increasing interfacial tension of the tissue spheroid facilitates rigidity in the spring network. In sum, our numerical and analytical results help reveal the complex mechanical interplay between a tissue spheroid and its surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>AI-driven control of bioelectric signalling for real-time topological reorganization of cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and manipulating bioelectric signaling could present a new wave of progress in developmental biology, regenerative medicine, and synthetic biology. Bioelectric signals, defined as voltage gradients across cell membranes caused by ionic movements, play a role in regulating crucial processes including cellular differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and tissue morphogenesis. Recent studies demonstrate the ability to modulate these signals to achieve controlled tissue regeneration and morphological outcomes in organisms such as planaria and frogs. However, significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly in predicting and controlling the spatial and temporal dynamics of membrane potentials (V_mem), understanding their regulatory roles in tissue and organ development, and exploring their therapeutic potential in diseases. In this work we propose an experiment using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework together with lab automation techniques for real-time manipulation of bioelectric signals to guide tissue regeneration and morphogenesis. The proposed framework should interact continuously with biological systems, adapting strategies based on direct biological feedback. Combining DRL with real-time measurement techniques -- such as optogenetics, voltage-sensitive dyes, fluorescent reporters, and advanced microscopy -- could provide a comprehensive platform for precise bioelectric control, leading to improved understanding of bioelectric mechanisms in morphogenesis, quantitative bioelectric models, identification of minimal experimental setups, and advancements in bioelectric modulation techniques relevant to regenerative medicine and cancer therapy. Ultimately, this research aims to utilize bioelectric signaling to develop new biomedical and bioengineering applications.</description>

      <title>Carbonic anhydrase II simulated with a universal neural network potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The carbonic anhydrase II enzyme (CA II) is one of the most significant enzymes in nature, reversibly converting CO$_2$ to bicarbonate at a remarkable rate. The precise mechanism it uses to achieve this rapid turnover remains unclear due to our inability to directly observe or simulate the full process dynamically. Here, we use a recently developed universal neural network potential (Orb) to simulate the active site of CA II. We reproduce several known features of the reaction mechanism, including the proton relay that conducts protons out of the active site to the His64 residue. Additionally, we observe a new reaction pathway where CO$_2$ reacts with a water molecule in the active site, which donates a proton to the zinc-bound hydroxide. This differs from the established mechanism where CO$_2$ directly reacts with hydroxide. Existing experimental data and independent quantum chemistry calculations are used to support the plausibility of this new mechanism. This demonstrates the potential of Orb to efficiently generate novel insights into important molecular scale processes that can potentially be harnessed to improve CO$_2$ capture technologies and drug design.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a mechanical external biventricular assist device for resuscitative thoracotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resuscitative thoracotomy, a high-risk procedure involving open heart massage, serves as a last resort for life-threatening conditions like penetrating chest wounds, severe blunt trauma, or surgery-related cardiac arrest. However, its success rate remains low, even with highly trained specialists. This research investigates the potential of an external biventricular assist device (BiVAD). By replacing open heart massage with our BiVAD device during resuscitative thoracotomy, we aim to achieve sufficient cardiac output, maintain physiological pressure levels, and potentially improve patient survival in these critical situations. The proposed BiVAD system features a simple 3D printed patch design for direct cardiac attachment, an actuation device, and a vacuum pump. The straightforward design allows quick application in emergency situations. The BiVAD system was tested in a hydraulic mock circulation, utilizing a silicone heart. Three actuation modes were tested for proof-of-concept: manual patch actuation, standard cardiac hand massage, and utilizing full capabilities of our BiVAD patch system with actuation device operation. Overall performance was assessed on ventricular pressure and flow rate data. Focusing on achieving the optimal cardiac output of 1.5 L/min (critical for patient survival), we tested our patch system against cardiac hand massage at a fixed rate of 60 bpm. Notably, our BiVAD system not only achieved to operate in the range of required cardiac output but also significantly reduced peak pressure in both ventricles compared to standard cardiac hand massage. This initial evaluation using a silicone heart model demonstrates the potential of our BiVAD system to achieve sufficient cardiac output while reducing peak pressure compared to cardiac hand massage. Further development holds promise for effective cardiac support in resuscitative thoracotomy.</description>

      <title>Capillary-driven thinning of DNA solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capillary thinning of polymeric fluids is central to biological and industrial processes, yet the mechanisms governing thinning dynamics remain unresolved, especially for semi-flexible polymers. Using ideal solutions of semi-flexible DNA, we validate a predictive model for exponential capillary thinning that accounts for each polymer in the molecular weight distribution. For semi-flexible polymers, self-selection of the exponential time constant occurs by a fundamentally different mechanism than for highly flexible systems, and is not simply governed by the longest polymer relaxation time.</description>

      <title>Fluid mechanics of sarcomeres as porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Muscle contraction, both in skeletal and cardiac tissue, is driven by sarcomeres, the microscopic units inside muscle cells where thick myosin and thin actin filaments slide past each other. During contraction and relaxation, the sarcomere's volume changes, causing sarcoplasm (intra-sarcomeric fluid) to flow out during contraction and back in as the sarcomere relaxes. We present a quantitative model of this sarcoplasmic flow, treating the sarcomere as an anisotropic porous medium with regions defined by the presence and absence of thick and thin filaments. Using semi-analytic methods, we solve for axial and lateral fluid flow within the filament lattice, calculating the permeabilities of this porous structure. We then apply these permeabilities within a Darcy model to determine the flow field generated during contraction. The predictions of our continuum model show excellent agreement with finite element simulations, reducing computational time by several orders of magnitude while maintaining accuracy in modelling the biophysical flow dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions in elastic media give rise to rich non-equilibrium behaviors, but controllable experimental realizations of such odd elastic phenomena remain scarce. Building on recent breakthroughs in electrical analogs of non-Hermitian solid-state systems, we design and analyze scalable odd electrical circuits (OECs) as exact analogs of an odd solid. We show that electrical work can be extracted from OECs via cyclic excitations and trace the apparent energy gain back to active circuit elements. We show that OECs host oscillatory modes that resemble recent experimental observations in living chiral crystals and identify active resonances that reveal a perspective on odd elasticity as a mechanism for mechanical amplification.</description>

      <title>Functional classification of metabolic networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks underpin biological and physical phenomena across scales, from microbial interactions to planetary atmosphere dynamics. Bacterial communities exhibit complex competitive interactions for resources, human organs and tissues demonstrate specialized biochemical functions, and planetary atmospheres are capable of displaying diverse organic and inorganic chemical processes. Despite their complexities, comparing these networks methodically remains a challenge due to the vast underlying degrees of freedom. In biological systems, comparative genomics has been pivotal in tracing evolutionary trajectories and classifying organisms via DNA sequences. However, purely genomic classifications often fail to capture functional roles within ecological systems. Metabolic changes driven by nutrient availability highlight the need for classification schemes that integrate metabolic information. Here we introduce and apply a computational framework for a classification scheme of organisms that compares matrix representations of chemical reaction networks using the Grassmann distance, corresponding to measuring distances between the fundamental subspaces of stoichiometric matrices. Applying this framework to human gut microbiome data confirms that metabolic distances are distinct from phylogenetic distances, underscoring the limitations of genetic information in metabolic classification. Importantly, our analysis of metabolic distances reveals functional groups of organisms enriched or depleted in specific metabolic processes and shows robustness to metabolically silent genetic perturbations. The generalizability of metabolic Grassmann distances is illustrated by application to chemical reaction networks in human tissue and planetary atmospheres, highlighting its potential for advancing functional comparisons across diverse chemical reaction systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse 3D microscopy rendering for cell shape inference with active mesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional methods for biological shape inference, such as deep learning (DL) and active contour models, face limitations in 3D. DL requires large labeled datasets, which are difficult to obtain, while active contour models rely on fine-tuned hyperparameters for intensity attraction and regularization. We introduce deltaMic, a novel 3D differentiable renderer for fluorescence microscopy. By leveraging differentiable Fourier-space convolution, deltaMic accurately models the image formation process, integrating a parameterized microscope point spread function and a mesh-based object representation. Unlike DL-based segmentation, it directly optimizes shape and microscopy parameters to fit real microscopy data, removing the need for large datasets or heuristic priors. To enhance efficiency, we develop a GPU-accelerated Fourier transform for triangle meshes, significantly improving speed. We demonstrate deltaMic's ability to reconstruct cellular shapes from synthetic and real microscopy images, providing a robust tool for 3D segmentation and biophysical modeling. This work bridges physics-based rendering with modern optimization techniques, offering a new paradigm for microscopy image analysis and inverse biophysical modeling.</description>

      <title>Devil's staircase inside shrimp-shaped regions reveals periodicity of plateau spikes and bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Slow-fast dynamics are intrinsically related to complex phenomena and are responsible for many of the homeostatic dynamics that keep biological systems healthy functioning. We study a discrete-time membrane potential model that can generate a diverse set of spiking behavior depending on the choice of slow-fast time scales, from fast spiking to bursting, or plateau action potentials -- also known as cardiac spikes since they are characteristic in heart myocytes. The plateau of cardiac spikes can lose stability, generating early or delayed afterdepolarizations (EADs and DADs, respectively), both of which are related to cardiac arrhythmia. We show the periodicity changes along the transition from the healthy action potentials to these impaired oscillations. We show that while EADs are mainly periodic attractors, DADs usually come with chaos. EADs are found inside shrimp-shaped regions of the parameter space. However, in our system, multiple periodic attractors live within a shrimp-shaped region, giving it an internal structure made of infinite transitions between periodicities forming a complete devil's staircase. Understanding the periodicity of plateau attractors in slow-fast systems could be useful in unveiling the characteristics of heart myocyte behaviors that are linked to cardiac arrhythmias.</description>
