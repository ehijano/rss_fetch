      <title>Market-Based Variance of Market Portfolio and of Entire Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the unified market-based description of returns and variances of the trades with shares of a particular security, of the trades with shares of all securities in the market, and of the trades with the market portfolio. We consider the investor who doesn't trade the shares of his portfolio he collected at time t0 in the past. The investor observes the time series of the current trades with all securities made in the market during the averaging interval. The investor may convert these time series into the time series that model the trades with all securities as the trades with a single security and into the time series that model the trades with the market portfolio as the trades with a single security. That establishes the same description of the returns and variances of the trades with a single security, the trades with all securities in the market, and the market portfolio. We show that the market-based variance, which accounts for the impact of random change of the volumes of consecutive trades with securities, takes the form of Markowitz's (1952) portfolio variance if the volumes of consecutive trades with all market securities are assumed constant. That highlights that Markowitz's (1952) variance ignores the effects of random volumes of consecutive trades. We compare the market-based variances of the market portfolio and of the trades with all market securities, consider the importance of the duration of the averaging interval, and explain the economic obstacles that limit the accuracy of the predictions of the returns and variances at best by Gaussian distributions. The same methods describe the returns and variances of any portfolio and the trades with its securities.</description>

      <title>Your AI, Not Your View: The Bias of LLMs in Investment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts arising from discrepancies between their pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time market data. These conflicts are especially problematic in real-world investment services, where a model's inherent biases can misalign with institutional objectives, leading to unreliable recommendations. Despite this risk, the intrinsic investment biases of LLMs remain underexplored. We propose an experimental framework to investigate emergent behaviors in such conflict scenarios, offering a quantitative analysis of bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract the latent biases of models and measure their persistence. Our analysis, centered on sector, size, and momentum, reveals distinct, model-specific biases. Across most models, a tendency to prefer technology stocks, large-cap stocks, and contrarian strategies is observed. These foundational biases often escalate into confirmation bias, causing models to cling to initial judgments even when faced with increasing counter-evidence. A public leaderboard benchmarking bias across a broader set of models is available at https://linqalpha.com/leaderboard</description>

      <title>An extended Merton problem with relaxed benchmark tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10802v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies Merton's problem in an extended formulation by incorporating the benchmark tracking on the wealth process. We consider a tracking formulation where the fund manager aims to maximize the trade-off between the expected utility of consumption and the expected largest shortfall of the wealth with reference to the benchmark level. Equivalently, the problem can be interpreted as a mixed stochastic control problem if a fictitious capital injection singular control is allowed, subjecting to the dynamic constraint that the wealth process compensated by the costly capital injection outperforms the benchmark at all times. By considering an auxiliary state process, we formulate an equivalent stochastic control problem with state reflections at zero. For general utility functions and Ito's diffusion benchmark process, we develop a convex duality theorem, new to the literature, to the auxiliary stochastic control problem with state reflections in which the dual process also exhibits reflections from above. For CRRA utility and geometric Brownian motion benchmark process, we further derive the optimal portfolio and consumption in feedback form using the new duality theorem, allowing us to discuss some interesting financial implications induced by the additional risk-taking from the capital injection and the goal of tracking.</description>
