      <title>Evolution and Monotonicity of Geometric Constants under Extended Ricci Flows with Variable Coupling Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the evolution and monotonicity of geometric constants within the framework of extended Ricci flows, incorporating variable coupling parameters. Building on Hamiltons foundational Ricci flow and subsequent extensions by List (2008), we introduce modifications to the extended Ricci flow by varying parameters that affect the interaction between the metric and scalar fields. Specifically, we modify the coefficients in the evolution equations governing geometric constants, thereby introducing new degrees of freedom in the analysis. The primary contributions include deriving evolution formulas for the modified geometric constant lambda under the extended and normalized extended Ricci flows, and proving conditions under which monotonicity is maintained.</description>

      <title>The buckling and clamped plate problems on differential forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the buckling and clamped-plate problems to the context of differential forms on compact Riemannian manifolds with smooth boundary. We characterize their smallest eigenvalues and prove that, in the case of Euclidean domains, their spectra on forms coincide with the spectra of the corresponding problems. We obtain various estimates involving the first eigenvalues of the mentioned problems and the ones of the Hodge Laplacian with respect to Dirichlet and absolute boundary conditions on forms. These estimates generalize previous ones in the case of functions.</description>

      <title>Initial value problems on cohomogeneity one manifolds, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study initial value problems for various geometric equations on a cohomogeneity manifold near a singular orbit. We show that when prescribing the Ricci curvature, or finding solutions to the Einstein and soliton equations, there exist solutions near the singular orbit, unique up to a finite number of constants. In part I we make a special assumption that significantly simplifies the proof, and will solve the general case in Part II.</description>

      <title>Weighted extremal K\"ahler metrics on resolutions of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing previous results of Arezzo-Pacard-Singer, Seyyedali-Sz\'ekelyhidi and Hallam, we prove the invariance under smooth blowups of the class of weighted extremal K\"ahler manifolds, modulo a log-concavity assumption on the first weight. Through recent work of Di Nezza-Jubert-Lahdili and Han-Liu, this is obtained as a consequence of a general uniform coercivity estimate for the (relative, weighted) Mabuchi energy on the blowup, which applies more generally to any equivariant resolution of singularities of Fano type of a compact K\"ahler klt space whose Mabuchi energy is assumed to be coercive.</description>

      <title>On the non-collapsed RCD spaces with local bounded covering geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a RCD$(-(N-1),N)$ space $(X,d,\mathcal{H}^N)$ with local bounded covering geometry. The first result is related to Gromov's almost flat manifold theorem. Specifically, if for every point $\tilde{p}$ in the universal cover $\widetilde{X}$, we have $\mathcal{H}^N(B_1(\tilde{p})) \ge v &gt; 0$ and the diameter of $X$ is sufficiently small, then $X$ is biH\"{o}lder homeomorphic to an infranil-manifold. Moreover, if $X$ is a smooth Riemannian $N$-manifold with $\mathrm{Ric} \ge -(N-1)$, then $X$ is biH\"{o}lder diffeomorphic to an infranil-manifold. An application of our argument is to confirm the conjecture that Gromov's almost flat manifold theorem holds in the $\mathrm{RCD}+\mathrm{CBA}$ setting.
  The second result concerns a regular fibration theorem. Let $(X_i,d_i,\mathcal{H}^N)$ be a sequence of RCD$(-(N-1),N)$ spaces converging to a compact smooth $k$-dimensional manifold $K$ in the Gromov-Hausdorff sense. Assume that for any $p_i \in X_i$, the local universal cover is non-collapsing, i.e., for any pre-image point $\tilde{p}_i$ of $p_i$ in the universal cover of the ball $B_3(p_i)$, we have $\mathcal{H}^N(B_{1}(\tilde{p}_i)) \ge v$ for some fixed $v&gt;0$. Then for sufficiently large $i$, there exists a fibration map $f_i:X_i \to K$, where the fiber is an infra-nilmanifold and the structure group is affine.</description>

      <title>Some computations on trivial canonical-bundle solvmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Dolbeault and the Bott-Chern cohomology of six dimensional solvmanifolds endowed with a complex structure of splitting type, introduced by Kasuya, and with trivial canonical bundle. We build, following results by Angella and Kasuya, finite dimensional double subcomplexes $(C_\Gamma^{\bullet,\bullet},\partial,\bar{\partial})\subseteq(\wedge^{\bullet,\bullet}G/\Gamma,\partial,\bar{\partial})$ for which the inclusion is an isomorphism in cohomology. We decompose such double complexes into indecomposable ones. Lastly, we study some notions of formality for this class of manifolds, giving a characterization of the $\partial\bar{\partial}$-Lemma property in general complex dimension, and we compute triple ABC-Massey products on them.</description>

      <title>Minimal surfaces in the Riemannian product of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal surfaces in the Riemannian product of surfaces of constant curvature have been considered recently, particularly as these products arise as spaces of oriented geodesics of 3-dimensional space-forms. This papers considers more general Riemannian products of surfaces and explores geometric and topological restrictions that arise for minimal surfaces. We show that generically, a totally geodesic surface in a Riemannian product is locally either a slice or a product of geodesics. If the Gauss curvatures of the factors are negative, it is proven that there are no minimal 2-spheres, while minimal 2-tori are Lagrangian with respect to both product symplectic structures. If the surfaces have non-zero bounded curvatures, we establish a sharp lower bound on the area of minimal 2-spheres and explore the properties of the Gauss and normal curvatures of general compact minimal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Nakajima quiver bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Nakajima bundle representation. Given a labelled quiver and a variety or manifold $X$, such a representation involves an assignment of a complex vector bundle on $X$ to each node of the doubled quiver; to the edges, we assign sections of, and connections on, associated twisted bundles. We for the most part restrict attention in our development to algebraic curves or Riemann surfaces. Our construction simultaneously generalizes ordinary Nakajima quiver representations on the one hand and quiver bundles on the other hand. These representations admit gauge-theoretic characterizations, analogous to the ADHM equations in the original work of Nakajima, allowing for the construction of these generalized quiver varieties using a reduction procedure with moment maps. We study the deformation theory of Nakajima bundle representations, prove a Hitchin-Kobayashi correspondence between such representations and stable quiver bundles, examine the natural torus action on the resulting moduli varieties, and comment on scenarios where the variety is hyperk\"ahler. Finally, we produce concrete examples that recover known and new moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Existence results for Toda systems with sign-changing prescribed functions: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a compact Riemann surface with area $1$, we shall study the Toda system $$
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta u_1 = 2\rho_1(h_1e^{u_1}-1) - \rho_2(h_2e^{u_2}-1),\\
  -\Delta u_2 = 2\rho_2(h_2e^{u_2}-1) - \rho_1(h_1e^{u_1}-1),
  \end{cases} $$ on $(M,g)$ with $\rho_1=4\pi$, $\rho_2\in(0,4\pi)$, $h_1$ and $h_2$ are two smooth functions on $M$. In Jost-Lin-Wang's celebrated article (Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 59 (2006), no. 4, 526--558), they obtained a sufficient condition for the existence of this Toda system when $h_1$ and $h_2$ are both positive. In this paper, we shall improve this result to the case $h_1$ and $h_2$ can change signs. We shall pursue a variational method and use the standard blowup analysis. Among other things, the main contribution in our proof is to show the blowup can only happen at one point where $h_1$ is positive.</description>

Abstract: We review recent results regarding the problem of the stability of Sobolev inequalities on Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature lower bounds. We shall describe techniques and methods from smooth and non-smooth geometry, the fruitful combination of which revealed particularly effective. Furthermore, we present a self-contained overview of the proof of the stability of the Sobolev inequality on manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and Euclidean volume growth, adopting a direct strategy tailored to this setting. Finally, we discuss related stability results and present some open problems.</description>

      <title>Boundary value problems for 0-elliptic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a manifold with boundary, and let $L$ be a 0-elliptic operator on X which is semi-Fredholm essentially surjective with infinite-dimensional kernel. Examples include Hodge Laplacians and Dirac operators on conformally compact manifolds. We construct left and right parametrices for L when supplemented with appropriate elliptic boundary conditions. The construction relies on a new calculus of pseudodifferential operators on functions over both $X$ and $\partial X$, which we call the "symbolic 0-calculus". This new calculus supplements the ordinary 0-calculus of Mazzeo--Melrose, enabling it to handle boundary value problems. In the original 0-calculus, operators are characterized as polyhomogeneous right densities on a blow-up of $X^2$. By contrast, operators in the symbolic 0-calculus are characterized (locally near each point of the boundary of the diagonal) as quantizations of polyhomogeneous symbols on appropriate blown-up model spaces.</description>

Abstract: We introduce maximal discs of Weil-Petersson class in $\mathbb{A}\mathrm{d}\mathbb{S}^{2,1}$ whose deformation space can be understood as the cotangent bundle of Weil-Petersson universal Teichm\"uller space $T_0(1)$. We show that the Mess map is a symplectic diffeomorphism from $T^*T_0(1)$ to $T_0(1)\times T_0(1)$ for a canonical symplectic form on $T^*T_0(1)$ and the difference of two Weil-Petersson symplectic forms on $T_0(1)\times T_0(1)$. Moreover, we show that the anti-holomorphic energy functional of the induced Gauss map is a K\"ahler potential of the canonical symplectic form over certain subspaces of $T^*T_0(1)$.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic spinors and horospheres in 4-dimensional hyperbolic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give explicit bijective correspondences between three families of objects: certain pairs of quaternions, which we regard as spinors; certain flags in (1+4)-dimensional Minkowski space; and horospheres in 4-dimensional hyperbolic space decorated with certain pairs of spinorial directions. These correspondences generalise previous work of the first author, Penrose--Rindler, and Penner in lower dimensions, and use the description of 4-dimensional hyperbolic isometries via Clifford matrices studied by Ahlfors and others.
  We show that lambda lengths generalise to 4 dimensions, where they take quaternionic values, and are given by a certain bilinear form on quaternionic spinors. They satisfy a non-commutative Ptolemy equation, arising from quasi-Pl\"ucker relations in the Gel'fand--Retakh theory of noncommutative determinants. We also study various structures of geometric and topological interest that arise in the process.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathfrak q=Lie Q$ be an algebraic Lie algebra of index 1, i.e., a generic $Q$-orbit on $\mathfrak q^*$ has codimension 1. We show that the following conditions are equivalent: $\mathfrak q$ is contact; a generic $Q$-orbit on $\mathfrak q^*$ is not conical; there is a generic stabiliser for the coadjoint action of $\mathfrak q$. In addition, if $\mathfrak q$ is contact, then the subalgebra $S(\mathfrak q)_{\sf si}\subset S(\mathfrak q)$ generated by symmetric semi-invariants of $\mathfrak q$ is a polynomial ring. We study also affine seaweed Lie algebras of type ${\sf A}$ and find some contact as well as non-contact examples among them.</description>

      <title>Differential forms on diffeological spaces and diffeological gluing, I</title>

      <description>arXiv:1605.07328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to describe the behavior of diffeological differential forms under the operation of gluing of diffeological spaces along a smooth map. In the diffeological context, two ways of looking at diffeological forms are available, that of the vector space of all diffeological forms on a given space, and that of the pseudo-bundle of values of these forms. We describe the behavior of the former under a gluing of diffeological spaces.</description>

      <title>Sections of time-like twistor spaces with light-like or zero covariant derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conformal Gauss maps of time-like minimal surfaces in $E^3_1$ give sections of the time-like twistor spaces associated with the pull-back bundles such that the covariant derivatives are fully light-like, that is, these are either light-like or zero, and do not vanish at any point. For an oriented neutral $4n$-manifold $(M, h)$, if $J$ is an $h$-reversing almost paracomplex structure of $M$ such that $\nabla J$ is locally given by the tensor product of a nowhere zero 1-form and an almost nilpotent structure related to $J$, then we will see that $\nabla J$ is valued in a light-like $2n$-dimensional distribution $\mathcal{D}$ such that $(M , h, \mathcal{D} )$ is a Walker manifold and that the square norm $\parallel\!\nabla J\!\parallel^2$ of $\nabla J$ vanishes. We will obtain examples of $h$-reversing almost paracomplex structures of $E^{4n}_{2n}$ as above. In addition, we will obtain all the pairs of $h$-reversing almost paracomplex structures of $E^4_2$ such that each pair gives sections of the two time-like twistor spaces with fully light-like covariant derivatives.</description>

      <title>On the limit of simply connected manifolds with discrete isometric cocompact group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study complete, connected and simply connected $n$-dim Riemannian manifold $M$ satisfying Ricci curvature lower bound. Further more, suppose that $M$ admits discrete isometric group actions $G$ so that the diameter of the quotient space $\mathrm{diam}(M/G)$ is bounded. In particular, for any $n$-manifold $N$ satisfying $\mathrm{diam}(N) \le D$ and $\mathrm{Ric} \ge -(n-1)$, the universal cover and fundamental group $(\widetilde{N},G)$ satisfies the above condition.
  Let $\{(M_i,p_i)\}_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$ be a sequence of complete, connected and simply connected $n$-dim Riemmannian manifolds satisfying $\mathrm{Ric} \ge -(n-1)$. Let $G_i$ be a discrete subgroup of $\mathrm{Iso}(M_i)$ such that $\mathrm{diam}(M_i/G_i) \le D$ where $D&gt;0$ is fixed. Passing to a subsequence, $(M_i, p_i,G_i)$ equivariantly pointed-Gromov-Hausdorff converges to $(X,p,G)$. Then $G$ is a Lie group by Cheeger-Colding and Colding-Naber. We shall show that the identity component $G_0$ is a nilpotent Lie group. Therefore there is a maximal torus $T^k$ in $G$. Our main result is that $X/T^k$ is simply connected. Moreover, $\pi_1(X,p)$ is generated by loops contained in the $T^k$-orbits up to conjugation; each of these loops can be represented by $\alpha^{-1} \cdot \beta \cdot \alpha$ where $\alpha$ is a curve from $y$ to $p$ for some $y \in X$, and $\beta$ is a loop at $y$ contained in the $T^k$-orbit of $y$.</description>

Abstract: We construct connection maps and linear symmetric connections on tangent and second-order tangent bundles for \fr manifolds using the notion of a spray. For these manifolds, we characterize linear symmetric connections on tangent bundles in terms of bilinear symmetric mappings associated with sprays. We also provide an alternative characterization of these connections using tangent structures. Furthermore, we prove that a bijective correspondence exists between linear symmetric connections on tangent bundles and sprays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.02567v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a Floer type boundary operator for generalised Morse-Smale dynamical systems on compact smooth manifolds by counting the number of suitable flow lines between closed (both homoclinic and periodic) orbits and isolated critical points. The same principle works for the discrete situation of general combinatorial vector fields, defined by Forman, on CW complexes. We can thus recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ homology of both smooth and discrete structures directly from the flow lines (V-paths) of our vector field.</description>

Abstract: A $b$-contact structure on a $b$-manifold $(M,Z)$ is a Jacobi structure on $M$ satisfying a transversality condition along the hypersurface $Z$. We show that, in three dimensions, $b$-contact structures with overtwisted three-dimensional leaves satisfy an existence $h$-principle that allows prescribing the induced singular foliation. We give a method to classify $b$-contact structures on a given $b$-manifold and use it to give a classification on $S^3$ with either a two-sphere or an unknotted torus as the critical surface. We also discuss generalizations to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>What is the probability that a random symmetric tensor is close to rank-one?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the general problem of estimating the probability that a real symmetric tensor is close to rank-one tensors. Using Weyl's tube formula, we turn this question into a differential geometric one involving the study of metric invariants of the real Veronese variety. More precisely, we give an explicit formula for its reach and curvature coefficients with respect to the Bombieri-Weyl metric. These results are obtained using techniques from Random Matrix theory and an explicit description of the second fundamental form of the Veronese variety in terms of GOE matrices. Our findings give a complete solution to the original problem. In the case of rational normal curves it leads to a simple formula describing explicitly exponential decay with respect to the degree of the tensor.</description>

      <title>Deformation quantization with separation of variables of $G_{2,4}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the deformation quantization with separation of variables on the Grassmannian $G_{2,4}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$. The star product on $G_{2,4}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$ can be explicitly determined as the solution of the recurrence relations for $G_{2,4}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$ given by Hara and one of the authors (A. S.). To give the solution of the recurrence relations, it is necessary to solve a system of linear equations at each order. However, to give the concrete expression of the general term is not easy because the variables increase with the order of the differentiation of the star product. For this reason, there has been no formula to express the general term of the recurrence relations. In this paper, by overcoming this problem by transforming the recurrence relations into simpler ones, we obtain the formula for the general term. We solve the recurrence relations by using creation and annihilation operators on a Fock space. From this solution, we obtain the explicit formula of the star product with separation of variables on $G_{2,4}\left(\mathbb{C}\right)$.</description>

      <title>Random Systems of Holomorphic Sections of a Sequence of Line bundles on Compact K\"{a}hler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper primarily establishes a novel asymptotic variance estimate for smooth linear statistics associated with zero sets of systems of random holomorphic sections in a sequence of positive Hermitian holomorphic line bundles on a compact K\"ahler manifold $(X, \omega)$. Using this variance estimate and the expected distribution, we derive an equidistribution result for zeros of these random systems, which, in terms of approximation theory, proves that the smooth positive closed form $\omega^{k}$ can be approximated by currents of integration along analytic subsets of $X$ of codimension $k$, $k \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$. The probability measures taken into consideration in this paper are sufficiently general to include a wide range of the measures commonly encountered in the literature, for which we give equidistribution results at the end, such as the standard Gaussian measure, Fubini-Study measure, the area measure of spheres, probability measures whose distributions have bounded densities with logarithmically decaying tails and locally moderate measures among others.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09217v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the symmetry groups and winding numbers of planar curves obtained as images of weighted sums of exponentials. More generally, we study the image of the complex unit circle under a finite or infinite Laurent series using a particular parametrization of the circle. We generalize various previous results on such sums of exponentials and relate them to other classes of curves present in the literature. Moreover, we consider the evolution under the wave equation of such curves for the case of binomials. Interestingly, our methods provide a unified and systematic way of constructing curves with prescribed properties, such as the number of cusps, the number of intersection points or the winding number.</description>

      <title>RETR: Multi-View Radar Detection Transformer for Indoor Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indoor radar perception has seen rising interest due to affordable costs driven by emerging automotive imaging radar developments and the benefits of reduced privacy concerns and reliability under hazardous conditions (e.g., fire and smoke). However, existing radar perception pipelines fail to account for distinctive characteristics of the multi-view radar setting. In this paper, we propose Radar dEtection TRansformer (RETR), an extension of the popular DETR architecture, tailored for multi-view radar perception. RETR inherits the advantages of DETR, eliminating the need for hand-crafted components for object detection and segmentation in the image plane. More importantly, RETR incorporates carefully designed modifications such as 1) depth-prioritized feature similarity via a tunable positional encoding (TPE); 2) a tri-plane loss from both radar and camera coordinates; and 3) a learnable radar-to-camera transformation via reparameterization, to account for the unique multi-view radar setting. Evaluated on two indoor radar perception datasets, our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 15.38+ AP for object detection and 11.91+ IoU for instance segmentation, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We show that there is a topology on the group of loops in euclidean space such that this group is embedded in a Lie group which is simple relative to the loops. An extension of this Lie group gives the structural group of a principal bundle with connection whose holonomy coincides with the Chen signature map. We also give an alternative geometric new proof of Chen signature Theorem.</description>
