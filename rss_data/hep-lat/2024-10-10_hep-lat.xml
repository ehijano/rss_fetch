      <title>Exact space-time symmetry conservation and automatic mesh refinement for classical lattice field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breaking of space-time symmetries and the non-conservation of the associated Noether charges constitutes a central artifact in lattice field theory. In prior work we have shown how to overcome this limitation for classical actions describing point particle motion, using the world-line formalism of general relativity. The key is to treat coordinate maps (from an abstract parameter space into space-time) as dynamical and dependent degrees of freedom, which remain continuous after discretization of the underlying parameter space. Here we present latest results where we construct a reparameterization invariant classical action for scalar fields, which features dynamical coordinate maps. We highlight the following achievements of our approach: 1) global space-time symmetries remain intact after discretization and the associated Noether charges remain exactly preserved 2) coordinate maps adapt to the dynamics of the scalar field leading to adaptive grid resolution guided by the symmetries.</description>

      <title>QCD deconfinement transition line up to $\mu_B=400$ MeV from finite volume lattice simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The QCD cross-over line in the temperature ($T$) -- baryo-chemical potential ($\mu_B$) plane has been computed by several lattice groups by calculating the chiral order parameter and its susceptibility at finite values of $\mu_B$. In this work we focus on the deconfinement aspect of the transition between hadronic and Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) phases. We define the deconfinement temperature as the peak position of the static quark entropy ($S_Q(T,\mu_B)$) in $T$, which is based on the renormalized Polyakov loop. We extrapolate $S_Q(T,\mu_B)$ based on high statistics finite temperature ensembles on a $16^3\times 8$ lattice to finite density by means of a Taylor expansion to eighth order in $\mu_B$ (NNNLO) along the strangeness neutral line. For the simulations the 4HEX staggered action was used with 2+1 flavors at physical quark masses. In this setup the phase diagram can be drawn up to unprecedentedly high chemical potentials. Our results for the deconfinement temperature are in rough agreement with phenomenological estimates of the freeze-out curve in relativistic heavy ion collisions. In addition, we study the width of the deconfinement crossover. We show that up to $\mu_B \approx 400$ MeV, the deconfinement transition gets broader at higher densities, disfavoring the existence of a deconfinement critical endpoint in this range. Finally, we examine the transition line without the strangeness neutrality condition and observe a hint for the narrowing of the crossover towards large $\mu_B$.</description>

      <title>Thermomagnetic effects on light pseudo-scalar meson masses within the SU(3) Nambu-Jona--Lasinio model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the screening masses of pseudoscalar mesons in a hot and strongly magnetized medium within the framework of the SU(3) Nambu-Jona--Lasinio model, using a magnetic field-independent regularization scheme. Inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) is implemented through the use of a magnetic field-dependent coupling $G(B)$, fitted to reproduce lattice QCD results for the pseudocritical chiral transition temperature $T_c^B$. For the external homogeneous magnetic field considered, neutral screening masses separate in two types: perpendicular and parallel to the direction of the field, while for charged mesons only parallel energies can be defined for each Landau level. We obtain $m_{\mathrm{scr},\perp} &gt; m_{\mathrm{scr},\parallel}$, as expected from causality. Thermally, all screening energies are almost constant until some critical temperature, whose behavior is correlated with $T_c^B$. They rapidly increase around this value, keeping a steady enhancement afterwards due to thermal excitation. Magnetically, neutral parallel masses are enhanced (suppressed) at high temperatures when considering $G(B)$ ($G$). Perpendicular ones display a non-linear magnetic behavior for $G$ (due to increasing $T_c^B$), while they always increase with $B$ for $G(B)$. Charged parallel energies are also always magnetically enhanced. In the high-temperature limit, we show that both neutral and charged screening energies converge to $2\pi T$. At $B=0$ the model overestimates the remaining quark interaction in this regime. At $B\neq 0$ we find that, when IMC is accounted for, the interaction is suppressed as $B$ increases, a fact that appears to be at odds with currently available lattice QCD results.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Abelian and nonAbelian gauge Higgs theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauge symmetries and Higgs mechanisms are key features of theories describing high-energy particle physics and collective phenomena in statistical and condensed-matter physics. In this review we address the collective behavior of systems of multicomponent scalar fields interacting with gauge fields, which can be already present in the underlying microscopic system or emerge only at criticality. The interplay between local gauge and global symmetries determines the phase diagram, the nature of the Higgs phases, and the nature of phase transitions between the high-temperature disordered and the low-temperature Higgs phases. However, further crucial features determine the universal properties of the critical behaviors at continuous transitions. Specifically, their nature also depends on the role played by the gauge modes at criticality: effective (Abelian or nonAbelian) gauge Higgs field theories emerge if gauge modes develop critical correlations, while more standard critical behaviors occur in the case they remain short ranged at the transition. In the latter case, gauge fields only prevent non-gauge invariant correlators from becoming critical. This review covers the recent progress made in the study of Higgs systems with Abelian and nonAbelian gauge fields. We mainly focus on three-dimensional systems, and briefly discuss two-dimensional systems, whose equilibrium statistical properties are described by a classical partition function. However, by using the quantum-to-classical mapping, the results on the critical behavior for classical systems in $D=d+1$ dimensions can be extended to quantum transitions in $d$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Observation of disorder-free localization and efficient disorder averaging on a quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most challenging problems in the computational study of localization in quantum manybody systems is to capture the effects of rare events, which requires sampling over exponentially many disorder realizations. We implement an efficient procedure on a quantum processor, leveraging quantum parallelism, to efficiently sample over all disorder realizations. We observe localization without disorder in quantum many-body dynamics in one and two dimensions: perturbations do not diffuse even though both the generator of evolution and the initial states are fully translationally invariant. The disorder strength as well as its density can be readily tuned using the initial state. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our platform by measuring Renyi entropies. Our method could also be extended to higher moments of the physical observables and disorder learning.</description>

      <title>Building imaginary-time thermal field theory with artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel approach in quantum field theories to estimate the action using the artificial neural networks (ANNs). The estimation is achieved by learning on system configurations governed by the Boltzmann factor, $e^{-S}$ at different temperatures within the imaginary time formalism of thermal field theory. We focus on 0+1 dimensional quantum field with kink/anti-kink configurations to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. The continuous-mixture autoregressive networks (CANs) enable the construction of accurate effective actions with tractable probability density estimation. Our numerical results demonstrate that this methodology not only facilitates the construction of effective actions at specified temperatures but also adeptly estimates the action at intermediate temperatures using data from both lower and higher temperature ensembles. This capability is especially valuable for the detailed exploration of phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Potential of the Polyakov Loop in SU(3) Quenched Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using SU(3) lattice QCD, we study for the first time the effective potential of the Polyakov loop $\langle P \rangle$ at finite temperature, i.e., the thermodynamic potential, in the field-theoretical way. In the framework of the reweighting method in lattice QCD, we express the effective potential $V_{\rm eff}(\langle P \rangle)$ using the expectation value without a source term. In particular, we consider the most difficult and interesting case of vacuum coexistence at the critical temperature $T_c$. We adopt SU(3) quenched lattice QCD on $48^3 \times 6$ at $\beta$= 5.89379, which corresponds exactly to the critical temperature $T_c$ of the deconfinement phase transition, and use 200,000 Monte Carlo configurations. After categorizing the gauge configurations into one $Z_3$-symmetric and three $Z_3$-broken vacua each, we perform a vacuum-associated reweighting method, using the gauge configurations around each vacuum separately. Finally, we obtain the Polyakov-loop effective potential, which is well depicted around the $Z_3$-symmetric and $Z_3$-broken vacua.</description>

      <title>Global aspects of $3$-form gauge theory: implications for axion-Yang-Mills systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the proposition that axion-Yang-Mills systems are characterized by a $3$-form gauge theory in the deep infrared regime. This hypothesis is rigorously examined by initially developing a systematic framework for analyzing $3$-form gauge theory coupled to an axion, specifically focusing on its global properties. The theory consists of a BF term deformed by marginal and irrelevant operators and describes a network of vacua separated by domain walls converging at the junction of an axion string. It encompasses $0$- and $3$-form spontaneously broken global symmetries. Utilizing this framework, in conjunction with effective field theory techniques and 't Hooft anomaly-matching conditions, we argue that the $3$-form gauge theory faithfully captures the infrared physics of the axion-Yang-Mills system. The ultraviolet theory is an $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory endowed with a massless Dirac fermion coupled to a complex scalar and is characterized by chiral and genuine $\mathbb{Z}_m^{(1)}$ $1$-form center symmetries, with a mixed anomaly between them. It features two scales: the vev of the complex scalar, $v$, and the strong-coupling scale, $\Lambda$, with $\Lambda \ll v$. Below $v$, the fermion decouples and a $U(1)^{(2)}$ $2$-form winding symmetry emerge, while the $1$-form symmetry is enhanced to $\mathbb Z_N^{(1)}$. As we flow below $\Lambda$, matching the mixed anomaly necessitates introducing a dynamical $3$-form gauge field of $U(1)^{(2)}$, which appears as the incarnation of a long-range tail of the color field. The infrared theory possesses spontaneously broken chiral and emergent $3$-form global symmetries. It passes several checks, among which: it displays the expected restructuring in the hadronic sector upon transition between the vacua, and it is consistent under the gauging of the genuine $\mathbb Z_m^{(1)}\subset \mathbb Z_N^{(1)}$ symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The program ftint is introduced which numerically evaluates dimensionally regulated integrals as they occur in the perturbative approach to the gradient-flow formalism in quantum field theory. It relies on sector decomposition in order to determine the coefficients of the individual orders in $\epsilon=(4-D)/2$, where $D$ is the space-time dimension. For that purpose, it implements an interface to the public library pySecDec. The current version works for massive and massless integrals up to three-loop level with vanishing external momenta, but the underlying method is extendable to more general cases.</description>

      <title>Inverse Spin Hall Effect in Nonequilibrium Dirac Systems Induced by Anomalous Flow Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Dirac fermions in the presence of a space-dependent chiral gauge field and thermodynamic gradients, establishing a connection to the inverse spin Hall effect. The chiral gauge field induces a chiral magnetic field, resulting in a surface Fermi arc state and a chiral Landau level state which, although is delocalized in the bulk, we show to be more robust against impurities. By applying chemical potential and temperature gradients, we achieve nonzero charge currents, with each gradient leading to distinct Fermi level dependencies, both of which have been observed in a recent experiment. Unlike the conventional mixed axial-gravitational anomaly, our currents require a noncollinear chiral magnetic field and thermodynamic gradient. We further derive low-energy transport formulas and demonstrate the importance of carefully treating the ultraviolet cutoff for understanding our lattice calculations.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Gravitational Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving analysis of strong interaction quantum field equations is used to complete a unified treatment of pion, kaon, nucleon electromagnetic and gravitational form factors. Findings include a demonstration that the pion near-core pressure is roughly twice that in the proton, so both are significantly greater than that of a neutron star; parton species separations of the nucleon's three gravitational form factors, in which, inter alia, the glue-to-quark ratio for each form factor is seen to take the same constant value, independent of momentum transfer; and a determination of proton radii orderings, with the mechanical (normal force) radius being less than the mass-energy radius, which is less than the proton charge radius. This body of predictions should prove useful in an era of anticipated experiments that will enable them to be tested.</description>
