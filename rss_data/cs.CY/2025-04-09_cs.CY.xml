      <title>Not someone, but something: Rethinking trust in the age of medical AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes embedded in healthcare, trust in medical decision-making is changing fast. This opinion paper argues that trust in AI isn't a simple transfer from humans to machines -- it's a dynamic, evolving relationship that must be built and maintained. Rather than debating whether AI belongs in medicine, this paper asks: what kind of trust must AI earn, and how? Drawing from philosophy, bioethics, and system design, it explores the key differences between human trust and machine reliability -- emphasizing transparency, accountability, and alignment with the values of care. It argues that trust in AI shouldn't rely on mimicking empathy or intuition, but on thoughtful design, responsible deployment, and clear moral responsibility. The goal is a balanced view -- one that avoids blind optimism and reflexive fear. Trust in AI must be treated not as a given, but as something to be earned over time.</description>

      <title>When is using AI the rational choice? The importance of counterfactuals in AI deployment decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decisions to deploy AI capabilities are often driven by counterfactuals - a comparison of decisions made using AI to decisions that would have been made if the AI were not used. Counterfactual misses, which are poor decisions that are attributable to using AI, may have disproportionate disutility to AI deployment decision makers. Counterfactual hits, which are good decisions attributable to AI usage, may provide little benefit beyond the benefit of better decisions. This paper explores how to include counterfactual outcomes into usage decision expected utility assessments. Several properties emerge when counterfactuals are explicitly included. First, there are many contexts where the expected utility of AI usage is positive for intended beneficiaries and strongly negative for stakeholders and deployment decision makers. Second, high levels of complementarity, where differing AI and user assessments are merged beneficially, often leads to substantial disutility for stakeholders. Third, apparently small changes in how users interact with an AI capability can substantially impact stakeholder utility. Fourth, cognitive biases such as expert overconfidence and hindsight bias exacerbate the perceived frequency of costly counterfactual misses. The expected utility assessment approach presented here is intended to help AI developers and deployment decision makers to navigate the subtle but substantial impact of counterfactuals so as to better ensure that beneficial AI capabilities are used.</description>

      <title>Connecting Feedback to Choice: Understanding Educator Preferences in GenAI vs. Human-Created Lesson Plans in K-12 Education -- A Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative AI (GenAI) models are increasingly explored for educational applications, understanding educator preferences for AI-generated lesson plans is critical for their effective integration into K-12 instruction. This exploratory study compares lesson plans authored by human curriculum designers, a fine-tuned LLaMA-2-13b model trained on K-12 content, and a customized GPT-4 model to evaluate their pedagogical quality across multiple instructional measures: warm-up activities, main tasks, cool-down activities, and overall quality. Using a large-scale preference study with K-12 math educators, we examine how preferences vary across grade levels and instructional components. We employ both qualitative and quantitative analyses. The raw preference results indicate that human-authored lesson plans are generally favored, particularly for elementary education, where educators emphasize student engagement, scaffolding, and collaborative learning. However, AI-generated models demonstrate increasing competitiveness in cool-down tasks and structured learning activities, particularly in high school settings. Beyond quantitative results, we conduct thematic analysis using LDA and manual coding to identify key factors influencing educator preferences. Educators value human-authored plans for their nuanced differentiation, real-world contextualization, and student discourse facilitation. Meanwhile, AI-generated lesson plans are often praised for their structure and adaptability for specific instructional tasks. Findings suggest a human-AI collaborative approach to lesson planning, where GenAI can serve as an assistive tool rather than a replacement for educator expertise in lesson planning. This study contributes to the growing discourse on responsible AI integration in education, highlighting both opportunities and challenges in leveraging GenAI for curriculum development.</description>

      <title>Balancing Benefits and Risks: RL Approaches for Addiction-Aware Social Media Recommenders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms provide valuable opportunities for users to gather information, interact with friends, and enjoy entertainment. However, their addictive potential poses significant challenges, including overuse and negative psycho-logical or behavioral impacts [4, 2, 8]. This study explores strategies to mitigate compulsive social media usage while preserving its benefits and ensuring economic sustainability, focusing on recommenders that promote balanced usage.
  We analyze user behaviors arising from intrinsic diversities and environmental interactions, offering insights for next-generation social media recommenders that prioritize well-being. Specifically, we examine the temporal predictability of overuse and addiction using measures available to recommenders, aiming to inform mechanisms that prevent addiction while avoiding user disengagement [7].
  Building on RL-based computational frameworks for addiction modelling [6], our study introduces: - A recommender system adapting to user preferences, introducing non-stationary and non-Markovian dynamics.
  - Differentiated state representations for users and recommenders to capture nuanced interactions.
  - Distinct usage conditions-light and heavy use-addressing RL's limitations in distinguishing prolonged from healthy engagement.
  - Complexity in overuse impacts, highlighting their role in user adaptation [7].
  Simulations demonstrate how model-based (MB) and model-free (MF) decision-making interact with environmental dynamics to influence user behavior and addiction. Results reveal the significant role of recommender systems in shaping addiction tendencies or fostering healthier engagement. These findings support ethical, adaptive recommender design, advancing sustainable social media ecosystems [9, 1].

      <title>Unequal Opportunities: Examining the Bias in Geographical Recommendations by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have made them a popular information-seeking tool among end users. However, the statistical training methods for LLMs have raised concerns about their representation of under-represented topics, potentially leading to biases that could influence real-world decisions and opportunities. These biases could have significant economic, social, and cultural impacts as LLMs become more prevalent, whether through direct interactions--such as when users engage with chatbots or automated assistants--or through their integration into third-party applications (as agents), where the models influence decision-making processes and functionalities behind the scenes. Our study examines the biases present in LLMs recommendations of U.S. cities and towns across three domains: relocation, tourism, and starting a business. We explore two key research questions: (i) How similar LLMs responses are, and (ii) How this similarity might favor areas with certain characteristics over others, introducing biases. We focus on the consistency of LLMs responses and their tendency to over-represent or under-represent specific locations. Our findings point to consistent demographic biases in these recommendations, which could perpetuate a ``rich-get-richer'' effect that widens existing economic disparities.</description>

      <title>SoK: Frontier AI's Impact on the Cybersecurity Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As frontier AI advances rapidly, understanding its impact on cybersecurity and inherent risks is essential to ensuring safe AI evolution (e.g., guiding risk mitigation and informing policymakers). While some studies review AI applications in cybersecurity, none of them comprehensively discuss AI's future impacts or provide concrete recommendations for navigating its safe and secure usage. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of frontier AI's impact on cybersecurity and establishes a systematic framework for risk assessment and mitigation. To this end, we first define and categorize the marginal risks of frontier AI in cybersecurity and then systemically analyze the current and future impacts of frontier AI in cybersecurity, qualitatively and quantitatively. We also discuss why frontier AI likely benefits attackers more than defenders in the short term from equivalence classes, asymmetry, and economic impact. Next, we explore frontier AI's impact on future software system development, including enabling complex hybrid systems while introducing new risks. Based on our findings, we provide security recommendations, including constructing fine-grained benchmarks for risk assessment, designing AI agents for defenses, building security mechanisms and provable defenses for hybrid systems, enhancing pre-deployment security testing and transparency, and strengthening defenses for users. Finally, we present long-term research questions essential for understanding AI's future impacts and unleashing its defensive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Single-Agent vs. Multi-Agent LLM Strategies for Automated Student Reflection Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated assessment of open-text student reflections and prediction of academic performance. Traditional methods for evaluating reflections are time-consuming and may not scale effectively in educational settings. In this work, we employ LLMs to transform student reflections into quantitative scores using two assessment strategies (single-agent and multi-agent) and two prompting techniques (zero-shot and few-shot). Our experiments, conducted on a dataset of 5,278 reflections from 377 students over three academic terms, demonstrate that the single-agent with few-shot strategy achieves the highest match rate with human evaluations. Furthermore, models utilizing LLM-assessed reflection scores outperform baselines in both at-risk student identification and grade prediction tasks. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively automate reflection assessment, reduce educators' workload, and enable timely support for students who may need additional assistance. Our work emphasizes the potential of integrating advanced generative AI technologies into educational practices to enhance student engagement and academic success.</description>

      <title>Building Proactive and Instant-Reactive Safety Designs to Address Harassment in Social Virtual Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social Virtual Reality (VR) games offer immersive socialization experiences but pose significant challenges of harassment. Common solutions, such as reporting and moderation, address harassment after it happens but fail to prevent or stop harassment in the moment. In this study, we explore and design proactive and instant-reactive safety designs to mitigate harassment in social VR. Proactive designs prevent harassment from occurring, while instant-reactive designs minimize harm during incidents. We explore three directions for design: user-initiated personal bubbles, clarifying social norms, and encouraging bystander intervention. Through an iterative process, we first conducted a formative interview study to determine design goals for making these features effective, fit user needs, and robust to manipulation. We then implemented Puffer, an integrated safety system that includes a suite of proactive and instant-reactive features, as a social VR prototype. From an evaluation using simulated scenarios with participants, we find evidence that Puffer can help protect players during emergencies, foster prosocial norms, and create more positive social interactions. We conclude by discussing how system safety features can be designed to complement existing proactive and instant-reactive strategies, particularly for people with marginalized identities.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Review Citations: Impact on Scientific Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of surveys and review articles in academic journals has impacted citation metrics like impact factor and h-index, skewing evaluations of journal and researcher quality. This work investigates the implications of this trend, focusing on the field of Computer Science, where a notable increase in review publications has led to inflated citation counts and rankings. While reviews serve as valuable literature overviews, they should not overshadow the primary goal of research -to advance scientific knowledge through original contributions. We advocate for prioritizing citations of primary research in journal articles to uphold citation integrity and ensure fair recognition of substantive contributions. This approach preserves the reliability of citation-based metrics and supports genuine scientific advancement.</description>

      <title>Computing for Community-Based Economies: A Sociotechnical Ecosystem for Democratic, Egalitarian and Sustainable Futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automation and industrial mass production, particularly in sectors with low wages, have harmful consequences that contribute to widening wealth disparities, excessive pollution, and worsened working conditions. Coupled with a mass consumption society, there is a risk of detrimental social outcomes and threats to democracy, such as misinformation and political polarization. But AI, robotics and other emerging technologies could also provide a transition to community-based economies, in which more democratic, egalitarian, and sustainable value circulations can be established. Based on both a review of case studies, and our own experiments in Detroit, we derive three core principles for the use of computing in community-based economies. The prefigurative principle requires that the development process itself incorporates equity goals, rather than viewing equity as something to be achieved in the future. The generative principle requires the prevention of value extraction, and its replacement by circulations in which value is returned back to the aspects of labor, nature, and society by which it is generated. And third, the solidarity principle requires that deployments at all scales and across all domains support both individual freedoms and opportunities for mutual aid. Thus we propose the use of computational technologies to develop a specifically generative form of community-based economy: one that is egalitarian regarding race, class and gender; sustainable both environmentally and socially; and democratic in the deep sense of putting people in control of their own lives and livelihoods.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Rabbit Hole: Emergent Biases in LLM-Generated Attack Narratives Targeting Mental Health Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to demonstrate imbalanced biases against certain groups. However, the study of unprovoked targeted attacks by LLMs towards at-risk populations remains underexplored. Our paper presents three novel contributions: (1) the explicit evaluation of LLM-generated attacks on highly vulnerable mental health groups; (2) a network-based framework to study the propagation of relative biases; and (3) an assessment of the relative degree of stigmatization that emerges from these attacks. Our analysis of a recently released large-scale bias audit dataset reveals that mental health entities occupy central positions within attack narrative networks, as revealed by a significantly higher mean centrality of closeness (p-value = 4.06e-10) and dense clustering (Gini coefficient = 0.7). Drawing from sociological foundations of stigmatization theory, our stigmatization analysis indicates increased labeling components for mental health disorder-related targets relative to initial targets in generation chains. Taken together, these insights shed light on the structural predilections of large language models to heighten harmful discourse and highlight the need for suitable approaches for mitigation.</description>

      <title>AIJIM: A Theoretical Model for Real-Time, Crowdsourced Environmental Journalism with AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17401v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environmental journalism is vital for raising awareness of ecological crises and supporting evidence-based policy, yet traditional methods suffer from delays, limited scalability, and lack of coverage in under-monitored regions. This paper introduces the Artificial Intelligence Journalism Integration Model (AIJIM), a conceptual and transferable theoretical model that structures real-time, AI-supported environmental journalism workflows.
  AIJIM combines citizen-sourced image data, automated hazard detection, dual-level validation (visual and textual), and AI-generated reporting. Validated through a pilot study in Mallorca, AIJIM achieved significant improvements in reporting speed and accuracy, while maintaining transparency and ethical oversight through Explainable AI (XAI), GDPR compliance, and community review. The model demonstrates high transferability and offers a new benchmark for scalable, responsible, and participatory journalism at the intersection of environmental communication and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Do Chinese models speak Chinese languages?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The release of top-performing open-weight LLMs has cemented China's role as a leading force in AI development. Do these models support languages spoken in China? Or do they speak the same languages as Western models? Comparing multilingual capabilities is important for two reasons. First, language ability provides insights into pre-training data curation, and thus into resource allocation and development priorities. Second, China has a long history of explicit language policy, varying between inclusivity of minority languages and a Mandarin-first policy. To test whether Chinese LLMs today reflect an agenda about China's languages, we test performance of Chinese and Western open-source LLMs on Asian regional and Chinese minority languages. Our experiments on Information Parity and reading comprehension show Chinese models' performance across these languages correlates strongly (r=0.93) with Western models', with the sole exception being better Mandarin. Sometimes, Chinese models cannot identify languages spoken by Chinese minorities such as Kazakh and Uyghur, even though they are good at French and German. These results provide a window into current development priorities, suggest options for future development, and indicate guidance for end users.</description>
