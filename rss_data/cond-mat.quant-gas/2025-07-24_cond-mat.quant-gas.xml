      <title>Correlation effects in one-dimensional metallic quantum wires under various confinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical response theory is used to investigate various transverse confinements on electron correlations in the ground state of a ferromagnetic one-dimensional quantum wire for different wire widths $b$ and density parameters $r_{\rm s}$. Using the first-order random phase approximation (FRPA), which provides the ground state structure beyond the random phase approximation, we compute the structure factor, pair-correlation function, correlation energy, and ground-state energy. The correlation energy depends on the choice of confinement model and hence effective electron-electron interaction. For the ultrathin wire ($b\rightarrow 0$) in the high-density limit, the correlation energy for transverse confinement models $V_1(q)$ (harmonic), $V_2(q)$ (cylindrical), and $V_5(q)$ (harmonic-delta) approaches $\epsilon_{\rm c}(r_{\rm s})= - \pi^2/360 \sim -0.02741$ a.u., which agrees with the exact results in this limit [J. Chem. Phys. 138, 064108 (2013); Phys. Rev. B 101, 075130 (2020)]. For at least these three confinement potentials, the one-dimensional Coulomb potential can be regularized at interparticle distance $x=0$ to yield the same correlation energy. In contrast, $V_3(q)$ (infinite square well), $V_4(q)$ (infinite square-infinite triangular well), and $V_6(q)$ (infinite square-delta well), do not approach the same high-density limit; instead, the correlation energy tends to $\epsilon_{\rm c} \sim -0.03002$ a.u. The ground-state properties obtained from the FRPA are compared with quantum Monte Carlo results. The peak height in the static structure factor at $k=2k_{\rm F}$ depends significantly on the confinement model. These peaks are fitted with a function based on our finite wire-width theory demonstrating good agreement with FRPA.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Dynamics in Atomic-Molecular Bose Condensates in the Presence of Gaussian Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of atomic and molecular bosons weakly coupled via Feshbach detuning in the presence of Gaussian white noise. The time-evolution of the population imbalance between the two species, as well as the coherence of the system are analyzed using a Bloch sphere model. We observe that the system exhibits relaxation of the Bloch vector components towards a stable equilibrium. In the population imbalance dynamics, the relaxation rates predicted by the Bogoliubov Born Green Kirkwood Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy are found to be smaller than those calculated with a simple the mean field approximation. As for the coherence dynamics, the inclusion of correlations and fluctuations in the system can either increase or decrease the relaxation time, depending on the initial conditions. We attribute the increase in the relaxation time to the emergence of a structured noise, and the subsequent suppression of certain dephasing channels. We also study the impact of correlations and fluctuations on time-averaged quantities like the drift speed, the fringe visibility, the phase entanglement etc., and find the results to be in perfect agreement with the properties of the relaxation dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Quantum Droplets in a Quasi-one-dimensional Framework: An Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum droplets have been recently observed in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) and in BEC mixtures. This forms the motivation for us to explore the dynamics of these droplets. We make use of the Extended Gross-Pitaevski equation which apart from the effective mean field (MF) interaction, also includes a beyond mean field interaction. The competition of these two interactions in the context of droplet formation is explored. Further, the conditions for droplet formation are studied.</description>

      <title>Observation of Kibble-Zurek Behavior across Topological Transitions of a Chern Band in Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism renders a theoretical framework for elucidating the formation of topological defects across continuous phase transitions. Nevertheless, it is not immediately clear whether the KZ mechanism applies to topological phase transitions. The direct experimental study for such a topic is hindered by quenching a certain parameter over orders of magnitude in topological materials. Instead, we investigate the KZ behavior across topological transitions of a Chern band in two-dimensional (2D) optical Raman lattices with quantum gases. Defined as the defects, excitation density is reconstructed via measuring the spin wave functions, with which the power-law scaling of total excitation density is extracted and such scaling could be interpreted within the KZ framework. Our work has heralded the commencement of experimentally exploring the KZ mechanism of the topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Mobile Impurity in a Two-Leg Bosonic Ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a mobile impurity in a two-leg bosonic ladder. The impurity moves both along and across the legs and interacts with a bath of interacting bosonic particles present in the ladder. We use both analytical (Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid - TLL) and numerical (Density Matrix Renormalization Group - DMRG) methods to compute the Green's function of the impurity. We find that for a small impurity-bath interaction, the bonding mode of the impurity effectively couples only to the gapless mode of the bath while the anti-bonding mode of the impurity couples to both gapped and gapless mode of the bath. We compute the time dependence of the Green's function of the impurity, for impurity created either in the anti-bonding or bonding mode with a given momentum. The later case leads to a decay as a power-law below a critical momentum and exponential above, while the former case always decays exponentially. We compare the DMRG results with analytical results using the linked cluster expansion and find a good agreement. In addition we use DMRG to extract the lifetime of the quasi-particle, when the Green's function decays exponentially. We also treat the case of an infinite bath-impurity coupling for which both the bonding and antibonding modes are systematically affected. For this case the impurity Green's function in the bonding mode decays as a power-law at zero momentum.The corresponding exponent increases with increasing transverse-tunneling of the impurity. We compare our results with the other impurity problems for which the motion of either the impurity or the bath is limited to a single chain. Finally we comments on the consequences of our findings for experiments with the ultracold gasses.</description>

      <title>Persistent currents in ultracold gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17318v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent currents flowing in spatially closed tracks define one of the most iconic concepts in mesoscopic physics. They have been studied in solid-state platforms such as superfluids, superconductors and metals. Cold atoms trapped in magneto-optical toroidal circuits and driven by suitable artificial gauge fields allow us to study persistent currents with unprecedented control and flexibility of the system's physical conditions. Here, we review persistent currents of ultracold matter. Capitalizing on the remarkable progress in driving different atomic species to quantum degeneracy, persistent currents of single or multicomponent bosons/fermions, and their mixtures can be addressed within the present experimental know-how. This way, fundamental concepts of quantum science and many-body physics, like macroscopic quantum coherence, solitons, vortex dynamics, fermionic pairing and BEC-BCS crossover can be studied from a novel perspective. Finally, we discuss how persistent currents can form the basis of new technological applications like matter-wave gyroscopes and interferometers.</description>

      <title>Effective theory for strongly attractive one-dimensional fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional system of two-component fermions in the limit of strong attractive particle-particle interactions. First, we analyze scattering in the corresponding few-body problem, which is analytically solvable via Bethe ansatz. This allows us to engineer effective interactions between the system's effective degrees of freedom: fermions and bosonic dimers (tightly bound pairs of fermions). We argue that, although these interactions are strong, the resulting effective problem can be mapped onto a weakly interacting one, paving the way for the use of perturbation theory. This finding simplifies studies of many-fermion systems under confinement that are beyond reach of state-of-the-art numerical methods. We illustrate this statement by considering an impurity atom in a Fermi gas.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03647v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-Andr\'e model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-Andr\'e) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, $S$-duality, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. In essence, this work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new avenues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, suggests the existence of an $S$-duality of spacetime curvatures, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.</description>
