      <title>EAGER: Edge-Aligned LLM Defense for Robust, Efficient, and Accurate Cybersecurity Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly effective for cybersecurity question answering (QA) but are difficult to deploy on edge devices due to their size. Quantization reduces memory and compute requirements but often degrades accuracy and increases vulnerability to adversarial attacks. We present EAGER, an edge-aligned defense framework that integrates parameter-efficient quantization with domain-specific preference alignment to jointly optimize efficiency, robustness, and accuracy. Unlike prior methods that address these aspects separately, EAGER leverages Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) for low-cost fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a self-constructed cybersecurity preference dataset, eliminating the need for human labels. Experiments show that EAGER reduces adversarial attack success rates by up to 7.3x and improves QA accuracy by up to 55% over state-of-the-art defenses, while achieving the lowest response latency on a Jetson Orin, demonstrating its practical edge deployment.</description>

      <title>AttackPilot: Autonomous Inference Attacks Against ML Services With LLM-Based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inference attacks have been widely studied and offer a systematic risk assessment of ML services; however, their implementation and the attack parameters for optimal estimation are challenging for non-experts. The emergence of advanced large language models presents a promising yet largely unexplored opportunity to develop autonomous agents as inference attack experts, helping address this challenge. In this paper, we propose AttackPilot, an autonomous agent capable of independently conducting inference attacks without human intervention. We evaluate it on 20 target services. The evaluation shows that our agent, using GPT-4o, achieves a 100.0% task completion rate and near-expert attack performance, with an average token cost of only $0.627 per run. The agent can also be powered by many other representative LLMs and can adaptively optimize its strategy under service constraints. We further perform trace analysis, demonstrating that design choices, such as a multi-agent framework and task-specific action spaces, effectively mitigate errors such as bad plans, inability to follow instructions, task context loss, and hallucinations. We anticipate that such agents could empower non-expert ML service providers, auditors, or regulators to systematically assess the risks of ML services without requiring deep domain expertise.</description>

      <title>SPQR: A Standardized Benchmark for Modern Safety Alignment Methods in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models can emit copyrighted, unsafe, or private content. Safety alignment aims to suppress specific concepts, yet evaluations seldom test whether safety persists under benign downstream fine-tuning routinely applied after deployment (e.g., LoRA personalization, style/domain adapters). We study the stability of current safety methods under benign fine-tuning and observe frequent breakdowns. As true safety alignment must withstand even benign post-deployment adaptations, we introduce the SPQR benchmark (Safety-Prompt adherence-Quality-Robustness). SPQR is a single-scored metric that provides a standardized and reproducible framework to evaluate how well safety-aligned diffusion models preserve safety, utility, and robustness under benign fine-tuning, by reporting a single leaderboard score to facilitate comparisons. We conduct multilingual, domain-specific, and out-of-distribution analyses, along with category-wise breakdowns, to identify when safety alignment fails after benign fine-tuning, ultimately showcasing SPQR as a concise yet comprehensive benchmark for T2I safety alignment techniques for T2I models.</description>

      <title>IRSDA: An Agent-Orchestrated Framework for Enterprise Intrusion Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern enterprise systems face escalating cyber threats that are increasingly dynamic, distributed, and multi-stage in nature. Traditional intrusion detection and response systems often rely on static rules and manual workflows, which limit their ability to respond with the speed and precision required in high-stakes environments. To address these challenges, we present the Intrusion Response System Digital Assistant (IRSDA), an agent-based framework designed to deliver autonomous and policy-compliant cyber defense. IRSDA combines Self-Adaptive Autonomic Computing Systems (SA-ACS) with the Knowledge guided Monitor, Analyze, Plan, and Execute (MAPE-K) loop to support real-time, partition-aware decision-making across enterprise infrastructure.
  IRSDA incorporates a knowledge-driven architecture that integrates contextual information with AI-based reasoning to support system-guided intrusion response. The framework leverages retrieval mechanisms and structured representations to inform decision-making while maintaining alignment with operational policies. We assess the system using a representative real-world microservices application, demonstrating its ability to automate containment, enforce compliance, and provide traceable outputs for security analyst interpretation. This work outlines a modular and agent-driven approach to cyber defense that emphasizes explainability, system-state awareness, and operational control in intrusion response.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data: AI's New Weapon Against Android Malware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-increasing number of Android devices and the accelerated evolution of malware, reaching over 35 million samples by 2024, highlight the critical importance of effective detection methods. Attackers are now using Artificial Intelligence to create sophisticated malware variations that can easily evade traditional detection techniques. Although machine learning has shown promise in malware classification, its success relies heavily on the availability of up-to-date, high-quality datasets. The scarcity and high cost of obtaining and labeling real malware samples presents significant challenges in developing robust detection models. In this paper, we propose MalSynGen, a Malware Synthetic Data Generation methodology that uses a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to generate synthetic tabular data. This data preserves the statistical properties of real-world data and improves the performance of Android malware classifiers. We evaluated the effectiveness of this approach using various datasets and metrics that assess the fidelity of the generated data, its utility in classification, and the computational efficiency of the process. Our experiments demonstrate that MalSynGen can generalize across different datasets, providing a viable solution to address the issues of obsolescence and low quality data in malware detection.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and Efficiency Trade-Offs in LLM-Based Malware Detection and Explanation: A Comparative Study of Parameter Tuning vs. Full Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines whether Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can approximate the performance of fully fine-tuned models in generating human-interpretable decisions and explanations for malware classification. Achieving trustworthy malware detection, particularly when LLMs are involved, remains a significant challenge. We developed an evaluation framework using Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE), and Semantic Similarity Metrics to benchmark explanation quality across five LoRA configurations and a fully fine-tuned baseline. Results indicate that full fine-tuning achieves the highest overall scores, with BLEU and ROUGE improvements of up to 10% over LoRA variants. However, mid-range LoRA models deliver competitive performance exceeding full fine-tuning on two metrics while reducing model size by approximately 81% and training time by over 80% on a LoRA model with 15.5% trainable parameters. These findings demonstrate that LoRA offers a practical balance of interpretability and resource efficiency, enabling deployment in resource-constrained environments without sacrificing explanation quality. By providing feature-driven natural language explanations for malware classifications, this approach enhances transparency, analyst confidence, and operational scalability in malware detection systems.</description>

      <title>BASICS: Binary Analysis and Stack Integrity Checker System for Buffer Overflow Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems have played an essential role in our daily lives, providing critical services such as power and water, whose operability, availability, and reliability must be ensured. The C programming language, prevalent in CPS development, is crucial for system control where reliability is critical. However, it is also commonly susceptible to vulnerabilities, particularly buffer overflows. Traditional vulnerability discovery techniques often struggle with scalability and precision when applied directly to the binary code of C programs, which can thereby keep programs vulnerable. This work introduces a novel approach designed to overcome these limitations by leveraging model checking and concolic execution techniques to automatically verify security properties of a program's stack memory in binary code, trampoline techniques to perform automated repair of the issues, and crash-inducing inputs to verify if they were successfully removed. The approach constructs a Memory State Space -- MemStaCe -- from the binary program's control flow graph and simulations, provided by concolic execution, of C function calls and loop constructs. The security properties, defined in LTL, model the correct behaviour of functions associated with vulnerabilities and allow the approach to identify vulnerabilities in MemStaCe by analysing counterexample traces that are generated when a security property is violated. These vulnerabilities are then addressed with a trampoline-based binary patching method, and the effectiveness of the patches is checked with crash-inducing inputs extracted during concolic execution. We implemented the approach in the BASICS tool for BO mitigation and evaluated using the Juliet C/C++ and SARD datasets and real applications, achieving an accuracy and precision above 87%, both in detection and correction. Also, we compared it with CWE Checker, outperforming it.</description>

      <title>CrypTorch: PyTorch-based Auto-tuning Compiler for Machine Learning with Multi-party Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) involves private data and proprietary model parameters. MPC-based ML allows multiple parties to collaboratively run an ML workload without sharing their private data or model parameters using multi-party computing (MPC). Because MPC cannot natively run ML operations such as Softmax or GELU, existing frameworks use different approximations. Our study shows that, on a well-optimized framework, these approximations often become the dominating bottleneck. Popular approximations are often insufficiently accurate or unnecessarily slow, and these issues are hard to identify and fix in existing frameworks. To tackle this issue, we propose a compiler for MPC-based ML, CrypTorch. CrypTorch disentangles these approximations with the rest of the MPC runtime, allows easily adding new approximations through its programming interface, and automatically selects approximations to maximize both performance and accuracy. Built as an extension to PyTorch 2's compiler, we show that CrypTorch's auto-tuning alone provides 1.20--1.7$\times$ immediate speedup without sacrificing accuracy, and 1.31--1.8$\times$ speedup when some accuracy degradation is allowed, compared to our well-optimized baseline. Combined with better engineering and adoption of state-of-the-art practices, the entire framework brings 3.22--8.6$\times$ end-to-end speedup compared to the popular framework, CrypTen.</description>

      <title>Prompt Fencing: A Cryptographic Approach to Establishing Security Boundaries in Large Language Model Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks, representing the most significant security threat in production deployments. We present Prompt Fencing, a novel architectural approach that applies cryptographic authentication and data architecture principles to establish explicit security boundaries within LLM prompts. Our approach decorates prompt segments with cryptographically signed metadata including trust ratings and content types, enabling LLMs to distinguish between trusted instructions and untrusted content. While current LLMs lack native fence awareness, we demonstrate that simulated awareness through prompt instructions achieved complete prevention of injection attacks in our experiments, reducing success rates from 86.7% (260/300 successful attacks) to 0% (0/300 successful attacks) across 300 test cases with two leading LLM providers. We implement a proof-of-concept fence generation and verification pipeline with a total overhead of 0.224 seconds (0.130s for fence generation, 0.094s for validation) across 100 samples. Our approach is platform-agnostic and can be incrementally deployed as a security layer above existing LLM infrastructure, with the expectation that future models will be trained with native fence awareness for optimal security.</description>

      <title>Cross-LLM Generalization of Behavioral Backdoor Detection in AI Agent Supply Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI agents become integral to enterprise workflows, their reliance on shared tool libraries and pre-trained components creates significant supply chain vulnerabilities. While previous work has demonstrated behavioral backdoor detection within individual LLM architectures, the critical question of cross-LLM generalization remains unexplored, a gap with serious implications for organizations deploying multiple AI systems. We present the first systematic study of cross-LLM behavioral backdoor detection, evaluating generalization across six production LLMs (GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4.1, Llama 4 Maverick, GPT-OSS 120B, and DeepSeek Chat V3.1). Through 1,198 execution traces and 36 cross-model experiments, we quantify a critical finding: single-model detectors achieve 92.7% accuracy within their training distribution but only 49.2% across different LLMs, a 43.4 percentage point generalization gap equivalent to random guessing. Our analysis reveals that this gap stems from model-specific behavioral signatures, particularly in temporal features (coefficient of variation &gt; 0.8), while structural features remain stable across architectures. We show that model-aware detection incorporating model identity as an additional feature achieves 90.6% accuracy universally across all evaluated models. We release our multi-LLM trace dataset and detection framework to enable reproducible research.</description>

      <title>Frequency Bias Matters: Diving into Robust and Generalized Deep Image Forgery Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As deep image forgery powered by AI generative models, such as GANs, continues to challenge today's digital world, detecting AI-generated forgeries has become a vital security topic. Generalizability and robustness are two critical concerns of a forgery detector, determining its reliability when facing unknown GANs and noisy samples in an open world. Although many studies focus on improving these two properties, the root causes of these problems have not been fully explored, and it is unclear if there is a connection between them. Moreover, despite recent achievements in addressing these issues from image forensic or anti-forensic aspects, a universal method that can contribute to both sides simultaneously remains practically significant yet unavailable. In this paper, we provide a fundamental explanation of these problems from a frequency perspective. Our analysis reveals that the frequency bias of a DNN forgery detector is a possible cause of generalization and robustness issues. Based on this finding, we propose a two-step frequency alignment method to remove the frequency discrepancy between real and fake images, offering double-sided benefits: it can serve as a strong black-box attack against forgery detectors in the anti-forensic context or, conversely, as a universal defense to improve detector reliability in the forensic context. We also develop corresponding attack and defense implementations and demonstrate their effectiveness, as well as the effect of the frequency alignment method, in various experimental settings involving twelve detectors, eight forgery models, and five metrics.</description>

      <title>Zero-Knowledge Proof Based Verifiable Inference of Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning, have led to widespread adoption across various applications. Yet, a fundamental challenge persists: how can we verify the correctness of AI model inference when model owners cannot (or will not) reveal their parameters? These parameters represent enormous training costs and valuable intellectual property, making transparent verification difficult. In this paper, we introduce a zero-knowledge framework capable of verifying deep learning inference without exposing model internal parameters. Built on recursively composed zero-knowledge proofs and requiring no trusted setup, our framework supports both linear and nonlinear neural network layers, including matrix multiplication, normalization, softmax, and SiLU. Leveraging the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, we obtain a succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zkSNARK) with constant-size proofs. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we translate the DeepSeek model into a fully SNARK-verifiable version named ZK-DeepSeek and show experimentally that our framework delivers both efficiency and flexibility in real-world AI verification workloads.</description>

      <title>Improving the Identification of Real-world Malware's DNS Covert Channels Using Locality Sensitive Hashing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, malware increasingly uses DNS-based covert channels in order to evade detection and maintain stealthy communication with its command-and-control servers. While prior work has focused on detecting such activity, identifying specific malware families and their behaviors from captured network traffic remains challenging due to the variability of DNS. In this paper, we present the first application of Locality Sensitive Hashing to the detection and identification of real-world malware utilizing DNS covert channels. Our approach encodes DNS subdomain sequences into statistical similarity features that effectively capture anomalies indicative of malicious activity. Combined with a Random Forest classifier, our method achieves higher accuracy and reduced false positive rates than prior approaches, while demonstrating improved robustness and generalization to previously unseen or modified malware samples. We further demonstrate that our approach enables reliable classification of malware behavior (e.g., uploading or downloading of files), based solely on DNS subdomains.</description>

      <title>Hey there! You are using WhatsApp: Enumerating Three Billion Accounts for Security and Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WhatsApp, with 3.5 billion active accounts as of early 2025, is the world's largest instant messaging platform. Given its massive user base, WhatsApp plays a critical role in global communication.
  To initiate conversations, users must first discover whether their contacts are registered on the platform. This is achieved by querying WhatsApp's servers with mobile phone numbers extracted from the user's address book (if they allowed access). This architecture inherently enables phone number enumeration, as the service must allow legitimate users to query contact availability. While rate limiting is a standard defense against abuse, we revisit the problem and show that WhatsApp remains highly vulnerable to enumeration at scale. In our study, we were able to probe over a hundred million phone numbers per hour without encountering blocking or effective rate limiting.
  Our findings demonstrate not only the persistence but the severity of this vulnerability. We further show that nearly half of the phone numbers disclosed in the 2021 Facebook data leak are still active on WhatsApp, underlining the enduring risks associated with such exposures. Moreover, we were able to perform a census of WhatsApp users, providing a glimpse on the macroscopic insights a large messaging service is able to generate even though the messages themselves are end-to-end encrypted. Using the gathered data, we also discovered the re-use of certain X25519 keys across different devices and phone numbers, indicating either insecure (custom) implementations, or fraudulent activity.
  In this updated version of the paper, we also provide insights into the collaborative remediation process through which we confirmed that the underlying rate-limiting issue had been resolved.</description>

      <title>Can LLMs Make (Personalized) Access Control Decisions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise access control decisions are crucial to the security of both traditional applications and emerging agent-based systems. Typically, these decisions are made by users during app installation or at runtime. Due to the increasing complexity and automation of systems, making these access control decisions can add a significant cognitive load on users, often overloading them and leading to suboptimal or even arbitrary access control decisions. To address this problem, we propose to leverage the processing and reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to make dynamic, context-aware decisions aligned with the user's security preferences. For this purpose, we conducted a user study, which resulted in a dataset of 307 natural-language privacy statements and 14,682 access control decisions made by users. We then compare these decisions against those made by two versions of LLMs: a general and a personalized one, for which we also gathered user feedback on 1,446 of its decisions.
  Our results show that in general, LLMs can reflect users' preferences well, achieving up to 86\% accuracy when compared to the decision made by the majority of users. Our study also reveals a crucial trade-off in personalizing such a system: while providing user-specific privacy preferences to the LLM generally improves agreement with individual user decisions, adhering to those preferences can also violate some security best practices. Based on our findings, we discuss design and risk considerations for implementing a practical natural-language-based access control system that balances personalization, security, and utility.</description>

      <title>APT-CGLP: Advanced Persistent Threat Hunting via Contrastive Graph-Language Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Provenance-based threat hunting identifies Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) on endpoints by correlating attack patterns described in Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) with provenance graphs derived from system audit logs. A fundamental challenge in this paradigm lies in the modality gap -- the structural and semantic disconnect between provenance graphs and CTI reports. Prior work addresses this by framing threat hunting as a graph matching task: 1) extracting attack graphs from CTI reports, and 2) aligning them with provenance graphs. However, this pipeline incurs severe \textit{information loss} during graph extraction and demands intensive manual curation, undermining scalability and effectiveness.
  In this paper, we present APT-CGLP, a novel cross-modal APT hunting system via Contrastive Graph-Language Pre-training, facilitating end-to-end semantic matching between provenance graphs and CTI reports without human intervention. First, empowered by the Large Language Model (LLM), APT-CGLP mitigates data scarcity by synthesizing high-fidelity provenance graph-CTI report pairs, while simultaneously distilling actionable insights from noisy web-sourced CTIs to improve their operational utility. Second, APT-CGLP incorporates a tailored multi-objective training algorithm that synergizes contrastive learning with inter-modal masked modeling, promoting cross-modal attack semantic alignment at both coarse- and fine-grained levels. Extensive experiments on four real-world APT datasets demonstrate that APT-CGLP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art threat hunting baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Reality Check on SBOM-based Vulnerability Management: An Empirical Study and A Path Forward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a critical tool for securing the software supply chain (SSC), but its practical utility is undermined by inaccuracies in both its generation and its application in vulnerability scanning. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study on 2,414 open-source repositories to address these issues from a practical standpoint. First, we demonstrate that using lock files with strong package managers enables the generation of accurate and consistent SBOMs, establishing a reliable foundation for security analysis. Using this high-fidelity foundation, however, we expose a more fundamental flaw in practice: downstream vulnerability scanners produce a staggering 97.5\% false positive rate. We pinpoint the primary cause as the flagging of vulnerabilities within unreachable code. We then demonstrate that function call analysis can effectively prune 63.3\% of these false alarms. Our work validates a practical, two-stage approach for SSC security: first, generate an accurate SBOM using lock files and strong package managers, and second, enrich it with function call analysis to produce actionable, low-noise vulnerability reports that alleviate developers' alert fatigue.</description>

      <title>A Single-Root, Multi-Curve, Context-Isolated, PQC-Pluggable Cryptographic Identity Primitive with Stateless Secret Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptographic identity anchors modern decentralized systems, yet current standards like BIP-39 and BIP-32 are structurally insufficient for the demands of multi-curve, multi-domain, and post-quantum (PQC) environments. These legacy schemes rely on a monolithic identity root with no inherent context isolation, algorithm agility, or secure secret rotation. This paper introduces MSCIKDF, a single-root, multi-curve, context-isolated, PQC-pluggable cryptographic identity primitive. MSCIKDF defines a new architectural foundation where identity is derived deterministically but with cryptographically enforced separation across diverse contexts (e.g., blockchain, E2EE, KMS, IoT). It achieves strong security invariants -- such as zero-linkability, multi-curve independence, and resistance to cross-context correlation -- while offering stateless secret rotation that preserves long-term identity continuity without requiring asset migration. MSCIKDF is proposed as an infrastructure-level upgrade to deterministic identity, establishing a durable and algorithm-agnostic root of trust suitable for the next decade of distributed systems, AI agents, and PQC migration.</description>

      <title>Engel p-adic Isogeny-based Cryptography over Laurent Series: Foundations, Security, and an ESP32 Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Securing the Internet of Things (IoT) against quantum attacks requires public-key cryptography that (i) remains compact and (ii) runs efficiently on microcontrollers, capabilities many post-quantum (PQ) schemes lack due to large keys and heavy arithmetic. We address both constraints simultaneously with, to our knowledge, the first-ever isogeny framework that encodes super-singular elliptic-curve isogeny data via novel Engel expansions over the p-adic Laurent series. Engel coefficients compress torsion information, thereby addressing the compactness constraint, yielding public keys of ~1.1 - 16.9 kbits preserving the hallmark small sizes of isogeny systems. Engel arithmetic is local and admits fixed-precision p-adic operations, enabling micro-controller efficiency with low-memory, branch-regular kernels suitable for embedded targets.</description>

      <title>Effective Command-line Interface Fuzzing with Path-Aware Large Language Model Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Command-line interface (CLI) fuzzing tests programs by mutating both command-line options and input file contents, thus enabling discovery of vulnerabilities that only manifest under specific option-input combinations. Prior works of CLI fuzzing face the challenges of generating semantics-rich option strings and input files, which cannot reach deeply embedded target functions. This often leads to a misdetection of such a deep vulnerability using existing CLI fuzzing techniques. In this paper, we design a novel Path-guided, Iterative LLM-Orchestrated Testing framework, called PILOT, to fuzz CLI applications. The key insight is to provide potential call paths to target functions as context to LLM so that it can better generate CLI option strings and input files. Then, PILOT iteratively repeats the process, and provides reached functions as additional context so that target functions are reached. Our evaluation on real-world CLI applications demonstrates that PILOT achieves higher coverage than state-of-the-art fuzzing approaches and discovers 51 zero-day vulnerabilities. We responsibly disclosed all the vulnerabilities to their developers and so far 41 have been confirmed by their developers with 33 being fixed and three assigned CVE identifiers.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Resistant Authentication Scheme for RFID Systems Using Lattice-Based Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel quantum-resistant mutual authentication scheme for radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems. Our scheme uses lattice-based cryptography and, in particular, achieves quantum-resistance by leveraging the hardness of the inhomogeneous short integer solution (ISIS) problem. In contrast to prior work, which assumes that the reader-server communication channel is secure, our scheme is secure even when both the reader-server and tag-reader communication channels are insecure. Our proposed protocol provides robust security against man-in-the-middle (MITM), replay, impersonation, and reflection attacks, while also ensuring unforgeability and preserving anonymity. We present a detailed security analysis, including semi-formal analysis and formal verification using the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) tool. In addition, we analyze the storage, computation, and communication costs of the proposed protocol and compare its security properties with those of existing protocols, demonstrating that our scheme offers strong security guarantees. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first quantum-resistant authentication protocol for RFID systems that comprehensively addresses the insecurity of both the reader-server and tag-reader communication channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SOCs and CSIRTs face increasing pressure to automate incident categorization, yet the use of cloud-based LLMs introduces costs, latency, and confidentiality risks. We investigate whether locally executed SLMs can meet this challenge. We evaluated 21 models ranging from 1B to 20B parameters, varying the temperature hyperparameter and measuring execution time and precision across two distinct architectures. The results indicate that temperature has little influence on performance, whereas the number of parameters and GPU capacity are decisive factors.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Dual-Strategy Unlearning for Biomedical and Healthcare Intelligence Using Imperfect and Privacy-Sensitive Medical Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance but pose substantial privacy risks due to training data memorization, particularly within healthcare contexts involving imperfect or privacy-sensitive patient information. We present a hierarchical dual-strategy framework for selective knowledge unlearning that precisely removes specialized knowledge while preserving fundamental medical competencies. Our approach synergistically integrates geometric-constrained gradient updates to selectively modulate target parameters with concept-aware token-level interventions that distinguish between preservation-critical and unlearning-targeted tokens via a unified four-level medical concept hierarchy. Comprehensive evaluations on the MedMCQA (surgical) and MHQA (anxiety, depression, trauma) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving an 82.7% forgetting rate and 88.5% knowledge preservation. Notably, our framework maintains robust privacy guarantees while requiring modification of only 0.1% of parameters, addressing critical needs for regulatory compliance, auditability, and ethical standards in clinical research.</description>

      <title>Beyond Binary Classification: A Semi-supervised Approach to Generalized AI-generated Image Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generators (e.g., StyleGAN, Midjourney, DALL-E) has produced highly realistic synthetic images, posing significant challenges to digital media authenticity. These generators are typically based on a few core architectural families, primarily Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models (DMs). A critical vulnerability in current forensics is the failure of detectors to achieve cross-generator generalization, especially when crossing architectural boundaries (e.g., from GANs to DMs). We hypothesize that this gap stems from fundamental differences in the artifacts produced by these \textbf{distinct architectures}. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis explaining how the distinct optimization objectives of the GAN and DM architectures lead to different manifold coverage behaviors. We demonstrate that GANs permit partial coverage, often leading to boundary artifacts, while DMs enforce complete coverage, resulting in over-smoothing patterns. Motivated by this analysis, we propose the \textbf{Tri}archy \textbf{Detect}or (TriDetect), a semi-supervised approach that enhances binary classification by discovering latent architectural patterns within the "fake" class. TriDetect employs balanced cluster assignment via the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm and a cross-view consistency mechanism, encouraging the model to learn fundamental architectural distincts. We evaluate our approach on two standard benchmarks and three in-the-wild datasets against 13 baselines to demonstrate its generalization capability to unseen generators.</description>

      <title>On the Feasibility of Hijacking MLLMs' Decision Chain via One Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional adversarial attacks focus on manipulating a single decision of neural networks. However, real-world models often operate in a sequence of decisions, where an isolated mistake can be easily corrected, but cascading errors can lead to severe risks.
  This paper reveals a novel threat: a single perturbation can hijack the whole decision chain. We demonstrate the feasibility of manipulating a model's outputs toward multiple, predefined outcomes, such as simultaneously misclassifying "non-motorized lane" signs as "motorized lane" and "pedestrian" as "plastic bag".
  To expose this threat, we introduce Semantic-Aware Universal Perturbations (SAUPs), which induce varied outcomes based on the semantics of the inputs. We overcome optimization challenges by developing an effective algorithm, which searches for perturbations in normalized space with a semantic separation strategy. To evaluate the practical threat of SAUPs, we present RIST, a new real-world image dataset with fine-grained semantic annotations. Extensive experiments on three multimodal large language models demonstrate their vulnerability, achieving a 70% attack success rate when controlling five distinct targets using just an adversarial frame.</description>

      <title>Ranking-Enhanced Anomaly Detection Using Active Learning-Assisted Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a significant challenge in cybersecurity due to their stealthy and long-term nature. Modern supervised learning methods require extensive labeled data, which is often scarce in real-world cybersecurity environments. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach that leverages AutoEncoders for unsupervised anomaly detection, augmented by active learning to iteratively improve the detection of APT anomalies. By selectively querying an oracle for labels on uncertain or ambiguous samples, we minimize labeling costs while improving detection rates, enabling the model to improve its detection accuracy with minimal data while reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. We provide a detailed formulation of the proposed Attention Adversarial Dual AutoEncoder-based anomaly detection framework and show how the active learning loop iteratively enhances the model. The framework is evaluated on real-world imbalanced provenance trace databases produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like attacks constitute as little as 0.004\% of the data. The datasets span multiple operating systems, including Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows, and cover two attack scenarios. The results have shown significant improvements in detection rates during active learning and better performance compared to other existing approaches.</description>

      <title>From One Attack Domain to Another: Contrastive Transfer Learning with Siamese Networks for APT Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) pose a major cybersecurity challenge due to their stealth, persistence, and adaptability. Traditional machine learning detectors struggle with class imbalance, high dimensional features, and scarce real world traces. They often lack transferability-performing well in the training domain but degrading in novel attack scenarios. We propose a hybrid transfer framework that integrates Transfer Learning, Explainable AI (XAI), contrastive learning, and Siamese networks to improve cross-domain generalization. An attention-based autoencoder supports knowledge transfer across domains, while Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) select stable, informative features to reduce dimensionality and computational cost. A Siamese encoder trained with a contrastive objective aligns source and target representations, increasing anomaly separability and mitigating feature drift. We evaluate on real-world traces from the DARPA Transparent Computing (TC) program and augment with synthetic attack scenarios to test robustness. Across source to target transfers, the approach delivers improved detection scores with classical and deep baselines, demonstrating a scalable, explainable, and transferable solution for APT detection.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) agents into web browsers introduces security challenges that go beyond traditional web application threat models. Prior work has identified prompt injection as a new attack vector for web agents, yet the resulting impact within real-world environments remains insufficiently understood.
  In this work, we examine the landscape of prompt injection attacks and synthesize a benchmark of attacks embedded in realistic HTML payloads. Our benchmark goes beyond prior work by emphasizing injections that can influence real-world actions rather than mere text outputs, and by presenting attack payloads with complexity and distractor frequency similar to what real-world agents encounter. We leverage this benchmark to conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of existing defenses, assessing their effectiveness across a suite of frontier AI models. We propose a multi-layered defense strategy comprising both architectural and model-based defenses to protect against evolving prompt injection attacks. Our work offers a blueprint for designing practical, secure web agents through a defense-in-depth approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum Key Distribution: Bridging Theoretical Security Proofs, Practical Attacks, and Error Correction for Quantum-Augmented Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is revolutionizing cryptography by promising information-theoretic security through the immutable laws of quantum mechanics. Yet, the challenge of transforming these idealized security models into practical, resilient systems remains a pressing issue, especially as quantum computing evolves. In this review, we critically dissect and synthesize the latest advancements in QKD protocols and their security vulnerabilities, with a strong emphasis on rigorous security proofs. We actively categorize contemporary QKD schemes into three key classes: uncertainty principle-based protocols (e.g., BB84), hybrid architectures that enable secure direct communication (eg, three-stage protocol), and continuous-variable frameworks. We further include two modern classes of QKD protocols, namely Twin-field QKD and Device-Independent QKD, both of which were developed to have practical implementations over the last decade. Moreover, we highlight important experimental breakthroughs and innovative mitigation strategies, including the deployment of advanced Quantum Error Correction Codes (QECCs), that significantly enhance channel fidelity and system robustness. By mapping the current landscape, from sophisticated quantum attacks to state-of-the-art error correction methods, this review fills an important gap in the literature. To bring everything together, the relevance of this review concerning quantum augmented networks (QuANets) is also presented. This allows the readers to gain a comprehensive understanding of the security promises of quantum key distribution from theoretical proofs to experimental validations.</description>

      <title>Securing Large Language Models: Addressing Bias, Misinformation, and Prompt Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across various fields, yet their increasing use raises critical security concerns. This article reviews recent literature addressing key issues in LLM security, with a focus on accuracy, bias, content detection, and vulnerability to attacks. Issues related to inaccurate or misleading outputs from LLMs is discussed, with emphasis on the implementation from fact-checking methodologies to enhance response reliability. Inherent biases within LLMs are critically examined through diverse evaluation techniques, including controlled input studies and red teaming exercises. A comprehensive analysis of bias mitigation strategies is presented, including approaches from pre-processing interventions to in-training adjustments and post-processing refinements. The article also probes the complexity of distinguishing LLM-generated content from human-produced text, introducing detection mechanisms like DetectGPT and watermarking techniques while noting the limitations of machine learning enabled classifiers under intricate circumstances. Moreover, LLM vulnerabilities, including jailbreak attacks and prompt injection exploits, are analyzed by looking into different case studies and large-scale competitions like HackAPrompt. This review is concluded by retrospecting defense mechanisms to safeguard LLMs, accentuating the need for more extensive research into the LLM security field.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking and Mitigation of Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by advancing natural language understanding and generation, enabling applications across fields beyond healthcare, software engineering, and conversational systems. Despite these advancements in the past few years, LLMs have shown considerable vulnerabilities, particularly to prompt injection and jailbreaking attacks. This review analyzes the state of research on these vulnerabilities and presents available defense strategies. We roughly categorize attack approaches into prompt-based, model-based, multimodal, and multilingual, covering techniques such as adversarial prompting, backdoor injections, and cross-modality exploits. We also review various defense mechanisms, including prompt filtering, transformation, alignment techniques, multi-agent defenses, and self-regulation, evaluating their strengths and shortcomings. We also discuss key metrics and benchmarks used to assess LLM safety and robustness, noting challenges like the quantification of attack success in interactive contexts and biases in existing datasets. Identifying current research gaps, we suggest future directions for resilient alignment strategies, advanced defenses against evolving attacks, automation of jailbreak detection, and consideration of ethical and societal impacts. This review emphasizes the need for continued research and cooperation within the AI community to enhance LLM security and ensure their safe deployment.</description>

      <title>BackFed: An Efficient &amp; Standardized Benchmark Suite for Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on backdoor attacks in Federated Learning (FL) has accelerated in recent years, with new attacks and defenses continually proposed in an escalating arms race. However, the evaluation of these methods remains neither standardized nor reliable. First, there are severe inconsistencies in the evaluation settings across studies, and many rely on unrealistic threat models. Second, our code review uncovers semantic bugs in the official codebases of several attacks that artificially inflate their reported performance. These issues raise fundamental questions about whether current methods are truly effective or simply overfitted to narrow experimental setups. We introduce \textbf{BackFed}, a benchmark designed to standardize and stress-test FL backdoor evaluation by unifying attacks and defenses under a common evaluation framework that mirrors realistic FL deployments. Our benchmark on three representative datasets with three distinct architectures reveals critical limitations of existing methods. Malicious clients often require excessive training time and computation, making them vulnerable to server-enforced time constraints. Meanwhile, several defenses incur severe accuracy degradation or aggregation overhead. Popular defenses and attacks achieve limited performance in our benchmark, which challenges their previous efficacy claims. We establish BackFed as a rigorous and fair evaluation framework that enables more reliable progress in FL backdoor research.</description>

      <title>VULSOLVER: Vulnerability Detection via LLM-Driven Constraint Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00882v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional vulnerability detection methods rely heavily on predefined rule matching, which often fails to capture vulnerabilities accurately. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), leveraging their ability to understand code semantics has emerged as a promising direction for achieving more accurate and efficient vulnerability detection. However, current LLM-based approaches face significant challenges: instability in model outputs, degraded performance with long context, and hallucination. As a result, many existing solutions either use LLMs merely to enrich predefined rule sets, thereby keeping the detection process fundamentally rule-based, or over-rely on them, leading to poor robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a constraint-solving approach powered by LLMs named VULSOLVER. By modeling vulnerability detection as a constraint-solving problem, and by integrating static application security testing (SAST) with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs, our method enables the LLM to act like a professional human security expert. We assess VULSOLVER on the OWASP Benchmark (1,023 labeled samples), achieving 97.85% accuracy, 97.97% F1-score, and 100% recall. Applied to widely-used open-source projects, VULSOLVER identified 15 previously unknown high-severity vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.5-9.8), demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world security analysis.</description>

      <title>AI-in-the-Loop: Privacy Preserving Real-Time Scam Detection and Conversational Scambaiting by Leveraging LLMs and Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scams exploiting real-time social engineering -- such as phishing, impersonation, and phone fraud -- remain a persistent and evolving threat across digital platforms. Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving, AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement $\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism, safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement ($\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage ($\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3, MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.</description>

      <title>Mind Your Server: A Systematic Study of Parasitic Toolchain Attacks on the MCP Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated with external systems through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which standardizes tool invocation and has rapidly become a backbone for LLM-powered applications. While this paradigm enhances functionality, it also introduces a fundamental security shift: LLMs transition from passive information processors to autonomous orchestrators of task-oriented toolchains, expanding the attack surface, elevating adversarial goals from manipulating single outputs to hijacking entire execution flows. In this paper, we reveal a new class of attacks, Parasitic Toolchain Attacks, instantiated as MCP Unintended Privacy Disclosure (MCP-UPD). These attacks require no direct victim interaction; instead, adversaries embed malicious instructions into external data sources that LLMs access during legitimate tasks. The malicious logic infiltrates the toolchain and unfolds in three phases: Parasitic Ingestion, Privacy Collection, and Privacy Disclosure, culminating in stealthy exfiltration of private data. Our root cause analysis reveals that MCP lacks both context-tool isolation and least-privilege enforcement, enabling adversarial instructions to propagate unchecked into sensitive tool invocations. To assess the severity, we design MCP-SEC and conduct the first large-scale security census of the MCP ecosystem, analyzing 12,230 tools across 1,360 servers. Our findings show that the MCP ecosystem is rife with exploitable gadgets and diverse attack methods, underscoring systemic risks in MCP platforms and the urgent need for defense mechanisms in LLM-integrated environments.</description>

      <title>Practitioners' Perspectives on a Differential Privacy Deployment Registry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) -- a principled approach to producing statistical data products with strong, mathematically provable privacy guarantees for the individuals in the underlying dataset -- has seen substantial adoption in practice over the past decade. Applying DP requires making several implementation decisions, each with significant impacts on data privacy and/or utility. Hence, to promote shared learning and accountability around DP deployments, Dwork, Kohli, and Mulligan (2019) proposed a public-facing repository ("registry") of DP deployments. The DP community has recently started to work toward realizing this vision. We contribute to this effort by (1) developing a holistic, hierarchical schema to describe any given DP deployment and (2) designing and implementing an interactive interface to act as a registry where practitioners can access information about past DP deployments. We (3) populate our interface with 21 real-world DP deployments and (4) conduct an exploratory user study with DP practitioners ($n=16$) to understand how they would use the registry, as well as what challenges and opportunities they foresee around its adoption. We find that participants were enthusiastic about the registry as a valuable resource for evaluating prior deployments and making future deployments. They also identified several opportunities for the registry, including that it can become a "hub" for the community and support broader communication around DP (e.g., to legal teams). At the same time, they identified challenges around the registry gaining adoption, including the effort and risk involved with making implementation choices public and moderating the quality of entries. Based on our findings, we offer recommendations for encouraging adoption and increasing the registry's value not only to DP practitioners, but also to policymakers, data users, and data subjects.</description>

      <title>Steganographic Backdoor Attacks in NLP: Ultra-Low Poisoning and Defense Evasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer models are foundational to natural language processing (NLP) applications, yet remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks introduced through poisoned data, which implant hidden behaviors during training. To strengthen the ability to prevent such compromises, recent research has focused on designing increasingly stealthy attacks to stress-test existing defenses, pairing backdoor behaviors with stylized artifact or token-level perturbation triggers. However, this trend diverts attention from the harder and more realistic case: making the model respond to semantic triggers such as specific names or entities, where a successful backdoor could manipulate outputs tied to real people or events in deployed systems. Motivated by this growing disconnect, we introduce SteganoBackdoor, bringing stealth techniques back into line with practical threat models. Leveraging innocuous properties from natural-language steganography, SteganoBackdoor applies a gradient-guided data optimization process to transform semantic trigger seeds into steganographic carriers that embed a high backdoor payload, remain fluent, and exhibit no representational resemblance to the trigger. Across diverse experimental settings, SteganoBackdoor achieves over 99% attack success at an order-of-magnitude lower data-poisoning rate than prior approaches while maintaining unparalleled evasion against a comprehensive suite of data-level defenses. By revealing this practical and covert attack, SteganoBackdoor highlights an urgent blind spot in current defenses and demands immediate attention to adversarial data defenses and real-world threat modeling.</description>

      <title>Critical Evaluation of Quantum Machine Learning for Adversarial Robustness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computational principles into learning algorithms, offering improved representational capacity and computational efficiency. Nevertheless, the security and robustness of QML systems remain underexplored, especially under adversarial conditions. In this paper, we present a systematization of adversarial robustness in QML, integrating conceptual organization with empirical evaluation across three threat models-black-box, gray-box, and white-box. We implement representative attacks in each category, including label-flipping for black-box, QUID encoder-level data poisoning for gray-box, and FGSM and PGD for white-box, using Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) trained on two datasets from distinct domains: MNIST from computer vision and AZ-Class from Android malware, across multiple circuit depths (2, 5, 10, and 50 layers) and two encoding schemes (angle and amplitude). Our evaluation shows that amplitude encoding yields the highest clean accuracy (93% on MNIST and 67% on AZ-Class) in deep, noiseless circuits; however, it degrades sharply under adversarial perturbations and depolarization noise (p=0.01), dropping accuracy below 5%. In contrast, angle encoding, while offering lower representational capacity, remains more stable in shallow, noisy regimes, revealing a trade-off between capacity and robustness. Moreover, the QUID attack attains higher attack success rates, though quantum noise channels disrupt the Hilbert-space correlations it exploits, weakening its impact in image domains. This suggests that noise can act as a natural defense mechanism in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) systems. Overall, our findings guide the development of secure and resilient QML architectures for practical deployment. These insights underscore the importance of designing threat-aware models that remain reliable under real-world noise in NISQ settings.</description>

      <title>MAIF: Enforcing AI Trust and Provenance with an Artifact-Centric Agentic Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The AI trustworthiness crisis threatens to derail the artificial intelligence revolution, with regulatory barriers, security vulnerabilities, and accountability gaps preventing deployment in critical domains. Current AI systems operate on opaque data structures that lack the audit trails, provenance tracking, or explainability required by emerging regulations like the EU AI Act. We propose an artifact-centric AI agent paradigm where behavior is driven by persistent, verifiable data artifacts rather than ephemeral tasks, solving the trustworthiness problem at the data architecture level. Central to this approach is the Multimodal Artifact File Format (MAIF), an AI-native container embedding semantic representations, cryptographic provenance, and granular access controls. MAIF transforms data from passive storage into active trust enforcement, making every AI operation inherently auditable. Our production-ready implementation demonstrates ultra-high-speed streaming (2,720.7 MB/s), optimized video processing (1,342 MB/s), and enterprise-grade security. Novel algorithms for cross-modal attention, semantic compression, and cryptographic binding achieve up to 225 compression while maintaining semantic fidelity. Advanced security features include stream-level access control, real-time tamper detection, and behavioral anomaly analysis with minimal overhead. This approach directly addresses the regulatory, security, and accountability challenges preventing AI deployment in sensitive domains, offering a viable path toward trustworthy AI systems at scale.</description>

      <title>Protocols for Quantum Weak Coin Flipping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak coin flipping is an important cryptographic primitive$\unicode{x2013}$it is the strongest known secure two-party computation primitive that classically becomes secure only under certain assumptions (e.g. computational hardness), while quantumly there exist protocols that achieve arbitrarily close to perfect security. This breakthrough result was established by Mochon in 2007 [arXiv:0711.4114]. However, his proof relied on the existence of certain unitary operators which was established by a non-constructive argument. Consequently, explicit protocols have remained elusive. In this work, we give exact constructions of related unitary operators. These, together with a new formalism, yield a family of protocols approaching perfect security thereby also simplifying Mochon's proof of existence. We illustrate the construction of explicit weak coin flipping protocols by considering concrete examples (from the aforementioned family of protocols) that are more secure than all previously known protocols.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Input Auto-Encoder Guided Feature Selection for IoT Intrusion Detection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While intrusion detection systems (IDSs) benefit from the diversity and generalization of IoT data features, the data diversity (e.g., the heterogeneity and high dimensions of data) also makes it difficult to train effective machine learning models in IoT IDSs. This also leads to potentially redundant/noisy features that may decrease the accuracy of the detection engine in IDSs. This paper first introduces a novel neural network architecture called Multiple-Input Auto-Encoder (MIAE). MIAE consists of multiple sub-encoders that can process inputs from different sources with different characteristics. The MIAE model is trained in an unsupervised learning mode to transform the heterogeneous inputs into lower-dimensional representation, which helps classifiers distinguish between normal behaviour and different types of attacks. To distil and retain more relevant features but remove less important/redundant ones during the training process, we further design and embed a feature selection layer right after the representation layer of MIAE resulting in a new model called MIAEFS. This layer learns the importance of features in the representation vector, facilitating the selection of informative features from the representation vector. The results on three IDS datasets, i.e., NSLKDD, UNSW-NB15, and IDS2017, show the superior performance of MIAE and MIAEFS compared to other methods, e.g., conventional classifiers, dimensionality reduction models, unsupervised representation learning methods with different input dimensions, and unsupervised feature selection models. Moreover, MIAE and MIAEFS combined with the Random Forest (RF) classifier achieve accuracy of 96.5% in detecting sophisticated attacks, e.g., Slowloris.

      <title>ARBoids: Adaptive Residual Reinforcement Learning With Boids Model for Cooperative Multi-USV Target Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The target defense problem (TDP) for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) concerns intercepting an adversarial USV before it breaches a designated target region, using one or more defending USVs. A particularly challenging scenario arises when the attacker exhibits superior maneuverability compared to the defenders, significantly complicating effective interception. To tackle this challenge, this letter introduces ARBoids, a novel adaptive residual reinforcement learning framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the biologically inspired, force-based Boids model. Within this framework, the Boids model serves as a computationally efficient baseline policy for multi-agent coordination, while DRL learns a residual policy to adaptively refine and optimize the defenders' actions. The proposed approach is validated in a high-fidelity Gazebo simulation environment, demonstrating superior performance over traditional interception strategies, including pure force-based approaches and vanilla DRL policies. Furthermore, the learned policy exhibits strong adaptability to attackers with diverse maneuverability profiles, highlighting its robustness and generalization capability. The code of ARBoids will be released upon acceptance of this letter.</description>

      <title>CGCE: Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure in Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale generative models have enabled the creation of high-quality images and videos, but have also raised significant safety concerns regarding the generation of unsafe content. To mitigate this, concept erasure methods have been developed to remove undesirable concepts from pre-trained models. However, existing methods remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can regenerate the erased content. Moreover, achieving robust erasure often degrades the model's generative quality for safe, unrelated concepts, creating a difficult trade-off between safety and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Classifier-Guided Concept Erasure (CGCE), an efficient plug-and-play framework that provides robust concept erasure for diverse generative models without altering their original weights. CGCE uses a lightweight classifier operating on text embeddings to first detect and then refine prompts containing undesired concepts. This approach is highly scalable, allowing for multi-concept erasure by aggregating guidance from several classifiers. By modifying only unsafe embeddings at inference time, our method prevents harmful content generation while preserving the model's original quality on benign prompts. Extensive experiments show that CGCE achieves state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of red-teaming attacks. Our approach also maintains high generative utility, demonstrating a superior balance between safety and performance. We showcase the versatility of CGCE through its successful application to various modern T2I and T2V models, establishing it as a practical and effective solution for safe generative AI.</description>

      <title>A Visual Perception-Based Tunable Framework and Evaluation Benchmark for H.265/HEVC ROI Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ROI selective encryption, as an efficient privacy protection technique, encrypts only the key regions in the video, thereby ensuring security while minimizing the impact on coding efficiency. However, existing ROI-based video encryption methods suffer from insufficient flexibility and lack of a unified evaluation system. To address these issues, we propose a visual perception-based tunable framework and evaluation benchmark for H.265/HEVC ROI encryption. Our scheme introduces three key contributions: 1) A ROI region recognition module based on visual perception network is proposed to accurately identify the ROI region in videos. 2) A three-level tunable encryption strategy is implemented while balancing security and real-time performance. 3) A unified ROI encryption evaluation benchmark is developed to provide a standardized quantitative platform for subsequent research. This triple strategy provides new solution and significant unified performance evaluation methods for ROI selective encryption field. Experimental results indicate that the proposed benchmark can comprehensively measure the performance of the ROI selective encryption. Compared to existing ROI encryption algorithms, our proposed enhanced and advanced level encryption exhibit superior performance in multiple performance metrics. In general, the proposed framework effectively meets the privacy protection requirements in H.265/HEVC and provides a reliable solution for secure and efficient processing of sensitive video content.</description>
