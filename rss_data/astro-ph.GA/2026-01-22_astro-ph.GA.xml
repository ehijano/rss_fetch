      <title>The Little Red Dots Are Direct Collapse Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery by JWST of a substantial population of compact "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) presents a major puzzle: their observed spectra defy standard astrophysical interpretations. Here, we show that LRD spectra are naturally reproduced by emission from an accreting Direct Collapse Black Hole (DCBH). Using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, we follow the growth of the DCBH seed via a dense, compressionally heated, collisionally ionized accretion flow. The model self-consistently reproduces the screen responsible for the observed Balmer absorption, while allowing UV/optical emission to partially escape, along with reprocessed infrared radiation. Crucially, this structure is not a blackbody and requires no stellar contribution: the UV continuum originates entirely from reprocessed DCBH radiation, attenuated only by a small amount of dust with an extinction curve consistent with high-redshift galaxies. This single framework simultaneously explains the key observational puzzles of LRDs: (a) weak X-ray emission, (b) metal and high-ionization lines alongside absent star-formation features, (c) overmassive black holes, (d) compact morphology, (e) abundance and redshift evolution -- linking them directly to pristine atomic-cooling halos, (f) long-lived ($&gt;100$ Myr), slowly variable phases driven by radiation pressure. Our findings indicate that JWST is witnessing the widespread formation of heavy black hole seeds in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Hunting the first Cosmic Giants: formation and detectability of Direct Collapse Black Holes around high-redshift quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe poses a challenge to current models of black hole growth. One promising formation pathway is the direct collapse black hole (DCBH) scenario, in which gas in pristine, low-metallicity halos forms supermassive (or quasi-) stars leading to massive black holes seeds under specific environmental conditions. In this work, we investigate the potential host environments of DCBHs by coupling a semi-analytic model tracing BH formation and galaxy co-evolution with high-resolution N-body dark matter merger trees. This allows us to trace the population of DCBHs formed during the hierarchical assembly of a $\sim 10^{12} ~\rm M_\odot$ dark matter halo hosting a bright $10^9 ~\rm M_\odot$ quasar at redshift $z \approx 7$. We find that, when accounting for local fluctuations in the UV radiation field within this early cosmic structure, massive BH seeds can form via direct collapse as early as $z \approx 22$. Even under more stringent conditions for heavy seed formation, tens of DCBHs are predicted to emerge within the simulated overdensity down to $z \sim 14$, at which point metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium inhibits further episodes of direct collapse. A significant fraction of the massive black hole population formed at $z &gt; 14$ is expected to survive in satellite galaxies that do not merge with the central halo down to $z \approx 7$. We show that the existence of such a population of ungrown heavy BH seeds can be probed through deep JWST observations targeting regions surrounding bright high-redshift quasars, and we discuss tailored observational strategies to detect and identify these elusive systems.</description>

      <title>The Distance to NGC 4258 from Individual Maser Component Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a reanalysis of the water maser system in NGC 4258 to reassess its geometric distance, commonly reported as approximately 7.6 Mpc with percent-level accuracy, a key anchor in extragalactic distance ladder calibrations and recent determinations of the Hubble constant. We introduce a method that relies exclusively on tracking individual maser components, rather than assuming a single averaged trajectory as in previous works, thereby avoiding arbitrary data averaging that can bias interpretations of the disk's geometry and dynamics. This approach requires spatially resolved individual maser components; consequently, the majority of observational epochs were excluded, as they lack sufficient spatial resolution to localize the maser position. We track individual maser components across multiple epochs and introduce an efficient marginalization method over nuisance parameters (angular radius and azimuth of each maser), reducing the number of free parameters from hundreds to 14. Our analysis reveals that the current observational cadence is insufficient to reliably track the individual masers, which our method relies on, given their intrinsic variability. Across a range of maser selections and model configurations, inferred distances span approximately between 6.7 to 8.1 Mpc, demonstrating significant sensitivity to how our method selects individual masers. Even visually and statistically robust fits can differ by several standard deviations, reflecting ambiguity in component identification across sparsely sampled epochs. We evaluate the impact of observational cadence on tracking fidelity and distance precision, and show that high-cadence monitoring is needed for our method to track individual masers and produce a robust anchor for cosmology.</description>

      <title>Mirror images of lensed star clusters with mismatched spectral energy distributions: A possible signature of top-heavy stellar initial mass functions and extreme stars in high-redshift star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly lensed star clusters have recently been detected up to redshift $z\approx 10$ in galaxy cluster fields using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). When pairs of mirror images of such star clusters appear across the lensing critical curve, it is usually assumed that both images will display identical spectral energy distributions (SEDs). However, this assumption may be invalidated in the presence of gravitational microlensing from stars or other compact objects in the lens, since microlensing will affect the SED contribution from bright stars within the star cluster independently in the two mirror images. Here, we explore under what circumstances mismatched mirror-image SEDs are likely to be observable, and argue that SED differences detectable in JWST observations of lensing-cluster fields will be limited to star clusters of mass $&lt; 10^5\ M_\odot$ and ages $\lesssim 5$ Myr. The probability of severely mismatched mirror-image SEDs increases if the stellar initial mass function is very top-heavy and extends to stellar masses $\gg 100\ M_\odot$, as has been suggested to be the case for Population III stars. The prevalence of lensed star clusters with highly discrepant mirror-image SEDs could therefore serve as a probe of very massive stars and extreme stellar populations in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Cold gas formation triggered by active galactic nuclei jet feedback in galaxy cluster cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended warm and cold gas nebulae, with complex morphologies and kinematics, have been observed in the centres of cool-core galaxy clusters. Their origin within the hot intracluster medium (ICM) is still puzzling, and among many mechanisms, positive feedback from the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been proposed. In this work, we performed a suite of very high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of a Perseus-like cool-core galaxy cluster subject to self-regulated AGN jet feedback, which leads to realistic ICM properties. By explicitly following warm ionized, neutral, and molecular gas phases, we studied the complex interplay between AGN activity and the multi-phase ICM. While AGN feedback globally heats the ICM, we find that during the individual AGN jet bursts, hot material is also injected laterally to the jet axis, within the turbulent mixing layer. This material, as it expands, compresses the surrounding hot ICM, reducing the local cooling time, and leads to the formation of cold clumps on a characteristic timescale of $\sim 30$ Myr. By employing tracers, we explicitly track cooling within the affected regions, finding that very hot gas identified in high-compression, low-vorticity zones condenses in situ to form cold clumps. A statistical analysis reveals that the condensation of cold gas is highly promoted once the local turbulent Mach number, $\sigma_{hot}/c_{s,hot}$, in the hot gas component ($T \geq 10^7$ K) takes values around ~0.3. The presented process is a further important step in understanding the physical mechanisms that lead to the formation of cold gas in the cluster core. Our measured values of the characteristic turbulent Mach number, together with detailed multi-phase gas kinematics predictions, provide important theoretical tools to interpret future X-ray spectroscopy and deep radio data, ultimately to constrain the origin of cool-core cluster nebulae.</description>

      <title>Growth of Light Seed Black Holes in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses exceeding $10^6 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ at redshifts $z &gt; 8$, posing significant challenges to existing models of early black hole formation and growth. Here we show, in a fully cosmological setting, that light seed black holes (LSBHs), remnants of Population III stars, can grow rapidly to $\sim10^4 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in the early Universe. This growth is enabled by our novel black hole seeding prescription and the unprecedented resolution of our zoom-in cosmological simulations, which resolve the dense environments necessary for efficient accretion. Our results provide robust evidence that LSBHs can attain the masses required to serve as the dominant progenitors of the SMBH population observed at later cosmic epochs. These findings have far-reaching implications for the interpretation of JWST observations and future gravitational wave detections with LISA.</description>

      <title>Stirring Things Up: Bar-induced substructures in the stellar halo of a cosmological Milky Way analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar halo of the Milky Way contains the remnants of past accretion events, which could be detectable as substructures in the classical integrals of motion space, such as energy and angular momentum (E-Lz). However, our galaxy also contains a non-axisymmetric stellar bar, which traps stars in resonant orbits, leading to substructures in phase-space. Using a high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamic cosmological zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way analogue, we explore the connection between the bar and the accreted stellar halo. We find that the bar induces prominent substructures, or "ridges", in E-Lz, caused by the resonances. The most pronounced of these is caused by the corotation and the retrograde 1:1 resonances, with weaker ridges visible due to the prograde 1:1 and outer Lindblad resonance. The ridges are present across much of the stellar halo, with variations in radius due to the morphology of different orbital families. We explore the scattering of orbits at the resonances, finding that stars trapped at the 1:1 retrograde resonance become more circularised and have more negative angular momentum. Additionally, stars can move between the corotation and retrograde 1:1 families, thus alternating between prograde and retrograde motion. Due to these scatterings and the pre-existing metallicity gradients in the accreted population, the bar-induced substructures have distinct metallicities compared to stars in the surrounding phase-space. Our results suggest the need for caution when searching the Milky Way stellar halo for accreted substructures in both integral of motions and chemical spaces, since these can be induced by internal perturbations.</description>

      <title>The Role of Inner Halo Angular Momentum (Spin) in Shaping Dark Matter Bars in Milky Way Analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of galactic bars have primarily focused on stellar bars, since they can be directly observed through ultraviolet to infrared wavebands. Cosmological as well as idealised simulations reveal that the dark matter (DM) haloes interact with baryonic matter, primarily the stellar bars, dynamically by means of the exchange of angular momentum. In these simulations, the spherical DM halo dynamically responds to interaction with the stellar bar by reshaping its orbital structure in the proximity of the stellar bar, forming a bar-like configuration, called as the Dark Matter (DM) bar. Using N-body simulations of Milky Way analogs we discuss the role of inner halo angular momentum, measured as halo spin parameter {\lambda} of the dark matter halo, on formation and evolutionary characteristics of the DM bars. Our systematic study involves haloes with initial spin configurations ranging from {\lambda} = 0 to 0.1. The result conveys that DM bar formation and its characteristics are extensively dependent on the initial spin parameter {\lambda} of the DM halo. We demonstrate that the strength of the dark matter bar gradually increases with an increase in halo spin in long-term evolution, with a significant impact of stellar bar buckling on dark matter bar strength. The evolutionary characteristics of the DM bar are strongly influenced by the initial spin of the host halo.</description>

      <title>The Carousel Lens I: A Spectroscopic Survey of the Carousel Lens Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic survey of field galaxies and lensed sources in the vicinity of the strong lensing galaxy cluster known as the Carousel lens at z=0.49. Using both Gemini/GMOS slitmask spectra and deep VLT/MUSE observations, we bring the total number of lensed sources up to 13, including three which were not previously known from imaging observations but are apparent in the MUSE data as emission-line sources. Of these sources, 10 have confident redshifts, and an additional 2 have tentative redshifts from likely Ly$\alpha$ emission (including seven new redshifts determined here adding to those presented previously in Sheu et al. (2024)). The lensed sources span a redshift range from z=0.96 to 4.09 with most of them showing 3-5 images, including four sources displaying central or radial images. In total, we identify 43 images of these 13 sources. This lens system is remarkably symmetric and well-modeled by a simpler lens model than typical cluster lenses, and the large number of sources and their large range of redshifts make this cluster ideal for constraining cosmological parameters such as $w$ and $\Omega_m$ as well as the cluster density profile. Additionally, we present a catalog of 57 unlensed field galaxies with confident redshifts, of which 49 are associated with the cluster. We measure a cluster velocity dispersion of about 1100 km s$^{-1}$ from which we estimate a halo mass $M_{200c} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{15} M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>New techniques to investigate the AGN-SF connection with integral field spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between active galactic nuclei and star-formation (the AGN-SF connection) is one of the longest standing problems in modern astrophysics. In the age of large Integral Field Unit (IFU) surveys, studies of the AGN-SF connection greatly benefit from spatially resolving AGN and SF contributions to study the two processes independently. Using IFU data for 54 local active galaxies from the S7 sample, we present a new method to separate emission from AGN activity and SF using mixing sequences observed in the [NII]$\lambda 6584$/H$\alpha$ vs. [OIII]$\lambda 5007$/H$\beta$ Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram. We use the new decomposition method to calculate the H$\alpha$ star-formation rate and AGN [OIII] luminosity for the galaxies. Our new method is robust to outliers in the line-ratio distribution and can be applied to large galaxy samples with little manual intervention. We infer star-formation histories (SFHs) using pPXF, conducting detailed recovery tests to determine the quantities that can be considered robust. We test the correlation between the AGN Eddington ratio, using the proxy L[OIII]/$\sigma_*^4$, and star-formation properties. We find a moderately strong correlation between the Eddington ratio and the star-formation rate (SFR). We also observe marginally significant correlations between the AGN Eddington ratio and the light-weighted stellar age under 100 Myr. Our results point to higher AGN accretion being associated with young nuclear star formation under 100 Myr, consistent with timelines presented in previous studies. The correlations found in this paper are relatively weak; extending our methods to larger samples, including radio-quiet galaxies, will help better constrain the physical mechanisms and timescales of the AGN-SF connection.</description>

      <title>Signatures of a Tidally Induced Spiral Arm at the Anticenter of the Milky Way and a Kinematically Extended Anticenter Stream Using DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Milky Way Survey (DESI MWS), we examine the 6D space of the anticenter region of the stellar disk (150$^\circ$ $&lt;$ Galactic longitude $&lt;$ 220$^\circ$) using 61,883 main sequence turn-off stars. We focus on two well-known stellar overdensities in the anticenter, the Monoceros Ring (MRi) and Anticenter Stream (ACS). We find that the MRi overdensity has kinematics consistent with a tidally induced spiral arm, a type of dynamic spiral arm created by an interaction with a satellite galaxy, most likely the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal galaxy (Sgr). We use the kinematics of the MRi to calculate the two most recent passage times of Sgr are 0.25 $\pm$ 0.09 Gyrs and 1.10 $\pm$ 0.23 Gyrs from the present day. We validate that the ACS is kinematically decoupled from the MRi because they are moving in opposite radial and vertical directions. We find that the kinematics associated with the ACS are not confined to our defined overdensity. The features we see in the ACS region are likely part of a broader distribution of stars with the same kinematic signature as detected in other places, like the vertical wave in the outer disk and phase spiral.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Multi-Line Analysis Combined Kernel PCA and Kernel SHAP: A Case of NGC 1068 ALMA Band 3 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new framework for multi-line analysis that combines kernel principal component analysis (Kernel PCA), an unsupervised machine-learning method, and Kernel SHapley Additive exPlanations (Kernel SHAP), an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique. To enable a comparison with PCA-based studies, which have been widely used in multi-line analyses, we apply our framework to integrated intensity maps of 13 molecular lines from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 3 archival data of the nearby galaxy NGC 1068. Previous PCA-based studies of NGC 1068 reported that physically meaningful structures are mainly captured up to the second component. In contrast, our framework can interpret physically meaningful features up to the fourth component. Furthermore, by comparing the results obtained from our framework with molecular column densities derived from local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) analysis, we suggest that the abundance of HCO+ is relatively enhanced in the molecular outflow region extending to a radius of about 400 pc from the galactic center, likely due to the effects of ultraviolet radiation and highly dense gas. These results show that our framework can provide data-driven insights into physical and chemical features that have not been clearly identified in previous studies. It also provides an efficient tool for interpreting the rapidly increasing amount of multi-line observational data.</description>

      <title>Decomposing the growth mechanisms of galaxies over the last 10 billion years</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining how galaxies accumulate stellar mass is paramount to understanding the Universe. Two primary mechanisms drive this process: star-formation (SF) &amp; mergers. Our understanding of star formation, and to some degree the processes that influence the baryon cycle (environment, gas supply, feedback, etc), are either relatively well constrained or will develop significantly over the coming decades via upcoming facilities (i.e. through their imprint on galaxy properties measured with deep multi-wavelength and spectroscopic data). However, the same can not be said for mergers. It is telling that we indirectly know hierarchical assembly through mergers is one of the most crucial processes that shape our Universe, but the robust observational measurement of mergers is almost non-existent outside of the local Universe - let alone how these mergers impact galaxy properties. This is not likely to significantly change in the coming decades as existing or approved facilities/surveys are inadequate in charactering mergers in the distant Universe. Motivated by this, we discuss an ambitious study to first explore mergers, and then the co-dependent astrophysical process that govern the accumulation of stellar mass over the last ~10billion years, and highlight the essential need for a 10m+ class multi-object spectroscopic facility.</description>

      <title>Detailed lens modeling and kinematics of the submillimeter galaxy G09v1.97. An analysis of CO, H2O, H2O+, and dust continuum emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation mechanisms of intensely starbursting galaxies at high redshift remain unknown. One possible mechanism for triggering these starbursts is mergers and interactions, but detecting these at high redshift remains a challenge. Observations of high-redshift gravitationally lensed galaxies enable studies of the interstellar medium and environment of these extreme starbursts in detail. We used high angular resolution observations of dust continuum, CO(6-5), H2O(211-202), and H2O+(202-111) emission to constrain the ongoing processes in the z = 3.63 gravitationally lensed submillimeter galaxy H-ATLAS J083051.0+013224 (G09v1.97). We used PyAutoLens to create a de-magnified source plane CO(6-5) emission line cube and performed kinematic modeling using 3DBarolo. Additionally, we investigated the properties of the continuum and molecular line emission in the source plane. We find that the regions of CO(6-5) and H2O(211-202) emission match closely in the source plane but that the dust continuum emission is more compact. We find that our lens modeling results do not require more than one source, contrary to what has been found in previous studies. Instead, we find that G09v1.97 resembles a rotating disk with Vmax/sigma = 2.8 +/- 0.4 with evidence for residual emission indicative of non-circular motions such as outflows, tidal tails, or an additional background galaxy. We suggest that the origin of the non-circular motions may be associated with a bi-conical outflow, a tidal tail from an interaction, or indicate the possible presence of an additional galaxy. We calculate the dynamical mass, gas mass, star-formation rate, and depletion time for G09v1.97 and find a high star-formation rate and low gas depletion time. In combination, this suggests that G09v1.97 has recently undergone an interaction, triggering intense star formation, and is in the process of settling into a disk.</description>

      <title>Polarization properties of changing-look active galactic nuclei: NGC 1365 and NGC 2992</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGNs) represent a rare class of AGNs that undergo transitions from type 1 (characterized by the presence of broad emission lines in their spectra) to type 2 (absence of broad emission lines) or vice versa, over timescales ranging from months to years. Since normal type 1 and type 2 AGNs are known to show different polarization properties, detailed investigations of the CLAGN polarization can shed light on the underlying mechanisms responsible for the changing-look phenomenon. We present new (spectro)polarimetric observations of two changing-look AGNs located in the core of the inclined spiral galaxies NGC 1365 and NGC 2992. Both AGNs are radio emitters, thereby enabling a comparison of their polarization to the radio jet axis, which defines the accretion disk geometry. In the case of NGC 1365, the AGN shows polarization characteristics consistent with those observed in type 1 Seyferts, in particular polarization parallel to the radio jet. This intrinsic polarization is modified by the wavelength-dependent dichroic extinction that occurs in the galaxy bar and that rotates the polarization angle at the shortest wavelengths. NGC 2992, on the other hand, is so inclined that dichroic dust extinction in the disk completely dominates the polarization of the AGN, thus overwhelming any polarization due to scattering. Consequently, the polarization properties remain essentially constant between the different AGN states, and the faint broad lines observed in the polarized flux are most likely not scattered light. Differential dilution between the continuum and the narrow-line polarizations can explain the unusually high polarization measured in the emission lines.</description>

      <title>The Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Reverberation Mapping Project: Stable Optical Continuum Lags of an IMBH in the Dwarf Galaxy NGC 4395 Over Years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC 4395 is a nearby dwarf spiral galaxy hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) powered by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH, $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{4-5}\,M_\odot$). Recent optical continuum reverberation mapping studies have suggested potential lag variations between different epochs, offering important clues to the physical mechanisms governing variability in the vicinity of the central black hole. We present continuous intranight multi-band photometric monitoring of NGC 4395 based on three nights of observations with the Faulkes Telescope North and two nights with the Mephisto telescope. This represents the first systematic investigation of optical continuum lag stability in a robustly confirmed IMBH. By applying difference-imaging techniques to both the new observations and archival data, we significantly detect the optical inter-band lags of $\sim$5-15 minutes, which increase monotonically with wavelength. No obvious $u$-band lag excess is observed, implying a negligible fractional contribution from diffuse continuum (DC) emission to the optical continuum, in agreement with our spectral decomposition results. Remarkably, the inter-band lags remain stable over multi-year baselines. We attribute this long-term lag stability primarily to the minor DC contribution, a relatively steady disk-corona structure, and the unusually high X-ray-to-optical luminosity ratio characteristic of low-luminosity AGNs, which likely allows X-ray reprocessing to dominate over other potential variability mechanisms. Future facilities like Gemini/SCORPIO, with its simultaneous optical-to-near-infrared coverage, will be ideally suited to play an important role in advancing this field.</description>

      <title>Small scale turbulence alongside with large scale turbulence in a z~sim 2 star Forming Galaxy with outflowing wind, revealed by Multi-point structure functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Goldman (2024) obtained evidence for a large scale compressible, Burgers turbulence in the ism of a gravitationally lensed, star-forming galaxy at $z = 1.87$, with an outflowing wind. The turbulent timescale on the largest spatial scale has been found to be ~500 Myr . This together with the large spatial scale of~ 6.4 kpc suggest a large scale generating mechanism (such as tidal interaction or merger) that lasted for ~500 Myr. On the other hand, the outflowing wind is much younger and is probably the result of the intense star formation. Therefore, could it be that the star formation drives also turbulence on small scales? In the present work we utilize multi-point second order structure functions to find whether there exists also a small scale turbulence in this galaxy, and if so, try to identify its drivers. We obtained evidence for small scale turbulence whose largest spatial scale ~240 pc for the nebular gas velocity field and ~ 290 pc$ for the outflowing wind velocity field. These values suggest that stellar sub clumps or giant star clusters with an high concentration of young massive stars could be responsible for both the outflow and for the small scale turbulence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The European Archive of the James Webb Space Telescope (eJWST) provides access to all data collected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). JWST's capabilities span from studying early universe galaxy formation to probing exoplanet atmospheres. Specifically, for Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), JWST offers unparalleled opportunities, enabling investigation into AGN phenomena with unprecedented detail through high-resolution imaging, spectroscopy, and photometric data. Aims. This study aims to compile and release a catalogue of all AGN observations conducted with JWST. Using eJWST, we systematically filter and organize these observations to facilitate access and retrieval of all of JWST's data products related to AGNs. Our goal is to provide the community with a valuable resource for their research. Methods. We compiled the AGN observations in eJWST using specific keywords set by the principal investigators in their proposals, manually reviewing the approved programs of JWST, as well as cross-matching all available observations with available AGN catalogues such as the Million Quasar catalogue, the SDSS MaNGA AGN catalogue, the CDFS catalogue, and others. Results. The resulting catalogue contains a total of 3,242 individual AGNs included in JWST observations. This is one of the first extensive collections of AGN observations from the JWST. It includes detailed information about the targets (name, coordinates, redshift), specifics of the JWST observations (instrument, aperture, filter, etc.), and provides links for data downloads.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE: The evolving radio luminosity functions of star-forming galaxies to $z\sim 4.5$ and the cosmic history of star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key question in extragalactic astronomy is how the star-formation rate density (SFRD) evolves over cosmic time. A powerful way of addressing this question is using radio-continuum observations, where the radio waves are unaffected by dust and are able to reach sufficient resolution to resolve individual galaxies. We present an investigation of the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using deep radio continuum observations in the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields, covering a combined area of $\sim 4\,\mathrm{deg}^2$. These data enable the most accurate measurement of the evolution in the SFRD from mid-frequency radio continuum observations. We model the total RLF as the sum of evolving SFG and AGN components, negating the need for individual source classification. We find that the SFGs have systematically higher space densities at fixed luminosity than found in previous radio studies, but consistent with more recent studies with MeerKAT. We attribute this to the excellent low-surface brightness sensitivity of MeerKAT.
  We then determine the evolution of the SFRD. Adopting the far-infrared - radio correlation results in a significantly higher the SFRD at $z &gt; 1$, compared to combined UV and far-infrared measurements. However, using more recent relations for the correlation between star-formation rate and radio luminosity, based on full spectral energy distribution modelling, can resolve this apparent discrepancy. Thus radio observations provide a powerful method of determining the total SFRD, in the absence of dust-sensitive far-infrared data.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of the HII region NGC 7538 from study of the Ha line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Massive stars impact their surrounding initiating star-formation along their photo-dissociation region. Once the HII region is formed it is unclear if and how the second generation of stars impacts its aspect and evolution. Methods. We performed high spectral resolution (R ~ 23400) Ha Fabry-Perot observations in five fields covering the Galactic HII region NGC 7538 and lead profiles multi-gaussian fitting to extract the parameters as peak intensity, width and velocity. We then analyse the kinematics of the ionised gas building kinematic diagrams and second order structure functions for every field. Results. The observations reveal a general blue-shifted ionised gas flow larger than 11 km s-1 in NGC 7538, consistent with previous studies. Profiles originating from features that are dark in Ha due to extinction or from outside the region show velocity dispersion larger than the one typically found for the Warm Interstellar Medium. The analysis of kinematic diagrams and second-order structure functions reveals non-thermal motions attributed to turbulence and large-scale velocity gradients. In the direction of the HII region itself the turbulence seems to be shock-dominated, with a characteristic scale length between ~ 0.72 and 1.46 pc. In this context, we propose that the kinematics of the central part of the region could be explained by the superposition of the outflow coming from IRS1 and a wind bow shock formed ahead IRS6.</description>

      <title>MSA-3D: Connecting the Chemical and Kinematic Structures of Galaxies at $z \sim 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between ionized gas kinematics and gas-phase metallicity gradients in 21 star-forming galaxies at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.7$ from the MSA-3D survey, using spatially resolved JWST/NIRSpec slit-stepping observations. Galaxy kinematics are characterized by the ratio of rotational velocity to intrinsic velocity dispersion, $v/\sigma$, measured at $1.5\,R_e$, where $R_e$ is the effective radius. We find that dynamically hotter disks exhibit systematically flatter metallicity gradients, with a moderate anti-correlation between metallicity gradient and $v/\sigma$ (Pearson $r=-0.43$, $p=0.05$) and a linear fit yields a slope of $\sim 0.005$ dex per dex in $v/\sigma$, weaker than the dependence on stellar mass. A significantly stronger anti-correlation is observed with $R_e/\sigma$, interpreted as a proxy for the radial mixing timescale ($r=-0.59$, $p=0.005$), indicating that cumulative radial mixing more directly regulates chemical stratification. The metallicity gradients in our sample are uniformly shallow, indicating that efficient turbulent mixing in kinematically settled disks regulates the chemical structure of typical star-forming galaxies at $z\sim1$.</description>

      <title>CO Diffusion on Interstellar Amorphous Solid Water: A Computational Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface chemistry on interstellar dust grains is recognized as a central component in astrochemical models, representing a plausible formation route for many of the observed complex molecular species. However, key parameters governing interstellar surface chemistry, such as diffusion energy barriers, remain poorly constrained. In particular, surface diffusion constitutes a fundamental step for the synthesis of complex organic molecules and plays a crucial role in understanding the desorption process. In this paper, the diffusion dynamics of carbon monoxide (CO) on amorphous solid water (ASW) surfaces, representative of interstellar ices, is modeled with quantum-chemical methods. Employing a representative ensemble of water clusters, each made by 22 molecules, diffusion energy barriers between the binding sites are computed using Density Functional Theory. Diffusion rate coefficients are then determined by applying the harmonic approximation of Transition State Theory. The results, in agreement with experimental studies, revealed a wide distribution of diffusion energies. This reflects the intrinsic topological heterogeneity of ASW surfaces, and highlights how surface mobility significantly influences CO's desorption dynamics and, as a consequence, surface-mediated reactivity in interstellar environments. We show that key parameters commonly employed in astrochemical models, like the ratio between binding and diffusion energy, should be carefully revised.</description>

      <title>Probing Heavily Obscured AGN in Major Galaxy Mergers Using the mm-X-ray Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15186v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of heavily obscured supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth in late-stage galaxy mergers is challenging: column densities $N_{\mathrm{H}}&gt;10^{24},\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ can block most nuclear emission, leaving significant gaps in the SMBH growth census. Millimeter-wave continuum emission offers a potential window into this obscured phase, as it can trace Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) activity through mechanisms less affected by dust extinction. In this work, we test whether the observed correlation between millimeter ($\sim200,\mathrm{GHz}$) and hard X-ray (14 - 150,keV) luminosities can be used to plausibly identify hidden AGN in local (Ultra)Luminous Infrared Galaxies (U)LIRGs, including systems hosting confirmed dual AGN. We identify three sources -- one confirmed AGN and two strong candidates -- presenting significant evidence of AGN activity. The confirmed dual AGN lie within $\sim3\sigma$ of the mm--X-ray correlation, suggesting this relation can be used to identify hidden pairs. By combining the position of each source relative to this correlation with independent star formation rate constraints, we propose a method to disentangle AGN and star formation contributions for sources with measured column densities. While our analysis is based on a small, heterogeneous local sample and relies on empirical scaling relations, these results indicate that millimeter continuum emission may provide a useful complementary diagnostic for obscured SMBH growth. ALMA observations at high angular resolutions are particularly valuable for this approach, while future facilities such as the ngVLA will be essential to test its robustness in larger and more distant samples.</description>

      <title>Implications of the continuous radio-loudness distribution among AGNs in the local Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We investigate the radio loudness ($\mathcal{R}$) distribution in a large, homogeneous sample of radio galaxies. Methods. The sample is composed of galaxies from the ROGUE I/II catalogue belonging to the SDSS MGS and is divided into optically inactive radio galaxies (OPIRGs), optically active ones (OPARGs) and radio Seyferts. We use optical, mid-infrared and radio data to calculate the AGN bolometric luminosities, accretion rate ($\lambda$), black-hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and $\mathcal{R}$. Results. Contrary to some previous studies based on restricted samples, using our complete sample of objects with redshifts $z &lt; 0.4$, we find no evidence of bimodality in $\mathcal{R}$. The highest $\mathcal{R}$ values are associated with extended radio structures. $\mathcal{R}$ is anti-correlated with $\lambda$, and spans about 2 dex at fixed $\lambda$. Radio Seyferts, OPARGs and OPIRGs form a sequence of increasing $M_{BH}$ with substantial overlap. Radio Seyferts show no $\mathcal{R}$-$M_{BH}$ correlation, whereas OPARGs and OPIRGs show a weak positive trend. From theoretical considerations, the observed two-dex spread in radio luminosity and $\mathcal{R}$ can be reproduced by a four-fold variation in the dimensionless magnetic flux $\varphi$ assuming realistic black-hole spins. Conclusions. The smooth distribution of radio loudness supports a common evolutionary path for all radio sources, with black-hole spin and magnetic field varying continuously. The radio loudness depends on black-hole mass and accretion rate, while moderate variations in $\varphi$ may account for the observed scatter in this relation.</description>

      <title>The importance of super-Eddington black hole accretion for the emergence of massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations indicate that massive quiescent galaxies (stellar mass $M_{*}\gtrsim 10^{10}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$) at high redshift ($z\gtrsim 6$) are more abundant than predicted by most existing galaxy formation simulations and semi-analytic models. Notably, the new COLIBRE simulations have succeeded in reconciling this tension, though the precise reason for their improved agreement with JWST data remains unclear. We demonstrate that the improved agreement is largely due to super-Eddington growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) at high redshift. We run a series of $(100~\mathrm{cMpc})^{3}$ simulations with the COLIBRE subgrid physics, varying the maximum allowed BH accretion rate in units of the Eddington rate. We show that only the fiducial COLIBRE model, which permits super-Eddington accretion, is consistent with the JWST constraints at $z \gtrsim 6$. Moreover, we find that in COLIBRE about $50$ per cent of BH mass growth at high redshift occurs in the super-Eddington regime, even though such events are extremely rare in time. Our work highlights the important role of super-Eddington accretion in simulations of galaxy formation for reproducing the observed early emergence of quenching of massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>The baryonic mass-size relation of galaxies. II. Implications for the evolutionary paths between star-forming and passive galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The baryonic mass-size relation of galaxies links the total baryonic mass (stars plus gas) to the baryonic half-mass radius. In the first paper of this series, we showed that star-forming galaxies from the SPARC sample follow two distinct relations in the baryonic mass-size plane: one defined by high-surface-density (HSD), star-dominated, Sa-to-Sc galaxies, and one defined by low-surface-density (LSD), gas-dominated, Sd-to-dI galaxies. In this second paper, we study the structural relations between baryonic mass, half-mass radius, and mean surface density to constrain possible morphological transformations between star-forming and passive galaxies. We complemented the SPARC sample with $\sim$1200 passive galaxies that are nearly devoid of gas: ellipticals (Es), lenticulars (S0s), dwarf ellipticals (dEs) or dwarf spheroidals (dSphs), and the so-called `ultra-diffuse galaxies' (UDGs). Our results can be summarised as follows: (1) passive stellar components follow four distinct relations at high statistical significance, namely (i) ellipticals plus bulges, (ii) S0 disks, (iii) non-nucleated dwarfs (dEs, dSphs, UDGs), and (iv) nucleated dEs; (2) star-forming HSD disks (mostly Sa to Sc) overlap with S0 disks within 2$\sigma$ in the baryonic relations and within 1$\sigma$ in the stellar ones, so present-day spirals may simply evolve into lenticulars as they run out of gas; (3) star-forming LSD disks (mostly Sd to dI) are offset from non-nucleated passive dwarfs at more than 3$\sigma$ in the baryonic relations, but the two galaxy populations overlap within 1$\sigma$ in the stellar relations, suggesting that non-nucleated passive dwarfs may form from star-forming dwarfs only after gas removal; (4) UDGs extend the sequence of non-nucleated dEs/dSphs and may originate from the most diffuse star-forming LSD galaxies with no need for a substantial expansion of the stellar component.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Galactic Disk with Gaia DR3: A Deep Study of Berkeley 17, 18, and 39 Open Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a detailed investigation of three intermediate-to-old age open clusters, Berkeley 17, Berkeley 18, and Berkeley 39, utilizing precise astrometric and photometric data from Gaia DR3. Cluster membership was robustly determined through a probabilistic proper-motion analysis, yielding statistically significant samples of 600, 1042, and 907 stars, respectively. From the mean parallaxes of these members, we determine astrometric distances ranging from approximately 3.40 kpc for Berkeley 17 to 5.80 kpc for Berkeley 18. Isochrone fitting applied to the decontaminated color-magnitude diagrams constrains the cluster ages to 9.12 +/- 1.00 Gyr, 3.36 +/- 0.50 Gyr, and 5.10 +/- 0.50 Gyr, respectively. Interstellar reddening spans a wide range, from E(B-V) = 0.17 mag in Berkeley 39 to 0.58 mag in Berkeley 17. Structural parameters derived from King model fits to the radial density profiles, combined with mass function analyses, indicate that the clusters are dynamically relaxed systems with mass distributions broadly consistent with the canonical Salpeter slope. Our kinematic analysis reveals that Berkeley 17, Berkeley 18, and Berkeley 39 are part of the outer disk population.</description>

      <title>A spectroscopically confirmed, strongly lensed, metal-poor Type II supernova at z = 5.13</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04156v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observing supernovae (SNe) in the early Universe (z &gt; 3) provides a window into how both galaxies and individual stars have evolved over cosmic time, yet a detailed study of high-redshift stars and SNe has remained difficult due to their extreme distances and cosmological redshifting. To overcome the former, searches for gravitationally lensed sources allow for the discovery of magnified SNe that appear as multiple images - further providing the opportunity for efficient follow-up. Here we present the discovery of "SN Eos": a strongly lensed, multiply-imaged, SN II at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 5.133 +/- 0.001. SN Eos exploded in a Lyman-{\alpha} emitting galaxy when the Universe was only ~1 billion years old, shortly after it reionized and became transparent to ultraviolet radiation. A year prior to our discovery in JWST data, archival HST imaging of SN Eos reveals rest-frame far ultraviolet (~1,300{\AA}) emission, indicative of shock breakout or interaction with circumstellar material in the first few (rest-frame) days after explosion. The JWST spectroscopy of SN Eos, now the farthest spectroscopically confirmed SN ever discovered, shows that SN Eos's progenitor star likely formed in a metal-poor environment (&lt;= 0.1 Z_{\odot}), providing the first direct evidence of massive star formation in the metal-poor, early Universe. SN Eos would not have been detectable without the extreme lensing magnification of the system, highlighting the potential of such discoveries to eventually place constraints on the faint end of the cosmic star-formation rate density in the very early Universe.</description>

      <title>Chemical evolution of close massive binaries -- tidally-enhanced or tidally-suppressed mixing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the largest source of uncertainties in the predictions of stellar models comes from the internal transport mechanisms. In close massive binaries, previous theoretical studies suggest that tides systematically boost chemical mixing. However, observations do not reveal any clear period-nitrogen enrichment trend, challenging these predictions. In addition, comprehensive examinations of the interplay between tidal interactions, angular momentum and chemicals transport have so far been scarce. We investigate the interplay between tidal interactions and rotational mixing, and the impact of the angular moment transport (AMT) assumptions. We examine whether tidal interactions enhance or suppress chemical mixing by computing grids of genec binary models with various AMT treatments. In order to independently assess the role of tidal interactions, we systematically compute model variations of single stars with identical initial conditions. Our investigations reveal that tides can either enhance or suppress mixing relative to single-star models, and that the outcome is highly sensitive to the AMT assumptions. We identify a key contrast between the two types of computed models: in close systems subject to tides, magnetic models predict that the mixing efficiency is mostly determined by the orbital configuration, whereas in hydrodynamic models it also depends on the assumed initial velocity. As a result, hydro models may display non-monotonic period-enrichment trends, or even period-enrichment correlations. These results highlight the importance of the AMT assumptions in modeling binaries with tidal interactions. The sensitivity of the predictions of hydro models to initial conditions extends the size of the period-enrichment parameter space they cover, allowing them to accommodate for peculiar observed systems, i.e., with mild enrichment at short periods, or high enrichment at longer periods.</description>

      <title>Mach $&gt;3$ shocks at the tips of both eROSITA bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: eROSITA substantiated earlier indications that Loop-I is the northern part of an extended bipolar Galactic-bubble structure, but the southern bubble was not established in nonthermal emission and the shock strength was not robustly measured in either bubble. After using eROSITA data to map the bubble edges, we analyzed edge-adjacent radio and $\gamma$-ray data to remove foregrounds, test if the southern bubble can be detected in nonthermal emission, and measure the corresponding high-latitude spectra of both bubbles. Data were stacked parallel to the eROSITA bubble edges traced by an edge detector, in the same method used previously to pick up weak signals in the smaller, nested Fermi bubbles; the detected brightness jumps were then used to measure the spectrum. We detect ($&gt;5\sigma$) both bubble tips in both radio and $\gamma$-rays, and find a radio spectrum corresponding to high, Mach $3$-$5$ shocks. The southern bubble is fainter, by $\sim$an order of magnitude in radio, its edge propagating into a medium roughly half as dense. The results indicate that these eROSITA bubbles are older, evolved counterparts of the Fermi bubbles, arising from an earlier collimated high-energy outburst from the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>The Self-Limiting Nature of Jet-Modulated Thermal Conduction in Cool Core Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conduction as a mechanism for explaining the disrupted cooling-flow in galaxy clusters has been mostly discounted, as the process is inefficient at transporting heat all the way from the cluster into the core. However, thermal conduction can be strongly enhanced when materials of significantly different temperature are brought into proximity, and thus into close thermal contact. Jets of active galactic nuclei may act as heat pumps by bringing low-entropy gas from the cluster core into thermal contact with the hot outer atmosphere of the cluster, significantly increasing the feedback efficiency of active galactic nuclei. We test this hypothesis by running a suite of 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of active galactic nuclei jets in a Perseus-like cluster, including anisotropic conduction. We find that the heat pump efficiency $\eta$ can reach up to 50\% of the maximum possible efficiency $\eta_{\rm max}$ if conduction operates near the Spitzer-Braginskii limit, while $\eta\approx f_{\rm sp}\eta_{\rm max}$ if conduction along the field lines is substantially suppressed below the Spitzer-Braginskii value by a factor $f_{\rm sp}$ by kinetic effects, as recently suggested. We further find that jet-induced thermal conduction is self-limiting: Magnetic draping during the uplift results in a magnetic field orientation close to perpendicular to the induced temperature gradients, significantly reducing conduction along the ideal conductive pathways. Thus, for conservative assumptions about thermal conduction suppression by $f_{\rm sp} \lesssim 0.1$, the heat pump effect leads to only marginal heat transfer and, correspondingly, to immaterial changes in the overall thermal evolution of cool core clusters beyond the isolated effects of conduction and jet-induced heating alone.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Radial Velocities from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations and Implications for Astrometric Acceleration Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometry from the Gaia satellite and from the long-term combination of Hipparcos and Gaia are now sensitive to sky-plane accelerations as low as $\approx$1 m/s/yr. This paper quantifies and explores an important caveat: apparent nonlinear motion due to a star's nonzero radial velocity can be indistinguishable from real astrometric acceleration. This nonlinear motion is parallel to the proper motion, so it can be both quantified and avoided by projecting apparent astrometric accelerations into components parallel and perpendicular to the proper motion. We illustrate this distinction for a sample of very nearby, fast-moving stars from the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations (HGCA). We then generalize the effect of stellar radial velocity and projections of the astrometric acceleration to binary stars in which we observe the acceleration of both components. Finally, we demonstrate that the proper motion differences in the HGCA are statistically well-behaved even for the nearest and fastest-moving stars, at least in the component perpendicular to the proper motion. This distinction -- between astrometric acceleration parallel and perpendicular to proper motion -- could have important consequences for future missions reaching extreme astrometric sensitivities around nearby stars.</description>

      <title>The First Upper Bound on the Nano-Hertz Gravitational Waves and Galaxy Cross-Correlation signal using 15-year NANOGrav Data and DESI Galaxy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of a common-spectrum stochastic signal by multiple pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations has provided tentative evidence for a nanohertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB). This signal can be widely interpreted as originating from a cosmic population of inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Current PTA analyses primarily constrain the SGWB power spectrum and its auto-angular power spectrum. However, the supermassive black holes will produce an underlying correlation with the large-scale structure of the Universe, which can help in understanding the formation and evolution of the binaries. In this work, we develop a new analysis pipeline PyGxGW-PTA for studying the cross-correlation of nHz GW signal with galaxy surveys ($C^{\rm g\, GW}_\ell$) and obtain the first constraint on the SGWB and galaxy distribution cross-correlation using the NANOGrav 15-year dataset in combination with the DESI galaxy catalog. We find no statistically significant correlation between the SGWB and the large-scale distribution of DESI galaxies and using an optimal estimator we put an upper bound on $C^{\rm g\, GW}_{\ell=8} &lt; 0.0083$ at $95\%$ C.I. This yields the first observational upper limit on the spatial correlation between the nHz SGWB and the large-scale structure of the Universe, establishing the observational groundwork for future multi-tracer analyses that will combine PTA data with next-generation galaxy surveys to unveil the SMBHB-galaxy correlation.</description>

      <title>The relativistic restricted three-body problem: geometry and motion around tidally perturbed black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the geometry of a tidally deformed, rotating black hole and timelike geodesics in its vicinity. Our framework provides a local picture of the structural evolution of a relativistic restricted three-body problem around a deformed black hole in an adiabatically evolving binary, motivated by various astrophysical settings including disk dynamics and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. As the tidal-field strength is increased, initially regular, bound geodesics undergo four stages: (i) weak chaos emerges within the bound motion; (ii) a subset of trajectories plunges into the black hole; (iii) a fraction of the remaining trajectories becomes unbound; and (iv) no bound trajectories persist. We provide semi-analytic estimates for the critical tidal amplitudes associated with each transition. Our estimates indicate that, within the frequency band of ground-based gravitational-wave detectors, the matter flow around black holes may already be depleted, whereas LISA and (B-)DECIGO could probe the earlier stages. Our results suggest that an object orbiting a tidally deformed massive BH may remain near resonances over a wide range of separations, indicating an accumulated, non-negligible impact on the gravitational-wave phase. Tidal perturbations can also introduce nonlinear couplings among epicyclic oscillations of geodesics, offering a potential avenue to resonant excitation of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray light curves from accreting black holes.</description>

In particular, HD 34700AaAb is a spectroscopic binary ($M_{\rm{bin}}=4\,M_\odot$) surrounded by two low-mass companions at large separations. Its circumbinary disk is highly substructured, featuring numerous spiral arms and a large cavity observed in infrared (IR) scattered light. We analyzed the CO line channel and intensity moment maps. By fitting a Keplerian model to the line channel emission, we identified the residual motions and conducted a line spectra analysis. We resolved an asymmetric continuum crescent on top of a dust ring at 0.39" (138 au), colocated with the IR ring. The CO molecule line emissions trace a smaller cavity in gas, whose edge aligns with the inner rim of the ring detected in H$\alpha$ emission at 0.20" (65 au). The $^{12}$CO line emission and kinematics trace highly non-Keplerian motions ($\sim0.1\Delta\upsilon_{\rm kep}$), and these CO spiral features align well with the spiral structures in scattered light. The $^{12}$CO line spectra analysis reveals a streamer above the southeastern disk plane, likely falling onto the disk. The $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O kinematics largely follow the disk's underlying Keplerian rotation, while $^{13}$CO exhibits tentative signs of anticyclonic vortex flows at the continuum crescent location. Our multimolecular line study suggests that the circumbinary disk of HD 34700A is highly perturbed in its upper layers, possibly warped and influenced by infalling material. While late-stage infall may account for the IR spirals and the formation of the vortex through Rossby wave instability, an embedded massive companion within the cavity may also contribute to these features.</description>

      <title>Radio Emission from Broad Absorption Line Quasars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Broad Absorption Line Quasars (BALQs) generally exhibit significant outflows that may interact with the surrounding medium, resulting in radio emission. We selected a sample of 13 powerful radio-quiet (RQ) BALQs, where the UV outflow kinetic power is measurable, and detected nine of them with the Very Large Array A configuration at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz. The radio emission is mostly unresolved and is generally constrained within a scale of &lt; 1--4 kpc. In the nine detected objects, the radio spectral slope alpha_5.5-9.0 is steep (&lt; -0.5) in five objects and is flat or inverted (&gt; -0.5) in four objects. We discuss how the steep-slope emission can be associated with the UV outflows, and how the flat-slope emission can be intrinsically steep but flattened by free-free absorption from the UV outflowing gas. However, we find no correlation between the radio luminosity and the estimated outflow kinetic power, which suggests that the outflows are likely not a major source of the observed radio emission. In addition, the radio loudness of these RQ BALQs is comparable to that of typical RQ quasars, implying that the UV outflows likely do not produce stronger radio emission compared to non-BALQs. Follow-up radio observations can test the free-free absorption interpretation and can be used as a new probe for outflows in AGN.</description>

Abstract: Both the Galactic Center and little red dots (LRDs) host million-solar-mass black holes within dense, cold reservoirs of molecules associated with dust grains, and are electromagnetically tranquil. These conditions enable complex molecular chemistry and may serve as natural laboratories for prebiotic genetic evolution by allowing the synthesis of organic molecules essential for life.</description>

      <title>Estimating accretion times of halo substructures in the Milky Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To unravel the formation history of the Milky Way, we estimate the accretion times of six phase-space substructures in the stellar halo, using the orbital frequencies toward two spatial directions ($r, \phi$) in spherical coordinates. These substructures, identified in our previous studies, are located in the solar neighbourhood and therefore have high-precision astrometry from Gaia. The uncertainties of the results are determined using the Monte Carlo method, and the significance is established through comparison with random halo samples. The results for the substructure GL-1 in both directions show good consistency and high significance ($4.3\sigma$ and $3.9\sigma$), yielding a combined accretion time of $5.6 \pm 0.1$ Gyr ago, where the uncertainties quoted are statistical only. The substructures GL-4 and GR-1, with smaller pericenters, exhibit higher significance in the less massive potential of the Milky Way, implying that the more massive potential may overestimate the central mass, especially the bulge. The accretion times of GL-4 and GR-1 are $6.9 \pm 0.3$ Gyr with a confidence of $3.7\sigma$, and $2.0 \pm 0.1$ Gyr with a confidence of $4.4\sigma$, respectively. Further constraints on the accretion times of phase-space substructures require more precise astrometric data, e.g., by Gaia DR4, China Space Station Survey Telescope and Roman space telescope.</description>

      <title>Radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of Population III star formation during the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations find that pockets of star-forming gas could remain pristine up until the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) due to the inhomogeneous nature of metal mixing and enrichment in the early Universe. Such pristine clouds could have formed Population III stars, which could have distinct properties compared to their very high redshift ($z \geq 20$) counterparts. We investigate how Population III stars form and grow during the EoR, and whether the resulting mass distribution varies with environment or across cosmic time. We perform high-resolution ($7.5\,\rm{au}$) radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of identical primordial clouds exposed to the CMB appropriate for $z=30$ and $z=6$, respectively, as part of the POPSICLE project. We also run a simulation at $z=6$ with a strong external Lyman-Werner (LW) background, to span across radiative environments which could host metal-free clumps during the EoR. In the limit of no external LW radiation, we find that while the evolution of the most massive star ($M_{\star} \approx 70\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) is almost identical between $z=30$ and $z=6$, the latter exhibits less fragmentation, leading to a smaller cluster of stars with a higher median stellar mass. In the limit of high external LW radiation, we see vigorous accretion and high star formation efficiencies, leading to the formation of very massive ($M_{\star} &gt; 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) stars. Our results suggest that Population III IMF could vary with redshift simply due to the CMB, independent of the environment. We find that less massive and more compact Pop III star clusters could form during the EoR as compared to $z \geq 20$, with the formation of very massive and supermassive stars likely in strongly irradiated environments.</description>

      <title>Made-to-Measure Outperforms Schwarzschild's Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Syer and Tremaine's made-to-measure method and Schwarzschild's orbit superposition method are well-known within the field of stellar dynamical modeling. This research is concerned with assessing and comparing the operational capabilities of the two methods and, in particular, the impact on observable reproduction, orbit classifications and computer elapsed times when using low orbit numbers (8000 orbits) with different observational data sets and initial conditions. Both methods are able to reproduce observed data with mean $\chi^2 \approx 1$ or less. However, the made-to-measure process does so three to five times faster than the orbit superposition method, and this starts to make the made-to-measure process attractive for analyzing galaxy surveys. For a given set of initial conditions, both methods produce similar orbit classifications but the orbits behind the classifications are not the same. Orbits which are common do not have the same weights. Different initial conditions result in different classifications.</description>

      <title>The FAST-SETI Milky Way Globular Cluster Survey I: A Pilot Multibeam On-the-Fly Search of Five Globular Clusters at L-Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a narrowband technosignature search toward five Milky Way globular clusters (NGC 6171, NGC 6218, NGC 6254, NGC 6838, and IC 1276) using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) 19-beam L-band receiver (1.05-1.45 GHz). We adapt the MultiBeam Point-source Scanning (MBPS) strategy to extended targets by gating detections to generalized on-target windows (gOTWs), i.e. the time intervals when a beam main lobe intersects a buffered cluster mask, and by enforcing the deterministic multibeam illumination sequence as a geometry test. Dynamic spectra with frequency resolution about 7.5 Hz and time resolution about 10 s are searched with turboSETI over drift rates |nu_dot| &lt;= 4 Hz s^-1 at signal-to-noise ratio S/N &gt;= 10. From about 2.75e5 raw hits across both linear polarizations, none survive the gOTW gating, array-wide simultaneity veto, in-stripe ordering, and single-drift coherence checks, yielding a robust null result. With system equivalent flux density SEFD about 1.5 Jy and an effective 60 s per illuminated crossing, our per-crossing flux density threshold is S_min about 0.50 Jy, corresponding to minimum isotropic-equivalent radiated power EIRP_min in the range (0.72-1.8)e16 W for cluster distances 4-6.5 kpc; when multiple illuminated crossings occur, non-coherent stacking improves sensitivity by up to sqrt(N). To our knowledge this is the first FAST technosignature survey dedicated to globular clusters and the first to use MBPS as the primary observing strategy. These limits disfavor bright, persistent, isotropic L-band beacons above the stated thresholds during our epochs and establish a scalable blueprint, based on geometry-aware gating and verification, for multi-epoch MBPS campaigns that expand signal morphologies and combine passes to deepen constraints on transmitters in dense stellar systems.</description>

      <title>The effects of star-gas interactions on binary evolution in open clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star-gas interactions can provide gravitational feedback that influences the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters, through processes such as dynamical friction (DF) and its non-dissipative counterpart, negative dynamical friction (NDF). Using the \texttt{PeTar} code, we perform direct $N$-body simulations of an open cluster initially containing $10^4$ stars, evolving within a gaseous medium spanning a range of ambient densities. Our results demonstrate that NDF associated with stellar outflows interacting with the surrounding gas can enhance the rate of cluster expansion, preferentially transporting stars toward the cluster outskirts. This behavior is accompanied by a more rapid decline in the number of binaries composed of a neutron star and a main-sequence star. A statistical analysis of binary orbital parameters further indicates that, compared to DF-dominated evolution, NDF tends to retain systems with larger semi-major axes and lower eccentricities. Outflow-ambient gas interactions can modify the dynamical processing of binaries in star clusters, leading to changes in the survival fraction and composition of the remaining binary population.</description>

      <title>Origins of the UV continuum and Balmer emission lines in Little Red Dots: observational validation of dense gas envelope models enshrouding the AGN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a statistical study on the origins of the UV continuum and narrow/broad emission lines in little red dots (LRDs), a newly discovered class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Leveraging all archived JWST/NIRSpec data, we build a sample of 28 spectroscopically-confirmed LRDs at $5&lt;z_{\rm spec}&lt;7.2$, by requiring broad H$\alpha$ emission, blue UV colors, V-shaped continua, and compact morphologies. We define a control sample of 9 blue, compact, broad-line AGNs without red optical continua (hereafter little blue dots; LBDs), and examine correlations between rest UV and the narrow/broad H$\alpha$ luminosities in these populations. In LRDs, both narrow and broad H$\alpha$ components are tightly correlated with the UV continuum, and the luminosity ratios are consistent with those in young starburst galaxies. In contrast, the UV to broad H$\alpha$ ratios in LBDs closely match local unobscured AGNs and are statistically different from LRDs. The Ly$\alpha$ occurrence rates and strengths do not differ between LRDs and LBDs and are comparable to normal star-forming galaxies. These results are consistent with a scenario where the central BH in LRDs is enshrouded by a dense opaque gas envelope -- in this model, the UV continuum as well as narrow and even broad H$\alpha$ emissions are not powered by AGNs but predominantly by young massive stars surrounding the envelope, while the envelope radiates as a $\sim 5000$ K blackbody. As the envelope dissipates, direct AGN emission can emerge, potentially transforming LRDs into LBDs and marking the end of a short-lived phase of rapid black hole growth.</description>

      <title>Updated Metallicity Diagnostics for Precision Oxygen Abundance Measurements in High-redshift Galaxies with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that widely used strong-line oxygen abundance indicators, such as O3N2, $\rm R23$, and $\widehat{\rm R}$, suffer from large uncertainties when applied to high-redshift galaxies. We show that this loss of precision primarily arises because, at fixed \Oabund, galaxies span a wide dynamic range in ionization parameter and nitrogen enrichment. Here we develop updated indicators that explicitly incorporate both effects via the proxies O32 and N2O2. We define ${\rm R}_{\rm u}\equiv \rm R23+\alpha_1 O32+\alpha_2 N2O2$, $\widehat{\rm R}_{\rm u}\equiv \rm \widehat{R}+\beta_1 O32+\beta_2 N2O2$, and ${\rm O}_{\rm u}\equiv \rm O3N2+\gamma_1 O32+\gamma_2 N2O2$, and calibrate \Oabund~as low-order polynomials in each composite indicator. Applied to a JWST sample with $T_{\rm e}$-method abundances, the updated indicators substantially tighten the correlations with \Oabund, boosting adjusted coefficients of determination from $\mathbb{R}^2\lesssim 0$ (classical indicators) to $\mathbb{R}^2\gtrsim 0.5$ for the full sample and to $\sim 0.7$ at $z&gt;2$. The residuals reveal a redshift evolution in the mapping between \Oabund, strong lines, ionization, and nitrogen enrichment, with a pivotal turning point near the cosmic noon ($z\sim 2$). Our calibrations provide a practical, physically grounded path to precise metallicity measurements in the JWST era and a firmer basis for quantifying early chemical enrichment and feedback.</description>

      <title>Possible time-variable iron-K$\alpha$ emission in the circumnuclear region of the Circinus galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present imaging and spatially resolved spectral analyses of eight Chandra data taken for the Circinus galaxy in $\approx$ 22 years to reveal neutral iron-K$\alpha$ emission on a circumnuclear scale ($\sim$ 10--100 pc) and search for time variability in the emission. By simulating and taking account of point-source emission from the active galactic nucleus (AGN), we detect iron-line emission $\sim$ 20--60 pc away from the nucleus, particularly in the eastern and western regions. In the two regions, possible time variability in the line flux was also detected. Our spectral analysis then finds that the observed equivalent widths can reach $\sim$ 2 keV and the slopes of underlying continua are rather inverted with $\Gamma &lt; 0$. These are consistent with a scenario in which the iron emission originates from clouds illuminated by AGN X-rays; our result could provide the first extragalactic example of AGN X-ray echoes. In this scenario, we estimated the physical sizes of the illuminated clouds based on the timescale of variability to be less than 6 pc. Furthermore, we compared the iron emission distribution with the cold molecular distribution inferred by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observation of CO($J$=3--2), revealing that in the region of bright iron-line emission, the molecular emission seems to be weak. This might suggest that the AGN X-ray emission affects the chemical composition in the form of AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>A binary-related origin mediated by environmental conditions for blue straggler stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blue stragglers are anomalously massive core hydrogen-burning stars that, according to the theory of single star evolution, should not exist. They are suspected to form in mass-enhancement processes, involving binary evolution or stellar collisions. In dynamically active systems like globular clusters, the number of blue stragglers originated by collisions is expected to increase with the local density and the rate of stellar encounters. Here we analyse more than 3000 blue stragglers in 48 Galactic globular clusters with different structures, finding that their number normalized to the sampled luminosity anti-correlates (instead of correlating) with the central density, collision rate, and dynamical age of the parent cluster. Similar trends are also found for the cluster binary fraction. Once inserted in the context of the current knowledge of the BSS phenomenon, these correlations indicate that low-density regions (possibly because of a higher binary production/survival rate) are the natural habitat of both BSSs and binary systems, and the observed BSSs mostly have a binary-related origin mediated by the environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Observation of an Accreting Planetary-Mass Companion with Signs of Disk-Disk Interaction in Orion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young ($\lesssim 10$ Myr) planetary-mass companions (PMCs) provide valuable insights into the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. To date, only a dozen such objects have been identified through direct imaging. Using JWST/NIRCam observations towards the Orion Nebula, obtained as part of the \textit{PDRs4All} Early Release Science program, we have identified a faint point source near the M-type star V2376 Ori. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the MUSE instrument on the VLT confirm that the source, V2376 Ori b, is indeed a young planetary-mass companion. It is a member of Orion D, around 80\,pc in the foreground of the Trapezium cluster of Orion and with an age of approximately $7 \pm 3$ Myr. We fit the SED of V2376 Ori b to infer a mass of $ \sim 20~M_{\rm Jup}$. The MUSE spectrum reveals several accretion tracers. Based on the H$\alpha$ line intensity, we estimate an accretion rate of $\sim$10$^{-6.5 \pm 0.7}~\rm M_{Jup}\,yr^{-1}$, which is comparable to that of young PMCs such as PDS~70b. In addition, the MUSE data cube reveals extended emission in the [O\,\textsc{ii}] doublet at 7320 and 7330~\AA, which is interpreted as evidence of a dynamical interaction between the two sources that, potentially, involves mass transfer between their individual accretion disks. These results demonstrate that JWST/NIRCam imaging surveys of young stellar associations can uncover new PMCs, which can then be confirmed and characterized through ground-based spectroscopic follow-up.</description>

      <title>Black-hole mass estimation through accretion disk spectral fitting for high-redshift blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-redshift ($z&gt;2$) blazars, with relativistic jets aligned toward us, probe the most powerful end of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) population. We aim at determining the black hole masses and mass accretion rates of high-$z$ blazars in a common framework that utilizes a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting method and the Shakura-Sunayev multi-temperature accretion disk model, accounting also for attenuation due to neutral hydrogen gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We compiled a sample of 23 high-redshift blazars from the literature with publicly available infrared-to-ultraviolet photometric data. We performed a Bayesian fit to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the accretion disk, accounting for upper limits, and determined the black hole masses and mass accretion rates with their uncertainties. We also examined the impact of optical-ultraviolet attenuation due to gas in the IGM. We find that neglecting IGM attenuation in SED fits leads to systematically larger black-hole mass estimates and correspondingly lower Eddington ratios, with the bias becoming more severe at higher redshift. Our MCMC fits yield median black-hole masses in the range $\sim (10^{8}-10^{10})\,M_{\odot}$ and a broad distribution of median Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}\sim0.04$ up to $\sim1$). Comparison with previous literature shows no clear method-dependent systematic offsets, although individual mass estimates can differ by up to a factor of a few. We also demonstrate that assumptions about black-hole spin introduce a systematic degeneracy. This work is to our knowledge the first systematic study to model the accretion-disk emission of a large sample of high-$z$ blazars within a single, consistent statistical framework. Our results emphasize the importance of accounting for IGM attenuation and of using uniform fitting methods when comparing disk-based black hole estimates across samples.</description>

      <title>Intermediate-Mass Stripped Stars in the Magellanic Clouds: Forward Modeling the Observed Population Discovered Via UV Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stripped stars are hot, helium-rich stars formed when binary interactions remove a star's hydrogen envelope. While low-mass ($\lesssim 1 M_\odot$) and high-mass ($\gtrsim 8 M_\odot$) stripped stars are well studied as hot subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars, their intermediate-mass counterparts ($1-8 M_\odot$) have only recently been discovered. The Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Cloud Survey (SUMS) identified UV-excess sources (i.e., sources lying blueward of the main sequence) in the Magellanic Clouds using Swift-UVOT photometry and selected 820 photometric stripped-star candidates. However, the completeness and purity of this sample remain poorly understood. We forward model the population of stripped stars in the Magellanic Clouds using a binary population synthesis model combined with spatially resolved star formation histories and simulated UV photometry. To assess survey sensitivity, we inject simulated sources into real Swift-UVOT images and reproduce the SUMS selection process, including crowding, extinction, and photometric quality cuts. For the SMC and LMC, we respectively recover 31\% and 15\% of sources with intrinsic UV excess, and $11\%$ and $7\%$ of all stripped stars. The rest are missed due to dilution by luminous companions, crowding, high extinction, and limited survey coverage. The observed population is biased toward systems with low-mass companions formed by common envelope evolution and systems with compact object companions. We predict contamination of the observed stripped-star candidates by main-sequence stars with spurious UV excess due to crowding and provide guidelines for selecting higher-purity subsamples. Our population synthesis model matches the number and properties of observed stripped star candidates with masses of $(2-5) M_\odot$ well. It underpredicts the number of lower- and higher-mass candidates, perhaps due to contamination.</description>

      <title>Potential Thermal Profiles of The Third Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal evolution of 3I/ATLAS, the third macroscopic interstellar object discovered on 2025 July 1. By comparing modeled thermal profiles with observations of volatile activity, it is possible to constrain bulk physical properties of a cometary nucleus. 3I/ATLAS is actively producing a variety of cometary volatiles. In this paper, we calculate one-dimensional thermal profiles of the third interstellar object 3I/ATLAS throughout its trajectory in an attempt to gain insight into its bulk properties based on measurements of its volatiles. Assuming a variety of typical comet and asteroid bulk geophysical properties such as heat capacities, densities, and conductivities, we calculate the radial thermal profile as a function of depth throughout the hyperbolic trajectory. The methods and code to generate the thermal profile are flexible for any hyperbolic or bound orbit. The thermal profiles are benchmarked to the nominal sublimation temperatures of H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO, but are still applicable to any volatile. Comparison between the modeled surface temperatures and the observed onset of H$_2$O activity near 3 au indicates that surface temperatures exceeding $\sim$150 K can only be achieved if the albedo is below 0.2. We therefore set the upper limit on the albedo of 3I/ATLAS to be 0.2.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the extragalactic background light at 8600\r{A} using dark cloud shadow and the CaII-triplet lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results of a measurement of the near infrared Extragalactic Background Light using the dark-cloud method. Long-slit spectra covering the opaque core of the intermediate--latitude globule DC303.8-14.2 and the almost unobscured off area were measured using nodding-along-the-slit measuring technique providing a differential spectrum free of most of the foreground components. A template for the only remaining major foreground component, the scattered integrated starlight dominated by the strong Ca II triplet lines at 8498, 8542, 8664$\r{A}$, from the dark core itself was constructed using the GAIA RVS spectral database. The derived EBL intensity is $1.62\pm 0.76(\sigma_{stat})\, 10^{-9} erg\, cm^{-2} s^{-1}\r{A}^{-1} sr^{-1}$ or $13.8\pm6.5(\sigma_{stat})$nW m$^{-2}$sr$^{-1}$; this represents a tentative detection at $2.1\sigma$, level.</description>

      <title>Catching 3I/ATLAS Using a Solar Oberth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The third interstellar object to be discovered, 3I/ATLAS, has a unique and continually unfolding story to tell about its nature and origin as it is monitored by telescopes on Earth, orbiting Earth and around the Solar System. Previous research into missions using chemical propulsion have only really addressed the direct case, where the opportunity to launch already expired before 3I/ATLAS's discovery. In contrast, investigations herein exploit 'Optimum Interplanetary Trajectory Software' to simulate an alternative indirect option for chemical propulsion, namely the Solar Oberth Manoeuvre (SOM). For a SOM, a low perihelion burn provides maximum benefit from the Oberth Effect, and accelerates the spacecraft rapidly towards the receding 3I/ATLAS. Though in principle feasible, results indicate this option presents significant challenges. For possible launch years between 2031 and 2037 inclusive, a 2035 launch permits the most efficient transfer to 3I/ATLAS. The reference mission requires a SOM at 3.2 Solar Radii from the Sun's centre, with an intercept after 35-50 years. It is found the SOM can leverage spacecraft masses up to $\sim{500}$ kg. Two or three solid propellant boosters could deliver the required SOM $\Delta$V, and furthermore a refuelled Starship Block 3 in LEO has sufficient performance for such a mission. As inevitable with a SOM, some of the payload mass would be needed for a heat shield to protect against the high solar flux at low perihelion.</description>
