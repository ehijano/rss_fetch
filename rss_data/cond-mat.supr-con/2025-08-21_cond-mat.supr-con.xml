      <title>Single layer clathrane: A potential superconducting two-dimensional (2D) hydrogenated metal borocarbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new family of two-dimensional (2D) metal-borocarbide clathrane superconductors, derived from three-dimensional (3D) MM$^\prime$B$_6$C$_6$ clathrates. First-principles calculations reveal that hydrogen passivation and surface metal decoration stabilize the M$_2$M$^\prime$B$_8$C$_8$H$_8$ monolayers. These 2D systems exhibit tunable superconductivity governed by hole concentration, structural anisotropy, and electron-phonon coupling. We find that in-plane anisotropy competes with superconductivity, reducing \tc\ despite favorable doping. Biaxial strain mitigates this anisotropy, enhances Fermi surface nesting, and increases \tc\ by an average of 15.5~K. For example, the \tc\ of Sr$_3$B$_8$C$_8$H$_8$ is predicted to increase from 11.3~K to 22.2~K with strain engineering. These findings identify 2D clathranes as promising, strain-tunable superconductors and highlight design principles for optimizing low-dimensional superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Emergent superconducting stripes in two-orbital superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments in KTaO$_3$/EuO interface, we propose an intrinsic mechanism where superconducting stripes emerge naturally without involving disorder, charge inhomogeneity, or competing orders. Our theory is based on a two-orbital model of superconductivity, where one orbital displays a quasi-one-dimensional dispersion and the other orbital is more localized and contributes pairing interactions along the perpendicular direction. Our auxiliary-field Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the pairing amplitude exhibits spatial modulation such that the superconductivity naturally disaggregates into two-leg or three-leg superconducting stripes separated by non-superconducting blocks. Our work provides a promising scenario of emergent superconducting stripes in homogeneous two-dimensional systems and reveals unexpectedly rich physics in two-orbital superconductors for future materials design.</description>

      <title>Robust field re-entrant superconductivity in ferromagnetic infinite-layer rare-earth nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity and ferromagnetism are naturally competing, while their interplay can give rise to exotic quantum phases, such as triplet pairing, exemplified by heavy-fermion compounds like UTe$_2$, where magnetic fluctuations stabilise multiple superconducting states. However, such phenomena have remained elusive in high-temperature superconductors. Here we report the discovery of robust field-induced re-entrant superconductivity in heavily Eu-doped infinite-layer nickelate Sm$_{0.95-x}$Ca$_{0.05}$Eu$_x$NiO$_2$. In the heavily over-doped regime, we observe a remarkable superconducting state that emerges under high magnetic fields ($&gt;$ 6 Tesla) after the initial suppression of zero-field superconductivity. Both zero-resistance transport and Meissner diamagnetic effect confirm the superconducting nature of this high-field phase, which persists up to at least 45 Tesla. This re-entrant behaviour is featured by the coexistence of ferromagnetism and superconductivity on distinct sublattices -- magnetic Eu$^{2+}$ ions and the Ni-O planes, respectively. Such an exotic state may arise from the compensation between external and internal exchange fields (Jaccarino-Peter effect) combined with magnetic fluctuation-enhanced pairing near quantum criticality. Our findings establish infinite-layer nickelates as a unique platform for high-temperature ferromagnetic superconductivity, opening new avenues for discovering and manipulating unconventional quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Correlated phases in rhombohedral N-layer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of correlated electron phases in rhombohedral $N$-layer graphene due to two-valley Coulomb interactions within a low-energy $k \cdot p$ framework. Analytical expressions for Lindhard susceptibilities in intra- and intervalley channels are derived, and the critical temperatures for phase transitions are estimated using both the random phase approximation (RPA) and the parquet approximation (PA). Within RPA, only Stoner and intervalley coherent (IVC) phases are supported, while the PA reveals a richer phase structure including particle-particle (PP) channel instabilities. We establish a general scaling law for the critical temperature with respect to layer number $N$, highlighting an upper bound as $N \rightarrow \infty$, and demonstrate a non-monotonic decrease of the critical temperature with increasing chemical potential. The PA uncovers the role of interaction symmetry: $SU(4)$-symmetric interactions favor intervalley Stoner order in the density channel, whereas $SU(2) \times SU(2)$-symmetric interactions permit a broader set of phases. A crossover in the dominant instability occurs in the particle-hole channel at a critical layer number, suggesting the emergence of magnetic or IVC phases in thicker systems. We also identify conditions under which pair-density wave (PDW) order could form in the PP channel, though its physical realization may be constrained.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Superconductivity and Mixed-dimensional Behaviour in Infinite-layer Samarium Nickelate Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare-earth infinite-layer nickelates represent an emerging class of unconventional superconductors, with materials synthesis largely limited to early lanthanide compounds. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of phase-pure superconducting samarium-based infinite-layer nickelate thin films, including the first demonstration of Sm$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$, along with co-doped variants incorporating europium and calcium. These films, grown on LSAT (001) substrates, exhibit coherent lattice structures up to $\sim$ 9 nm thickness with minimal stacking faults. The co-doped compounds achieve a record-small $c$-axis parameter of 3.26 {\AA} and display remarkable superconducting transition temperatures up to 32.5 K. These results establish a clear correlation between decreasing $c$-axis parameter and increasing critical temperature across different rare-earth systems. In addition, angle-dependent magnetoresistance investigations reveal the existence of a hybrid mixture of 2D and 3D superconductivity in this novel system with enhanced coupling between the rare-earth 5d and Ni 3d orbitals, confirmed by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering experiments. As the concentration of Eu increases, the system exhibits a clear tendency towards 3D superconductivity. Furthermore, we observe distinctive negative magnetoresistance in the europium-containing samples. These findings advocate clear materials design principles for higher transition temperatures and exotic physics in infinite-layer nickelate superconductors through structural engineering of the rare-earth site.</description>

      <title>Topological hydrodynamics in spin-triplet superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the structure of the underlying SO(3) $\mathbf d$-vector order parameter, spin triplet superconductors exhibit a bulk-edge correspondence linking the circulation of supercurrent to the bulk magnetic skyrmion density, giving rise to topological hydrodynamics of magnetic skyrmions. To probe the interplay of charge and spin dynamics, we propose a blueprint for a spin-triplet superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which functions without a Josephson weak link. The triplet SQUID undergoes nonsingular $4\pi$ phase slips, in which current relaxation is facilitated by spin dynamics that trace out a magnetic skyrmion texture. Inductively coupling the device to a tank circuit and probing the nonlinear supercurrent response via Oersted field measurements could provide an experimental signature of ferromagnetic spin-triplet superconductivity.</description>
