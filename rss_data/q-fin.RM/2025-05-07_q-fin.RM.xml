      <title>Economic Security of Multiple Shared Security Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As restaking protocols gain adoption across blockchain ecosystems, there is a need for Actively Validated Services (AVSs) to span multiple Shared Security Providers (SSPs). This leads to stake fragmentation which introduces new complications where an adversary may compromise an AVS by targeting its weakest SSP. In this paper, we formalize the Multiple SSP Problem and analyze two architectures : an isolated fragmented model called Model $\mathbb{M}$ and a shared unified model called Model $\mathbb{S}$, through a convex optimization and game-theoretic lens. We derive utility bounds, attack cost conditions, and market equilibrium that describes protocol security for both models. Our results show that while Model $\mathbb{M}$ offers deployment flexibility, it inherits lowest-cost attack vulnerabilities, whereas Model $\mathbb{S}$ achieves tighter security guarantees through single validator sets and aggregated slashing logic. We conclude with future directions of work including an incentive-compatible stake rebalancing allocation in restaking ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning Based on Convex Scoring Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework under a broad class of risk objectives, characterized by convex scoring functions. This class covers many common risk measures, such as variance, Expected Shortfall, entropic Value-at-Risk, and mean-risk utility. To resolve the time-inconsistency issue, we consider an augmented state space and an auxiliary variable and recast the problem as a two-state optimization problem. We propose a customized Actor-Critic algorithm and establish some theoretical approximation guarantees. A key theoretical contribution is that our results do not require the Markov decision process to be continuous. Additionally, we propose an auxiliary variable sampling method inspired by the alternating minimization algorithm, which is convergent under certain conditions. We validate our approach in simulation experiments with a financial application in statistical arbitrage trading, demonstrating the effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Auto.gov: Learning-based Governance for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09551v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an integral component of the blockchain ecosystem, enabling a range of financial activities through smart-contract-based protocols. Traditional DeFi governance typically involves manual parameter adjustments by protocol teams or token holder votes, and is thus prone to human bias and financial risks, undermining the system's integrity and security. While existing efforts aim to establish more adaptive parameter adjustment schemes, there remains a need for a governance model that is both more efficient and resilient to significant market manipulations. In this paper, we introduce "Auto$.$gov", a learning-based governance framework that employs a deep Qnetwork (DQN) reinforcement learning (RL) strategy to perform semi-automated, data-driven parameter adjustments. We create a DeFi environment with an encoded action-state space akin to the Aave lending protocol for simulation and testing purposes, where Auto$.$gov has demonstrated the capability to retain funds that would have otherwise been lost to price oracle attacks. In tests with real-world data, Auto$.$gov outperforms the benchmark approaches by at least 14% and the static baseline model by tenfold, in terms of the preset performance metric--protocol profitability. Overall, the comprehensive evaluations confirm that Auto$.$gov is more efficient and effective than traditional governance methods, thereby enhancing the security, profitability, and ultimately, the sustainability of DeFi protocols.</description>
