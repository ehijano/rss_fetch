      <title>Proximity-induced flat bands and topological properties in a decorated diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we propose a unique scheme to generate and control multiple flat bands in a decorated diamond chain by using a strain-induced proximity effect between the diagonal sites of each diamond plaquette. This is in complete contrast to the conventional diamond chain, in which the interplay between the lattice topology and an external magnetic flux leads to an extreme localization of the single-particle states, producing the flat bands in the energy spectrum. Such a strain-induced proximity effect will enable us to systematically control one of the diagonal hoppings in the decorated diamond chain, which will lead to the formation of both gapless and gapped flat bands in the energy spectrum. These gapless or gapped flat bands have been corroborated by the computation of the compact localized states amplitude distribution as well as the density of states of the system using a real space calculation. We have also shown that these flat bands are robust against the introduction of small amounts of random onsite disorder in the system. In addition to this, we have also classified the nontrivial topological properties of the system by calculating the winding numbers and edge states for the gapped energy spectrum. These findings could be easily realized experimentally using the laser-induced photonic lattice platforms.</description>

      <title>Magnon topology driven by altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets present a new class of fully compensated collinear magnetic order, where the two sublattices are not related merely by time-reversal combined with lattice translation or inversion, but require an additional lattice rotation. This distinctive symmetry leads to a characteristic splitting of the magnon bands; however the splitting is only partial -- residual degeneracies persist along certain lines in the Brillouin zone as a consequence of the underlying altermagnetic rotation. We consider a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnetic spin model on the checkerboard lattice and introduce additional interactions such as an external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, that lift these degeneracies. The resulting magnon bands become fully gapped and acquire non-trivial topology, characterized by nonzero Chern numbers. We demonstrate the crucial role of altermagnetism for the generation of the Berry curvature. As a direct consequence of the topological magnons, we find finite thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$, which exhibits a characteristic low-temperature scaling, $\kappa_{xy}\propto T^4$. Moreover, $\kappa_{xy}$ changes sign under reversal of the magnetic field, exhibiting a sharp jump across zero field at low temperatures. We also demonstrate topologically protected chiral edge modes in a finite strip geometry.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional nonlinear dynamical response of the magnetoelectrically driven dimerized spin-$1{/}2$ chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study of the dynamical two-dimensional (2D) nonlinear response of the dimerized spin-$1{/}2$ chain to external electric fields is presented. The coupling of the spin system to those fields is set to arise from the inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. In the XY-limit, we provide analytical expressions for the second-order nonlinear dynamical response function. Apart from multi spinon continua, this response displays a strong antidiagonal, i.e. galvanoelectric, feature in the 2D frequency plane. This allows to read off scattering rates of the fractional spinon excitations. For the XXZ-case, we focus on the interaction-driven renormalization of the light-matter coupling by considering vertex corrections which are induced by the zz-exchange. We show this renormalization to modify the spinon joint density of states significantly, potentially allowing for the formation of in-gap bound states. As a result, the vertex corrected light-matter coupling can induce a dramatic spectral weight transfer to lower energies for the dynamical response function within the 2D frequency plane.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis of plasmon modes in layered Lindhard metals and strange metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enigmatic strange metal remains one of the central unsolved problems of 21st century science. Understanding this phase of matter requires knowledge of the momentum- and energy-resolved dynamic charge susceptibility, $\chi(q,\omega)$, especially at finite momentum. Inelastic electron scattering (EELS), performed in either transmission (T-EELS) or reflection (R-EELS) geometries, is a powerful probe of $\chi(q,\omega)$. For the prototypical strange metal Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$, T-EELS, R-EELS, and infrared (IR) spectroscopy agree at $q \sim 0$, all revealing a highly damped plasmon near 1 eV. At larger $q$, however, EELS results show unresolved discrepancies. Since IR data are highly reproducible, it is advantageous to use IR data to calculate what the expected EELS response should be at modest $q$. Building on prior R-EELS work [J. Chen \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. B. \textbf{109}, 045108 (2024)], we extend this approach to T-EELS for finite stacks of metallic layers, comparing a "textbook" Lindhard metal to a strange metal. In the Lindhard case, the low-$q$ response is dominated by long-lived, standing wave plasmon modes arising from interlayer Coulomb coupling, with in-plane dispersions that resemble the well-known Fetter modes of layered metals. This behavior depends only on the geometry and the long-ranged nature of the Coulomb interaction, and is largely insensitive to layer details. At larger $q$, the response reflects the microscopic properties of individual layers. For the strange metal, calculations based on IR data predict a highly damped plasmon with weak dispersion and no distinct surface mode. While our results match IR and R-EELS at low $q$, they do not reproduce any published EELS spectra at large $q$, highlighting unresolved discrepancies that demand further experimental investigation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Griffiths phase in the kagome Kondo lattice CeRh$_{0.9}$Pd$_{0.1}$Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CeRhSn is a valence fluctuating heavy-fermion metal with a twisted Ce-kagome lattice, displaying zero-field quantum criticality, previously associated with geometrical frustration. The partial substitution of Rh by Pd in CeRh$_{1-x}$Pd$_x$Sn enlarges the unit-cell volume, suppresses valence fluctuations, decreases the Kondo temperature and stabilizes a possible long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordered ground state with $T_N=0.8$ K at $x=0.5$. Previous thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements for $x=0.1$ suggested a quantum critical spin liquid. We report low-temperature dilatometry and magnetization measurements on CeRh$_{0.9}$Pd$_{0.1}$Sn and compare with published low-$T$ specific heat data. The absence of a Gr\"uneisen parameter divergence excludes a conventional quantum criticality scenario. Instead, the weak power-law divergences signal non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior, according to a disorder-driven quantum Griffiths phase scenario. At low temperatures, a negative thermal expansion is found in fields above approximately 0.5 T and the NFL scaling breaks down, probably due to the polarization of AFM correlations.</description>

      <title>Deep Variational Free Energy Calculation of Hydrogen Hugoniot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model that represents the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an autoregressive transformer that models the distribution of electrons in excited states, and a permutational equivariant flow model that constructs backflow coordinates for electrons in Hartree-Fock orbitals. By jointly optimizing the three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen. We compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies. The calculated results provide a valuable benchmark for deuterium in the warm dense matter region.</description>

      <title>Variational Monte Carlo Optimization of Topological Chiral Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the variational Monte Carlo calculation for recently proposed chiral superconducting states driven by strong Coulomb interactions. We compare the resulting energetics of these electronic phases for the electron dispersion relation $E_k = c_2 k^2+c_4 k^4$. Motivated by the recent discovery of chiral superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene systems, we apply our analysis to relevant parameter regimes. We demonstrate that topological chiral superconducting phases (including a spin-unpolarized state) can be energetically favored over the spin-valley polarized Fermi liquid above the density of Wigner crystal phase. Our results show that the preference for chiral superconductivity is strongest when $c_2$ lies between zero and a negative value, corresponding to a system on the verge of forming a hole pocket around $k=0$. This finding suggests that superconductivity can arise from pure repulsive Coulomb interactions in systems with an almost flat band bottom, without relying on the pairing instability of a Fermi surface. This mechanism opens a new pathway to superconductivity beyond the conventional BCS mechanism.</description>

      <title>Topological constraint on crystalline current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How much current does a sliding electron crystal carry? The answer to this simple question has important implications for the dynamic properties of the crystal, such as the frequency of its cyclotron motion, and its phonon spectrum. In this work we introduce a precise definition of a sliding crystal and compute the corresponding current $\mathbf{j}_c$ for topological electron crystals in the presence of magnetic field. Our result is fully non-perturbative, does not rely on Galilean invariance, and applies equally to Wigner crystals and (anomalous) Hall crystals. In terms of the electron density $\rho$ and magnetic flux density $\phi$, we find that $\mathbf{j}_c = e(\rho-C\phi)\mathbf{v}$. Surprisingly, the current receives a contribution from the many-body Chern number $C$ of the crystal. When $\rho = C\phi$, sliding crystals therefore carry zero current. The crystalline current fixes the Lorentz force felt by the sliding crystal and the dispersion of low-energy phonons of such crystals. This gives us a simple counting rule for the number of gapless phonons: if a sliding crystal carries nonzero current in a magnetic field, there is a single gapless mode, while otherwise there are two gapless modes. This result can also be understood from anomaly-matching of emanant discrete translation symmetries -- an idea that is also applicable to the dispersion of skyrmion crystals. Our results lead to novel experimental implications and invite further conceptual developments for electron crystals.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Theories, Wigner's Function, Compactification, and Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23887v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global symmetry data of a $D$-dimensional absolute quantum field theory can sometimes be packaged in terms of a $(D+1)$-dimensional bulk system obtained by extending along an interval, with a relative QFT$_D$ at one end and suitable gapped / free boundary conditions at the other end. The partition function of the QFT$_D$ can then be interpreted as a wavefunction depending on background fields. However, in some cases, it is not possible or simply cumbersome to fix an absolute form of the symmetry data. Additionally, it is also of interest to consider entangled and mixed states of relative QFTs as well as entangled and mixed states of gapped / free boundary conditions. We argue that Wigner's quasi-probabilistic function on phase space provides a physical interpretation of the symmetry data in all such situations. We illustrate these considerations in the case of string compactifications and holographic systems.</description>

      <title>Shallow quantum circuit for generating O(1)-entanged approximate state designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science, including quantum cryptography, quantum simulation, and benchmarking quantum devices. In this work, we discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. We show that those resources such quantum states can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega\left(\log (t/\epsilon)\right)$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, those resources do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$ in the system. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states. To this end, we develop an algorithm that transforms $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones through a sequence of multi-controlled gates, without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit is $O\left(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon)\right)$, which is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of shallow quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in various quantum information processing tasks. As a concrete example for demonstrating utility of our algorithm, we propose classical shadow tomography using an $O(1)$-entangled estimator, which can achieve shorter runtime compared to conventional schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chiral SYK model is an 1 + 1 dimensional generalisation of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with chiral Majorana fermions. The Dyson-Schwinger equation of the model is exactly solvable in the large-N limit, leading to an exact analytic solution of the two-point function valid across all energy scales. We consider two chiral SYK systems coupled by a quadratic interaction that explicitly breaks the scaling and time reversal symmetry. We compute the two-point function analytically by solving the Dyson-Schwinger equations perturbatively when the two systems are weakly coupled. We find that the system does not acquire a mass gap unlike the 0+1 dimensional coupled SYK model. The leading correction to thermal free energy is independent of temperature and the ground state entropy remains the same as the entropy of 2N free chiral Majorana fermions. The coupled model can be realised as a gapless edge theory of 2+1 dimensional gapped topological condensed matter systems that do not preserve scaling and time reversal symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring potential empirical manifestations of quantum gravity is a challenging pursuit. In this study, we utilise a lattice representation of a (2+1)D massive gravity toy model interacting with Dirac fermions that can support specific spacetime fluctuations. We focus on the evolution of the fermion's spin due to its coupling to spacetime fluctuations. To monitor their dynamics a minimal model is required that comprises two bosonic modes describing spacetime geometry fluctuations coupled with the spin of the fermion. A possible emulation of this system involves encoding spin degrees of freedom in an atom coupled with a bimodal optical cavity that provides the two bosonic modes. We observe diverse spin evolution patterns based on its interaction with fluctuating spacetime geometry. Our proposal introduces a novel approach for modelling the effect of interactions between quantum gravity and matter that can be probed with current technology.</description>

      <title>Persistent paramagnons in high-temperature infinite-layer nickelate superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in hole-doped SmNiO$_2$, exhibiting the record-high transition temperature $T_c$ among infinite-layer (IL) nickelates, has opened a new avenue for exploring design principles of superconductivity. Experimentally determining the electronic structure and magnetic interactions in this new system is crucial to elucidating the mechanism behind the enhanced superconductivity. Here, we report a Ni $L$-edge resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) study of superconducting Sm-based IL nickelate thin films Sm$_{1-x-y-z}$Eu$_x$Ca$_y$Sr$_z$NiO$_2$ (SECS). Dispersive paramagnonic excitations are observed in both optimally and overdoped SECS samples, supporting a spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing scenario. However, despite the two-fold enhancement of $T_c$ in the Sm-based nickelates compared to their Pr-based counterparts, the effective exchange coupling strength is reduced by approximately $20\%$. This behavior contrasts with hole-doped cuprates, where magnetic interactions correlate positively with $T_c$, highlighting essential differences in their superconducting mechanisms.</description>

Strangely, despite the tininess of the ordered polarization, the ferroelectricity survives up to 350 K, rendering the mechanism of such ferroelectricity challenging for standard understandings. Here, via a density-functional-based multi-energy-scale analysis of the system's broken symmetries, we identify a weak out-of-plane ferroelectricity accompanying a strong in-plane antiferro-orbital order. This unusual low-energy correlation, which emerges from an antiferroelectric structure formed at much higher energy, naturally explains the above puzzling observation. This result reveals an unprecedented paradigm of electronic ferroelectricity generally applicable to 2D polar metals with ultrafast-switchable polarization ideal for the next-generation non-volatile memory and other devices.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from dual-surface carriers in rhombohedral graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intrinsic rhombohedral graphene hosts an unusual low-energy electronic wavefunction, predominantly localized at its outer crystal faces with negligible presence in the bulk. Increasing the number of graphene layers amplifies the density of states near charge neutrality, greatly enhancing the susceptibility to symmetry-breaking phases. Here, we report superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene arising from an unusual charge-delocalized semimetallic normal state, characterized by coexisting valence- and conduction-band Fermi pockets split to opposite crystal surfaces. In octalayer graphene, the superconductivity appears in five apparently distinct pockets for each sign of an external electric displacement field ($D$). In a moir\'e superlattice sample where heptalayer graphene is aligned on one side to hexagonal boron nitride, two pockets of superconductivity emerge from a single sharp resistive feature. At higher $D$ the same resistive feature additionally induces an $h/e^{2}$-quantized anomalous Hall state at dopings near one electron per moir\'e unit cell. Our findings reveal a novel superconducting regime in multilayer graphene and create opportunities for coupling to nearby topological states.</description>

      <title>Strain-Tunable Topological Phase Transitions in Line- and Split-Graph Flat-Band Lattices</title>

Abstract: In recent years, materials with topological flat bands have attracted significant attention due to their association with extraordinary transport properties and strongly correlated electrons. Yet, generic principles linking lattice architecture, strain, and band topology remain scarce. Here, using a unified graph-theoretic framework we generate entire families of two-dimensional lattices and, using analytical tight-binding calculations, demonstrate that a single mechanical knob -- uniform in-plane strain -- drives universal transitions between trivial insulating, Dirac semimetal, and quantum spin-Hall phases across all lattices. The framework yields several flat band lattices that were hitherto absent or largely unexplored in the literature -- for example, the checkerboard split-graph and triangular-Kagome lattices -- whose strain-driven topological phase diagrams we establish here for the first time. The design rules implied by our studies provide a blueprint for engineering topological states in a wide variety of 2D materials, photonic crystals, and circuit lattices, and are anticipated to accelerate the discovery of strain-programmable quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature quantum topological order in three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a three-dimensional system that exhibits long-range entanglement at sufficiently small but nonzero temperature--it therefore constitutes a quantum topological order at finite temperature. The model of interest is known as the fermionic toric code, a variant of the usual 3D toric code, which admits emergent fermionic point-like excitations. The fermionic toric code, importantly, possesses an anomalous 2-form symmetry, associated with the space-like Wilson loops of the fermionic excitations. We argue that it is this symmetry that imbues low-temperature thermal states with a novel topological order and long-range entanglement. Based on the current classification of three-dimensional topological orders, we expect that the low-temperature thermal states of the fermionic toric code belong to an equilibrium phase of matter that only exists at nonzero temperatures. We conjecture that further examples of topological orders at nonzero temperatures are given by discrete gauge theories with anomalous 2-form symmetries. Our work therefore opens the door to studying quantum topological order at nonzero temperature in physically realistic dimensions.</description>

      <title>High Chern numbers and topological flat bands in high-field polarized Kitaev magnets on the star lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometrically frustrated Kitaev magnets are demonstrated to be fertile playgrounds that allow for the occurrence of exotic phenomena, including topological phases and the thermal Hall effect. Notwithstanding the established consensus that the field-polarized phase in the honeycomb-lattice Kitaev magnet hosts topological magnons exhibiting Chern numbers $C = \pm1$, the nature of magnon excitations in Kitaev magnets on the star lattice, a triangle-decorated honeycomb lattice, has rarely been explored primarily due to its complicated geometry. To this end, we study the band topology of magnons on the star lattice in the presence of a strong out-of-plane magnetic field using linear spin-wave theory. By calculating the Chern numbers of magnon bands, we find that topological phase diagrams are predominantly composed of two distinct topological phases whose Chern numbers are different by a sign in inverse order. Remarkably, each phase is characterized by a high Chern number of either $+2$ or $-2$. In addition, several topological flat bands with large flatness are identified. The two phases are separated by a dozen narrow topological high-Chern-number segments, whose region shrinks as the magnetic field increases and vanishes eventually. We also find that the thermal Hall conductivity approaches zero at certain parameters, and it changes (keeps) its sign when crossing the topological phase-transition points (flat-band points).</description>

Abstract: Demons are a type of plasmons, which consist of out-of-phase oscillations of electrons in different bands. Here, we show that $d$-wave altermagnets, a recently discovered class of collinear magnetism, naturally realize a spin demon, which consists of out-of-phase movement of the two spin species. The spin demon lives outside of the particle-hole continuum of one of the spin species, and is therefore significantly underdamped, reaching quality factors of $&gt;10$. We show that the spin demon carries a magnetic moment, which inherits the $d$-wave symmetry. Finally, we consider both three and two dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets, and show that spin demons exists in both.</description>

Abstract: The thesis presents a comprehensive Raman spectroscopic and first-principle density functional theory based investigation of V_(1-x)PS_(3) ; PbTaSe_(2) and 1T-TaS_(2). In V_(1-x)PS_(3),the detection of fractionalized excitations (Majorana fermions) suggests a potential Kitaev spin liquid phase, which becomes more pronounced as dimensionality decreases. Evidence of temperature-driven structural phase transition and topological surface phonons has been detected in PbTaSe_(2). TaS_(2) in 1T-phase reveals the presence of a hidden quantum state, a Mott-insulating phase, and a quantum spin liquid state. The observed phenomenon in these quantum systems makes them a promising candidate for advanced technologies such as quantum computing and communication.</description>

      <title>Mobile Impurity in a Two-Leg Bosonic Ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a mobile impurity in a two-leg bosonic ladder. The impurity moves both along and across the legs and interacts with a bath of interacting bosonic particles present in the ladder. We use both analytical (Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid - TLL) and numerical (Density Matrix Renormalization Group - DMRG) methods to compute the Green's function of the impurity. We find that for a small impurity-bath interaction, the bonding mode of the impurity effectively couples only to the gapless mode of the bath while the anti-bonding mode of the impurity couples to both gapped and gapless mode of the bath. We compute the time dependence of the Green's function of the impurity, for impurity created either in the anti-bonding or bonding mode with a given momentum. The later case leads to a decay as a power-law below a critical momentum and exponential above, while the former case always decays exponentially. We compare the DMRG results with analytical results using the linked cluster expansion and find a good agreement. In addition we use DMRG to extract the lifetime of the quasi-particle, when the Green's function decays exponentially. We also treat the case of an infinite bath-impurity coupling for which both the bonding and antibonding modes are systematically affected. For this case the impurity Green's function in the bonding mode decays as a power-law at zero momentum.The corresponding exponent increases with increasing transverse-tunneling of the impurity. We compare our results with the other impurity problems for which the motion of either the impurity or the bath is limited to a single chain. Finally we comments on the consequences of our findings for experiments with the ultracold gasses.</description>

      <title>Superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars</title>

Abstract: The neutron star starts to cool down shortly after its birth by emitting neutrinos. As it becomes cold enough, the Cooper pairs of neutrons are formed, triggering a superfluid transition. Previous studies on neutron superfluidity are focused on finite-temperature transitions, with little attention paid to the potentially important quantum critical phenomena associated with superfluidity. Here, we provide the first theoretical analysis of superfluid quantum criticality, concentrating on its impact on neutron star cooling. Extensive calculations found that superfluidity occurs within a finite range of neutron star density $\rho$. The density serves as a non-thermal parameter for superfluid quantum phase transition. In a broad quantum critical region, gapless neutrons are strongly coupled to the quantum critical fluctuations of superfluid order parameter. We handle this coupling using both perturbation theory and renormalization group method and find that it leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior, which yields a logarithmic $T\ln(1/T)$ correction to the neutron specific heat $c_{\mathrm{n}}\propto T$ and also dramatically alters the neutrino emissivity. Quantum critical phenomena emerge much earlier than the onset of superfluidity and persist throughout almost the entire lifetime of a neutron star. At low temperatures, these phenomena coexist with superfluidity in the neutron star interior but occupy different layers. We incorporate superfluid quantum criticality into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling and show that it substantially prolongs the thermal relaxation time. By varying the strength of superfluid fluctuations and other quantities, we obtain an excellent fit to the observed cooling data of a number of neutron stars. Our results indicate an intriguing correlation between superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Regularizing 3D conformal field theories via anyons on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently introduced ''fuzzy sphere'' method has enabled accurate numerical regularizations of certain three-dimensional (3D) conformal field theories (CFTs). The regularization is provided by the non-commutative geometry of the lowest Landau level filled by electrons, such that the charge is trivially gapped due to the Pauli exclusion principle at filling factor $\nu=1$, while the electron spins encode the desired CFT. Successful applications of the fuzzy sphere to paradigmatic CFTs, such as the 3D Ising model, raise an important question: how finely tuned does the underlying electron system need to be? Here, we show that the 3D Ising CFT can also be realized at fractional electron fillings. In such cases, the CFT spectrum is intertwined with the charge-neutral spectrum of the underlying fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state -- a feature that is trivially absent in the previously studied $\nu=1$ case. Remarkably, we show that the mixing between the CFT spectrum and the FQH spectrum is strongly suppressed within the numerically-accessible system sizes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the CFT critical point is unaffected by the exchange statistics of the particles and by the nature of topological order in the charge sector. Our results set the stage for the fuzzy-sphere exploration of conformal critical points between topologically-ordered states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional system of two-component fermions in the limit of strong attractive particle-particle interactions. First, we analyze scattering in the corresponding few-body problem, which is analytically solvable via Bethe ansatz. This allows us to engineer effective interactions between the system's effective degrees of freedom: fermions and bosonic dimers (tightly bound pairs of fermions). We argue that, although these interactions are strong, the resulting effective problem can be mapped onto a weakly interacting one, paving the way for the use of perturbation theory. This finding simplifies studies of many-fermion systems under confinement that are beyond reach of state-of-the-art numerical methods. We illustrate this statement by considering an impurity atom in a Fermi gas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of identifying a 2+1d topologically ordered phase using measurements on the ground-state wavefunction. For non-chiral topological order, we describe a series of bulk multipartite entanglement measures that extract the invariants $\sum_a d_a^2 \theta_a^r$ for any $r \geq 2$, where $d_a$ and $\theta_a$ are the quantum dimension and topological spin of an anyon $a$, respectively. These invariants are obtained as expectation values of permutation operators between $2r$ replicas of the wavefunction, applying different permutations on four distinct regions of the plane. Our proposed measures provide a refined tool for distinguishing topological phases, capturing information beyond conventional entanglement measures such as the topological entanglement entropy. We argue that any operator capable of extracting the above invariants must act on at least $2r$ replicas, making our procedure optimal in terms of the required number of replicas. We discuss the generalization of our results to chiral states.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast optical excitation of magnons in 2D antiferromagnets via spin torque exerted by photocurrent of excitons: Signatures in charge pumping and THz emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments observing femtosecond laser pulse (fsLP) exciting magnons in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic (AF) semiconductors -- such as CrSBr, NiPS$_3$, and MnPS$_3$, or their van der Waals heterostructures -- suggest exciton-mediation of such an effect. However, its microscopic details remain obscure, as resonant coupling of magnons, living in the sub-meV energy range, to excitons, living in the \mbox{$\sim 1$ eV} range, can hardly be operative. Here, we develop a quantum transport theory of this effect, in which time-dependent nonequilibrium Green's functions (TDNEF) for electrons driven by fsLP are coupled self-consistently to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation describing classical dynamics of localized magnetic moments (LMMs) within 2D AF semiconductors. This theory explains how fsLP, of central frequency above the semiconductor gap, generates a photocurrent that subsequently exerts spin-transfer torque (STT) onto LMMs as a {\em nonequilibrium spintronic mechanism}. The collective motion of LMMs analyzed by windowed Fast Fourier transform (FFT) decodes frequencies of excited magnons, as well as their lifetime governed by {\em nonlocal} damping with the LLG equation due to, explicitly included via TDNEGF, electronic bath. The TDNEGF part of the loop is also used to include excitons via mean-field treatment, utilizing off-diagonal elements of the density matrix, of Coulomb interaction binding conduction-band electrons and valence-band holes. Finally, our theory predicts how excited magnons will {\em pump} time-dependent charge currents into the attached electrodes, or locally within AF semiconductor that will then emit electromagnetic radiation. The windowed FFT of these signals contains imprints of excited magnons, as well as their interaction with excitons, which could be exploited as a novel probe in future experiments.</description>
