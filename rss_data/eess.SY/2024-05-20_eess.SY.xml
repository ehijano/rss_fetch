      <title>Frequency stabilization of self-sustained oscillations in a sideband-driven electromechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to stabilize the frequency of self-sustained vibrations in micro- and nanomechanical resonators. The method refers to a two-mode system with the vibrations at significantly different frequencies. The signal from one mode is used to control the other mode. In the experiment, self-sustained oscillations of micromechanical modes are excited by pumping at the blue-detuned sideband of the higher-frequency mode. Phase fluctuations of the two modes show near perfect anti-correlation. They can be compensated in either one of the modes by a stepwise change of the pump phase. The phase change of the controlled mode is proportional to the pump phase change, with the proportionality constant independent of the pump amplitude and frequency. This finding allows us to stabilize the phase of one mode against phase diffusion using the measured phase of the other mode. We demonstrate that phase fluctuations of either the high or low frequency mode can be significantly reduced. The results open new opportunities in generating stable vibrations in a broad frequency range via parametric downconversion in nonlinear resonators.</description>

      <title>Predictive Energy Management for Battery Electric Vehicles with Hybrid Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of predicting the energy consumption for the drivers of Battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Several external factors (e.g., weather) are shown to have huge impacts on the energy consumption of a vehicle besides the vehicle or powertrain dynamics. Thus, it is challenging to take all of those influencing variables into consideration. The proposed approach is based on a hybrid model which improves the prediction accuracy of energy consumption of BEVs. The novelty of this approach is to combine a physics-based simulation model, which captures the basic vehicle and powertrain dynamics, with a data-driven model. The latter accounts for other external influencing factors neglected by the physical simulation model, using machine learning techniques, such as generalized additive mixed models, random forests and boosting. The hybrid modeling method is evaluated with a real data set from TUM and the hybrid models were shown that decrease the average prediction error from 40% of the pure physics model to 10%.</description>

      <title>Distributed Model Predictive Control for Asynchronous Multi-agent Systems with Self-Triggered Coordinator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the distributed model predictive control for an asynchronous nonlinear multi-agent system with external interference via a self-triggered generator and a prediction horizon regulator. First, a shrinking constraint related to the error between the actual state and the predicted state is introduced into the optimal control problem to enable the robustness of the system. Then, the trigger interval and the corresponding prediction horizon are determined by altering the expression of the Lyapunov function, thus achieving a trade-off between control performance and energy loss. By implementing the proposed algorithm, the coordination objective of the multi-agent system is achieved under asynchronous communication. Finally, the recursive feasibility and stability are proven successively. An illustrative example is conducted to demonstrate the merits of the presented approach.</description>

      <title>Self-Triggered Distributed Model Predictive Control with Synchronization Parameters Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an aperiodic distributed model predictive control approach for multi-agent systems (MASs) in which parameterized synchronization constraints is considered and an innovative self-triggered criterion is constructed. Different from existing coordination methodology, the proposed strategy achieves the cooperation of agents through the synchronization of one-dimensional parameters related to the control inputs. At each asynchronous sampling instant, each agent exchanges the one-dimensional synchronization parameters, solves the optimal control problem (OCP) and then determines the open-loop phase. The incorporation of the selftriggered scheme and the synchronization parameter constraints relieves the computational and communication usage. Sufficient conditions guaranteeing the recursive feasibility of the OCP and the stability of the closed-loop system are proven. Simulation results illustrate the validity of the proposed control algorithm.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Distribution Assessment of Jiles-Atherton Parameter Estimation for Inrush Current Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers are one of the key assets in AC distribution grids and renewable power integration. During transformer energization inrush currents appear, which lead to transformer degradation and can cause grid instability events. These inrush currents are a consequence of the transformer's magnetic core saturation during its connection to the grid. Transformer cores are normally modelled by the Jiles-Atherton (JA) model which contains five parameters. These parameters can be estimated by metaheuristic-based search algorithms. The parameter initialization of these algorithms plays an important role in the algorithm convergence. The most popular strategy used for JA parameter initialization is a random uniform distribution. However, techniques such as parameter initialization by Probability Density Functions (PDFs) have shown to improve accuracy over random methods. In this context, this research work presents a framework to assess the impact of different parameter initialization strategies on the performance of the JA parameter estimation for inrush current studies. Depending on available data and expert knowledge, uncertainty levels are modelled with different PDFs. Moreover, three different metaheuristic-search algorithms are employed on two different core materials and their accuracy and computational time are compared. Results show an improvement in the accuracy and computational time of the metaheuristic-based algorithms when PDF parameter initialization is used.</description>

      <title>Game-theoretic Energy Management Strategies With Interacting Agents in Formula 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an interaction-aware energy management optimization framework for Formula 1 racing. The considered scenario involves two agents and a drag reduction model. Strategic interactions between the agents are captured by a Stackelberg game formulated as a bilevel program. To address the computational challenges associated with bilevel optimization, the problem is reformulated as a single-level nonlinear program employing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. The proposed framework contributes towards the development of new energy management and allocation strategies, caused by the presence of another agent. For instance, it provides valuable insights on how to redistribute the energy in order to optimally exploit the wake effect, showcasing a notable difference with the behavior studied in previous works. Robust energy allocations can be identified to reduce the lap time loss associated with unexpected choices of the other agent. It allows to recognize the boundary conditions for the interaction to become relevant, impacting the system's behavior, and to assess if overtaking is possible and beneficial. Overall, the framework provides a comprehensive approach for a two-agent Formula 1 racing problem with strategic interactions, offering physically intuitive and practical results.</description>

      <title>Affine Transformation-based Perfectly Undetectable False Data Injection Attacks on Remote Manipulator Kinematic Control with Attack Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the viability of perfectly undetectable affine transformation attacks against robotic manipulators where intelligent attackers can inject multiplicative and additive false data while remaining completely hidden from system users. The attacker can implement these communication line attacks by satisfying three Conditions presented in this work. These claims are experimentally validated on a FANUC 6 degree of freedom manipulator by comparing a nominal (non-attacked) trial and a detectable attack case against three perfectly undetectable trajectory attack Scenarios: scaling, reflection, and shearing. The results show similar observed end effector error for the attack Scenarios and the nominal case, indicating that the perfectly undetectable affine transformation attack method keeps the attacker perfectly hidden while enabling them to attack manipulator trajectories.</description>

      <title>A Simulation-Optimization Framework for Developing Wind-Resilient AAM Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental factors pose a significant challenge to the operational efficiency and safety of advanced air mobility (AAM) networks. This paper presents a simulation-optimization framework that dynamically integrates wind variability into AAM operations. We employ a nonlinear charging model within a multi-vertiport environment to optimize fleet size and scheduling. Our framework assesses the impact of wind on operational parameters, providing strategies to enhance the resilience of AAM ecosystems. The results demonstrate that wind conditions exert significant influence on fleet size even for short-distance flights, their impact on fleet size and energy requirements becomes more pronounced over longer distances. Efficient management of fleet size and charging policies, particularly for long-distance networks, is needed to accommodate the variability of wind conditions effectively.</description>

      <title>Gallium Nitride (GaN) based High-Power Multilevel H-Bridge Inverter for Wireless Power Transfer of Electric Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a design and implementation of a high-power Gallium Nitride (GaN)-based multilevel Hbridge inverter to excite wireless charging coils for the wireless power transfer of electric vehicles (EVs). Compared to the traditional conductive charging, wireless charging technology offers a safer and more convenient way to charge EVs. Due to the increasing demand of fast charging, high-power inverters play a crucial role in exciting the wireless charging coils within a wireless power transfer system. This paper details the system specifications for the wireless charging of EVs, providing theoretical analysis and a control strategy for the modular design of a 75-kW 3-level and 4-level Hbridge inverter. The goal is to deliver a low-distortion excitation voltage to the wireless charging coils. LTspice simulation results, including output voltage, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis for both 3-level and 4-level H-bridge inverters, are presented to validate the control strategy and demonstrate the elimination of output harmonic components in the modular design. A GaNbased inverter prototype was employed to deliver a 85-kHz power to the wireless charging pads of the wireless power transfer system. Experimental results at two different voltage and power levels, 100V-215W and 150V-489W, validate the successful performance of the GaN inverter in the wireless charging system.</description>

      <title>Inner-approximate Reachability Computation via Zonotopic Boundary Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inner-approximate reachability analysis involves calculating subsets of reachable sets, known as inner-approximations. This analysis is crucial in the fields of dynamic systems analysis and control theory as it provides a reliable estimation of the set of states that a system can reach from given initial states at a specific time instant. In this paper, we study the inner-approximate reachability analysis problem based on the set-boundary reachability method for systems modelled by ordinary differential equations, in which the computed inner-approximations are represented with zonotopes. The set-boundary reachability method computes an inner-approximation by excluding states reached from the initial set's boundary. The effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the efficient extraction of the exact boundary of the initial set. To address this, we propose methods leveraging boundary and tiling matrices that can efficiently extract and refine the exact boundary of the initial set represented by zonotopes. Additionally, we enhance the exclusion strategy by contracting the outer-approximations in a flexible way, which allows for the computation of less conservative inner-approximations. To evaluate the proposed method, we compare it with state-of-the-art methods against a series of benchmarks. The numerical results demonstrate that our method is not only efficient but also accurate in computing inner-approximations.</description>

      <title>Excess Delay from GDP: Measurement and Causal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground Delay Programs (GDPs) have been widely used to resolve excessive demand-capacity imbalances at arrival airports by shifting foreseen airborne delay to pre-departure ground delay. While offering clear safety and efficiency benefits, GDPs may also create additional delay because of imperfect execution and uncertainty in predicting arrival airport capacity. This paper presents a methodology for measuring excess delay resulting from individual GDPs and investigates factors that influence excess delay using regularized regression models. We measured excess delay for 1210 GDPs from 33 U.S. airports in 2019. On a per-restricted flight basis, the mean excess delay is 35.4 min with std of 20.6 min. In our regression analysis of the variation in excess delay, ridge regression is found to perform best. The factors affecting excess delay include time variations during gate out and taxi out for flights subject to the GDP, program rate setting and revisions, and GDP time duration.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Safety at Intelligent Intersections: Temporal Logic Meets Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an approach for ensuring the safety of vehicles passing through an intelligent intersection. There are many proposals for the design of intelligent intersections that introduce central decision-makers to intersections for enhancing the efficiency and safety of the vehicles. To guarantee the safety of such designs, we develop a safety framework for intersections based on temporal logic and reachability analysis. We start by specifying the required behavior for all the vehicles that need to pass through the intersection as linear temporal logic formula. Then, using temporal logic trees, we break down the linear temporal logic specification into a series of Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analyses in an automated fashion. By successfully constructing the temporal logic tree through reachability analysis, we verify the feasibility of the intersection specification. By taking this approach, we enable a safety framework that is able to automatically provide safety guarantees on new intersection behavior specifications. To evaluate our approach, we implement the framework on a simulated T-intersection, where we show that we can check and guarantee the safety of vehicles with potentially conflicting paths.</description>

      <title>Control-Aware Transmit Power Allocation for 6G In-Factory Subnetwork Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel power control solution for subnetworks-enabled distributed control systems in factory settings. We propose a channel-independent control-aware (CICA) policy based on the logistic model and learn the parameters using Bayesian optimization with a multi-objective tree-structured Parzen estimator. The objective is to minimize the control cost of the plants, measured as a finite horizon linear quadratic regulator cost. The proposed policy can be executed in a fully distributed manner and does not require cumbersome measurement of channel gain information, hence it is scalable for large-scale deployment of subnetworks for distributed control applications. With extensive numerical simulation and considering different densities of subnetworks, we show that the proposed method can achieve competitive stability performance and high availability for large-scale distributed control plants with limited radio resources.</description>

      <title>Combined film and pulse heating of lithium ion batteries to improve performance in low ambient temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low ambient temperatures significantly reduce Lithium ion batteries' (LIBs') charge/discharge power and energy capacity, and cause rapid degradation through lithium plating. These limitations can be addressed by preheating the LIB with an external heat source or by exploiting the internal heat generation through the LIB's internal impedance. Fast external heating generates large temperature gradients across the LIB due to the low thermal conductivity of the cell, while internal impedance heating (usually through AC or pulse charge/discharging) tends to be relatively slow, although it can achieve more uniform temperature distribution. This paper investigates the potential of combining externally sourced resistive film heating with bidirectional pulse heating to achieve fast preheating without causing steep temperature gradients. The LIB is modeled with the Doyle Fuller Newman (DFN) electrochemical model and 1D thermal model, and reinforcement learning (RL) is used to optimize the pulse current amplitude and film voltage concurrently. The results indicate that the optimal policy for maximizing the rate of temperature rise while limiting temperature gradients has the film heating dominate the initial phases and create the ideal conditions for pulse heating to take over. In addition, the pulse component shares the heating load and reduces the energy rating of the auxiliary power source.</description>

      <title>Optimal control barrier functions for RL based safe powertrain control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can improve control performance by seeking to learn optimal control policies in the end-use environment for vehicles and other systems. To accomplish this, RL algorithms need to sufficiently explore the state and action spaces. This presents inherent safety risks, and applying RL on safety-critical systems like vehicle powertrain control requires safety enforcement approaches. In this paper, we seek control-barrier function (CBF)-based safety certificates that demarcate safe regions where the RL agent could optimize the control performance. In particular, we derive optimal high-order CBFs that avoid conservatism while ensuring safety for a vehicle in traffic. We demonstrate the workings of the high-order CBF with an RL agent which uses a deep actor-critic architecture to learn to optimize fuel economy and other driver accommodation metrics. We find that the optimized high-order CBF allows the RL-based powertrain control agent to achieve higher total rewards without any crashes in training and evaluation while achieving better accommodation of driver demands compared to previously proposed exponential barrier function filters and model-based baseline controllers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, data-driven methods have surged in popularity, emerging as valuable tools for control theory. As such, neural network approximations of control feedback laws, system dynamics, and even Lyapunov functions have attracted growing attention. With the ascent of learning based control, the need for accurate, fast, and easy-to-use benchmarks has increased. In this work, we present the first learning-based environment for boundary control of PDEs. In our benchmark, we introduce three foundational PDE problems - a 1D transport PDE, a 1D reaction-diffusion PDE, and a 2D Navier-Stokes PDE - whose solvers are bundled in an user-friendly reinforcement learning gym. With this gym, we then present the first set of model-free, reinforcement learning algorithms for solving this series of benchmark problems, achieving stability, although at a higher cost compared to model-based PDE backstepping. With the set of benchmark environments and detailed examples, this work significantly lowers the barrier to entry for learning-based PDE control - a topic largely unexplored by the data-driven control community. The entire benchmark is available on Github along with detailed documentation and the presented reinforcement learning models are open sourced.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SmartAntenna proposes a novel approach to extend wireless communication, focusing on autonomous orientation to extend range and optimize performance. Through meticulous evaluation, various aspects of its functionality were assessed, revealing both strengths and areas for improvement. Notably, the antenna tracking mechanism exhibited remarkable efficacy. The SmartAntenna demonstrated robust functionality throughout extensive testing, underscoring its reliability even amidst complex operational scenarios. However, challenges emerged during target tracking, particularly evident in 360-degree sweeps, necessitating further refinement to enhance accuracy. Despite reliance on the HC-12 module, LoRa, performance limitations surfaced, prompting concerns regarding its suitability for production systems, especially within noisy frequency bands. Nevertheless, the SmartAntenna's adaptability across various wireless technologies holds promise, opening avenues for extended communication ranges and diverse applications. SmartAntenna research contributes valuable insights into optimizing wireless communication systems, paving the way for enhanced performance and expanded capabilities in diverse operational environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Learning Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Objective Learning Model Predictive Control is a novel data-driven control scheme which improves a system's closed-loop performance with respect to several control objectives over iterations of a repeated task. At each task iteration, collected system data is used to construct terminal components of a Model Predictive Controller. The formulation presented in this paper ensures that closed-loop control performance improves between successive iterations with respect to each objective. We provide proofs of recursive feasibility and performance improvement, and show that the converged policy is Pareto optimal. Simulation results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Flat Dual-Polarized Millimeter-Wave Luneburg Lens Antenna Using Transformation Optics with Reduced Anisotropy and Impedance Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a compact wideband dual-polarized Luneburg lens antenna (LLA) with reduced anisotropy and improved impedance matching is proposed in Ka band with a wide 2D beamscanning capability. Based on transformation optics, the spherical Luneburg lens is compressed into a cylindrical one, while the merits of high gain, broad band, wide scanning, and free polarization are preserved. A trigonometric function is employed to the material property of the flattened Luneburg lens with reduced anisotropy, thus effectively alleviates the strong reflection, the high sidelobes and back radiation with a free cost on the antenna weight and volume. Furthermore, a light thin wideband 7-by-1 metasurface phased array is studied as the primary feed for the LLA. The proposed metantenna, shorted for metamaterial-based antenna, has a high potential for B5G, future wireless communication and radar sensing as an onboard system.</description>

      <title>A Simulation Tool for V2G Enabled Demand Response Based on Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating electric vehicles (EVs) into the power grid can revolutionize energy management strategies, offering both challenges and opportunities for creating a more sustainable and resilient grid. In this context, model predictive control (MPC) emerges as a powerful tool for addressing the complexities of Grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enabled demand response management. By leveraging advanced optimization techniques, MPC algorithms can anticipate future grid conditions and dynamically adjust EV charging and discharging schedules to balance supply and demand while minimizing operational costs and maximizing flexibility. However, no standard tools exist to evaluate novel energy management strategies based on MPC approaches. Our research focuses on harnessing the potential of MPC in G2V and V2G applications, by providing a simulation tool that allows to maximize EV flexibility and support demand response initiatives while mitigating the impact on EV battery health. In this paper, we propose an open-source MPC controller for G2V and V2G-enabled demand response management. The proposed approach is capable of tackling the uncertainties inherent in demand response operations. Through extensive simulation and analysis, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in maximizing the benefits of G2V and V2G while assessing the impact on the longevity and reliability of EV batteries. Specifically, our controller enables Charge Point Operators (CPOs) to optimize EV charging and discharging schedules in real-time, taking into account fluctuating energy prices, grid constraints, and EV user preferences.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Sampling Approach to Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an optimal stochastic sampling approach to privacy, in which a sensor observes a process which is correlated to private information. In out set-up, a sampler decides to keep or discard the sensor's observations. The kept samples are shared with an adversary who might attempt to infer the private process based on the sampler's output. The privacy leakages are captured with the mutual information between the private process and sampler's output. We cast the optimal sampling design as an optimization problem with two objectives: (i) minimizing the reconstruction error of the observed process using the sampler's output, (ii) reducing the privacy leakages. We first show the optimal reconstruction policy is deterministic and can be obtained by solving a one-step optimization problem at each time step. We also derive the optimality equations of the privacy-sampler for a general class of processes via the dynamic decomposition method, and show the sampler controls the adversary's belief about the private input. Also, we propose a simplified design for linear Gaussian processes by restricting the sampling policy to a special collection. We show that the optimal reconstruction of the system state and the private process is similar to Kalman filter in the linear Gaussian case, and the objective of the sampler design problem can be analytically expressed based on a conditional mean and covariance matrix. Furthermore, we develop an numerical algorithm to optimize the sampling and reconstruction policies, wherein the policy gradient theorem for the optimal sampling design is derived based on the implicit function theorem. Finally, we verify our design and show it capabilities in state reconstruction, privacy protection and data size reduction via simulations.</description>

      <title>The Case for DeepSOH: Addressing Path Dependency for Remaining Useful Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The battery state of health (SOH) based on capacity fade and resistance increase is not sufficient for predicting Remaining Useful life (RUL). The electrochemical community blames the path-dependency of the battery degradation mechanisms for our inability to forecast the degradation. The control community knows that the path-dependency is addressed by full state estimation. We show that even the electrode-specific SOH (eSOH) estimation is not enough to fully define the degradation states by simulating infinite possible degradation trajectories and remaining useful lives (RUL) from a unique eSOH. We finally define the deepSOH states that capture the individual contributions of all the common degradation mechanisms, namely, SEI, plating, and mechanical fracture to the loss of lithium inventory. We show that the addition of cell expansion measurement may allow us to estimate the deepSOH and predict the remaining useful life.</description>

      <title>Design, Control, and Motion-Planning for a Root-Perching Rotor-Distributed Manipulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulation performance improvement is crucial for aerial robots. For aerial manipulators, the baselink position and attitude errors directly affect the precision at the end effector. To address this stability problem, fixed-body approaches such as perching on the environment using the rotor suction force are useful. Additionally, conventional arm-equipped multirotors, called rotor-concentrated manipulators (RCMs), find it difficult to generate a large wrench at the end effector due to joint torque limitations. Using distributed rotors to each link, the thrust can support each link weight, decreasing the arm joints' torque. Based on this approach, rotor-distributed manipulators (RDMs) can increase feasible wrench and reachability of the end-effector. This paper introduces a minimal configuration of a rotor-distributed manipulator that can perch on surfaces, especially ceilings, using a part of their body. First, we design a minimal rotor-distributed arm considering the flight and end-effector performance. Second, a flight controller is proposed for this minimal RDM along with a perching controller adaptable for various types of aerial robots. Third, we propose a motion planning method based on inverse kinematics (IK), considering specific constraints to the proposed RDMs such as perching force. Finally, we evaluate flight and perching motions and \revise{confirm} that the proposed manipulator can significantly improve the manipulation performance.</description>

      <title>Robust VAR Capability Curve of DER with Uncertain Renewable Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active distribution system with high penetration of inverter based distributed energy resources (DER) can be utilized for VAR-related ancillary services. To utilize the DER flexibility, transmission system operator (TSO) must be presented with the aggregated DER flexibility of distribution system. However, the uncertainty in renewable generation questions the credibility of aggregated capability curve in practice. In this paper, we incorporate the uncertainty into aggregation process to develop a robust capability curve while preserving the real physics (unbalance and lossy nature) of distribution system. Statistical inference method is employed to quantify uncertainty in solar generation and quantified uncertainty is integrated into a chance constrained optimal power flow (OPF). It provides the grid operator with the dispatchable aggregated reactive power capability. The resulting capability curve with the associated probability can be harnessed by the TSO for decision making for both planning and operation.</description>

      <title>Locational marginal burden: Quantifying the equity of optimal power flow solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fair distribution of benefits in electric power systems is a pertinent energy policymaking problem; however, these efforts cannot be easily quantified in power system engineering studies. Therefore, we propose locational marginal burden (LMB) to provide an interface between a well-studied measure of energy pricing equity, energy burden, with an optimal power flow problem (OPF). This is achieved by investigating the intrinsic link between the dual optimal solution of an OPF problem and the electricity prices, which are used to calculate the energy burden. By applying results from the field of differentiable optimization, locational marginal prices (LMPs) associated with an OPF solution can be differentiated with respect to demand. This enables electricity retail prices, and thereby, energy burden itself, to be differentiated, resulting in the proposed LMB. Simulation of a synthetic Hawaii network interfaced with real-world socioeconomic data shows how the LMB provides new insights into how the operation of the electricity network affects the equity of energy prices.</description>

      <title>Optimal Update Policy for the Monitoring of Distributed Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When making decisions in a network, it is important to have up-to-date knowledge of the current state of the system. Obtaining this information, however, comes at a cost. In this paper, we determine the optimal finite-time update policy for monitoring the binary states of remote sources with a reporting rate constraint. We first prove an upper and lower bound of the minimal probability of error before solving the problem analytically. The error probability is defined as the probability that the system performs differently than it would with full system knowledge. More specifically, an error occurs when the destination node incorrectly determines which top-K priority sources are in the ``free'' state. We find that the optimal policy follows a specific ordered 3-stage update pattern. We then provide the optimal transition points for each stage for each source.</description>

      <title>Meta-Control: Automatic Model-based Control Synthesis for Heterogeneous Robot Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The requirements for real-world manipulation tasks are diverse and often conflicting; some tasks necessitate force constraints or collision avoidance, while others demand high-frequency feedback. Satisfying these varied requirements with a fixed state-action representation and control strategy is challenging, impeding the development of a universal robotic foundation model. In this work, we propose Meta-Control, the first LLM-enabled automatic control synthesis approach that creates customized state representations and control strategies tailored to specific tasks. Meta-Control leverages a generic hierarchical control framework to address a wide range of heterogeneous tasks. Our core insight is the decomposition of the state space into an abstract task space and a concrete tracking space. By harnessing LLM's extensive common sense and control knowledge, we enable the LLM to design these spaces, including states, dynamic models, and controllers, using pre-defined but abstract templates. Meta-Control stands out for its fully model-based nature, allowing for rigorous analysis, efficient parameter tuning, and reliable execution. It not only utilizes decades of control expertise encapsulated within LLMs to facilitate heterogeneous control but also ensures formal guarantees such as safety and stability. Our method is validated both in real-world scenarios and simulations across diverse tasks with conflicting requirements, such as collision avoidance versus convergence and compliance versus high precision.

      <title>Preparing for Black Swans: The Antifragility Imperative for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operating safely and reliably despite continual distribution shifts is vital for high-stakes machine learning applications. This paper builds upon the transformative concept of ``antifragility'' introduced by (Taleb, 2014) as a constructive design paradigm to not just withstand but benefit from volatility. We formally define antifragility in the context of online decision making as dynamic regret's strictly concave response to environmental variability, revealing limitations of current approaches focused on resisting rather than benefiting from nonstationarity. Our contribution lies in proposing potential computational pathways for engineering antifragility, grounding the concept in online learning theory and drawing connections to recent advancements in areas such as meta-learning, safe exploration, continual learning, multi-objective/quality-diversity optimization, and foundation models. By identifying promising mechanisms and future research directions, we aim to put antifragility on a rigorous theoretical foundation in machine learning. We further emphasize the need for clear guidelines, risk assessment frameworks, and interdisciplinary collaboration to ensure responsible application.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing, leveraging principles of quantum mechanics, represents a transformative approach in computational methodologies, offering significant enhancements over traditional classical systems. This study tackles the complex and computationally demanding task of simulating power system transients through solving differential algebraic equations (DAEs). We introduce two novel Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs): the Sinusoidal-Friendly QNN and the Polynomial-Friendly QNN, proposing them as effective alternatives to conventional simulation techniques. Our application of these QNNs successfully simulates two small power systems, demonstrating their potential to achieve good accuracy. We further explore various configurations, including time intervals, training points, and the selection of classical optimizers, to optimize the solving of DAEs using QNNs. This research not only marks a pioneering effort in applying quantum computing to power system simulations but also expands the potential of quantum technologies in addressing intricate engineering challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of robust policy networks in deep reinforcement learning. We investigate the benefits of policy parameterizations that naturally satisfy constraints on their Lipschitz bound, analyzing their empirical performance and robustness on two representative problems: pendulum swing-up and Atari Pong. We illustrate that policy networks with small Lipschitz bounds are significantly more robust to disturbances, random noise, and targeted adversarial attacks than unconstrained policies composed of vanilla multi-layer perceptrons or convolutional neural networks. Moreover, we find that choosing a policy parameterization with a non-conservative Lipschitz bound and an expressive, nonlinear layer architecture gives the user much finer control over the performance-robustness trade-off than existing state-of-the-art methods based on spectral normalization.</description>

      <title>CPS-LLM: Large Language Model based Safe Usage Plan Generator for Human-in-the-Loop Human-in-the-Plant Cyber-Physical System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the usage of large language models (LLM) in human-in-the-loop human-in-the-plant cyber-physical systems (CPS) to translate a high-level prompt into a personalized plan of actions, and subsequently convert that plan into a grounded inference of sequential decision-making automated by a real-world CPS controller to achieve a control goal. We show that it is relatively straightforward to contextualize an LLM so it can generate domain-specific plans. However, these plans may be infeasible for the physical system to execute or the plan may be unsafe for human users. To address this, we propose CPS-LLM, an LLM retrained using an instruction tuning framework, which ensures that generated plans not only align with the physical system dynamics of the CPS but are also safe for human users. The CPS-LLM consists of two innovative components: a) a liquid time constant neural network-based physical dynamics coefficient estimator that can derive coefficients of dynamical models with some unmeasured state variables; b) the model coefficients are then used to train an LLM with prompts embodied with traces from the dynamical system and the corresponding model coefficients. We show that when the CPS-LLM is integrated with a contextualized chatbot such as BARD it can generate feasible and safe plans to manage external events such as meals for automated insulin delivery systems used by Type 1 Diabetes subjects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a motor-driven Peltier device designed to deliver immediate thermal sensations within extended reality (XR) environments. The system incorporates eight motor-driven Peltier elements, facilitating swift transitions between warm and cool sensations by rotating preheated or cooled elements to opposite sides. A multi-layer structure, comprising aluminum and silicone layers, ensures user comfort and safety while maintaining optimal temperatures for thermal stimuli. Time-temperature characteristic analysis demonstrates the system's ability to provide warm and cool sensations efficiently, with a dual-sided lifetime of up to 206 seconds at a 2V input. Our system design is adaptable to various body parts and can be synchronized with corresponding visual stimuli to enhance the immersive sensation of virtual object interaction and information delivery.</description>

      <title>Modeling and simulation of a mechanism for suppressing the flipping problem of a jumping robot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to solve the problem of stable jumping of micro robot, we design a special mechanism: elastic passive joint (EPJ). EPJ can assist in achieving smooth jumping through the opening-closing process when the robot jumps. First, we introduce the composition and operation principle of EPJ, and perform a dynamic modeling of the robot's jumping process. Then, in order to verify the effectiveness of EPJ in controlling the robot's smooth jump, we design a simulation experiment based on MATLAB. Through comparative experiments, it was proved that EPJ can greatly adjust the angular velocity of the robot and increase the jump distance of the robot. Finally, we analyze each parameter in EPJ and performs parameter optimization. After optimization, EPJ achieves a completely flip-free jump of the robot, laying an important foundation for improving the mobility of micro-robot.</description>

      <title>Sparse Attention-driven Quality Prediction for Production Process Optimization in Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the process industry, optimizing production lines for long-term efficiency requires real-time monitoring and analysis of operation states to fine-tune production line parameters. However, the complexity in operational logic and the intricate coupling of production process parameters make it difficult to develop an accurate mathematical model for the entire process, thus hindering the deployment of efficient optimization mechanisms. In view of these difficulties, we propose to deploy a digital twin of the production line by digitally abstracting its physical layout and operational logic. By iteratively mapping the real-world data reflecting equipment operation status and product quality inspection in the digital twin, we adopt a quality prediction model for production process based on self-attention-enabled temporal convolutional neural networks. This model enables the data-driven state evolution of the digital twin. The digital twin takes a role of aggregating the information of actual operating conditions and the results of quality-sensitive analysis, which facilitates the optimization of process production quality with virtual-reality evolution under multi-dimensional constraints. Leveraging the digital twin model as an information-flow carrier, we extract temporal features from key process indicators and establish a production process quality prediction model based on the proposed composite neural network. Our operation experiments on a specific tobacco shredding line demonstrate that the proposed digital twin-based production process optimization method fosters seamless integration between virtual and real production lines. This integration achieves an average operating status prediction accuracy of over 98\% and near-optimal production process control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems are increasingly widespread in a range of application domains, with optimization and learning underpinning many of the tasks that arise in this context. Different approaches have been proposed to enable the cooperative solution of these optimization and learning problems, including first- and second-order methods, and dual (or Lagrangian) methods, all of which rely on consensus and message-passing. In this article we discuss these algorithms through the lens of non-expansive operator theory, providing a unifying perspective. We highlight the insights that this viewpoint delivers, and discuss how it can spark future original research.</description>

      <title>Efficient Strategy Synthesis for Switched Stochastic Systems with Distributional Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for the control of discrete-time switched stochastic systems with uncertain distributions. In particular, we consider stochastic dynamics with additive noise whose distribution lies in an ambiguity set of distributions that are $\varepsilon-$close, in the Wasserstein distance sense, to a nominal one. We propose algorithms for the efficient synthesis of distributionally robust control strategies that maximize the satisfaction probability of reach-avoid specifications with either a given or an arbitrary (not specified) time horizon, i.e., unbounded-time reachability. The framework consists of two main steps: finite abstraction and control synthesis. First, we construct a finite abstraction of the switched stochastic system as a \emph{robust Markov decision process} (robust MDP) that encompasses both the stochasticity of the system and the uncertainty in the noise distribution. Then, we synthesize a strategy that is robust to the distributional uncertainty on the resulting robust MDP. We employ techniques from optimal transport and stochastic programming to reduce the strategy synthesis problem to a set of linear programs, and propose a tailored and efficient algorithm to solve them. The resulting strategies are correctly refined into switching strategies for the original stochastic system. We illustrate the efficacy of our framework on various case studies comprising both linear and non-linear switched stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Estimation-Based Safety-Critical Cruise Control of Vehicular Platoons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal cruise control design can increase highway throughput and vehicle safety in traffic flow. In most heterogeneous platoons, the absence of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication poses challenges in maintaining system stability and ensuring a safe inter-vehicle distance. This paper presents an adaptive estimation-based control design for adaptive cruise control (ACC) that reliably estimates the states of the preceding vehicle while ensuring the autonomous vehicle operates within a safe region. Lyapunov functions and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are employed to design a safety-critical controller that guarantees safety despite potential estimation errors. The proposed unified control formulation addresses limitations in the existing cruise control solutions by simultaneously ensuring safety, stability, and optimal performance. The estimator-controller framework is implemented in scenarios with and without vehicle-to-vehicle communication, demonstrating successful performance in maintaining platoon safety and stability. Additionally, physics engine-based simulations reinforce both the practical viability of the proposed control framework in real-world situations and the controller's adeptness at maintaining safety amidst realistic operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Integrated Freeway Traffic Control Using Q-Learning with Adjacent Arterial Traffic Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous studies have shown the effectiveness of intelligent transportation system techniques such as variable speed limit (VSL), lane change (LC) control, and ramp metering (RM) in freeway traffic flow control. The integration of these techniques has the potential to further enhance the traffic operation efficiency of both freeway and adjacent arterial networks. In this regard, we propose a freeway traffic control (FTC) strategy that coordinates VSL, LC, RM actions using a Q-learning (QL) framework which takes into account arterial traffic characteristics. The signal timing and demands of adjacent arterial intersections are incorporated as state variables of the FTC agent. The FTC agent is initially trained offline using a single-section road network, and subsequently deployed online in a connected freeway and arterial simulation network for continuous learning. The arterial network is assumed to be regulated by a traffic-responsive signal control strategy based on a cycle length model. Microscopic simulations demonstrate that the fully-trained FTC agent provides significant reductions in freeway travel time and the number of stops in scenarios with traffic congestion. It clearly outperforms an uncoordinated FTC and a decentralized feedback control strategy. Even though the FTC agent does not control the arterial traffic signals, it leads to shorter average queue lengths at arterial intersections by taking into account the arterial traffic conditions in controlling freeway traffic. These results motivate a future research where the QL framework will also include the control of arterial traffic signals.</description>

      <title>State of Health Estimation for Battery Modules with Parallel-Connected Cells Under Cell-to-Cell Variations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03097v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: State of health (SOH) estimation for lithium-ion battery modules with cells connected in parallel is a challenging problem, especially with cell-to-cell variations. Incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis (DVA) are effective at the cell level, but a generalizable method to extend them to module-level SOH estimation remains missing, when only module-level measurements are available. This paper proposes a new method and demonstrates that, with multiple features systematically selected from the module-level ICA and DVA, the module-level SOH can be estimated with high accuracy and confidence in the presence of cell-to-cell variations. First, an information theory-based feature selection algorithm is proposed to find an optimal set of features for module-level SOH estimation. Second, a relevance vector regression (RVR)-based module-level SOH estimation model is proposed to provide both point estimates and three-sigma credible intervals while maintaining model sparsity. With more selected features incorporated, the proposed method achieves better estimation accuracy and higher confidence at the expense of higher model complexity. When applied to a large experimental dataset, the proposed method and the resulting sparse model lead to module-level SOH estimates with a 0.5% root-mean-square error and a 1.5% average three-sigma value. With all the training processes completed offboard, the proposed method has low computational complexity for onboard implementations.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Robust Covariance Control for Uncertain Linear Systems</title>

Abstract: The theory of covariance control and covariance steering (CS) deals with controlling the dispersion of trajectories of a dynamical system, under the implicit assumption that accurate prior knowledge of the system being controlled is available. In this work, we consider the problem of steering the distribution of a discrete-time, linear system subject to exogenous disturbances under an unknown dynamics model. Leveraging concepts from behavioral systems theory, the trajectories of this unknown, noisy system may be (approximately) represented using system data collected through experimentation. Using this fact, we formulate a direct data-driven covariance control problem using input-state data. We then propose a maximum likelihood uncertainty quantification method to estimate and bound the noise realizations in the data collection process. Lastly, we utilize robust convex optimization techniques to solve the resulting norm-bounded uncertain convex program. We illustrate the proposed end-to-end data-driven CS algorithm on a double integrator example and showcase the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed method compared to that of model-based methods</description>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide a system identification-friendly introduction to the Structured State-space Models (SSMs). These models have become recently popular in the machine learning community since, owing to their parallelizability, they can be efficiently and scalably trained to tackle extremely-long sequence classification and regression problems. Interestingly, SSMs appear as an effective way to learn deep Wiener models, which allows to reframe SSMs as an extension of a model class commonly used in system identification. In order to stimulate a fruitful exchange of ideas between the machine learning and system identification communities, we deem it useful to summarize the recent contributions on the topic in a structured and accessible form. At last, we highlight future research directions for which this community could provide impactful contributions.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the learning of a Reduced-Order Linear Parameter-Varying Model (ROLPVM) of a nonlinear dynamical system based on data. This is achieved by a two-step procedure. In the first step, we learn a projection to a lower dimensional state-space. In step two, an LPV model is learned on the reduced-order state-space using a novel, efficient parameterization in terms of neural networks. The improved modeling accuracy of the method compared to an existing method is demonstrated by simulation examples.</description>

      <title>Bounding Stochastic Safety: Leveraging Freedman's Inequality with Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05745v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When deployed in the real world, safe control methods must be robust to unstructured uncertainties such as modeling error and external disturbances. Typical robust safety methods achieve their guarantees by always assuming that the worst-case disturbance will occur. In contrast, this paper utilizes Freedman's inequality in the context of discrete-time control barrier functions (DTCBFs) and c-martingales to provide stronger (less conservative) safety guarantees for stochastic systems. Our approach accounts for the underlying disturbance distribution instead of relying exclusively on its worst-case bound and does not require the barrier function to be upper-bounded, which makes the resulting safety probability bounds more directly useful for intuitive safety constraints such as signed distance. We compare our results with existing safety guarantees, such as input-to-state safety (ISSf) and martingale results that rely on Ville's inequality. When the assumptions for all methods hold, we provide a range of parameters for which our guarantee is stronger. Finally, we present simulation examples, including a bipedal walking robot, that demonstrate the utility and tightness of our safety guarantee.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, several direct Data-Driven Predictive Control (DDPC) methods have been proposed, advocating the possibility of designing predictive controllers from historical input-output trajectories without the need to identify a model. In this work, we show that these approaches are equivalent to an indirect approach. Reformulating the direct methods in terms of estimated parameters and covariance matrices allows us to give new insights into how they work in comparison with, for example, Subspace Predictive Control (SPC). In particular, we show that for unconstrained problems the direct methods are equivalent to SPC with a reduced weight on the tracking cost. Via a numerical experiment, motivated by the reformulation, we also illustrate why the performance of direct DDPC methods with fixed regularization tends to degrade as the number of training samples increases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging technology of quantum computing has the potential to change the way how problems will be solved in the future. This work presents a centralized network control algorithm executable on already existing quantum computer which are based on the principle of quantum annealing like the D-Wave Advantage. We introduce a resource reoccupation algorithm for traffic engineering in wide-area networks. The proposed optimization algorithm changes traffic steering and resource allocation in case of overloaded transceivers. Settings of active components like fiber amplifiers and transceivers are not changed for the reason of stability. This algorithm is beneficial in situations when the network traffic is fluctuating in time scales of seconds or spontaneous bursts occur. Further, we developed a discrete-time flow simulator to study the algorithm's performance in wide-area networks. Our network simulator considers backlog and loss modeling of buffered transmission lines. Concurring flows are handled equally in case of a backlog.
  This work provides an ILP-based network configuring algorithm that is applicable on quantum annealing computers. We showcase, that traffic losses can be reduced significantly by a factor of 2 if a resource reoccupation algorithm is applied in a network with bursty traffic. As resources are used more efficiently by reoccupation in heavy load situations, overprovisioning of networks can be reduced. Thus, this new form of network operation leads toward a zero-margin network. We show that our newly introduced network simulator enables analyses of short-time effects like buffering within fat-pipe networks. As the calculation of network configurations in real-sized networks is typically time-consuming, quantum computing can enable the proposed network configuration algorithm for application in real-sized wide-area networks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the systems with trajectories originating in the nonnegative orthant becoming nonnegative after some finite time transient. First we consider dynamical systems (i.e., fully observable systems with no inputs), which we call eventually positive. We compute forward-invariant cones and Lyapunov functions for these systems. We then extend the notion of eventually positive systems to the input-output system case. Our extension is performed in such a manner, that some valuable properties of classical internally positive input-output systems are preserved. For example, their induced norms can be computed using linear programming and the energy functions have nonnegative derivatives.</description>

      <title>OpenStreetMap-based Autonomous Navigation With LiDAR Naive-Valley-Path Obstacle Avoidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.09117v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: OpenStreetMaps (OSM) is currently studied as the environment representation for autonomous navigation. It provides advantages such as global consistency, a heavy-less map construction process, and a wide variety of road information publicly available. However, the location of this information is usually not very accurate locally.
  In this paper, we present a complete autonomous navigation pipeline using OSM information as environment representation for global planning. To avoid the flaw of local low-accuracy, we offer the novel LiDAR-based Naive-Valley-Path (NVP) method that exploits the concept of "valley" areas to infer the local path always furthest from obstacles. This behavior allows navigation always through the center of trafficable areas following the road's shape independently of OSM error. Furthermore, NVP is a naive method that is highly sample-time-efficient. This time efficiency also enables obstacle avoidance, even for dynamic objects.
  We demonstrate the system's robustness in our research platform BLUE, driving autonomously across the University of Alicante Scientific Park for more than 20 km with 0.24 meters of average error against the road's center with a 19.8 ms of average sample time. Our vehicle avoids static obstacles in the road and even dynamic ones, such as vehicles and pedestrians.</description>

      <title>A Safe First-Order Method for Pricing-Based Resource Allocation in Safety-Critical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel algorithm for solving network utility maximization (NUM) problems that arise in resource allocation schemes over networks with known safety-critical constraints, where the constraints form an arbitrary convex and compact feasible set. Inspired by applications where customers' demand can only be affected through posted prices and real-time two-way communication with customers is not available, we require an algorithm to generate ``safe prices''. This means that at no iteration should the realized demand in response to the posted prices violate the safety constraints of the network. Thus, in contrast to existing distributed first-order methods, our algorithm, called safe pricing for NUM (SPNUM), is guaranteed to produce feasible primal iterates at all iterations. At the heart of the algorithm lie two key steps that must go hand in hand to guarantee safety and convergence: 1) applying a projected gradient method on a shrunk feasible set to get the desired demand, and 2) estimating the price response function of the users and determining the price so that the induced demand is close to the desired demand. We ensure safety by adjusting the shrinkage to account for the error between the induced demand and the desired demand. In addition, by gradually reducing the amount of shrinkage and the step size of the gradient method, we prove that the primal iterates produced by the SPNUM achieve a sublinear static regret of ${\cal O}(\log{(T)})$ after $T$ time steps.</description>

      <title>System-level Safety Guard: Safe Tracking Control through Uncertain Neural Network Dynamics Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Neural Network (NN), as a black-box function approximator, has been considered in many control and robotics applications. However, difficulties in verifying the overall system safety in the presence of uncertainties hinder the deployment of NN modules in safety-critical systems. In this paper, we leverage the NNs as predictive models for trajectory tracking of unknown dynamical systems. We consider controller design in the presence of both intrinsic uncertainty and uncertainties from other system modules. In this setting, we formulate the constrained trajectory tracking problem and show that it can be solved using Mixed-integer Linear Programming (MILP). The proposed MILP-based approach is empirically demonstrated in robot navigation and obstacle avoidance through simulations. The demonstration videos are available at https://xiaolisean.github.io/publication/2023-11-01-L4DC2024.</description>

      <title>Global Rewards in Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Mobility on Demand Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study vehicle dispatching in autonomous mobility on demand (AMoD) systems, where a central operator assigns vehicles to customer requests or rejects these with the aim of maximizing its total profit. Recent approaches use multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) to realize scalable yet performant algorithms, but train agents based on local rewards, which distorts the reward signal with respect to the system-wide profit, leading to lower performance. We therefore propose a novel global-rewards-based MADRL algorithm for vehicle dispatching in AMoD systems, which resolves so far existing goal conflicts between the trained agents and the operator by assigning rewards to agents leveraging a counterfactual baseline. Our algorithm shows statistically significant improvements across various settings on real-world data compared to state-of-the-art MADRL algorithms with local rewards. We further provide a structural analysis which shows that the utilization of global rewards can improve implicit vehicle balancing and demand forecasting abilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/tumBAIS/GR-MADRL-AMoD.</description>

      <title>Stable and Safe Human-aligned Reinforcement Learning through Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) excels in applications such as video games, but ensuring safety as well as the ability to achieve the specified goals remains challenging when using RL for real-world problems, such as human-aligned tasks where human safety is paramount. This paper provides safety and stability definitions for such human-aligned tasks, and then proposes an algorithm that leverages neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) to predict human and robot movements and integrates the control barrier function (CBF) and control Lyapunov function (CLF) with the actor-critic method to help to maintain the safety and stability for human-aligned tasks. Simulation results show that the algorithm helps the controlled robot to reach the desired goal state with fewer safety violations and better sample efficiency compared to other methods in a human-aligned task.</description>

      <title>Rademacher Complexity of Neural ODEs via Chen-Fliess Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how continuous-depth neural ODE models can be framed as single-layer, infinite-width nets using the Chen--Fliess series expansion for nonlinear ODEs. In this net, the output ``weights'' are taken from the signature of the control input -- a tool used to represent infinite-dimensional paths as a sequence of tensors -- which comprises iterated integrals of the control input over a simplex. The ``features'' are taken to be iterated Lie derivatives of the output function with respect to the vector fields in the controlled ODE model. The main result of this work applies this framework to derive compact expressions for the Rademacher complexity of ODE models that map an initial condition to a scalar output at some terminal time. The result leverages the straightforward analysis afforded by single-layer architectures. We conclude with some examples instantiating the bound for some specific systems and discuss potential follow-up work.</description>

      <title>When to Preempt in a Status Update System?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted status update system with an error-free preemptive queue. The goal of the sampler-scheduler pair is to minimize the age of information at the monitor by sampling and transmitting the freshly sampled update packets to the monitor. The sampler-scheduler pair also has a choice to preempt an old update packet from the server and transmit a new update packet to the server. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and find the optimal sampling policy. We find a sufficient, and also separately a necessary, condition for the always preemption policy to be an optimal policy. We show that it is optimal for the sampler-scheduler pair to sample a new packet immediately upon the reception of an update packet at the monitor. We propose a double-threshold sampling policy which we show to be an optimal policy under some assumptions on the queue statistic.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Modeling and Control of Medical Digital Twins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vision of personalized medicine is to identify interventions that maintain or restore a person's health based on their individual biology. Medical digital twins, computational models that integrate a wide range of health-related data about a person and can be dynamically updated, are a key technology that can help guide medical decisions. Such medical digital twin models can be high-dimensional, multi-scale, and stochastic. To be practical for healthcare applications, they often need to be simplified into low-dimensional surrogate models that can be used for the optimal design of interventions. This paper introduces surrogate modeling algorithms for the purpose of optimal control applications. As a use case, we focus on agent-based models (ABMs), a common model type in biomedicine for which there are no readily available optimal control algorithms. By deriving surrogate models that are based on systems of ordinary differential equations, we show how optimal control methods can be employed to compute effective interventions, which can then be lifted back to a given ABM. The relevance of the methods introduced here extends beyond medical digital twins to other complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a linear programming formulation for the solution of joint chance constrained optimal control problems over finite time horizons. The joint chance constraint may represent an invariance, reachability or reach-avoid specification that the trajectory must satisfy with a predefined probability. For finite state and action spaces, the solution is exact and our method computationally superior to approaches in the literature. For continuous state or action spaces, our linear programming formulation enables basis function approximations.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Superstabilizing Control under Quadratically-Bounded Errors-in-Variables Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Error-in-Variables model of system identification/control involves nontrivial input and measurement corruption of observed data, resulting in generically nonconvex optimization problems. This paper performs full-state-feedback stabilizing control of all discrete-time linear systems that are consistent with observed data for which the input and measurement noise obey quadratic bounds. Instances of such quadratic bounds include elementwise norm bounds (at each time sample), energy bounds (across the entire signal), and chance constraints arising from (sub)gaussian noise. Superstabilizing controllers are generated through the solution of a sum-of-squares hierarchy of semidefinite programs. A theorem of alternatives is employed to eliminate the input and measurement noise process, thus improving tractability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanoid-Gym is an easy-to-use reinforcement learning (RL) framework based on Nvidia Isaac Gym, designed to train locomotion skills for humanoid robots, emphasizing zero-shot transfer from simulation to the real-world environment. Humanoid-Gym also integrates a sim-to-sim framework from Isaac Gym to Mujoco that allows users to verify the trained policies in different physical simulations to ensure the robustness and generalization of the policies. This framework is verified by RobotEra's XBot-S (1.2-meter tall humanoid robot) and XBot-L (1.65-meter tall humanoid robot) in a real-world environment with zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. The project website and source code can be found at: https://sites.google.com/view/humanoid-gym/.</description>

      <title>Learning Force Control for Legged Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controlling contact forces during interactions is critical for locomotion and manipulation tasks. While sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) has succeeded in many contact-rich problems, current RL methods achieve forceful interactions implicitly without explicitly regulating forces. We propose a method for training RL policies for direct force control without requiring access to force sensing. We showcase our method on a whole-body control platform of a quadruped robot with an arm. Such force control enables us to perform gravity compensation and impedance control, unlocking compliant whole-body manipulation. The learned whole-body controller with variable compliance makes it intuitive for humans to teleoperate the robot by only commanding the manipulator, and the robot's body adjusts automatically to achieve the desired position and force. Consequently, a human teleoperator can easily demonstrate a wide variety of loco-manipulation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first deployment of learned whole-body force control in legged manipulators, paving the way for more versatile and adaptable legged robots.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI for Ship Collision Avoidance: Decoding Decision-Making Processes and Behavioral Intentions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study developed an explainable AI for ship collision avoidance. Initially, a critic network composed of sub-task critic networks was proposed to individually evaluate each sub-task in collision avoidance to clarify the AI decision-making processes involved. Additionally, an attempt was made to discern behavioral intentions through a Q-value analysis and an Attention mechanism. The former focused on interpreting intentions by examining the increment of the Q-value resulting from AI actions, while the latter incorporated the significance of other ships in the decision-making process for collision avoidance into the learning objective. AI's behavioral intentions in collision avoidance were visualized by combining the perceived collision danger with the degree of attention to other ships. The proposed method was evaluated through a numerical experiment. The developed AI was confirmed to be able to safely avoid collisions under various congestion levels, and AI's decision-making process was rendered comprehensible to humans. The proposed method not only facilitates the understanding of DRL-based controllers/systems in the ship collision avoidance task but also extends to any task comprising sub-tasks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Koopman Embedding for Robust Control of Complex Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of linear embedding is the key to the synthesis of linear control techniques for nonlinear systems. In recent years, while Koopman operator theory has become a prominent approach for learning these linear embeddings through data-driven methods, these algorithms often exhibit limitations in generalizability beyond the distribution captured by training data and are not robust to changes in the nominal system dynamics induced by intrinsic or environmental factors. To overcome these limitations, this study presents an adaptive Koopman architecture capable of responding to the changes in system dynamics online. The proposed framework initially employs an autoencoder-based neural network that utilizes input-output information from the nominal system to learn the corresponding Koopman embedding offline. Subsequently, we augment this nominal Koopman architecture with a feed-forward neural network that learns to modify the nominal dynamics in response to any deviation between the predicted and observed lifted states, leading to improved generalization and robustness to a wide range of uncertainties and disturbances compared to contemporary methods. Extensive tracking control simulations, which are undertaken by integrating the proposed scheme within a Model Predictive Control framework, are used to highlight its robustness against measurement noise, disturbances, and parametric variations in system dynamics.</description>

      <title>A finite-sample generalization bound for stable LPV systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main theoretical challenges in learning dynamical systems from data is providing upper bounds on the generalization error, that is, the difference between the expected prediction error and the empirical prediction error measured on some finite sample. In machine learning, a popular class of such bounds are the so-called Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) bounds. In this paper, we derive a PAC bound for stable continuous-time linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. Our bound depends on the H2 norm of the chosen class of the LPV systems, but does not depend on the time interval for which the signals are considered.</description>
