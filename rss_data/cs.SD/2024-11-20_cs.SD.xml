      <title>Compression of Higher Order Ambisonics with Multichannel RVQGAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multichannel extension to the RVQGAN neural coding method is proposed, and realized for data-driven compression of third-order Ambisonics audio. The input- and output layers of the generator and discriminator models are modified to accept multiple (16) channels without increasing the model bitrate. We also propose a loss function for accounting for spatial perception in immersive reproduction, and transfer learning from single-channel models. Listening test results with 7.1.4 immersive playback show that the proposed extension is suitable for coding scene-based, 16-channel Ambisonics content with good quality at 16 kbit/s.</description>

      <title>Vision Language Models Are Few-Shot Audio Spectrogram Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that vision language models (VLMs) are capable of recognizing the content in audio recordings when given corresponding spectrogram images. Specifically, we instruct VLMs to perform audio classification tasks in a few-shot setting by prompting them to classify a spectrogram image given example spectrogram images of each class. By carefully designing the spectrogram image representation and selecting good few-shot examples, we show that GPT-4o can achieve 59.00% cross-validated accuracy on the ESC-10 environmental sound classification dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that VLMs currently outperform the only available commercial audio language model with audio understanding capabilities (Gemini-1.5) on the equivalent audio classification task (59.00% vs. 49.62%), and even perform slightly better than human experts on visual spectrogram classification (73.75% vs. 72.50% on first fold). We envision two potential use cases for these findings: (1) combining the spectrogram and language understanding capabilities of VLMs for audio caption augmentation, and (2) posing visual spectrogram classification as a challenge task for VLMs.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Crate Digging: DJ Tool Retrieval Using Speech Activity, Music Structure And CLAP Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In genres like Hip-Hop, RnB, Reggae, Dancehall and just about every Electronic/Dance/Club style, DJ tools are a special set of audio files curated to heighten the DJ's musical performance and creative mixing choices. In this work we demonstrate an approach to discovering DJ tools in personal music collections. Leveraging open-source libraries for speech/music activity, music boundary analysis and a Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model for zero-shot audio classification, we demonstrate a novel system designed to retrieve (or rediscover) compelling DJ tools for use live or in the studio.</description>

      <title>DGSNA: prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of accurately enumerating and describing scenes and the labor-intensive process required to replicate acoustic environments using non-generative methods. We introduce the prompt-based Dynamic Generative Sce-ne-based Noise Addition method (DGSNA), which innovatively combines the Dynamic Generation of Scene Information (DGSI) with Scene-based Noise Addition for Audio (SNAA). Employing generative chat models structured within the Back-ground-Examples-Task (BET) prompt framework, DGSI com-ponent facilitates the dynamic synthesis of tailored Scene Infor-mation (SI) for specific acoustic environments. Additionally, the SNAA component leverages Room Impulse Response (RIR) fil-ters and Text-To-Audio (TTA) systems to generate realistic, scene-based noise that can be adapted for both indoor and out-door environments. Through comprehensive experiments, the adaptability of DGSNA across different generative chat models was demonstrated. The results, assessed through both objective and subjective evaluations, show that DGSNA provides robust performance in dynamically generating precise SI and effectively enhancing scene-based noise addition capabilities, thus offering significant improvements over traditional methods in acoustic scene simulation. Our implementation and demos are available at https://dgsna.github.io.</description>

      <title>Improving Controllability and Editability for Pretrained Text-to-Music Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of AI-assisted music creation has made significant strides, yet existing systems often struggle to meet the demands of iterative and nuanced music production. These challenges include providing sufficient control over the generated content and allowing for flexible, precise edits. This thesis tackles these issues by introducing a series of advancements that progressively build upon each other, enhancing the controllability and editability of text-to-music generation models.
  First, we introduce Loop Copilot, a system that tries to address the need for iterative refinement in music creation. Loop Copilot leverages a large language model (LLM) to coordinate multiple specialised AI models, enabling users to generate and refine music interactively through a conversational interface. Central to this system is the Global Attribute Table, which records and maintains key musical attributes throughout the iterative process, ensuring that modifications at any stage preserve the overall coherence of the music. While Loop Copilot excels in orchestrating the music creation process, it does not directly address the need for detailed edits to the generated content.
  To overcome this limitation, MusicMagus is presented as a further solution for editing AI-generated music. MusicMagus introduces a zero-shot text-to-music editing approach that allows for the modification of specific musical attributes, such as genre, mood, and instrumentation, without the need for retraining. By manipulating the latent space within pre-trained diffusion models, MusicMagus ensures that these edits are stylistically coherent and that non-targeted attributes remain unchanged. This system is particularly effective in maintaining the structural integrity of the music during edits, but it encounters challenges with more complex and real-world audio scenarios.

      <title>Predicting User Intents and Musical Attributes from Music Discovery Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intent classification is a text understanding task that identifies user needs from input text queries. While intent classification has been extensively studied in various domains, it has not received much attention in the music domain. In this paper, we investigate intent classification models for music discovery conversation, focusing on pre-trained language models. Rather than only predicting functional needs: intent classification, we also include a task for classifying musical needs: musical attribute classification. Additionally, we propose a method of concatenating previous chat history with just single-turn user queries in the input text, allowing the model to understand the overall conversation context better. Our proposed model significantly improves the F1 score for both user intent and musical attribute classification, and surpasses the zero-shot and few-shot performance of the pretrained Llama 3 model.</description>

      <title>Rethinking MUSHRA: Addressing Modern Challenges in Text-to-Speech Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in TTS models, a consistent and robust human evaluation framework is still lacking. For example, MOS tests fail to differentiate between similar models, and CMOS's pairwise comparisons are time-intensive. The MUSHRA test is a promising alternative for evaluating multiple TTS systems simultaneously, but in this work we show that its reliance on matching human reference speech unduly penalises the scores of modern TTS systems that can exceed human speech quality. More specifically, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the MUSHRA test, focusing on its sensitivity to factors such as rater variability, listener fatigue, and reference bias. Based on our extensive evaluation involving 471 human listeners across Hindi and Tamil we identify two primary shortcomings: (i) reference-matching bias, where raters are unduly influenced by the human reference, and (ii) judgement ambiguity, arising from a lack of clear fine-grained guidelines. To address these issues, we propose two refined variants of the MUSHRA test. The first variant enables fairer ratings for synthesized samples that surpass human reference quality. The second variant reduces ambiguity, as indicated by the relatively lower variance across raters. By combining these approaches, we achieve both more reliable and more fine-grained assessments. We also release MANGO, a massive dataset of 47,100 human ratings, the first-of-its-kind collection for Indian languages, aiding in analyzing human preferences and developing automatic metrics for evaluating TTS systems.</description>

      <title>Structured Multi-Track Accompaniment Arrangement via Style Prior Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of music AI, arranging rich and structured multi-track accompaniments from a simple lead sheet presents significant challenges. Such challenges include maintaining track cohesion, ensuring long-term coherence, and optimizing computational efficiency. In this paper, we introduce a novel system that leverages prior modelling over disentangled style factors to address these challenges. Our method presents a two-stage process: initially, a piano arrangement is derived from the lead sheet by retrieving piano texture styles; subsequently, a multi-track orchestration is generated by infusing orchestral function styles into the piano arrangement. Our key design is the use of vector quantization and a unique multi-stream Transformer to model the long-term flow of the orchestration style, which enables flexible, controllable, and structured music generation. Experiments show that by factorizing the arrangement task into interpretable sub-stages, our approach enhances generative capacity while improving efficiency. Additionally, our system supports a variety of music genres and provides style control at different composition hierarchies. We further show that our system achieves superior coherence, structure, and overall arrangement quality compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>A Novel Fusion Architecture for PD Detection Using Semi-Supervised Speech Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework to recognize Parkinson's disease (PD) through an English pangram utterance speech collected using a web application from diverse recording settings and environments, including participants' homes. Our dataset includes a global cohort of 1306 participants, including 392 diagnosed with PD. Leveraging the diversity of the dataset, spanning various demographic properties (such as age, sex, and ethnicity), we used deep learning embeddings derived from semi-supervised models such as Wav2Vec 2.0, WavLM, and ImageBind representing the speech dynamics associated with PD. Our novel fusion model for PD classification, which aligns different speech embeddings into a cohesive feature space, demonstrated superior performance over standard concatenation-based fusion models and other baselines (including models built on traditional acoustic features). In a randomized data split configuration, the model achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 88.94% and an accuracy of 85.65%. Rigorous statistical analysis confirmed that our model performs equitably across various demographic subgroups in terms of sex, ethnicity, and age, and remains robust regardless of disease duration. Furthermore, our model, when tested on two entirely unseen test datasets collected from clinical settings and from a PD care center, maintained AUROC scores of 82.12% and 78.44%, respectively. This affirms the model's robustness and it's potential to enhance accessibility and health equity in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Contribution of soundscape appropriateness to soundscape quality assessment in space: a mediating variable affecting acoustic comfort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soundscape appropriateness (SA) provides supplemental information on the matching degree between auditory information and the surrounding scene in soundscape perception. This indicator has been integrated into the standard ISO process for collecting soundscape data, forming a component of the sound quality assessment questionnaire. However, its role in soundscape quality assessment has not been fully understood. Herein, we present the findings from soundscape data collected from Beiling Park in Shenyang, China. A method was developed that integrates mediation effect models with multiscale geographically weighted regression models to explore the mediating role of SA in the impact of sound source types on soundscape quality, as well as the spatial heterogeneity of this mediation effect. The results confirm that SA does mediates the influence of sound source types on acoustics comfort (AC). Specifically, natural sounds (indirect effect/total effect = .19/.19), traffic sounds (indirect effect/total effect = -.46/-.65), and commercial sounds (indirect effect/total effect = -.25/-.12) impact the perception of AC by either enhancing or reducing SA. Moreover, the relationships among variables depicted in this model demonstrate spatial heterogeneity, demonstrating that in urban open spaces with complex constructures, local spatial models may be needed for soundscape assessment. The research reaffirms the significance of SA in urban open spaces. In terms of practical implications for urban and landscape planners, when sound sources cannot be controlled or altered, coordinating between the sound and the surrounding environment through landscape optimisation could also improve the quality of the soundscape through enhancing SA and help achieve the goal of creating healthy urban open spaces.</description>

      <title>Characteristics-Based Design of Generalized-Exponent Bandpass Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop characteristics-based design methods for a class of IIR bandpass filters which we refer to as Generalized Exponent Filters (GEFs) and that are represented as second order filters raised to non-unitary exponents. GEFs have a peak, are effectively linear phase, and may be used for phase-picking for seismic signals, cochlear implants, rainbow sensors, and equalizers. The native specifications for GEFs are not on a given frequency response but rather on filter characteristics such as peak frequency, quality factor, and group delay. Our characteristics-based method for design accommodates direct specification of a trio of frequency-domain characteristics from amongst the peak frequency, 3dB quality factor, equivalent rectangular bandwidth, maximum group delay, and phase accumulation. We achieve this by deriving parameterizations for the filters in terms of sets of filter characteristics which involves deriving closed-form analytic expressions mapping sets of filter characteristics to the original filter constants by making sharp-filter approximations. This results in parameterizations for GEFs including mixed parameterizations based on simultaneous specification of magnitude-based characteristics (e.g. bandwidths) and phase-based characteristics (e.g. group delays) which enables designing sharply tuned filters without significant group delay and simultaneous control over frequency selectivity and synchronization which is important in designing filterbanks. Our design methods with direct control over characteristics may also be utilized for higher-order variable bandpass filter design and may be useful for characteristics-based adaptive filtering. Our methods are inherently stable, highly accurate in meeting strict specifications on desired characteristics, and computationally efficient. The methods extend to the design of related bandpass, multiband filters, and filterbanks.</description>
