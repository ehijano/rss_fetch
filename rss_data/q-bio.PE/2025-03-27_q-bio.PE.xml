      <title>The importance of exploration: Modelling site-constant foraging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foraging site constancy, or repeated return to the same foraging location, is a foraging strategy used by many species to decrease uncertainty, but it is often unclear exactly how the foraging site is identified. Here we focus on the context where food harvesting is first preceded by a separate exploration period. Foraging then consists of three distinct steps: (1) exploration of the landscape (site-generation), (2) selection of a foraging site (site-selection), and (3) exploitation (harvesting) through repeated trips between the foraging site and "home base". This type of foraging has received scant attention by modellers, leading to two main knowledge gaps. First, little is known about how organisms implement steps (1) and (2). Second, it is not known how the choice of implementation method affects the outcomes of step (3). We investigate these two gaps using an agent-based model, with bumble bees as our model organism, foraging in a patchy resource landscape of crop, wildflower, and empty cells. We tested two different site-generation methods (random and circular foray exploration behaviour) and four different site-selection methods (random and optimizing based on distance from the nest, local wildflower density, or net rate of energy return) on a variety of outcomes from the site-constant harvesting step. We find that site-selection method has a high impact on crop pollination services as well as the percent of crop resources collected, while site-generation method has a high impact on the percent of time spent harvesting and the total trip time. We also find that some of the patterns we identify can be used to infer how a given real organism is identifying a foraging site. Our results underscore the importance of explicitly considering exploratory behaviour to better understand the ecological consequences of foraging dynamics.</description>

      <title>Compactifications of phylogenetic systems and electrical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03431v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a graphical map: a visual and numerical correspondence between circular electrical networks and circular planar split systems. When restricted to the \emph{planar} circular electrical case, this graphical map finds the split system uniquely associated with the Kalmanson resistance distance of the dual network, matching the induced split system familiar from phylogenetics. This correspondence is extended to compactifications of the respective spaces, taking cactus networks to the cactus split systems defined herein. The graphical map preserves both network components and cactus structure, allowing an elegant enumeration of induced phylogenetic split systems. We introduce the global spaces of circular planar electrical networks and circular split systems. These are CW complexes, and the 0-cells of each are counted by the Bell numbers as opposed to the Catalan numbers.</description>
