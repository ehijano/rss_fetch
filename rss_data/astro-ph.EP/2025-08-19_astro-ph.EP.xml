      <title>Earth-Mass Planets in Tandem Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new terrestrial planet formation theory demonstrating that Earth-mass planets form naturally in tandem protosolar disks. Our model builds upon tandem planet formation theory (Ebisuzaki and Imaeda 2017; Imaeda and Ebisuzaki 2017a,b, 2018), incorporating magneto-rotational instability (MRI) suppression (Balbus and Hawley 1991; Hawley and Balbus 1991), porous particle aggregation (Okuzumi et al. 2012; Kataoka et al. 2013), and standard planet formation mechanisms (e.g., Safronov 1969; Hayashi et al. 1985). In a tandem proto-solar disk, planets form at two distinct locations: the inner and outer edges of the MRI-suppressed region, where solid particles accumulate. The inner edge produces rocky planets, while the outer edge forms gas giants. When planetesimals reach Earth-sized mass at the inner MRI edge, they migrate outward due to gas disk torque. For a protosolar disk accretion rate of M_dot = 10^-7.08 solar masses per year (Case D), the total solid mass at the inner MRI edge reaches 1.99 Earth masses, producing two Earth-mass planets. This result closely matches the solar system's terrestrial planet distribution (Earth and Venus), which comprises 92% of total terrestrial planet mass, providing strong support for our formation mechanism.</description>

      <title>On the Ordering of Exoplanet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of planetary radii ordering within multi-planet systems, namely their ordinal position with respect to their size in a given system, utilizing data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. In addition, we consider not only the ordinal positions but also the specific period ratios and radius ratios of planetary pairs in multi-planet systems. We explore various dependencies on stellar host type and metallicity, as well as planetary types, and explore the differences between planetary systems with different planet multiplicities and different planetary pairs in the same system. Focusing on Kepler systems with two to four planets, we account for observational biases and uncover a robust trend of smaller inner planets. This trend is particularly pronounced in inner pairs of three-planet systems and exhibits variations in stellar metallicity and planet multiplicity. Notably, we find that the distribution of inner-to-outer planet radii ratios depends on the system's metallicity, suggesting a link between initial conditions and the resulting system architecture. Interestingly, planet pairs in resonance do not exhibit significantly different size ratios compared to non-resonant pairs, challenging current theoretical expectations, again, possibly suggesting that initially resonant systems could have been later destabilized. Our findings align with planet formation and migration models where larger planets form farther out and migrate inward. Importantly, we emphasize the significance of planet ordering as a novel and crucial observable for constraining planet formation and evolution models. The observed patterns offer unique insights into the complex interplay of formation, migration, and dynamical interactions shaping planetary systems.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive spectroscopic reference of the solar system and its application to exoplanet direct imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calibrated database of reflectance spectra for the solar system planets (i.e., Mercury, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune) and for Titan, spanning from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. We considered data collected over 60 years of planetary observations, employing a broad range of geometries and facilities (spacecraft and ground-based observatories). To correct for differences in observational geometries and data quality, we adopted a two-step calibration process that standardized each spectrum to the planet's geometric albedo values and corrected for planetary heterogeneity and calibration effects. The calibrated datasets were then combined across wavelengths, leading to a reference composite reflectance spectrum for each planet. As a test of this spectral library for exoplanetary research, we simulated direct imaging observations of the Proxima Centauri and HD 219134 systems as solar system analogs, as well as the solar system at a distance of 10 parsecs. We also explored the detection limitations of direct imaging instruments imposed by the inner and outer working angles for Earth and Jupiter-like exoplanets as a function of system distance. Additionally, we used the visible light portion of the results to produce realistic color reconstructions of each planet. Standardizing reflectance spectra in this work improves our baseline for interpreting new reflected light observations of exoplanets through comparative planetology. This spectral library can then serve as a calibrated and validated reference in the modeling and preparation for the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres with future direct imaging missions and for astronomical studies of the solar system.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a multi-planetary system orbiting the aged Sun-like star HD 224018</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2016, Kepler/K2 detected a system of two sub-Neptunes transiting the star HD 224018, one of them showing a mono-transit event. In 2017, we began a spectroscopic follow-up with HARPS-N to measure the dynamical masses of the planets using radial velocities, and collected additional transit observations using CHEOPS. We measured the fundamental physical parameters of the host star, which is an ``old Sun'' analogue. We analysed radial velocities and photometric time series, also including data by TESS, to provide precise ephemerides, radii, masses, and bulk densities of the two planets, and possibly modeling their internal structure and composition. The system turned out to be more crowded than shown by K2. Radial velocities revealed the presence of two additional bodies: a candidate cold companion on an eccentric orbit with a minimum mass nearly half that of Jupiter (eccentricity $0.60^{+0.07}_{-0.08}$; semi-major axis 8.6$^{+1.5}_{-1.6}$ au), and an innermost super-Earth (orbital period 10.6413$\pm$0.0028 d; mass 4.1$\pm$0.8 Me) for which we discovered previously undetected transit events in K2 photometry. TESS revealed a second transit of one of the two companions originally observed by K2. This allowed us to constrain its orbital period to a grid of values, the most likely being $\sim$138 days, which would imply a mass less than 9 Me, at a 3$\sigma$ significance level. Given the level of precision of our measurements, we were able to constrain the internal structure and composition of the second-most distant planet from the host star, a warm sub-Neptune with a bulk density of 3.9$\pm$0.5 g/cm$^{3}$. HD 224018 hosts three close-in transiting planets in the super-Earth-to-sub-Neptune regime, and a candidate cold and eccentric massive companion. Additional follow-up is needed to better characterise the physical properties of the planets and their architecture.</description>

      <title>Spatial variability of CH4 and C2H2 absorptions in Jupiter's auroral regions from Juno-UVS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color ratios derived from molecular hydrogen emissions provide valuable diagnostics for the energy of precipitating electrons and the structure of the auroral atmosphere. We aim to characterize the horizontal and vertical variability of hydrocarbon absorption in Jupiter's auroral atmosphere using ultraviolet data from the Juno-UVS spectrograph and to investigate potential departures from the expected structure. We constructed color ratio maps sensitive to CH$_4$ and C$_2$H$_2$ absorptions for perijoves (PJs) 6 and 10, two of Juno's close approaches to Jupiter, by integrating auroral H$_2$ emission over hydrocarbon-sensitive spectral intervals. For CH$_4$, we redefined the absorbed spectral band, replacing the traditionally used 125-130 nm interval with 135-140 nm, in order to mitigate higher-order calibration issues. In regions of intense auroral brightness, we developed a correction method to account for spectral distortion due to detector non-linearities at high fluxes. CH$_4$ and C$_2$H$_2$ absorptions generally follow the expected vertical distribution, with the CH$_4$ density extending to higher altitudes than C$_2$H$_2$. However, several localized regions show unexpected spatial distribution of the absorption. In PJ6, such anomalies are attributed to instrumental non-linearities. After correction, the CR distributions become consistent with standard hydrocarbon vertical distributions. In PJ10, however, some anomalous patterns persist despite correction. Spectral modeling indicates that these can be explained by modifying the relative abundances of CH$_4$ and C$_2$H$_2$, suggesting horizontal compositional variability and possible deviations in homopause altitude between species. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for local atmospheric composition when interpreting ultraviolet auroral spectra and retrieving electron energy distributions.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Impact-induced seismic shaking on asteroid (25143) Itokawa to address its resurfacing process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface of asteroid (25143) Itokawa shows both fresh and mature terrains, despite its short space weathering timescale of approximately 1000 years, as inferred from recent studies. Seismic shaking triggered by the impact that formed the 8-meter Kamoi crater has been proposed as a possible explanation for the diversity. This study aims to examine whether the seismic shaking induced by the impact could account for the observed spatial variations in space weathering and further constrain the internal structure of Itokawa. Assuming that the Kamoi crater was formed by a recent impact, we conducted three-dimensional seismic wave propagation simulations and applied a simplified landslide model to estimate surface accelerations and boulder displacements. Our results show that even a low-energy case (1 % of the nominal seismic energy) produces surface accelerations sufficient to destabilize the surface materials. The simulated boulder displacements are consistent with the observed distribution of space weathering degrees even on the opposite hemisphere. We estimate the seismic diffusivity to be 1000-2000 m2 s-1 and the seismic efficiency to be in the range of 5.0 x 10-8 to 5.0 x 10-7, implying that Itokawa's interior contains blocks tens of meters across and acts as a strongly scattering medium.</description>

      <title>Detecting False Positives With Derived Planetary Parameters: Experimenting with the KEPLER Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in computational power and machine learning techniques motivate their use in many different astrophysical research areas. Consequently, many machine learning models have been trained to classify exoplanet transit signals - typically done by using time series light curves. In this work, we attempt a different approach and try to improve the efficiency of these algorithms by fitting only derived planetary parameters, instead of full time-series light curves. We investigate and evaluate 4 models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Convolutional Neural Networks) on the KEPLER dataset, using precision-recall trade-off and accuracy metrics. We show that this approach can identify up to about 90% of false positives, implying the planetary parameters encompass most of the relevant information contained in a light curve. Random Forest and Convolutional Neural Networks produce the highest accuracy and the best precision-recall trade-off. We also note that the accuracies as a function of the stellar eclipse flag SS have the best performance.</description>

      <title>A Near-Infrared Spectral Library of Very Young Brown Dwarfs and Planetary-Mass Objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Age-benchmark brown dwarfs' and planetary-mass objects' spectroscopy is key to characterize substellar evolution. In this paper we present the JHK medium resolution (R~3000) spectra of 25 7-75 M_Jup (spectral types L3.0-M6.0) brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster obtained with MOSFIRE installed at the W. M. Keck I telescope. We obtained the spectral types of the targets in our sample using template brown dwarf and planetary-mass objects' spectra. We confirmed their extreme youth (&lt;5 Myr) and membership to the cluster using spectral indices, and the diversity of their spectra even for targets with similar spectral types. Six of our targets presented Pa-beta and Bra-gamma emission lines, suggesting the existence of accreting protoplanetary disks to objects with masses as low as 7 M_Jup. After analyzing the emission lines of those objects, and measuring their accretion rates, we compared them to those of stars, brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects, confirming that planetary-mass young objects deplete their disks quickly at young ages. Finally, we illustrate the spectral evolution of a 7-10 M_Jup planetary-mass object through its life from 1-3 Myr to 200 Myr old using one of our latest spectra type targets, and other targets from the literature with older age, but similar estimated masses. The spectra are publicly available for the community's use as data behind the figures.</description>

      <title>Transition metal abundance as a key parameter for the search of Life in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03748v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for Life in the Universe generally assumes three basic life's needs: I) building block elements (i.e., CHNOPS), II) a solvent to life's reactions (generally, liquid water) and III) a thermodynamic disequilibrium. It is assumed that similar requirements might be universal in the Cosmos. On our planet, life is able to harvest energy from a wide array of thermodynamic disequilibria, generally in the form of redox disequilibrium. The amount of different redox couples used by living systems has been estimated to be in the range of several thousands of reactions. Each of these energy yielding reactions requires specialised proteins called oxidoreductases, that have one or more metal cofactors acting as catalytic centres to exchange electrons. These metals are de facto the key component of the engines that life uses to tap into the thermodynamic disequilibria needed to fuel metabolism. The availability of these transition metals is not uniform in the Universe, and it is a function of the distribution (in time and space) of complex dynamics. Despite this, Life's need for specific metals to access thermodynamic disequilibria has been so far completely overlooked in identifying astrobiological targets. We argue that the availability of at least some transition elements appears to be an essential feature of habitability, and should be considered a primary requisite in selecting exoplanetary targets in the search for life.</description>

      <title>Discrete element simulations of self-gravitating rubble pile collisions: the effects of non-uniform particle size and rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel implementation of a soft sphere, discrete elements code to simulate the dynamics of self-gravitating granular materials. The code is used to study the outcome of sub-sonic collisions between self-gravitating rubble piles with masses ranging from $\sim6\times10^{21}$ to $\sim6\times10^{22}$ g. These masses are representative of asteroids and planetesimals in the $\sim100$~km range. We simulate rubble piles composed of a range of particle sizes and analyze the collisions outcome focusing on the properties of the largest surviving fragment. We successfully test and validate the code against previous results. The results of our study show that rubble piles formed by collision of two parent rubble piles do not maintain the same particle size distribution as their parents. Rubble piles formed in low velocity collisions are characterized by a larger fraction of large particles, while the largest fragments of high-velocity collisions show a significant decrease in their mean particle size. We ascribe this effect to the fact that large particles transmit most of the forces during the collisions. In addition, we find that the mass of the largest post-collision fragment does depend on the rotation of the colliding rubble piles. This effect is especially noticeable when the pre-collision spin axes are parallel with each other and perpendicular to the relative velocity. This finding can be particularly relevant for meter to kilometer sized bodies embedded in protostellar accretion disks, where viscous stresses can efficiently align the target and projectile spin axes.</description>

      <title>Spectral trends across the rings and inner moons of Uranus and Neptune from JWST NIRCam images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST NIRCam images provide low-resolution spectra of the rings and inner moons orbiting Uranus and Neptune. These data reveal systematic variations in spectral parameters like the strength of the strong OH absorption band around 3 microns and the spectral slopes at continuum wavelengths. Neptune's rings show an extremely weak 3-micron band, which is likely due to the small particle sizes in these dusty rings. Neptune's small inner moons also have weaker 3-micron bands and redder continua than Uranus' small inner moons, indicating that Neptune's moons have a lower water-ice fraction. There are also clear spectral trends across the inner Uranian system. The strength of the 3-micron band clearly increases with distance from Uranus, with the rings having a noticeably weaker 3-micron band than most of the small inner moons, which have a weaker 3-micron band than the larger moons like Miranda. While the rings and most of the small moons have neutral spectra between 1.4 microns and 2.1 microns, the outermost small moon Mab exhibits a blue spectral slope comparable to Miranda, indicating that Mab's surface may also be relatively water-ice rich. The next moon interior to Mab, Puck, exhibits a stronger 3-micron band and bluer continuum slope than any of the moons orbiting interior to it, perhaps indicating that it is being covered by water-ice-rich material derived from Mab via the mu ring. Finally, the small moon Rosalind has a redder spectral slope than its neighbors, possibly due to being coated with material from the dusty nu ring.</description>

      <title>Gravity-sensitive Spectral Indices in Ultracool Dwarfs: Investigating Correlations with Metallicity and Planet Occurrence using SpeX and FIRE Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a near-infrared spectroscopic analysis (0.9--2.4~$\mu$m) of gravity indices for 56 ultracool dwarfs (M5.5--L0), including exoplanet hosts SPECULOOS-2, SPECULOOS-3, and LHS 3154, with 59 spectra from SpeX and FIRE and literature data for TRAPPIST-1. Using gravity-sensitive spectral features (FeH at 0.99, 1.20, and 1.55~$\mu$m; VO at 1.06~$\mu$m; the H-band continuum; KI at 1.17 and 1.25$\mu$m), we investigate links between gravity classification, metallicity, and planet occurrence. All four planet hosts show intermediate-gravity signatures despite field-age indicators. A volume-corrected logistic regression finds no significant association between gravity class and planet occurrence. Among individual indices, FeH_z (0.99~$\mu$m) is the most promising tracer of planet-hosting status, with a tentative $2\sigma$ correlation that may reflect observational biases. More robustly, FeH_z shows a $3.3\sigma$ anti-correlation with [Fe/H]. A Kruskal--Wallis test finds no metallicity difference across gravity classes, suggesting the FeH_z--[Fe/H] trend is not due to bulk metallicity. We propose this relation reflects the interplay of age, gravity, and composition, with higher-metallicity objects being systematically younger and lower-gravity, reducing FeH absorption. While only hinting at a connection between gravity-sensitive features and planet occurrence among late-M dwarfs, these results highlight the need for caution when using spectral diagnostics to interpret ultracool dwarf planet hosts.</description>
