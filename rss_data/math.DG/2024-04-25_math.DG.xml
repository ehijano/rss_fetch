      <title>Boundary determination and local rigidity of analytic metrics in the Lorentzian scattering rigidity problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scattering rigidity problem in Lorentzian geometry: recovery of a Lorentzian metric from the scattering relation known on a lateral timelike boundary. We show that one can recover the jet of the metric up to a gauge transformation near a lightlike strictly convex point. Assuming that the metric is real analytic, we show that one can recover the metric up to a gauge transformation as well near such a point.</description>

      <title>Spectral Gap Estimates on Conformally Flat Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental gap is the difference between the first two Dirichlet eigenvalues of a Schr\"odinger operator (and the Laplacian, in particular). For horoconvex domains in hyperbolic space, Nguyen, Stancu and Wei conjectured that it is possible to obtain a lower bound on the fundamental gap in terms of the diameter of the domain and the dimension [IMRN2022]. In this article, we prove this conjecture by establishing conformal log-concavity estimates for the first eigenfunction. This builds off earlier work by the authors and Saha as well as recent work by Cho, Wei and Yang. We also prove spectral gap estimates for a more general class of problems on conformally flat manifolds and investigate the relationship between the gap and the inradius. For example, we establish gap estimates for domains in $\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^{N-1}$ which are convex with respect to the universal affine cover</description>

      <title>Anisotropic conformal change of conic pseudo-Finsler surfaces, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work is devoted to investigate anisotropic conformal transformation of conic pseudo-Finsler surfaces $(M,F)$, that is, $ F(x,y)\longmapsto \overline{F}(x,y)=e^{\phi(x,y)}F(x,y)$, where the function $\phi(x,y)$ depends on both position $x$ and direction $y$, contrary to the ordinary (isotropic) conformal transformation which depends on position only. If $F$ is a pseudo-Finsler metric, the above transformation does not yield necessarily a pseudo-Finsler metric. Consequently, we find out necessary and sufficient condition for a (conic) pseudo-Finsler surface $(M,F)$ to be transformed to a (conic) pseudo-Finsler surface $(M,\overline{F})$ under the transformation $\overline{F}=e^{\phi(x,y)}F$. In general dimension, it is extremely difficult to find the anisotropic conformal change of the inverse metric tensor in a tensorial form. However, by using the modified Berwald frame on a Finsler surface, we obtain the change of the components of the inverse metric tensor in a tensorial form. This progress enables us to study the transformation of the Finslerian geometric objects and the geometric properties associated with the transformed Finsler function $\overline{F}$. In contrast to isotropic conformal transformation, we have a non-homothetic conformal factor $\phi(x,y)$ that preserves the geodesic spray. Also, we find out some invariant geometric objects under the anisotropic conformal change. Furthermore, we investigate a sufficient condition for $\overline{F}$ to be dually flat or/and projectively flat. Finally, we study some special cases of the conformal factor $\phi(x,y)$. Various examples are provided whenever the situation needs.</description>

      <title>4-dimensional Space forms as determined by the volumes of small geodesic balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gray-Vanhecke conjectured that the volumes of small geodesic balls could determine if the manifold is a space form, and provided a proof for the compact 4-dimensional manifold, and some cases. In this paper, similar results for the 4-dimensional case are obtained, based upon tensor calculus and classical theorems rather than the topological characterizations in [6].</description>

      <title>The homogeneous generalized Ricci flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework inspired by Lauret's "bracket flow" to study the generalized Ricci flow, as introduced by Streets, on discrete quotients of Lie groups. As a first application, we establish global existence on solvmanifolds in arbitrary dimensions, a result which is new even for the pluriclosed flow. We also define a notion of generalized Ricci soliton on exact Courant algebroids that is geometrically meaningful and allows for non-trivial expanding examples. On nilmanifolds, we show that these solitons arise as rescaled limits of the generalized Ricci flow, provided the initial metrics have "harmonic torsion", and we classify them in low dimensions. Finally, we provide a new formula for the generalized Ricci curvature of invariant generalized metrics in terms of a moment map for the action of a non-reductive real Lie group.</description>

      <title>Curvature, diameter and signs of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a Li-Yau type eigenvalue-diameter estimate for signed graphs. That is, the nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian of a non-negatively curved signed graph are lower bounded by $1/D^2$ up to a constant, where $D$ stands for the diameter. This leads to several interesting applications, including a volume estimate for non-negatively curved signed graphs in terms of frustration index and diameter, and a two-sided Li-Yau estimate for triangle-free graphs. Our proof is built upon a combination of Chung-Lin-Yau type gradient estimate and a new trick involving strong nodal domain walks of signed graphs. We further discuss extensions of part of our results to nonlinear Laplacians on signed graphs.</description>

      <title>Differential equations on a $k$-dimensional torus: Poincar\'e type results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equations of the first order on the torus have been investigated in detail by H. Poincar\'e, P. Bohl and A. Denjoy. P. Bohl, back in 1916, emphasised the importance of the transfer of the results for the order $k=1$ to the case $k&gt;1$, adding at the same time: "However, any attempt to do so would be hopeless". The following more than hundred years have only confirmed Bohl's forecast. It became clear that a new approach to this problem is needed.
  In this paper, we propose a new (non-Hamiltonian) and promising approach. We use Hamiltonians, that is, ordinary differential systems of equations of the first order, only for heuristics. In the main scheme and corresponding proofs we do not use these systems. Instead of differential systems, we study sets of continuous vector functions $\phi(t,\eta)$ satisfying certain important conditions. Limit sets and left and right rotation vectors appear in the case $k&gt;1$. Some of our results are new even in the case $k=1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we consider two related problems, i.e. the description of geodesics and the calculation of the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a flag manifold. We show that there exists a family of invariant metrics such that both problems can be solved simply and explicitly. In order to determine the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, we construct natural, finite-dimensional approximations (of spin chain type) to the Hilbert space of functions on a flag manifold.</description>

Abstract: We show that the algebraic intersection form of hyperbolic surfaces of genus $g$ has a minimum in the moduli space and that the minimum grows in the order $(\log g)^{-2}$ in terms of the genus. We also describe the asymptotic behavior of the algebraic intersection form in the moduli space as the homologically systolic length goes to zero.</description>

      <title>Smoothability of $L^p$-connections on bundles and isometric immersions with $W^{2,p}$-regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.13560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are concerned with two interrelated problems: smoothability of connection 1-forms with low regularity on bundles with prescribed smooth curvature 2-forms, and existence of isometric immersions with low regularity. We first show that if $\Omega$ is an $L^p$-connection $1$-form on a vector bundle over a closed Riemannian $n$-manifold $\mathcal{M}$ with small $L^p$-norm ($p&gt;n$) and smooth curvature $2$-form $\mathscr{F}$, then $\Omega$ can be approximated in the $L^p_{\rm loc}$-topology by smooth connections of the same curvature (not necessarily gauge equivalent). Our proof, adapted from S. Mardare's work on the fundamental theory of surfaces with $L^p$-second fundamental form, is elementary in nature and uses only Hodge decomposition and fixed point theorems. This result is then applied to the study of isometric immersions of Riemannian manifolds with low regularity. We revisit the proof for the existence of $W^{2,p}$-isometric immersion $\mathcal{M}^n \to \mathbf{R}^{n+k}$ with arbitrary $n$ and $k$ given weak solutions to the Gauss--Codazzi--Ricci equations, aiming at elucidating some global vs. local issues, and also we provide a characterisation for metrics on $\mathcal{M}$ that admit $W^{2,p}$- but no $C^\infty$-isometric immersions.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Almost-Complex Curves in $\hat{\mathbb{S}}^{2,4}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For solutions to the $\mathfrak{g}_2$ affine Toda field equations in $\mathbb{C}$ with respect to \emph{polynomial} holomorphic sextic differential $q$, we study the associated almost-complex curves $\nu_q: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \hat{\mathbb{S}}^{2,4}$. The asymptotic boundary $\Delta := \partial_{\infty}(\nu_q)$ of $\nu_q$ is found to be a polygon in $\mathsf{Ein}^{2,3}$ with $\mathsf{deg} q + 6$ vertices. The polygon $\Delta$ satisfies an \emph{annihilator property}, which is related to a $\mathsf{G}_2'$-invariant discrete metric $d_3: \mathsf{Ein}^{2,3} \times \mathsf{Ein}^{2,3} \rightarrow \{0,1,2,3\}$ on $\mathsf{Ein}^{2,3}$. In fact, we show $\mathsf{G}_2' = \mathsf{Isom}(d_3) \cap \mathsf{Diff}(\mathsf{Ein}^{2,3})$. The asymptotic boundary defines a map $\alpha: \mathsf{MS}_{k} \rightarrow \mathsf{MP}_{k+6}$ between the equidimensional moduli spaces of holomorphic polynomial sextic differentials of degree $k$ and of annihilator polygons with $k+6$ vertices and is conjectured to be a homeomorphism onto its image. We also discuss the relationship between $\nu_q$ and a related minimal surface $f_q: \mathbb{C} \rightarrow \mathsf{G}_2'/K$ in the symmetric space $\mathsf{G}_2'/K$, showing how to realize their mutual harmonic lift to $\mathsf{G}_2'/T$ geometrically. Before beginning the geometry, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a complete (real) solution to the $\mathfrak{g}_2$ affine Toda field equations in $\mathbb{C}$ associated to polynomial $q \in H^0(\mathcal{K}_\mathbb{C}^6)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.06917v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General canonical bundle formula due to Kawamata and others has played fundamental roles in algebraic geometry. We show that the canonical bundle formula has analytic characterization in terms of fiberwise integration, which confirms a folklore conjecture. The proof uses $L^2$ metrics and the valuative equivalence of plurisubharmonic singularities. As an application, we identify the singularity of the Ohsawa measure from a general $L^2$ extension theorem of Demailly for log canonical pairs, in terms of the singularity in Kawamata's subadjunction. As another application, we give a partial answer to a question of Berndtsson on semipositivity theorems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Lagrangian correspondences between Hilbert spaces. A main focus is the question when the composition of two Lagrangian correspondences is again Lagrangian. Our answer leads in particular to a well-defined composition law in a category of Lagrangian correspondences respecting given polarizations of the Hilbert spaces involved. As an application, we construct a functorial field theory on geometric spin manifolds with values in this category of Lagrangian correspondences, which can be viewed as a formal Wick rotation of the theory associated to a free fermionic particle in a curved spacetime.</description>
