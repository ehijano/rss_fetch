      <title>Localizing synergies of hidden factors across complex systems: resting brain networks and HeLa gene expression profile as case studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09053</link>

Abstract: Factor analysis is a well-known statistical method to describe the variability of observed variables in terms of a smaller number of unobserved latent variables called factors. Even though latent factors are conceptually independent of each other, their influence on the observed variables is often joint and synergistic. We propose to quantify the synergy of the joint influence of factors on the observed variables using the O-information, a recently introduced metrics to assess high order dependencies in complex systems, in a new framework where latent factors and observed variables are jointly analyzed in terms of their joint informational character. Two case studies are reported: analyzing resting fMRI data, we find that DMN and FP networks show the highest synergy, consistently with their crucial role in higher cognitive functions; concerning HeLa cells, we find that the most synergistic gene is STK-12 (AURKB), suggesting that this gene is involved in controlling the HeLa cell cycle. We believe that this approach, representing a bridge between factor analysis and the field of high-order interactions, will find wide application across several domains.</description>

      <title>MetaInfoSci: An Integrated Web Tool for Scholarly Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential increase in academic publications has made it increasingly difficult for researchers to remain up to date and systematically synthesize knowledge scattered across vast and fragmented research domains. Literature reviews, particularly those supported by bibliometric methods, have become essential in organizing prior findings and guiding future research directions. While numerous tools exist for bibliometric analysis and network science, there is currently no single platform that integrates the full range of features from both domains. Researchers are often required to navigate multiple software environments, many of which lack customizable visualizations, cross-database integration, and AI-assisted result summarization. Addressing these limitations, this study introduces MetaInfoSci at www.metainfosci.com, a comprehensive, web-based platform designed to unify bibliometric, scientometric, and network analytical capabilities. The platform supports tailored query design, merges data from diverse sources, enables rich and adaptable visual outputs, and provides automated, AI-driven summaries of analytical results. This integrated approach aims to enhance the accessibility, efficiency, and depth of scientific literature analysis for scholars across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Observation of a low energy nuclear recoil peak in the neutron calibration data of an Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ crystal in CRESST-III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current generation of cryogenic solid state detectors used in direct dark matter and CE\textnu NS searches typically reach energy thresholds of $\mathcal{O}$(10)$\,$eV for nuclear recoils. For a reliable calibration in this energy regime a method has been proposed, providing mono-energetic nuclear recoils at low energies $\sim\,$100$\,$eV$\,$-$\,$1$\,$keV. In this work we report on the observation of a peak at (1113.6$^{+6.5}_{-6.5}$)$\,$eV in the data of an Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ crystal in CRESST-III, which was irradiated with neutrons from an AmBe calibration source. We attribute this mono-energetic peak to the radiative capture of thermal neutrons on $^{27}$Al and the subsequent de-excitation via single $\gamma$-emission. We compare the measured results with the outcome of Geant4 simulations and investigate the possibility to make use of this effect for the energy calibration of Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ detectors at low energies. We further investigate the possibility of a shift in the expected energy scale of this effect caused by the creation of defects in the target crystal.</description>

      <title>Simulation-trained conditional normalizing flows for likelihood approximation: a case study in stress regulation kinetics in yeast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-inspired inference often hinges on the ability to construct a likelihood, or the probability of observing a sequence of data given a model. These likelihoods can be directly maximized for parameter estimation, incorporated into Bayesian frameworks, or even used as loss functions in neural networks. Yet, many models, despite being conceptually simple, lack tractable likelihoods. A notable example arises in estimating protein production from snapshot measurements of actively dividing cells. Here, the challenge stems from cell divisions occurring at non-Exponentially distributed intervals with each division stochastically partitioning protein content between daughter cells, making protein counts in any given cell a function of its full division history. Such history dependence precludes a straightforward likelihood based on a (standard Markovian) master equation. Instead, we employ conditional normalizing flows (a class of neural network models designed to learn probability distributions) to approximate otherwise intractable likelihoods from simulated data. As a case study, we examine activation of the \emph{glc3} gene in yeast involved in glycogen synthesis and expressed under nutrient-limiting conditions. We monitor this activity using snapshot fluorescence measurements via flow cytometry, where GFP expression reflects \emph{glc3} promoter activity. A na\"ive analysis of flow cytometry data ignoring cell division suggests many cells are active with low expression. However, fluorescent proteins persist and can be inherited, so cells may appear active from retaining ancestral fluorescence. Explicitly accounting for the (non-Markovian) effects of cell division reveals \emph{glc3} is mostly inactive under stress, showing that while cells occasionally activate it, expression is brief and transient.</description>

      <title>Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17942v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Open Superclusters II. Discovery of an Inactive Supercluster Including a New Star Cluster in the Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13727v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The number of known star clusters, associations, and moving groups in the vicinity of the Sun has increased significantly due to the use of Gaia data. We investigated the existence and properties of open superclusters (OSC) within 500 pc of the Sun, with a particular focus on a newly identified OSC, designated HC8. Using advanced Gaia-derived astrometric data and star cluster catalogs, we identify and analyze member stars of various clusters, deriving key parameters such as ages, distances, extinctions, and kinematic properties. Our findings reveal that HC8, a previously unrecognized OSC, encompasses several young clusters, including the newly discovered cluster Duvia 1. We provide a detailed examination of HC8's star formation history and its spatial and kinematic characteristics. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the existence of highly populated primordial groups and enhances our understanding of the formation and evolution of star clusters in the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>DeepExtractor: Time-domain reconstruction of signals and glitches in gravitational wave data with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA, detect faint signals from distant astrophysical events. However, their high sensitivity also makes them susceptible to background noise, which can obscure these signals. This noise often includes transient artifacts called 'glitches', that can mimic genuine astrophysical signals or mask their true characteristics. In this study, we present DeepExtractor, a deep learning framework that is designed to reconstruct signals and glitches with power exceeding interferometer noise, regardless of their source. We design DeepExtractor to model the inherent noise distribution of GW detectors, following conventional assumptions that the noise is Gaussian and stationary over short time scales. It operates by predicting and subtracting the noise component of the data, retaining only the clean reconstruction of signal or glitch. We focus on applications related to glitches and validate DeepExtractor's effectiveness through three experiments: (1) reconstructing simulated glitches injected into simulated detector noise, (2) comparing its performance with the state-of-the-art BayesWave algorithm, and (3) analyzing real data from the Gravity Spy dataset to demonstrate effective glitch subtraction from LIGO strain data. We further demonstrate its potential by reconstructing three real GW events from LIGO's third observing run, without being trained on GW waveforms. Our proposed model achieves a median mismatch of only 0.9% for simulated glitches, outperforming several deep learning baselines. Additionally, DeepExtractor surpasses BayesWave in glitch recovery, offering a dramatic computational speedup by reconstructing one glitch sample in approximately 0.1 seconds on a CPU, compared to BayesWave's processing time of approximately one hour per glitch.</description>

      <title>Modern approach to muonic x-ray spectroscopy demonstrated through the measurement of stable Cl radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in muonic x-ray experiments have reinvigorated efforts in measurements of absolute nuclear charge radii. Here, a modern approach is presented, and demonstrated through determination of the charge radii of the two stable chlorine nuclides $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl. Knowledge of these radii has implications for fundamental studies in nuclear and atomic physics. For this purpose, a state-of-the-art experiment was performed at the $\pi$E1 beamline in the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland), using a large-scale HPGe detector array in order to extract precise energies of the muonic $^{35}$Cl and $^{37}$Cl $np1s$ transitions. The nuclear charge radius extraction relies on modern calculations for QED effects and nuclear polarization with rigorous uncertainty quantification, including effects that were not accounted for in older studies. Additionally, we established a new method for applying the nuclear shape correction directly from energy density functionals, which are amenable to isotopes for which no high-quality electron scattering experiments are available. The resulting charge radii are $3.3335(23) fm$ for $^{35}$Cl and $3.3445(23) fm$ for $^{37}$Cl, thus improving the uncertainty of the available electron scattering values by a factor of seven. The correlation of several observables was evaluated between the different isotopes in order to produce a more precise value of the differential mean square charge radius $\delta \langle r^2 \rangle^{37, 35}=+0.0771(66) fm^{2}$. In this case, improvement of the uncertainty by more than one order of magnitude was achieved compared to the literature value. This precision is sufficient to use this differential as input for isotope shift factor determination.</description>
