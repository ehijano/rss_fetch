      <title>Time-Varying Energy Landscapes and Temperature paths: Dynamic Transition Rates in locally Ultrametric Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the dynamics of complex systems with time-dependent transition rates, focusing on $p$-adic analysis in modeling such systems. Starting from the master equation that governs the stochastic dynamics of a system with a large number of interacting components, we generalize it by $p$-adically parametrizing the metabasins to account for hierarchically organized states within the energy landscape. This leads to a non-homogeneous Markov process described by a time-dependent operator acting on an ultrametric space. We prove the well-posedness of the initial value problem and analyze the stochastic nature of the master equation with time-dependent transition-operator. We demonstrate how ultrametricity simplifies the description of intra-metabasin dynamics without increasing computational complexity. We apply our theoretical framework to two scenarios: glass relaxation under rapid cooling and protein folding dynamics influenced by temperature variations. In the glass relaxation model, we observe anomalous relaxation behavior where the dynamics slows during cooling, with lasting effects depending on how drastic the temperature drop is. In the protein folding model, we incorporate temperature-dependent energy barriers and transition rates to simulate folding and unfolding processes across the melting temperature. Our results capture a "whiplash" effect: from an unfolded state, the system folds and then returns to an unfolded state (which may differ from the initial one) in response to temperature changes. This study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of $p$-adic parametrization and ultrametric analysis in modeling complex systems with dynamic transition rates, providing analytical solutions to relaxation processes in material and biological systems.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Self-Organization in Fixed-Magnetization Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical sorting is a fundamental task for programmable matter, inspired by the spontaneous formation of interfaces and membranes in nature. The task entails particles of different types, present in fixed densities, sorting into corresponding regions of a space that are themselves organized. By analyzing the Gibbs distribution of a general fixed-magnetization model of equilibrium statistical mechanics, we prove that particles moving stochastically according to local affinities solve the hierarchical sorting task. The analysis of fixed-magnetization models is notoriously difficult, and approaches that have led to recent breakthroughs in sampling the low-temperature regime only work in the variable-magnetization setting by default. To overcome this barrier, we introduce a new approach for comparing the partition functions of fixed- and variable-magnetization models. The core technique identifies a special class of configurations that contribute comparably to the two partition functions, which then serves as a bridge between the fixed- and variable-magnetization settings. Our main result is an estimate of the Gibbs distribution that unifies existing and new results for models at fixed magnetization, including the Ising, Potts, and Blume--Capel models, and leads to stochastic distributed algorithms for hierarchical sorting and other self-organizing tasks, like compression and separation.</description>

      <title>Fool's crowns, trumpets, and Schwarzian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Riemann surface with holes, we propose a variant of the action on a circum\-ference-$P$ boundary component with $n$ bordered cusps attached (a "fool's crown") that is decoration-invariant and generates finite volumes $V^{\text{crown}}_{n,P}$ of the corresponding moduli spaces when integrated against the volume form obtained by inverting the Fenchel--Nielsen (Goldman) Poisson brackets for a special set of decoration-invariant combinations of Penner's $\lambda$ lengths. In the limit as $n\to\infty$, the integrals transform into a functional integral with the measure given by the integral over $C^1$ of the action $A_1^{(0)}-\frac12 S[\psi,t]+\frac 12 (\psi')^2$. Here $A_1^{(0)}\sim \int \log \psi' \frac {dx}x$ is the disc amplitude, $S[\psi,t]$ is the Schwarzian, and the derivative $\psi'$ is related to the limiting density of orthogonal projections of bordered cusps to the hole perimeter. We derive the Fenchel--Nielsen symplectic form in the continuum limit and show that it coincides with the one obtained by Alekseev and Meinrenken. We also discuss the volumes of moduli spaces for a disc with $n$ bordered cusps.</description>

      <title>Generalized exchange operators for a system of spin-1 particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The irreps $(SU(2),{\cal H},U)$ of SU(2) of dimension $(2S+1)^N$, i.e. operators acting on the space ${\cal H}={\cal H}_N={\bf C}^{(2S+1)^N}$ of $N$ identical particles with spin $S$, are described by Clebsch-Gordan decomposition into inequivalent irreps. In the special case $S=1/2$, Dirac \cite{Dir1} discovered that there is another rep given by $({\cal S}(N),{\cal H},V)$ where ${\cal S}(N)$ is the permutation group, Thus, the standard ``linear'' Hamiltonian, or Heisenberg interaction Hamiltonian $H_0=\sum_{1\leq i\leq N}\vec S_i\cdot\vec S_j$, where $\vec \sigma_i=2\vec S_i$ is the vector of Pauli matrices, can be interpreted as the sum of the ``Exchange Operators'' $P_{ij}$ between particles $i$ and $j$. Schr\"odinger \cite{Sch} generalized to higher spin numbers $S$ the Exchange Operator $P_{ij}=P_S(\vec S_i\cdot \vec S_j)$ as a polynomial of degree $2S$ in $\vec S_i\cdot \vec S_j$. This we call the $P$-representation. There is another rep induced by the one particle permutation of states operators $\widetilde Q_\alpha$, which we call the $Q$-rep. Our main purpose is to write some physical Hamiltonians for a few particles in the $P$- or $Q$-rep and compute their spectrum. The simplest case where there are as many particles as available states for the spin operator along the $z$-axis, i.e. $N=2S+1=3$, see Weyl \cite{Wey} or Hamermesh \cite{Ham}. Finally, we consider the relationship between permutations and rotation invariance when $S=1/2$ and $S=1$.</description>

      <title>Large Scale Response of Gapless $1d$ and Quasi-$1d$ Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the transport properties of non-interacting, gapless one-dimensional quantum systems and of the edge modes of two-dimensional topological insulators, in the presence of time-dependent perturbations. We prove the validity of Kubo formula, in the zero temperature and infinite volume limit, for a class of perturbations that are weak and slowly varying in space and in time, in an Euler-like scaling. The proof relies on the representation of the real time Duhamel series in imaginary time, which allows to prove its convergence uniformly in the scaling parameter and in the size of system, at low temperatures. Furthermore, it allows to exploit a suitable cancellation for the scaling limit of the model, related to the emergent anomalous chiral gauge symmetry of relativistic one-dimensional fermions. The cancellation implies that, as the temperature and the scaling parameter are sent to zero, the linear response is the only contribution to the full response of the system. The explicit form of the leading contribution to the response function is determined by lattice conservation laws. In particular, the method allows to prove the quantization of the edge conductance of $2d$ quantum Hall systems from quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Energy transport in a free Euler-Bernoulli beam in terms of Schr\"odinger's wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger equation is not frequently used in the framework of the classical mechanics, though historically this equation was derived as a simplified equation, which is equivalent to the classical Germain-Lagrange dynamic plate equation. The question concerning the exact meaning of this equivalence is still discussed in modern literature. In this note, we consider the one-dimensional case, where the Germain-Lagrange equation reduces to the Euler-Bernoulli equation, which is used in the classical theory of a beam. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all solutions (i.e., wave functions ${\psi}$) of the 1D time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for a free particle with arbitrary complex initial data and the set of ordered pairs of quantities (the beam strain and the particle velocity), which characterize solutions $u$ of the beam equation with arbitrary real initial data. Thus, the dynamics of a free infinite Euler-Bernoulli beam can be described by the Schr\"odinger equation for a free particle and vice versa. Finally, we show that for two corresponding solutions $u$ and ${\psi}$ the mechanical energy density calculated for $u$ propagates in the beam exactly in the same way as the probability density calculated for ${\psi}$.</description>

As there are no further constraints, these systems are nondeterministic. In particular we examine trajectories with infinitely many collisions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the diffusive scaling of the Lorentz gas in the presence of an external force of mean-field type. In the weak coupling regime and for diffusive time scales, the test particle's law converges to the probability density satisfying the heat equation. The diffusion coefficient of the heat equation is given by the Green-Kubo relation.</description>

      <title>On the Kostant-Souriau prequantization of scalar fields with polysymplectic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I present a novel, purely differential geometric approach to the quantization of scalar fields, with a special focus on the familiar case of Minkowski spacetimes. This approach is based on using the natural geometric structures of polysymplectic Hamiltonian field theory to produce an analog of the Kostant-Souriau prequantization map familiar from geometric quantization. I show that while the resulting operators are quite different from those of canonical quantum field theory, the approach is nonetheless able to reproduce a few of canonical quantum field theory's most fundamental results. I finish by elaborating the current limitations of this approach and briefly discussing future prospects.</description>

Abstract: In this work, the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration, implying the existence of a maximal value for the Unruh temperature. We discuss this result for an electrodynamic model with maximal proper acceleration, showing that the maximal Unruh temperature must be of order $10^5\, K$ for current high acceleration gradient laser-plasma acceleration experiments.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, loss, and quantumness: When balanced beam splitters are best</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crux of quantum optics is using beam splitters to generate entanglement, including in pioneering experiments conducted by Hanbury-Brown and Twiss and Hong, Ou, and Mandel. This lies at the heart of what makes boson sampling hard to emulate by classical computers and is a vital component of quantum computation with light. Yet, despite overwhelming positive evidence, the conjecture that beam splitters with equal reflection and transmission probabilities generate the most entanglement for any state interfered with the vacuum has remained unproven for almost two decades [Asb\'oth et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{94}, 173602 (2005)]. We prove this conjecture for ubiquitous entanglement monotones by uncovering monotonicity, convexity, and entropic properties of states undergoing photon loss. Because beam splitters are so fundamental, our results yield numerous corollaries for quantum optics, from inequalities for quasiprobability distributions to proofs of a recent conjecture for the evolution of a measure of quantumness through loss. One can now definitively state: the more balanced a beam splitter, the more entanglement it can generate with the vacuum.</description>

      <title>Tutorial: Classifying Photonic Topology Using the Spectral Localizer and Numerical $K$-Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the spectral localizer framework has emerged as an efficient approach to classifying topology in photonic systems featuring local nonlinearities and radiative environments. In nonlinear systems, this framework provides rigorous definitions for concepts like topological solitons and topological dynamics, where a system's occupation induces a local change in its topology due to the nonlinearity. For systems embedded in radiative environments that do not possess a shared bulk spectral gap, this framework enables the identification of local topology and shows that local topological protection is preserved despite the lack of a common gap. However, as the spectral localizer framework is rooted in the mathematics of $C^*$-algebras, and not vector bundles, understanding and using this framework requires developing intuition for a somewhat different set of underlying concepts than those that appear in traditional approaches to classifying material topology. In this tutorial, we introduce the spectral localizer framework from a ground-up perspective, and provide physically motivated arguments for understanding its local topological markers and associated local measure of topological protection. In doing so, we provide numerous examples of the framework's application to a variety of topological classes, including crystalline and higher-order topology. We then show how Maxwell's equations can be reformulated to be compatible with the spectral localizer framework, including the possibility of radiative boundary conditions. To aid in this introduction, we also provide a physics-oriented introduction to multi-operator pseudospectral methods and numerical $K$-theory, two mathematical concepts that form the foundation for the spectral localizer framework.</description>

      <title>Gauge-Fixing Quantum Density Operators At Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide theory, algorithms, and simulations of non-equilibrium quantum systems using a one-dimensional (1D) completely-positive (CP), matrix-product (MP) density-operator ($\rho$) representation. By generalizing the matrix product state's orthogonality center, to additionally store positive classical mixture correlations, the MP$\rho$ factorization naturally emerges. In this work we analytically and numerically examine the virtual freedoms associated with the representation of quantum density operators. Using this augmented perspective, we simplify algorithms in certain limits to integrate the canonical form's master equation dynamics. This enables us to quickly evolve under the dynamics of two-body quantum channels without resorting to optimization-based methods. In addition to this technical advance, we also scale-up numerical examples and discuss implications for accurately modeling hardware architectures and predicting their performance. This includes an example of the quantum to classical transition of informationally leaky, i.e., decohering, qubits. In this setting, due to loss from environmental interactions, non-local complex coherence correlations are converted into local and incoherent classical statistical mixture correlations. Lastly, the representation of both global and local correlations is discussed. We expect this work to have applications in additional non-equilibrium settings beyond qubit engineering.</description>

      <title>The M-algebra completes the hierarchy of Super-Exceptional Tangent Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conjectured symmetries of M-theory famously involve (1.) brane-extended super-symmetry (the M-algebra) and (2.) exceptional duality-symmetry (the $\mathfrak{e}_{11}$-algebra); but little attention has been given to their inevitable combination.
  In this little note, we highlight (by combining results available in the literature) that the $local$ exceptional duality-symmetry (the hyperbolic involutary $\mathfrak{k}_{1,10} \subset \mathfrak{e}_{11}$) acts on the M-algebra, through the "brane-rotating symmetry" $\mathfrak{sl}_{32}$, in a way which extends the known hierarchy of finite-dimensional $n$-exceptional tangent spaces compatibly beyond the traditional bound of $n \leq 7$ all the way to $n = 11$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Center--Manifold for the Navier--Stokes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Center-manifold approximations for infinite-dimensional systems are treated in the context of the Navier--Stokes equations extended to include an equation for the parameter evolution. The consequences of system extension are non-trivial and are examined in detail. The extended system is reformulated via an isomorphic transformation, and the application of the center-manifold theorem to the reformulated system results in a finite set of center-manifold amplitude equations coupled with an infinite-dimensional graph equation for the stable subspace solution. General expressions for the asymptotic solution of the graph equation are then derived. The main benefit of such an approach is that the graph equation, and the subsequent asymptotic expressions are formally valid even when the system is perturbed slightly away from the bifurcation point. The derivation is then applied to two cases - the classic case of the Hopf bifurcation of the cylinder wake, and a case of flow in an open cavity which has interesting dynamical properties after bifurcation. Predictions of the angular frequencies of the reduced systems are in good agreement with those obtained for the full systems close to the bifurcation point. The Stuart-Landau equations for the two cases are also obtained. The presented methodology may easily be applied to other infinite-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Deeper understandings of the gauge theory for the first order inhomogeneous linear elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our previous study [1] has demonstrated that the gauge theory is a proper framework for characterizing the local temporal and spatial interactions in inhomogeneous elastic media. However, in that study temporal interactions were interpreted as the compensation for the loss of kinetic energy resulting from homogenization process, distinct from damping effects. In addition, that study did not account for the integration of temporal and spatial transformations, leading to the omission of some crucial information such as thermal stresses. In this paper, we address this oversight to establish generalized equations by employing a unified methodology that encompasses the integrated temporal-spatial transformations and the principle of minimum dissipation. Among many interesting new findings, we highlight that the newly derived equations are inherently consistent with the first and the second laws of thermodynamics, because this gauge theory naturally incorporates the fundamental mechanism that governs the partitioning between the dissipative and the non-dissipative energy.</description>

      <title>Ambient space and integration of the trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the ambient space construction, in which spacetime is mapped into a special lightcone of a higher dimensional manifold, to derive the integrable terms of the trace anomaly in even dimensions. We argue that the natural topological anomaly is the so-called $Q$-curvature, which, when projected from the ambient space, always comes with a Weyl covariant operator that should be adopted for the integration of the anomaly itself in the form of a nonlocal action. The use of the ambient space makes trasparent the fact that there are some new ambiguities in the integration of the anomaly, which we now understand geometrically from the ambient point of view. These ambiguities, which manifest themselves as undetermined parameters in the integrated nonlocal action, become more severe in dimensions $d\geq 6$ and do not seem to be related to a choice of the renormalization scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nozaki et.~al.\ gave a homotopy classification of the knotted defects of ordered media in three-dimensional space by considering continuous maps from complements of spatial graphs to the order parameter space modulo a certain equivalence relation. We extend their result by giving a classification scheme for ordered media in handlebodies, where defects are allowed to reach the boundary. Through monodromies around meridional loops, global defects are described in terms of planar diagrams whose edges are colored by elements of the fundamental group of the order parameter space. We exhibit examples of this classification in octahedral frame fields and biaxial nematic liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>Regularized stress tensor of vector fields in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Stueckelberg field in de Sitter space, which is a massive vector field with the gauge fixing (GF) term $\frac{1}{2\zeta} (A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu})^2$. We obtain the vacuum stress tensor, which consists of the transverse, longitudinal, temporal, and GF parts, and each contains various UV divergences. By the minimal subtraction rule, we regularize each part of the stress tensor to its pertinent adiabatic order. The transverse stress tensor is regularized to the 0th adiabatic order, the longitudinal, temporal, and GF stress tensors are regularized to the 2nd adiabatic order. The resulting total regularized vacuum stress tensor is convergent and maximally-symmetric, has a positive energy density, and respects the covariant conservation, and thus can be identified as the cosmological constant that drives the de Sitter inflation. Under the Lorenz condition $A^\mu\,_{;\, \mu}=0$, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor reduces to the regularized Proca stress tensor that contains only the transverse and longitudinal modes. In the massless limit, the regularized Stueckelberg stress tensor becomes zero, and is the same as that of the Maxwell field with the GF term, and no trace anomaly exists. If the order of adiabatic regularization were lower than our prescription, some divergences would remain. If the order were higher, say, under the conventional 4th-order regularization, more terms than necessary would be subtracted off, leading to an unphysical negative energy density and the trace anomaly simultaneously.</description>

Abstract: Consider the motion of a charged, point particle moving in the complement of a Poisson distribution of hard sphere scatterers in two dimensions under the effect of a fixed magnetic field. Building on, and extending a coupling method established by the authors, we show that this 'magnetic Lorentz gas' satisfies an invariance principle in an intermediate scaling limit. That is, we apply the low-density (Boltzmann-Grad) limit and simultaneously take the limit as time goes to infinity, then prove convergence of the rescaled trajectory to a Brownian motion in this limit.</description>

Abstract: We prove that normalized colored Alexander polynomial (the $A \rightarrow 1$ limit of colored HOMFLY-PT polynomial) evaluated for one-hook (L-shape) representation R possesses scaling property: it is equal to the fundamental Alexander polynomial with the substitution $q \rightarrow q^{|R|}$. The proof is simple and direct use of Reshetikhin-Turaev formalism to get all required R-matrices.</description>

      <title>A quantum anchor for higher Koszul brackets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the chain map between the de Rham and Poisson complexes on a Poisson manifold also maps the Koszul bracket of differential forms into the Schouten bracket of multivector fields.
  In the generalized case of a $P_\infty$-structure, where a Poisson bivector $P$ is replaced by an arbitrary even multivector obeying $[[P,P]]=0$, an analog of the chain map and an $L_\infty$-morphism from the higher Koszul brackets into the Schouten bracket are also known; however, they differ significantly in nature.
  In the present paper, we address the problem of quantizing this picture. In particular, we show that the $L_\infty$-morphism is quantized into a single linear operator, which is a formal Fourier integral operator.
  This paper employs Voronov's thick morphism technique and quantum Mackenzie-Xu transformations in the framework of $L_\infty$-algebroids.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant Coding for Quantum Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2009.07161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing encoding and decoding circuits to reliably send messages over many uses of a noisy channel is a central problem in communication theory. When studying the optimal transmission rates achievable with asymptotically vanishing error it is usually assumed that these circuits can be implemented using noise-free gates. While this assumption is satisfied for classical machines in many scenarios, it is not expected to be satisfied in the near term future for quantum machines where decoherence leads to faults in the quantum gates. As a result, fundamental questions regarding the practical relevance of quantum channel coding remain open. By combining techniques from fault-tolerant quantum computation with techniques from quantum communication, we initiate the study of these questions. We introduce fault-tolerant versions of quantum capacities quantifying the optimal communication rates achievable with asymptotically vanishing total error when the encoding and decoding circuits are affected by gate errors with small probability. Our main results are threshold theorems for the classical and quantum capacity: For every quantum channel $T$ and every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists a threshold $p(\epsilon,T)$ for the gate error probability below which rates larger than $C-\epsilon$ are fault-tolerantly achievable with vanishing overall communication error, where $C$ denotes the usual capacity. Our results are not only relevant in communication over large distances, but also on-chip, where distant parts of a quantum computer might need to communicate under higher levels of noise than affecting the local gates.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the conformal anomaly for a Weyl fermion in four dimensions that has generated some debate recently. We employ a perturbative expansion for the metric around Minkowski space, dimensional regularization and a Breitenlohner--Maison prescription for the chiral $\gamma$ matrix. We obtain a vanishing odd-parity contribution for Weyl fermions in four dimensions, while the even-parity contribution is exactly half the one for a Dirac fermion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15147v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to T-duality based on Courant algebroid relations which subsumes the usual T-duality as well as its various generalisations. Starting from a relational description for the reduction of exact Courant algebroids over foliated manifolds, we introduce a weakened notion of generalised isometries that captures the generalised geometry counterpart of Riemannian submersions when applied to transverse generalised metrics. This is used to construct T-dual backgrounds as generalised metrics on reduced Courant algebroids which are related by a generalised isometry. We prove an existence and uniqueness result for generalised isometric exact Courant algebroids coming from reductions. We demonstrate that our construction reproduces standard T-duality relations based on correspondence spaces. We also describe how it applies to generalised T-duality transformations of almost para-Hermitian manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact closure for hydrodynamic variables is rigorously derived from the linear Boltzmann kinetic equation. Our approach, based on spectral theory, structural properties of eigenvectors and the theory of slow manifolds, allows us to define a unique, optimal reduction in phase space close to equilibrium. The hydrodynamically constrained system induces a modification of entropy that ensures pure viscous dissipation on the hydrodynamic manifold, which is interpreted as a non-local variant of Korteweg's theory of viscosity-capillarity balance. The rigorous hydrodynamic equations are exemplified on the Knudsen minimum paradox in a channel flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study left-invariant pseudo-Riemannian metrics on Lie groups using the bracket flow of the corresponding Lie algebra. We focus on metrics where the Lie algebra is in the null cone of the $G=O(p,q)$-action; i.e., Lie algebras $\mu$ where zero is in the closure of the orbits: $0\in\overline{G\cdot \mu}$. We provide examples of such Lie groups in various signatures and give some general results. For signatures $(1,q)$ and $(2,q)$ we classify all cases belonging to the null cone. More generally, we show that all nilpotent and completely solvable Lie algebras are in the null cone of some $O(p,q)$ action. In addition, several examples of non-trivial Levi-decomposable Lie algebras in the null cone are given.</description>

      <title>Variations on quantum de Finetti theorems and operator valued Martin boundaries: a Choquet-Deny approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the quantum de Finetti theorem. We state and prove a couple of variants thereof. In parallel, we introduce an operator version of the Martin boundary on quantum groups and prove generalizations of Biane's theoresm. Our proof of the de Finetti theorem is new in the sense that it is based on an analogy with the theory of operator valued Martin boundary that we introduce.</description>

      <title>Response of any arbitrary initially stressed reference and the stress-free reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We often determine the constitutive relation for an initially stressed reference using the response of a virtual stress-free reference. However, it is usually difficult to identify the constitutive relation of the associated stress-free reference without conducting destructive tests. In this paper, we introduce three approaches to determine the response of the stress-free, or any arbitrary initially stressed reference, while the response of a particular initially stressed reference is known. The first and third approaches directly find the constitutive relations for one stressed reference from another. The second approach uses the response of a given stressed reference to identify the stress-free material and thereafter determines the response of any stressed reference. Quite interestingly, even though the given (known) initially stressed state is Green elastic, the stress-free material, or the reference in the presence of any other initial stress, may become implicit. We also derive several examples of explicit constitutive relations. The present approaches to changing the reference configuration do not start from a known stress-free state, which is standard practice. The present work also develops the universal relations for stress-free isotropic implicit elastic materials.</description>

      <title>Fermionic logarithmic negativity in the Krawtchouk chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement of non-complementary regions is investigated in an inhomogeneous free-fermion chain through the lens of the fermionic logarithmic negativity. Focus is on the Krawtchouk chain, whose relation to the eponymous orthogonal polynomials allows for exact diagonalization and analytical calculations of certain correlation functions. For adjacent regions, the negativity scaling corresponds to that of a conformal field theory with central charge $c=1$, in agreement with previous studies on bipartite entanglement in the Krawtchouk chain. For disjoint regions, we focus on the skeletal regime where each region reduces to a single site. This regime is sufficient to extract the leading behaviour at large distances. In the bulk, the negativity decays as $d^{-4 \Delta_f}$ with $\Delta_f=1/2$, where $d$ is the separation between the regions. This is in agreement with the homogeneous result of free Dirac fermions in one dimension. Surprisingly, when one site is close to the boundary, this exponent changes and depends on the parity of the boundary site $m=0,1,2,\dots$, with $\Delta_f^{\textrm{even}}=3/8$ and $\Delta_f^{\textrm{odd}}=5/8$. The results are supported by numerics and analytical calculations.</description>

      <title>Quantum K-Rings of Partial Flag Varieties, Coulomb Branches, and the Bethe Ansatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15575v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a purely geometric explanation of the coincidence between the Coulomb Branch equations for the 3D GLSM describing the quantum $K$-theory of a flag variety, and the Bethe Ansatz equations of the 5-vertex lattice model. In doing so, we prove two explicit presentations for the quantum $K$-ring of the flag variety, resolving conjectures of Gu-Sharpe-Mihalcea-Xu-Zhang-Zou and Rimanyi-Tarasov-Varchenko. We also prove that the stable map and quasimap $K$-theory of the partial flag varieties are isomorphic, using the work of Koroteev-Pushkar-Smirnov-Zeitlin identifying the latter ring with the Bethe algebra of the 5-vertex lattice model. Our isomorphism gives a more explicit description of the quantum tautological bundles described in the quasimap ring.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Stability of the Laplace Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the stability of the de Sitter equilibria in multi-resonant planetary systems. The de Sitter equilibrium is the dynamical state of the Laplace resonance in which all resonant arguments are librating. The sequence of equilibria exists all along the possible states balancing resonance offsets and forced eccentricities. Possible additional new-de Sitter equilibria may exist when at least one of the forced eccentricities is large (the paradigmatic case is Gliese-876). In the present work, these families of equilibria are traced up to crossing exact commensurability, where approximate first-order solutions diverge. Explicit exact location of the equilibria are determined allowing us to verify the Lyapunov stability of the standard de Sitter equilibrium and of the stable branches of the additional ones.</description>

      <title>A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically an Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</description>

      <title>Dynamical random field Ising model at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of the zero-temperature random field Ising model as the mean of the external field $M$ increases from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. We focus on two types of evolutions: the ground state evolution and the Glauber evolution. For the ground state evolution, we investigate the occurrence of global avalanche, a moment where a large fraction of spins flip simultaneously from minus to plus. In two dimensions, no global avalanche occurs, while in three or higher dimensions, there is a phase transition: a global avalanche happens when the noise intensity is small, but not when it is large. Additionally, we study the zero-temperature Glauber evolution, where spins are updated locally to minimize the Hamiltonian. Our results show that for small noise intensity, in dimensions $d =2$ or $3$, most spins flip around a critical time $c_d = \frac{2 \sqrt{d}}{1 + \sqrt{d}}$ (but we cannot decide whether such flipping occurs simultaneously or not). We also connect this process to polluted bootstrap percolation and solve an open problem on it.</description>

      <title>On Schauder Bases in Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short note we present a far generalization of the following very well-known assertion: assume that we have two orthonormal sequences in a Hilbert space and these sequences are quadratically close to each other. Then if one of these sequences is a basis in the Hilbert space then so is the other one.</description>
