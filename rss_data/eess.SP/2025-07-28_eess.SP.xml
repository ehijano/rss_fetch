      <title>Design and Implementation of Parametrized Look-Up Tables for Post-Correction of Oversampling Low-Resolution ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for the design, optimization, and implementation of Look-Up Tables (LUTs) used to recover noisy, oversampled, quantized signals given a parametric input model. The LUTs emulate the spectral effects of pre-quantization dithering through an all-digital solution applied after quantization. This methodology decomposes the intractable LUT design problem into four distinct stages, each of which is addressed analytically using a model-driven approach without reliance on training. Three dithering methods are studied to improve spectral purity metrics. Two novel indexing schemes are proposed to limit the LUT memory overhead shown to compress the LUT size by over four orders of magnitude with marginal performance loss. The LUT design is tested with an oversampled noisy sinusoidal input quantized to 3 bits and shown to improve its Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) by over 19 dBc with only 324 bytes of memory while maintaining the same 3-bit fixed-point precision at the digital output. This correction can be implemented using two-level combinational logic ensuring ultra-low latency and, hence, suitable for low-resolution wideband devices.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Movable Antennas in NOMA Networks: Joint Beamforming, Power Allocation and Antenna Position Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the movable antenna (MA)- assisted downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network to maximize system throughput. In the considered scenario, both the base station (BS) and users are equipped with MA, and a predetermined successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order is adopted. Based on the field-response channel model, we formulate a complex, non-convex problem to jointly optimize the BS beamforming, power allocation, and MA positions at both the transmitter and receivers. To address this, we propose an efficient algorithm based on an alternating optimization (AO) framework, which decomposes the original problem into three distinct subproblems. By employing sequential parametric convex approximation (SPCA) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, the non-convex constraints within each subproblem are transformed into tractable. This methodology ensures the algorithm converges to a stable, locally optimal solution. Numerical results validate that the proposed system, which fully exploits the degrees of freedom from antenna mobility at both ends, significantly outperforms benchmarks in terms of throughput.</description>

      <title>Max-Min Rate Optimization for Multigroup Multicast MISO Systems Via Novel Transmissive RIS Transceiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel transmissive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) transceiver architectureenabled multigroup multicast downlink communication system. Under this setup, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the minimum rate of users across all groups, subject to the maximum available power of each RIS unit. Due to the nondifferentiable nature of the objective function, the max-min rate problem is challenging to solve. To tackle this difficult problem, we develop an iterative solution by leveraging the successive convex approximation (SCA) and the penalty function method. However, the above approach has high computational complexity and may lead to compromised performance. To overcome these drawbacks, we design an efficient second-order cone programming (SOCP)-based method using the weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) framework to reduce computational complexity. Furthermore, to further reduce the computational complexity, we also propose a low-complexity and solver-free algorithm that analytically updates all variables by combining the smooth approximation theory and the majorization-minimization (MM) method. Numerical results are provided to verify the convergence and effectiveness of our proposed three algorithms. It is also demonstrated that the SOCP-based method outperforms the penalty-based algorithm in terms of both the achieved min rate and the computational complexity. In contrast, the lowcomplexity design achieves significantly lower complexity with only slightly degraded performance.</description>

      <title>Max-Min Fairness-Oriented Beamforming Design in HAPS-Enabled ISAC for 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a high-altitude platform station (HAPS)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system designed for sixth-generation (6G) networks. Positioned in the stratosphere, HAPS serves as a super-macro base station, leveraging advanced beamforming techniques to enable communication and sensing simultaneously. This research addresses the need for equitable service distribution in 6G networks by focusing on fairness within the HAPS-ISAC system. It tackles a non-convex optimization problem that balances sensing beampattern gain and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements among communication users (CUs) using a max-min fairness approach while adhering to power constraints. The proposed HAPS-ISAC framework ensures efficient resource allocation, reliable coverage, and improved sensing accuracy. Simulation results validate the potential of HAPS-ISAC as a pivotal enabler for 6G networks and integrated communication-sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Flexible Intelligent Metasurfaces in High-Mobility MIMO Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel doubly-dispersive (DD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel model incorporating flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs), which is suitable for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in high-mobility scenarios. We then discuss how the proposed FIM-parameterized DD (FPDD) channel model can be applied in a logical manner to ISAC waveforms that are known to perform well in DD environments, namely, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). Leveraging the proposed model, we formulate an achievable rate maximization problem with a strong sensing constraint for all the aforementioned waveforms, which we then solve via a gradient ascent algorithm with closed-form gradients presented as a bonus. Our numerical results indicate that the achievable rate is significantly impacted by the emerging FIM technology with careful parametrization essential in obtaining strong ISAC performance across all waveforms suitable to mitigating the effects of DD channels.</description>

      <title>A Fingerprint Database Generation Method for RIS-Assisted Indoor Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance indoor wireless communication and sensing performance. However, the construction of reliable received signal strength (RSS)-based fingerprint databases for RIS-assisted indoor positioning remains an open challenge due to the lack of realistic and spatially consistent channel modeling methods. In this paper, we propose a novel method with open-source codes for generating RIS-assisted RSS fingerprint databases. Our method captures the complex RIS-assisted multipath behaviors by extended cluster-based channel modeling and the physical and electromagnetic properties of RIS and transmitter (Tx). And the spatial consistency is incorporated when simulating the fingerprint data collection across neighboring positions. Furthermore, the proposed method offers exceptional flexibility in configuring RIS and Tx parameters. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the fingerprint database generated by the proposed method. Moreover, the positioning performance on the database using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and deep neural network (DNN) is analyzed, providing valuable insights for the system design.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Reliability and Validity of a Balance Mat for Measuring Postural Stability: A Combined Robot-Human Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Postural sway assessment is important for detecting balance problems and identifying people at risk of falls. Force plates (FP) are considered the gold standard postural sway assessment method in laboratory conditions, but their lack of portability and requirement of high-level expertise limit their widespread usage. This study evaluates the reliability and validity of a novel Balance Mat (BM) device, a low-cost portable alternative that uses optical fibre technology. The research includes two studies: a robot study and a human study. In the robot study, a UR10 robotic arm was used to obtain controlled sway patterns to assess the reliability and sensitivity of the BM. In the human study, 51 healthy young participants performed balance tasks on the BM in combination with an FP to evaluate the BM's validity. Sway metrics such as sway mean, sway absolute mean, sway root mean square (RMS), sway path, sway range, and sway velocity were calculated from both BM and FP and compared. Reliability was evaluated using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), where values greater than 0.9 were considered excellent and values between 0.75 and 0.9 were considered good. Results from the robot study demonstrated good to excellent ICC values in both single and double-leg stances. The human study showed moderate to strong correlations for sway path and range. Using Bland-Altman plots for agreement analysis revealed proportional bias between the BM and the FP where the BM overestimated sway metrics compared to the FP. Calibration was used to improve the agreement between the devices. The device demonstrated consistent sway measurement across varied stance conditions, establishing both reliability and validity following appropriate calibration.</description>

      <title>Max-Min Beamforming for Large-Scale Cell-Free Massive MIMO: A Randomized ADMM Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of max-min beamforming (MMB) for cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, where the objective is to maximize the minimum achievable rate among all users. Existing MMB methods are mainly based on deterministic optimization methods, which are computationally inefficient when the problem size grows large. To address this issue, we, in this paper, propose a randomized alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) algorithm for large-scale MMB problems. We first propose a novel formulation that transforms the highly challenging feasibility-checking problem into a linearly constrained optimization problem. An efficient randomized ADMM is then developed for solving the linearly constrained problem. Unlike standard ADMM, randomized ADMM only needs to solve a small number of subproblems at each iteration to ensure convergence, thus achieving a substantial complexity reduction. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the proposed algorithm exhibits an O(1/\bar{t}) convergence rate (\bar{t} represents the number of iterations), which is on the same order as its deterministic counterpart. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm offers a significant complexity advantage over existing methods in solving the MMB problem.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning based Radio Environment Map Estimation for Indoor Visible Light Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An innovative method for radio map estimation in optical wireless communications is proposed that is based on Machine Learning rather than simulation techniques. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) representation of indoor Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems is suggested, and signal propagation is estimated. The simulation and performance predictions are accurate, fast and require a reduced set of training sample size with respect to other counterparts, making this solution very suitable for real time estimation of an indoor VLC system. It is shown that by tweaking MLP parameters, such as sample size, number of epochs and batch size, one can balance the desired level of inference accuracy with training time and optimize the model's performance to meet real-time requirements.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity RF Mapping: Assessing Environmental Modeling in 6G Network Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of accurate Digital Twins (DTs) of electromagnetic environments strictly depends on the fidelity of the underlying environmental modeling. Evaluating the differences among diverse levels of modeling accuracy is key to determine the relevance of the model features towards both efficient and accurate DT simulations. In this paper, we propose two metrics, the Hausdorff ray tracing (HRT) and chamfer ray tracing (CRT) distances, to consistently compare the temporal, angular and power features between two ray tracing simulations performed on 3D scenarios featured by environmental changes. To evaluate the introduced metrics, we considered a high-fidelity digital twin model of an area of Milan, Italy and we enriched it with two different types of environmental changes: (i) the inclusion of parked vehicles meshes, and (ii) the segmentation of the buildings facade faces to separate the windows mesh components from the rest of the building. We performed grid-based and vehicular ray tracing simulations at 28 GHz carrier frequency on the obtained scenarios integrating the NVIDIA Sionna RT ray tracing simulator with the SUMO vehicular traffic simulator. Both the HRT and CRT metrics highlighted the areas of the scenarios where the simulated radio propagation features differ owing to the introduced mesh integrations, while the vehicular ray tracing simulations allowed to uncover the distance patterns arising along realistic vehicular trajectories.</description>

      <title>Bespoke multiresolution analysis of graph signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for discrete multiresolution analysis of graph signals. The main analytical tool is the samplet transform, originally defined in the Euclidean framework as a discrete wavelet-like construction, tailored to the analysis of scattered data. The first contribution of this work is defining samplets on graphs. To this end, we subdivide the graph into a fixed number of patches, embed each patch into a Euclidean space, where we construct samplets, and eventually pull the construction back to the graph. This ensures orthogonality, locality, and the vanishing moments property with respect to properly defined polynomial spaces on graphs. Compared to classical Haar wavelets, this framework broadens the class of graph signals that can efficiently be compressed and analyzed. Along this line, we provide a definition of a class of signals that can be compressed using our construction. We support our findings with different examples of signals defined on graphs whose vertices lie on smooth manifolds. For efficient numerical implementation, we combine heavy edge clustering, to partition the graph into meaningful patches, with landmark \texttt{Isomap}, which provides low-dimensional embeddings for each patch. Our results demonstrate the method's robustness, scalability, and ability to yield sparse representations with controllable approximation error, significantly outperforming traditional Haar wavelet approaches in terms of compression efficiency and multiresolution fidelity.</description>

      <title>Real-time rail vehicle localisation using spatially resolved magnetic field measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents two complementary real-time rail vehicle localization methods based on magnetic field measurements and a pre-recorded magnetic map. The first uses a particle filter reweighted via magnetic similarity, employing a heavy-tailed non-Gaussian kernel for enhanced stability. The second is a stateless sequence alignment technique that transforms real-time magnetic signals into the spatial domain and matches them to the map using a similarity measure. Experiments with operational train data show that the particle filter achieves track-selective, sub-5-meter accuracy over 21.6 km, though its performance degrades at low speeds and during cold starts. Accuracy tests were constrained by the GNSS-based reference system. In contrast, the alignment-based method excels in cold-start scenarios, localizing within 30 m in 92 % of tests (100 % using top-3 matches). A hybrid approach combines both methods$\unicode{x2014}$alignment-based initialization followed by particle filter tracking. Runtime analysis confirms real-time capability on consumer-grade hardware. The system delivers accurate, robust localization suitable for safety-critical rail applications.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI guided unsupervised fault diagnostics for high-voltage circuit breakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commercial high-voltage circuit breaker (CB) condition monitoring systems rely on directly observable physical parameters such as gas filling pressure with pre-defined thresholds. While these parameters are crucial, they only cover a small subset of malfunctioning mechanisms and usually can be monitored only if the CB is disconnected from the grid. To facilitate online condition monitoring while CBs remain connected, non-intrusive measurement techniques such as vibration or acoustic signals are necessary. Currently, CB condition monitoring studies using these signals typically utilize supervised methods for fault diagnostics, where ground-truth fault types are known due to artificially introduced faults in laboratory settings. This supervised approach is however not feasible in real-world applications, where fault labels are unavailable. In this work, we propose a novel unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework for CBs based on vibration and acoustic signals. This framework can detect deviations from the healthy state. The explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach is applied to the detected faults for fault diagnostics. The specific contributions are: (1) we propose an integrated unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework that is capable of detecting faults and clustering different faults with only healthy data required during training (2) we provide an unsupervised explainability-guided fault diagnostics approach using XAI to offer domain experts potential indications of the aged or faulty components, achieving fault diagnostics without the prerequisite of ground-truth fault labels. These contributions are validated using an experimental dataset from a high-voltage CB under healthy and artificially introduced fault conditions, contributing to more reliable CB system operation.</description>

      <title>Latent Granular Resynthesis using Neural Audio Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel technique for creative audio resynthesis that operates by reworking the concept of granular synthesis at the latent vector level. Our approach creates a "granular codebook" by encoding a source audio corpus into latent vector segments, then matches each latent grain of a target audio signal to its closest counterpart in the codebook. The resulting hybrid sequence is decoded to produce audio that preserves the target's temporal structure while adopting the source's timbral characteristics. This technique requires no model training, works with diverse audio materials, and naturally avoids the discontinuities typical of traditional concatenative synthesis through the codec's implicit interpolation during decoding. We include supplementary material at https://github.com/naotokui/latentgranular/ , as well as a proof-of-concept implementation to allow users to experiment with their own sounds at https://huggingface.co/spaces/naotokui/latentgranular .</description>

      <title>Variational Bayesian Inference for Multiple Extended Targets or Unresolved Group Targets Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15226v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a method for tracking multiple extended targets or unresolvable group targets in a clutter environment. Firstly, based on the Random Matrix Model (RMM), the joint state of the target is modeled as the Gamma Gaussian Inverse Wishart (GGIW) distribution. Considering the uncertainty of measurement origin caused by the clutters, we adopt the idea of probabilistic data association and describe the joint association event as an unknown parameter in the joint prior distribution. Then the Variational Bayesian Inference (VBI) is employed to approximately solve the non-analytical posterior distribution. Furthermore, to ensure the practicability of the proposed method, we further provide two potential lightweight schemes to reduce its computational complexity. One of them is based on clustering, which effectively prunes the joint association events. The other is a simplification of the variational posterior through marginal association probabilities. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulation and real data experiments, and we show that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and adaptability.</description>

      <title>A Multitask VAE for Time Series Preprocessing and Prediction of Blood Glucose Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data preprocessing is a critical part of time series data analysis. Data from connected medical devices often have missing or abnormal values during acquisition. Handling such situations requires additional assumptions and domain knowledge. This can be time-consuming, and can introduce a significant bias affecting predictive model accuracy and thus, medical interpretation. To overcome this issue, we propose a new deep learning model to mitigate the preprocessing assumptions. The model architecture relies on a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to produce a preprocessing latent space, and a recurrent VAE to preserve the temporal dynamics of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such an architecture on telemonitoring data to forecast glucose-level of diabetic patients. Our results show an improvement in terms of accuracy with respect of existing state-of-the-art methods and architectures.</description>

      <title>Masked Autoencoders that Feel the Heart: Unveiling Simplicity Bias for ECG Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22495</link>

Abstract: The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1) Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this, Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>A boostlet transform for wave-based acoustic signal processing in space-time</title>

Abstract: Sparse representation systems that encode signal architecture have had a profound impact on sampling and compression paradigms. Remarkable examples are multi-scale directional systems, which, similar to our vision system, encode the underlying architecture of natural images with sparse features. Inspired by this philosophy, we introduce a representation system for wave-based acoustic signal processing in 2D space--time, referred to as the \emph{boostlet transform}, which encodes sparse features of natural acoustic fields using the Poincar\'e group and isotropic dilations. Boostlets are spatiotemporal functions parametrized with dilations, Lorentz boosts, and translations in space--time. Physically speaking, boostlets are supported away from the acoustic radiation cone, i.e., having broadband frequency with phase velocities other than the speed of sound, resulting in a peculiar scaling function. We formulate a discrete boostlet frame using Meyer wavelets and bump functions and examine its sparsity properties. An analysis with experimentally measured fields indicates that discrete boostlet coefficients decay significantly faster and attain superior reconstruction performance than wavelets, curvelets, shearlets, and wave atoms. The results demonstrate that boostlets provide a natural, compact representation system for acoustic waves in space-time.</description>

      <title>AI Flow: Perspectives, Scenarios, and Approaches</title>

Abstract: Pioneered by the foundational information theory by Claude Shannon and the visionary framework of machine intelligence by Alan Turing, the convergent evolution of information and communication technologies (IT/CT) has created an unbroken wave of connectivity and computation. This synergy has sparked a technological revolution, now reaching its peak with large artificial intelligence (AI) models that are reshaping industries and redefining human-machine collaboration. However, the realization of ubiquitous intelligence faces considerable challenges due to substantial resource consumption in large models and high communication bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, AI Flow has been introduced as a multidisciplinary framework that integrates cutting-edge IT and CT advancements, with a particular emphasis on the following three key points. First, device-edge-cloud framework serves as the foundation, which integrates end devices, edge servers, and cloud clusters to optimize scalability and efficiency for low-latency model inference. Second, we introduce the concept of familial models, which refers to a series of different-sized models with aligned hidden features, enabling effective collaboration and the flexibility to adapt to varying resource constraints and dynamic scenarios. Third, connectivity- and interaction-based intelligence emergence is a novel paradigm of AI Flow. By leveraging communication networks to enhance connectivity, the collaboration among AI models across heterogeneous nodes achieves emergent intelligence that surpasses the capability of any single model. The innovations of AI Flow provide enhanced intelligence, timely responsiveness, and ubiquitous accessibility to AI services, paving the way for the tighter fusion of AI techniques and communication systems.</description>

      <title>Incremental Averaging Method to Improve Graph-Based Time-Difference-of-Arrival Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07087</link>

Abstract: Estimating the position of a speech source based on time-differences-of-arrival (TDOAs) is often adversely affected by background noise and reverberation. A popular method to estimate the TDOA between a microphone pair involves maximizing a generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) function. Since the TDOAs across different microphone pairs satisfy consistency relations, generally only a small subset of microphone pairs are used for source position estimation. Although the set of microphone pairs is often determined based on a reference microphone, recently a more robust method has been proposed to determine the set of microphone pairs by computing the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a signal graph of GCC-PHAT function reliabilities. To reduce the influence of noise and reverberation on the TDOA estimation accuracy, in this paper we propose to compute the GCC-PHAT functions of the MST based on an average of multiple cross-power spectral densities (CPSDs) using an incremental method. In each step of the method, we increase the number of CPSDs over which we average by considering CPSDs computed indirectly via other microphones from previous steps. Using signals recorded in a noisy and reverberant laboratory with an array of spatially distributed microphones, the performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of TDOA estimation error and 2D source position estimation error. Experimental results for different source and microphone configurations and three reverberation conditions show that the proposed method considering multiple CPSDs improves the TDOA estimation and source position estimation accuracy compared to the reference microphone- and MST-based methods that rely on a single CPSD as well as steered-response power-based source position estimation.</description>
