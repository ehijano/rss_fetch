      <title>DIAL: Decentralized I/O AutoTuning via Learned Client-side Local Metrics for Parallel File System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabling efficient, high-performance data access in parallel file systems (PFS) is critical for today's high-performance computing systems. PFS client-side I/O heavily impacts the final I/O performance delivered to individual applications and the entire system. Autotuning the key client-side I/O behaviors has been extensively studied and shows promising results. However, existing work has heavily relied on extensive number of global runtime metrics to monitor and accurate modeling of applications' I/O patterns. Such heavy overheads significantly limit the ability to enable fine-grained, dynamic tuning in practical systems. In this study, we propose DIAL (Decentralized I/O AutoTuning via Learned Client-side Local Metrics) which takes a drastically different approach. Instead of trying to extract the global I/O patterns of applications, DIAL takes a decentralized approach, treating each I/O client as an independent unit and tuning configurations using only its locally observable metrics. With the help of machine learning models, DIAL enables multiple tunable units to make independent but collective decisions, reacting to what is happening in the global storage systems in a timely manner and achieving better I/O performance globally for the application.</description>

      <title>AdapTBF: Decentralized Bandwidth Control via Adaptive Token Borrowing for HPC Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern high-performance computing (HPC) applications run on compute resources but share global storage systems. This design can cause problems when applications consume a disproportionate amount of storage bandwidth relative to their allocated compute resources. For example, an application running on a single compute node can issue many small, random writes and consume excessive I/O bandwidth from a storage server. This can hinder larger jobs that write to the same storage server and are allocated many compute nodes, resulting in significant resource waste.
  A straightforward solution is to limit each application's I/O bandwidth on storage servers in proportion to its allocated compute resources. This approach has been implemented in parallel file systems using Token Bucket Filter (TBF). However, strict proportional limits often reduce overall I/O efficiency because HPC applications generate short, bursty I/O. Limiting bandwidth can waste server capacity when applications are idle or prevent applications from temporarily using higher bandwidth during bursty phases.
  We argue that I/O control should maximize per-application performance and overall storage efficiency while ensuring fairness (e.g., preventing small jobs from blocking large-scale ones). We propose AdapTBF, which builds on TBF in modern parallel file systems (e.g., Lustre) and introduces a decentralized bandwidth control approach using adaptive borrowing and lending. We detail the algorithm, implement AdapTBF in Lustre, and evaluate it using synthetic workloads modeled after real-world scenarios. Results show that AdapTBF manages I/O bandwidth effectively while maintaining high storage utilization, even under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>CARAT: Client-Side Adaptive RPC and Cache Co-Tuning for Parallel File Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tuning parallel file system in High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems remains challenging due to the complex I/O paths, diverse I/O patterns, and dynamic system conditions. While existing autotuning frameworks have shown promising results in tuning PFS parameters based on applications' I/O patterns, they lack scalability, adaptivity, and the ability to operate online. In this work, focusing on scalable online tuning, we present CARAT, an ML-guided framework to co-tune client-side RPC and caching parameters of PFS, leveraging only locally observable metrics. Unlike global or pattern-dependent approaches, CARAT enables each client to make independent and intelligent tuning decisions online, responding to real-time changes in both application I/O behaviors and system states. We then prototyped CARAT using Lustre and evaluated it extensively across dynamic I/O patterns, real-world HPC workloads, and multi-client deployments. The results demonstrated that CARAT can achieve up to 3x performance improvement over the default or static configurations, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach. Due to its scalability and lightweight, we believe CARAT has the potential to be widely deployed into existing PFS and benefit various data-intensive applications.</description>

      <title>The Road to Useful Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building a useful quantum computer is a grand science and engineering challenge, currently pursued intensely by teams around the world. In the 1980s, Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin observed independently that computers based on quantum mechanics might enable better simulations of quantum phenomena. Their vision remained an intellectual curiosity until Peter Shor published his famous quantum algorithm for integer factoring, and shortly thereafter a proof that errors in quantum computations can be corrected. Since then, quantum computing R&amp;D has progressed rapidly, from small-scale experiments in university physics laboratories to well-funded industrial efforts and prototypes. Hype notwithstanding, quantum computers have yet to solve scientifically or practically important problems -- a target often called quantum utility. In this article, we describe the capabilities of contemporary quantum computers, compare them to the requirements of quantum utility, and illustrate how to track progress from today to utility. We highlight key science and engineering challenges on the road to quantum utility, touching on relevant aspects of our own research.</description>
