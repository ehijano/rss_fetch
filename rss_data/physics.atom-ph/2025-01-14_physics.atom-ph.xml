      <title>Lifetime measurement of the 5s5p 1P1 state in strontium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a direct lifetime measurement of the $5s5p~^1P_1$ state of strontium using time-correlated single-photon counting of laser induced fluorescence in a hot atomic beam. To achieve fast switch-off times and a high signal-to-noise ratio, we excite the strontium atoms with a femtosecond pulsed laser at $\approx$461 nm and collect the fluorescence onto a hybrid single-photon detector. Analysis of the measured exponential decay gives a lifetime of the $^1P_1$ state of $\tau = (5.216 \pm 0.006_{stat} \pm 0.013_{sys})$ ns, where all the systematic effects have been thoroughly considered.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian dynamics of collectively-encoded qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collectively-encoded qubits, involving ensembles of atomic or solid-state emitters, present many practical advantages for quantum technologies. However, they suffer from uncontrolled inhomogeneous dephasing which couples them to a quasi-continuum of dark states. In most cases, this process cannot be encompassed in a standard master equation with time-independent coefficients, making its description either tedious or inaccurate. We show that it can be understood as a displacement in time-frequency phase space and accurately included in resource-efficient numerical simulations of the qubit's dynamics. This description unveils a regime where the qubit becomes protected from dephasing through a combination of strong driving and non-Markovianity. We experimentally investigate this regime using a Rydberg superatom and extend its coherent dynamics beyond the inhomogeneous-dephasing characteristic time by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Enhancing reactivity of SiO$^+$ ions by controlled excitation to extreme rotational states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09129v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical pumping of molecules provides unique opportunities for control of chemical reactions at a wide range of rotational energies. This work reports a chemical reaction with extreme rotational excitation of a reactant and its kinetic characterization. We investigate the chemical reactivity for the hydrogen abstraction reaction SiO$^+$ + H$_2$ $\rightarrow$ SiOH$^+$ + H in an ion trap. The SiO$^+$ cations are prepared in a narrow rotational state distribution, including super-rotor states with rotational quantum number $\it{(j)}$ as high as 170, using a broad-band optical pumping method. We show that the super-rotor states of SiO$^+$ substantially enhance the reaction rate, a trend reproduced by complementary theoretical studies. We reveal the mechanism for the rotational enhancement of the reactivity to be a strong coupling of the SiO$^+$ rotational mode with the reaction coordinate at the transition state on the dominant dynamical pathway.</description>

      <title>Laser mode-hopping assisted all-optical single beam pulsed atomic magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate an all-optical single beam pulsed atomic magnetometer assisted by laser mode-hopping in a distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser. We implement a temporal sequence of the laser current, with sinusoidal current modulation including the laser mode-hop current for synchronous optical pumping, and a following constant current for paramagnetic Faraday rotation measurements, to probe the free induction decay (FID) of transverse $^{87}$Rb spin polarization. Repetitive sudden frequency shifts of 20 GHz around the pressure-broadened $^{87}$Rb spectra, originating from laser mode-hopping, enable discontinuous optical pumping modulation with a large depth, which enhances transverse spin polarization. We achieved a sensitivity of 0.6 pT/Hz$^{1/2}$ in a magnetic field of 27 $\mu$T, mainly limited by the photon-shot-noise and the magnetic field noise induced by the current noise in the current supply for driving the bias magnetic field coil. The Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the sensitivity due to the non-magnetic noise such as photon shot-noise is 131 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$. Our approach based on laser mode-hopping can be applied for the miniaturization of all-optical atomic magnetometers with sub-pT/Hz$^{1/2}$ sensitivities.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Light-assisted Collisions in Optical Tweezers Across the Hyperfine Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of hyperfine structure in resonant-dipole interactions between two atoms cotrapped in an optical tweezer. Two-body loss rates from light-assisted collisions (LACs) are measured across the $^{87}$Rb hyperfine spectrum and connected to properties of molecular photoassociation potentials via a semiclassical model. To obtain our results, we introduce an imaging technique that leverages repulsive LACs to detect two atoms in a trap, thereby circumventing parity constraints in tweezers. Our findings offer key insights for exploiting hyperfine structure in laser-induced collisions to control cold atoms and molecules in a broad range of quantum science applications.</description>

      <title>Dead-zone-free single-beam atomic magnetometer based on free-induction-decay of Rb atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-induction-decay (FID) magnetometers have evolved as simple magnetic sensors for sensitive detection of unknown magnetic fields. However, these magnetometers suffer from a fundamental problem known as a "dead zone," making them insensitive to certain magnetic field directions. Here, we demonstrate a simple experimental scheme for the dead-zone-free operation of a FID atomic magnetometer. Using a single laser beam containing equal strength of linear- and circular-polarization components and amplitude-modulation at a low-duty cycle, we have synchronously pumped the rubidium-87 atoms with both first- and second-order frequency harmonics. Such a pumping scheme has enabled us to observe the free Larmor precession of atomic spins at a frequency of $\Omega_L$ (orientation) and/or 2$\Omega_L$ (alignment) in a single FID signal, depending on the direction of the external magnetic field. We observed that the amplitude of the FID signal does not go to zero for any magnetic field direction, proving the absence of dead zones in the magnetometer. The magnetometer has a sensitivity in the range of 3.2 - 8.4 pT/$\sqrt{Hz}$ in all directions. Our experimental scheme can be crucial in developing miniaturized atomic magnetometers for various practical applications, including geomagnetic applications.</description>

      <title>Robust M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gate for neutral atoms using rapid adiabatic Rydberg dressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.04045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Rydberg blockade mechanism is now routinely considered for entangling qubits encoded in clock states of neutral atoms. Challenges towards implementing entangling gates with high fidelity include errors due to thermal motion of atoms, laser amplitude inhomogeneities, and imperfect Rydberg blockade. We show that adiabatic rapid passage by Rydberg dressing provides a mechanism for implementing two-qubit entangling gates by accumulating phases that are robust to these imperfections. We find that the typical error in implementing a two-qubit gate, such as the controlled phase gate, is dominated by errors in the single atom light shift, and that this can be easily corrected using adiabatic dressing interleaved with a simple spin echo sequence. This results in a two-qubit M{\o}lmer-S{\o}renson gate. A gate fidelity $\sim 0.995$ is achieveable with modest experimental parameters and a path to higher fidelities is possible for Rydberg states in atoms with a stronger blockade, longer lifetimes, and larger Rabi frequencies.</description>

      <title>Realization of a Laughlin state of two rapidly rotating fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We realize a Laughlin state of two rapidly rotating fermionic atoms in an optical tweezer. By utilizing a single atom and spin resolved imaging technique, we sample the Laughlin wavefunction, thereby revealing its distinctive features, including a vortex distribution in the relative motion, correlations in the particles' relative angle, and suppression of the inter-particle interactions. Our work lays the foundation for atom-by-atom assembly of fractional quantum Hall states in rotating atomic gases.</description>
