      <title>JWST Observations of Starbursts: Relations between PAH features and CO clouds in the starburst galaxy M 82</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of new 7.7-11.3 $\mu$m data obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope Mid-InfraRed Instrument in the starburst galaxy M 82. In particular, we focus on the dependency of the integrated CO(1-0) line intensity on the MIRI-F770W and MIRI-F1130W filter intensities to investigate the correlation between CO content and the 7.7 and 11.3 $\mu$m features from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in M 82's outflows. To perform our analysis, we identify CO clouds using archival $^{12}$CO($J$=1-0) NOEMA moment 0 map within 2 kpc from the center of M 82, with sizes ranging between $\sim$21 and 270 pc; then, we compute the CO-to-PAH relations for the 306 validated CO clouds. On average, the power-law slopes for the two relations in M 82 are lower than what is seen in local main-sequence spirals. In addition, there is a moderate correlation between $I_{\rm CO(1-0)}$-$I_{\rm 7.7\mu m} /I_{\rm 11.3\mu m}$ for most of the CO cloud groups analyzed in this work.Our results suggest that the extreme conditions in M 82 translate into CO not tracing the full budget of molecular gas in smaller clouds, perhaps as a consequence of photoionization and/or emission suppression of CO molecules due to hard radiation fields from the central starburst.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory Line-Driven Winds: The Role of Atmospheric Stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent study, Dannen et al. surveyed a large parameter space to study the transition from efficient to inefficient line driving. They found that when the line force significantly weakens due to ionization, the winds are variable, with a characteristic frequency comparable to the Lamb cut-off frequency of a stratified atmosphere, {\omega}c. In this work, we present a set of simulations and perturbation analyses that elucidate the variability source and characteristics. We found that the line force adds wave energy and amplifies perturbations with frequencies near {\omega}c. This selective amplification results from the coupling between the natural tendency of velocity perturbations to grow in a stratified atmosphere and the dependence of the line force on the velocity gradient, per the Castor-Abbott-Klein line-driven wind theory. We also found that the variability stems from self-excitation that occurs in the exponential atmosphere due to the non-linearity introduced by the absolute value of the velocity gradient in the line force prescription. We conclude that self-consistently calculating ionization is insufficient for modeling the dynamics in the subsonic atmosphere. Instead future wind models should relax the Sobolev approximation, or model the radiative transfer to capture the dynamics and instabilities at the base of the wind.</description>

      <title>Spatially-resolved spectro-photometric SED Modeling of NGC 253's Central Molecular Zone I. Studying the star formation in extragalactic giant molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the interstellar medium in nearby starbursts is essential for understanding the physical mechanisms driving these objects, thought to resemble young star-forming galaxies. This study aims to analyze the physical properties of the first spatially-resolved multi-wavelength SED of an extragalactic source, spanning six decades in frequency (from near-UV to cm wavelengths) at an angular resolution of 3$^{\prime\prime}$ (51 pc at the distance of NGC,253). We focus on the central molecular zone (CMZ) of NGC,253, which contains giant molecular clouds (GMCs) responsible for half of the galaxy's star formation. We use archival data, spanning optical to centimeter wavelengths, to compute SEDs with the GalaPy and CIGALE codes for validation, and analyze stellar optical spectra with the \textsc{starlight} code.
  Our results show significant differences between central and external GMCs in terms of stellar and dust masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and bolometric luminosities. We identify the best SFR tracers as radio continuum bands at 33 GHz, radio recombination lines, and the total infrared luminosity (L$_{\rm IR}$; 8-1000$\mu$m), as well as 60$\mu$m IR emission. BPT and WHAN diagrams indicate shock signatures in NGC~253's nuclear region, associating it with AGN/star-forming hybrids, though the AGN fraction is negligible ($\leq$7.5%). Our findings show significant heterogeneity in the CMZ, with central GMCs exhibiting higher densities, SFRs, and dust masses compared to external GMCs. We confirm that certain centimeter photometric bands can reliably estimate global SFR at GMC scales.</description>

      <title>Highly Variable Quasar Candidates Selected from 4XMM-DR13 with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sample of 12 quasar candidates with highly variable soft X-ray emission from the 4th XMM-newton Serendipitous Source Catalog (4XMM-DR13) using random forest. We obtained optical to mid-IR photometric data for the 4XMM-DR13 sources by correlating the sample with the SDSS DR18 photometric database and the AllWISE database. By cross-matching this sample with known spectral catalogs from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, we obtained a training data set containing stars, galaxies, and quasars. The random forest algorithm was trained to classify the XMM-WISE-SDSS sample. We further filtered the classified quasar candidates with $\it{Gaia}$ proper motion to remove stellar contaminants. Finally, 53,992 quasar candidates have been classified, with 10,210 known quasars matched in SIMBAD. The quasar candidates have systematically lower X-ray fluxes than quasars in the training set, which indicates the classifier is helpful to single out fainter quasars. We constructed a sample of 12 sources from these quasars candidates which changed their soft X-ray fluxes by a factor of 10 over $\sim$ 20 years in the 4XMM-newton survey. Our selected highly variable quasar candidates extend the quasar sample, characterized by extreme soft X-ray variability, to the optically faint end with magnitudes around $r \sim 22$. None of the 12 sources were detected in ROSAT observations. Given the flux limit of ROSAT, the result suggests that quasars exhibiting variations of more than two orders of magnitudes are extremely rare.</description>

      <title>Redistribution of ices between grain populations in protostellar envelopes. Only the coldest grains get ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Matter that falls onto a protoplanetary disk (PPD) from a protostellar envelope is heated before it cools again. This induces sublimation and subsequent re-adsorption of ices that accumulated during the prestellar phase. Aims. We explore the fate of ices on multiple-sized dust grains in a parcel of infalling matter. Methods. A comprehensive kinetic chemical model using five grain-size bins with different temperatures was applied for an infalling parcel. The parcel was heated to 150 K and then cooled over a total timescale of 20 kyr. Effects on ice loss and re-accumulation by the changed gas density, the maximum temperature, the irradiation intensity, the size-dependent grain temperature trend, and the distribution of the ice mass among the grain-size bins were investigated. Results. A massive selective redistribution of ices exclusively onto the surface of the coldest grain-size bin occurs in all models. The redistribution starts already during the heating stage, where ices that are sublimated from warmer grains re-adsorb onto colder grains before complete sublimation. During the cooling stage, the sublimated molecules re-freeze again onto the coldest grains. In the case of full sublimation, this re-adsorption is delayed and occurs at lower temperatures because a bare grain surface has lower molecular desorption energies in our model. Conclusions. Most protostellar envelope grains enter the PPD ice poor (bare). Ices are carried by a single coldest grain-size bin, here representing 12 % of the total grain surface area. This bare ice-grain dualism can affect the rate of the grain coagulation. The ice components are stratified on the grains according to their sublimation temperatures.</description>

      <title>Discovering Strong Gravitational Lenses in the Dark Energy Survey with Interactive Machine Learning and Crowd-sourced Inspection with Space Warps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a search for strong gravitational lenses in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 6 imaging data. We implement a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) for our machine learning (ML) architecture and adopt Interactive Machine Learning to construct a training sample with multiple classes to address common types of false positives. Our ML model reduces 236 million DES cutout images to 22,564 targets of interest, including around 85% of previously reported galaxy-galaxy lens candidates discovered in DES. These targets were visually inspected by citizen scientists, who ruled out approximately 90% as false positives. Of the remaining 2,618 candidates, 149 were expert-classified as 'definite' lenses and 516 as 'probable' lenses, with 147 of these candidates being newly identified. Additionally, we trained a second ViT to find double-source plane lens systems, finding at least one double-source system. Our main ViT excels at identifying galaxy-galaxy lenses, consistently assigning high scores to candidates with high confidence. The top 800 ViT-scored images include around 100 of our `definite' lens candidates. This selection is an order of magnitude higher in purity than previous convolutional neural network-based lens searches and demonstrates the feasibility of applying our methodology for discovering large samples of lenses in future surveys.</description>

      <title>Automatic Machine Learning Framework to Study Morphological Parameters of AGN Host Galaxies within $z &lt; 1.4$ in the Hyper Supreme-Cam Wide Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a composite machine learning framework to estimate posterior probability distributions of bulge-to-total light ratio, half-light radius, and flux for Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) host galaxies within $z&lt;1.4$ and $m&lt;23$ in the Hyper Supreme-Cam Wide survey. We divide the data into five redshift bins: low ($0&lt;z&lt;0.25$), mid ($0.25&lt;z&lt;0.5$), high ($0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9$), extra ($0.9&lt;z&lt;1.1$) and extreme ($1.1&lt;z&lt;1.4$), and train our models independently in each bin. We use PSFGAN to decompose the AGN point source light from its host galaxy, and invoke the Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN) to estimate morphological parameters of the recovered host galaxy. We first trained our models on simulated data, and then fine-tuned our algorithm via transfer learning using labeled real data. To create training labels for transfer learning, we used GALFIT to fit $\sim 20,000$ real HSC galaxies in each redshift bin. We comprehensively examined that the predicted values from our final models agree well with the GALFIT values for the vast majority of cases. Our PSFGAN + GaMPEN framework runs at least three orders of magnitude faster than traditional light-profile fitting methods, and can be easily retrained for other morphological parameters or on other datasets with diverse ranges of resolutions, seeing conditions, and signal-to-noise ratios, making it an ideal tool for analyzing AGN host galaxies from large surveys coming soon from the Rubin-LSST, Euclid, and Roman telescopes.</description>

      <title>Precision Analysis of $\mathrm{^{12}C / ^{13}C}$ Ratios in Orion IRc2 Acetylene Isotopologues via $\chi^2$ Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$) and its isotopologues in the Orion IRc2 region, focusing on the determination of $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratios using high-resolution infrared spectra from SOFIA. By employing a robust $\chi^2$ fitting method, we simultaneously determined temperature and column density, achieving a $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $18.72^{+1.54}_{-1.46}$ for the blue clump and $15.07^{+1.61}_{-1.60}$ for the red clump. These results revealed significant discrepancies with the traditional rotational diagram method, which overestimated the ratios by 12.1% and 23.9%, respectively. Our $\chi^2$ approach also reduced uncertainties by up to 80% , providing more precise and reliable isotopic ratios. Additionally, we extended the analysis to isotopologues not covered in HITRAN, calculating vibrational and rotational constants through quantum chemical calculations. This allowed us to model subtle isotopic shifts induced by $^{13}$C and deuterium substitution, enabling accurate isotopologue detection in astrophysical environments. The Python package developed in this study facilitates efficient $\chi^2$ fitting and isotopic ratio analysis, making it a valuable tool for future high-resolution observations. This work highlights the critical role of advanced spectral models and fitting techniques in understanding isotopic fractionation and the chemical evolution of interstellar matter.</description>

      <title>Laboratory rotational spectroscopy leads to the first interstellar detection of singly deuterated methyl mercaptan (CH$_{2}$DSH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an extensive rotational spectroscopic analysis of singly deuterated methyl mercaptan (CH$_{2}$DSH) using both millimeter and far-infrared synchrotron spectra to achieve a global torsional analysis of the three lowest torsional substates (e$_{0}$, e$_{1}$, and o$_{1}$) of this non-rigid species. A fit including 3419 millimeter wave transitions along with 43 infrared torsional subband centers was performed with root mean square deviations of 0.233 MHz and 0.270 cm$^{-1}$, respectively, resulting in 68 fit parameters. A spectroscopic catalogue built from this analysis for a temperature of 125 K has led to the first interstellar detection of CH$_{2}$DSH towards the Solar-like protostar IRAS 16293-2422 B. We report the identification of 46 transitions, including eight relatively unblended lines, resulting in a derived column density of (3.0$\pm$0.3)$\times$10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$. The column density ratio for HDCS/CH$_{2}$DSH compared to HDCO/CH$_{2}$DOH suggests a difference in the interstellar chemistry between the sulphur and oxygen complex organics, in particular a different link between H$_{2}$CO and CH$_{3}$OH and between H$_{2}$CS and CH$_{3}$SH. This is the first interstellar detection of a deuterated sulphur-bearing COM and therefore an important step into understanding the chemical origin of sulphur-based prebiotics.</description>

      <title>Mass and Metal Flows in Isolated IllustrisTNG Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cicumgalactic medium (CGM) is a reservoir of metals and star-forming fuel. Most baryons in the universe are in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) or intergalactic medium (IGM). The baryon cycle -- how mass and metals reach the CGM from the inner regions of the galaxy and how gas from the CGM replenishes star-forming activity in the inner regions -- is an essential question in galaxy evolution. In this paper, we study the flow of mass and metals in a stacked sample of 2770 isolated halos from the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamic simulation. The mean gas flow as a function of radius and angle is similar across a large galactic mass range when accounting for different feedback modes. Although both star formation and black holes cause powerful outflows, the flows from star formation are more angularly restricted. Black hole feedback dominates massflow throughout the halo, while star-formation feedback mainly affects the inner region. When scaling by virial radius ($R_v$), large dynamical changes occur at $0.2R_v$ for most halos, suggesting a characteristic size for the inner galaxy. Despite radio mode feedback from black holes being the primary quenching mechanism in IllustrisTNG, a small population of high mass radio mode disks are able to form stars.</description>

      <title>Grain Alignment and Dust Evolution Physics with Polarisation (GRADE-POL). I. Dust Polarisation Modelling for Isolated Starless Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarisation of light induced by aligned interstellar dust serves as a significant tool in investigating cosmic magnetic fields, dust properties, and poses a challenge in characterising the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background and other sources. To establish dust polarisation as a reliable tool, the physics of the grain alignment process needs to be studied thoroughly. The Magnetically enhanced Radiative Torque (MRAT) alignment is the only mechanism that can induce highly efficient alignment of grains with magnetic fields required by polarisation observations of the diffuse interstellar medium. Here, we aim to test the MRAT mechanism in starless cores using the multiwavelength polarisation from optical/NIR to far-IR/submm. Our numerical modelling of dust polarisation using the MRAT theory demonstrated that the alignment efficiency of starlight polarisation ($p_{\rm ext}/A_{\rm V}$) and the degree of thermal dust polarisation ($p_{\rm em}$) first decrease slowly with increasing visual extinction ($A_{\rm V}$) and then falls steeply as $\propto A^{-1}_{\rm V}$ at large $A_{\rm V}$ due to the loss of grain alignment, which explains the phenomenon known as polarisation holes. Visual extinction at the transition from shallow to steep slope ($A^{\rm loss}_{\rm V}$) increases with the maximum grain size. By applying physical profiles suitable for a starless core Pipe-109, our model successfully reproduces the existing observations of starlight polarisation at R-band ($0.65\,\mu$m) and H-band ($1.65\,\mu$m), as well as emission polarisation at submillimeter ($850\,\mu$m). Successful modelling of observational data requires perfect alignment of large grains as evidence of the MRAT mechanism, and larger maximum size with higher elongation at higher $A_{\rm V}$. The latter reveals the first evidence for the new model of anisotropic grain growth induced by magnetic grain alignment.</description>

      <title>E-INSPIRE -- I. Bridging the gap with the local Universe: Stellar population of a statistical sample of ultra-compact massive galaxies at $z&lt;0.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first effort to Extend the Investigation of Stellar Populations In RElics (E-INSPIRE). We present a catalogue of 430 spectroscopically-confirmed ultra-compact massive galaxies (UCMGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at redshifts $0.01&lt;z&lt;0.3$. This increases the original INSPIRE sample eightfold, bridging the gap with the local Universe. For each object, we compute integrated stellar velocity dispersion, age, metallicity, and [Mg/Fe] through spectroscopic stellar population analysis. We infer star formation histories (SFHs), metallicity evolution histories (MEHs) and compute the Degree of Relicness (DoR) of each object. The UCMGs, covering a wide range of DoR from 0.05 to 0.88, can be divided into three groups, according to how extreme their SFH was. The first group consists of 81 extreme relics ($\text{DoR}\gtrsim0.6$) that have formed the totality of their stellar mass by $z\sim2$ and have super-solar metallicities at all cosmic epochs. The second group ($0.3\lesssim\text{DoR}\lesssim0.6$) contains 293 objects also characterised by peaked SFHs but with a small percentage of later-formed stars and with a variety of MEHs. The third group ($\text{DoR}\lesssim0.3$), has 56 objects that cannot be considered relics since they have extended SFHs and formed a non-negligible fraction ($&gt;25\%$) of their stellar mass at $z&lt;2$. We confirm that an efficient method of finding relics is to select UCMGs with large velocity dispersion values but we believe that the most efficient way is to select high velocity dispersion objects that also have super-solar metallicities and high [Mg/Fe].</description>

      <title>Measuring the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation at $\sim10^{10}$ Solar masses, using space-based imaging of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) embodies the joint evolution of galaxies and their host dark matter halos. However, the relation is poorly constrained at sub-galactic masses, because the stellar emission from such objects is so faint. However, it is possible to directly detect the mass of halos along the line of sight to a strong gravitational lens, when they perturb one of its multiple images. Space telescopes including Euclid, CSST, and Roman will soon discover millions of galaxy-galaxy strong lensing systems. We simulate Euclid-like imaging of a typical lens galaxy, and find that a lensing reconstruction is sensitive to $3\times10^{10}$ subhalos with various positions and concentrations, at statistical signficance $&gt;$$3.6\sigma$. The subhalo mass can be measured without bias, provided the model simultaneously fits light from both the main lens and the subhalo. A future sample of 48 subhalos with $\geqslant$$5\sigma$ detection significance would constrain the SHMR at this mass range with $1\sigma$ uncertainty of 0.045 dex: distinguishing between different theoretical predictions at the sub-galactic scale. Follow-up spectroscopy is needed to measure lens and source redshifts; follow-up imaging at greater spatial resolution and depth would substantially improve the measurement, and eliminate false-positives at even lower halo masses.</description>

      <title>Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS): Exploring the nature of ultra-diffuse galaxies in the Hydra-I cluster II. Stellar kinematics and dynamical masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: This paper focuses on a class of galaxies characterised by an extremely low surface brightness: the ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). We used new integral-field spectroscopic data from the ESO Large Programme Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS) project. Aims: Our main goals are addressing the formation channels and investigating possible correlations of their observational properties. In particular, we derive their stellar kinematics and dynamical properties. Methods: We extract the 1D stacked spectrum inside the effective radius to obtain an unbiased measure of $\sigma_{\rm eff}$. To derive the spatially-resolved stellar kinematics, we first apply the Voronoi tessellation algorithm to bin the spaxels in the datacube and then follow the same prescription adopted for the 1D case. In addition, we extract the velocity profiles along the galaxy's major and minor axes. Results: We find that 7 out of 18 UDGs in LEWIS show a mild rotation, 5 do not have evidence of any rotation, and the remaining 6 UDGs are unconstrained cases. This is the first large census of velocity profiles for UDGs. On average, UDGs in LEWIS are characterised by low values of $\sigma_{\rm eff}$, comparable with available values from the literature. In the Faber-Jackson relation plane, we found a group of UDGs consistent with the relation within the errorbars, whereas outliers are objects with non-negligible rotation components. UDGs and LSBs in LEWIS have larger dark matter content than dwarf galaxies with similar total luminosity. We do not find clear correlations between the derived properties and the local environment. Conclusions: Based on the stellar kinematics, two classes of UDGs are found in the Hydra I cluster: the rotating and non-rotating systems. This result, combined with other structural properties, can help to discriminate between the several formation scenarios proposed for UDGs.</description>

      <title>Looking into the faintEst WIth MUSE (LEWIS): Exploring the nature of ultra-diffuse galaxies in the Hydra I cluster III. Untangling UDG 32 from the stripped filaments of NGC 3314A with multi-wavelength data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: UDG 32 is an ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG) candidate in the Hydra I cluster that was discovered in the extended network of stellar filaments of the jellyfish galaxy NGC 3314A. This galaxy is affected by ram pressure stripping and it is hypothesised that UDG 32 may have formed from its stripped material. In this paper, we address whether UDG 32 can be associated with the stripped material of NGC 3314A and constrain its formation scenario in relation to its environment. We use new integral-field spectroscopic data from the MUSE large programme `LEWIS' in conjunction with deep multi-band photometry to constrain the kinematics and stellar populations of UDG 32. The new MUSE data allow us to reveal that the stripped material from NGC 3314A, traced by emission lines such as H$\alpha$, extends much further from its parent galaxy than previously known, completely overlapping with UDG 32 in projection, and with ram pressure induced star formation. We determine the line-of-sight velocity of UDG 32 ($v_{\rm LOS} = 3080\pm120$ km/s) and confirm that UDG 32 is part of the same kinematic structure as NGC 3314A, the Hydra I cluster south-east subgroup. By fitting the UV and optical spectral energy distribution, we constrain the stellar population properties of UDG 32. We determine its mass-weighted age to be $7.7^{+2.9}_{-2.8}$ Gyr and its metallicity to be [M/H] = $0.07^{+0.19}_{-0.32}$ dex. We confirm the presence of two globular clusters (GCs) in the MUSE field of view, bound to the Hydra I cluster rather than to UDG 32, thus part of the Hydra I intracluster GC population. The metal-rich and intermediate-age nature of UDG 32 points towards its formation from pre-enriched material in the south-east group of the Hydra I cluster that was liberated from a more massive galaxy via tidal or ram-pressure stripping, but we cannot establish a direct link to the ram-pressure stripped material from NGC 3314A.</description>

      <title>Dissecting stellar populations with manifold learning I. Validation of the method on a synthetic Milky Way-like galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different stellar populations may be identified through differences in chemical, kinematic, and chronological properties, suggesting the interplay of various physical mechanisms that led to their origin and subsequent evolution. As such, the identification of stellar populations is key for gaining insight into the evolutionary history of the Milky Way galaxy. This task is complicated by the fact that stellar populations share significant overlap in their chrono-chemo-kinematic properties, hindering efforts to identify and define stellar populations. Our goal is to offer a novel and effective methodology that can provide deeper insight into the nonlinear and nonparametric properties of the multidimensional physical parameters that define stellar populations. For this purpose we explore the ability of manifold learning to differentiate stellar populations with minimal assumptions about their number and nature. Manifold learning is an unsupervised machine learning technique that seeks to intelligently identify and disentangle manifolds hidden within the input data. To test this method, we make use of Gaia DR3-like synthetic stellar samples generated from the FIRE-2 cosmological simulations. These represent red-giant stars constrained by asteroseismic data from TESS. We reduce the 5-dimensional input chrono-chemo-kinematic parameter space into 2-dimensional latent space embeddings generated by manifold learning. We then study these embeddings to assess how accurately they represent the original data and whether they contain meaningful information that can be used to discern stellar populations. We conclude that manifold learning possesses promising abilities to differentiate stellar populations when considering realistic observational constraints.</description>

      <title>A MARVEL-ous study of how well galaxy shapes reflect Dark Matter halo shapes in Cold Dark Matter Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 3D shape analysis of both dark matter (DM) and stellar matter (SM) in simulated dwarf galaxies to determine whether stellar shape traces DM shape. Using 80 central and satellite galaxies from three simulation suites (Marvelous Massive Dwarfs, Marvelous Dwarfs, and DC Justice League) spanning stellar masses of $10^6$--$10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, we measure 3D shapes through the moment of inertia tensor at two times the effective radius to derive axis ratios ($C/A$, $B/A$) and triaxiality. We find that stellar shape does indeed follow DM halo shape for our dwarf galaxies. However, the presence of a stellar disk in more massive dwarfs (M$_* \gtrsim 10^{7.5}$ M$_\odot$) pulls the distribution of stellar $C/A$ ratios to lower values, while in lower mass galaxies the gravitational potential remains predominantly shaped by DM. Similarly, stellar triaxiality generally tracks dark matter halo triaxiality, with this relationship being particularly strong for non-disky galaxies though weaker in disky systems. This correlation is reinforced by strong alignment between SM and DM axes, particularly in disk galaxies. Further, we find no detectable difference in either SM or DM shape comparing two different SNe feedback implementations, demonstrating that shape measurements may be robust to different implementations of baryonic feedback in dwarf galaxies. We also observe that a dwarf galaxy's shape is largely unperturbed by recent mergers (with merger ratios $&gt;4$). This comprehensive study demonstrates that stellar shape measurements can serve as a reliable tool for inferring DM shapes in dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Weak-emission-line quasars: A new clue from their optical variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak-emission-line QSOs (WLQs) are an enigmatic subclass of the QSO population, as their optical/UV spectra are marked by abnormally weak (or absent) emission lines. To obtain much-needed additional clues to the origin of this and other known peculiarities of WLQs, we have determined the 'ensemble' optical variability characteristics for a large, well-defined sample of 76 radio-quiet WLQs and also for a matched control sample comprising 603 normal radio-quiet QSOs. This analysis was done using their light-curves recorded in the $g$ and $r$ bands, under the ZTF survey during 2018-2024, with a typical cadence of 3 days. We find that, compared to normal QSOs, WLQs exhibit systematically milder optical variability on month/year-like time scales (by a factor of $\sim$ 1.76$\pm$0.05 in amplitude). We have independently verified this by carrying out an equivalent analysis of the V-band light-curves acquired under the CRTS during 2007- 2014, with a typical cadence of 10 days. This new observational differentiator between WLQs and normal QSOs may provide clues to understanding the intriguing nature of WLQs. It is proposed that the clumpiness of the torus material flowing into the central engine may play a key role in explaining the observed differences between the WLQs and normal QSOs.</description>

      <title>Limb-Brightened Jet in M87 from Anisotropic Nonthermal Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry observations reveal that relativistic jets like the one in M87 have a limb-brightened, double-edged structure. Analytic and numerical models struggle to reproduce this limb-brightening. We propose a model in which we invoke anisotropy in the distribution function of synchrotron-emitting nonthermal electrons such that electron velocities are preferentially directed parallel to magnetic field lines, as suggested by recent particle-in-cell simulations of electron acceleration and the effects of synchrotron cooling. We assume that the energy injected into nonthermal electrons is proportional to the jet Poynting flux, and we account for synchrotron cooling via a broken power-law energy distribution. We implement our emission model in both general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and axisymmetric force-free electrodynamic (GRFFE) jet models and produce simulated jet images at multiple scales and frequencies using polarized general relativistic radiative transfer. We find that the synchrotron emission is concentrated parallel to the local helical magnetic field and that this feature produces limb-brightened jet images on scales ranging from tens of microarcseconds to hundreds of milliarcseconds in M87. We present theoretical predictions for horizon-scale M87 jet images at 230 and 345 GHz that can be tested with next generation instruments. Due to the scale-invariance of the GRMHD and GRFFE models, our emission prescription can be applied to other targets and serve as a foundation for a unified description of limb-brightened synchrotron images of extragalactic jets.</description>

      <title>Modeling APOKASC-3 red giants: I. The first dredge-up and red giant branch bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on two key diagnostics of stellar physics in red giant branch (RGB) stars: the first dredge-up (FDU) of nuclear processed material and the location of the red giant branch bump (RGBB). We compare asteroseismic and spectroscopic APOKASC-3 data with theoretical MESA models. Our FDU predictions have similar mass and metallicity trends to the data, but the observed magnitude of the change in $[{\rm C}/{\rm N}]$ in data is smaller than theoretical predictions by $0.1615 \pm 0.0760 \,({\rm obs}) \pm 0.0108 \,({\rm sys}) \,{\rm dex}$. These results are insensitive to the input physics, but they are at a level consistent with systematic uncertainties in the abundance measurements. When we include observed trends in birth $[{\rm C}/{\rm Fe}]$ and $[{\rm N}/{\rm Fe}]$ in our models, it modestly stretches the metallicity dependent difference relative to the data. We find a well-defined empirical RGBB locus: $\log g = 2.6604 - 0.1832 (M/{\rm M}_\odot-1) + 0.2824 \,[{\rm Fe}/{\rm H}]$. Our model RGBB loci have mass and composition trends that mirror the data, but we find that the observed RGBB is $0.1509 \pm 0.0017 \,({\rm obs}) \pm 0.0182 \,({\rm sys})$ magnitudes higher than predicted across the board, similar to prior literature results. We find that envelope overshooting, proposed solution to reconcile theory with data, increases ${\rm Li}$ destruction during the FDU at higher metallicities, creating tension with depletion observed in GALAH data. We propose ${\rm Li}$ in the FDU as a sensitive test of the RGBB and FDU, and discuss other potential solutions.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Predictions for the Inner Dark Matter Distribution in the Milky Way Informed by Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build a theoretical range for the Milky Way's (MW) inner dark matter (DM) distribution informed by the FIRE-2, Auriga, VINTERGATAN-GM, and TNG50 simulation suites assuming the canonical cold dark matter (CDM) model. The DM density profiles in Auriga, VINTERGATAN-GM, and TNG50 can be approximately modeled using the adiabatic contraction prescription of Gnedin et al. 2004, while FIRE-2 has stronger baryonic feedback, leading to a departure from the adiabatic contraction model. The simulated halos that are adiabatically contracted are close to spherical (axis ratio $q \in [0.75-0.9]$ at $5^\circ$), whereas halos that experience strong baryonic feedback are oblate ($q \in [0.5-0.7]$). Using the adiabatic contraction and strong baryonic feedback models, along with the observed stellar distribution of the MW, the inner logarithmic density slope for CDM in the MW is predicted to range from $ -0.5$ to $-1.3$. The $J$-factor, which determines the DM-annihilation flux, averaged over a solid angle of $5^\circ$ ($10^\circ$) is predicted to span the range $0.8$-$30$ ($0.6$-$10$) $\times 10^{23} \rm{GeV}^2/\rm{cm}^5$. The $D$-factor, which determines the flux due to DM decay, is predicted to be in the range $0.6$-$2$ ($0.5-1$) $\times10^{23} \rm{GeV}/\rm{cm}^2$.

      <title>Refining local-type primordial non-Gaussianity: Sharpened $b_\phi$ constraints through bias expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local-type primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), predicted by many non-minimal models of inflation, creates a scale-dependent contribution to the power spectrum of large-scale structure (LSS) tracers. Its amplitude is characterized by the product $b_\phi f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, where $b_\phi$ is an astrophysical parameter dependent on the properties of the tracer. However, $b_\phi$ exhibits significant secondary dependence on halo concentration and other astrophysical properties, which may bias and weaken the constraints on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating knowledge of the relation between Lagrangian bias parameters and $b_\phi$ can significantly enhance PNG constraints. We employ the Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT) approach at the field-level and a linear regression model to seek a connection between the bias parameters and $b_{\phi}$ for halo and galaxy samples, constructed using the \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulation suite and mimicking the luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. For the fixed-mass halo samples, our full bias model reduces the uncertainty by more than 70\%, with most of that improvement coming from $b_\nabla$, which we find to be an excellent proxy for concentration. For the galaxy samples, our model reduces the uncertainty on $b_\phi$ by 80\% for all tracers. By adopting Lagrangian-bias informed priors on the parameter $b_\phi$, future analyses can thus constrain $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ with less bias and smaller errors.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven M Dwarf Model and Detailed Abundances for $\sim$17,000 M Dwarfs in SDSS-V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cool temperatures of M dwarf atmospheres enable complex molecular chemistry, making robust characterization of M dwarf compositions a long-standing challenge. Recent modifications to spectral synthesis pipelines have enabled more accurate modeling of M dwarf atmospheres, but these methods are too slow for characterizing more than a handful of stars at a time. Data-driven methods such as The Cannon are viable alternatives, and can harness the information content of many M dwarfs from large spectroscopic surveys. Here, we train The Cannon on M dwarfs with FGK binary companions from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper (SDSS-V/MWM), with spectra from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). The FGK-M pairs are assumed to be chemically homogeneous and span $-$0.56 $&lt;$ [Fe/H] $&lt;$ 0.31 dex. The resulting model is capable of inferring M dwarf $T_{\textrm{eff}}$ and elemental abundances for Fe, Mg, Al, Si, C, N, O, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ni with median uncertainties of 13 K and 0.018$-$0.029 dex, respectively. We test the model by verifying that it reproduces reported abundance values of M dwarfs in open clusters and benchmark M dwarf datasets, as well as expected metallicity trends from stellar evolution. We apply the model to 16,590 M dwarfs in SDSS-V/MWM and provide their detailed abundances in our accompanying catalog.</description>

      <title>Mapping Galaxy Images Across Ultraviolet, Visible and Infrared Bands Using Generative Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that generative deep learning can translate galaxy observations across ultraviolet, visible, and infrared photometric bands. Leveraging mock observations from the Illustris simulations, we develop and validate a supervised image-to-image model capable of performing both band interpolation and extrapolation. The resulting trained models exhibit high fidelity in generating outputs, as verified by both general image comparison metrics (MAE, SSIM, PSNR) and specialized astronomical metrics (GINI coefficient, M20). Moreover, we show that our model can be used to predict real-world observations, using data from the DECaLS survey as a case study. These findings highlight the potential of generative learning to augment astronomical datasets, enabling efficient exploration of multi-band information in regions where observations are incomplete. This work opens new pathways for optimizing mission planning, guiding high-resolution follow-ups, and enhancing our understanding of galaxy morphology and evolution.</description>

      <title>Constraining Disk-to-Corona Power Transfer Fraction, Soft X-ray Excess Origin, and Black Hole Spin Population of Type-1 AGN across Mass Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of the accretion disk, its interplay with the X-ray corona, and assessing black hole spin demographics are some open challenges in astrophysics. In this work, we examine the predictions of the standard $\alpha$-disk model, origin of the soft X-ray excess, and measure the black hole spin parameter by applying the updated high-density disk reflection model to the XMM-Newton/NuSTAR broadband (0.3$-$78 keV) X-ray spectra of a sample of Type-1 AGN. Our Bayesian analysis confirms that the high-density relativistic reflection model with a broken power-law emissivity profile can simultaneously fit the soft X-ray excess, broad iron K line, and Compton hump for $\sim$70% of the sample, while an additional warm Comptonization model is still required to describe the observed soft X-ray excess for the remaining sources. Our first-ever calculation of the disk-to-corona power transfer fraction reveals that the fraction of power released from the accretion disk into the hot corona can have diverse values, the sample median of which is $0.7_{-0.4}^{+0.2}$. We find that the transferred power from the accretion disk can potentially soften the X-ray spectrum of the hot corona. The median values of the hot coronal temperature and optical depth for the sample are estimated to be $63_{-11}^{+23}$ keV and $0.85_{-0.27}^{+0.12}$, respectively. Finally, through joint XMM-Newton+NuSTAR relativistic reflection spectroscopy, we systematically constrain the black hole spin parameter across the broad range of black hole masses, $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}) \sim 5.5-9.0$, and increase the available spin measurements in the AGN population by $\sim$20%.</description>

      <title>The Ophiuchus DIsk Survey Employing ALMA (ODISEA): Complete Size Distributions for the 100 Brightest Disks Across Multiplicity and SED Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The size of a protoplanetary disk is a fundamental property, yet most remain unresolved, even in nearby star-forming regions (d $\sim$ 140-200 pc). We present the complete continuum size distribution for the $105$ brightest protoplanetary disks (M$_{\text{dust}}$ $\gtrsim$ 2 M$_{\oplus}$) in the Ophiuchus cloud, obtained from ALMA Band 8 (410 GHz) observations at 0.05$^{\prime\prime}$ (7 au) to 0.15$^{\prime\prime}$ (21 au) resolution. This sample includes 54 Class II and 51 Class I and Flat Spectrum sources, providing a comprehensive distribution across evolutionary stages. We measure the Half Width at Half Maximum (HWHM) and the radius encircling $68\%$ of the flux ($R_{68\%}$) for most non-binary disks, yielding the largest flux-limited sample of resolved disks in any star-forming region. The distribution is log-normal with a median value of $\sim$14 au and a logarithmic standard deviation $\sigma_{\log} = 0.46$ (factor of 2.9 in linear scale). Disks in close binary systems ($&lt;$ 200 au separation) have smaller radii, with median value of $\sim$5 au, indicating efficient radial drift as predicted by dust evolution models. The size distribution for young embedded objects (SED Class I and Flat Spectrum, age $\lesssim$ 1 Myr) is similar to that of Class II objects (age $\sim$ a few Myr), implying that pressure bumps must be common at early disk stages to prevent mm-sized particle migration at au scales.</description>

      <title>Disks around young free-floating planetary-mass objects: Ultradeep Spitzer imaging of IC348</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks have been found around free-floating objects with masses comparable to those of giant planets. The frequency and properties of these disks around planetary-mass objects are still debated. Here we present ultradeep mid-infrared images for the young cluster IC348, obtained through stacking of time series images from Spitzer. We measure fluxes at 3.6 and 4.5 microns for known free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs, spectral type M9 or later) in this cluster. By comparing the observed infrared spectral energy distributions with photospheric templates, we identify six planetary-mass objects with disks, plus three which may or may not have a disk. This corresponds to a disk fraction of 46% (34-59%). The disk fraction among planetary-mass objects is comparable to more massive brown dwarfs. We show the disk fraction among free-floating planetary-mass objects as a function of age, demonstrating that these objects retain disks for several million years, similar to low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the deflections of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in several widely used models of the coherent Galactic magnetic field (GMF), including PT11 (Pshirkov et al. [1]), JF12 (Jansson and Farrar [2]), UF23 (Unger and Farrar [3]) and KST24 (Korochkin, Semikoz, and Tinyakov [4]). We propagate particles with rigidities of 5, 10, and 20 EV and analyze the differences in deflection predictions across these GMF models. We identify the GMF components responsible for deflections in various regions of the sky and discuss the uncertainties in modeling these components, as well as potential future improvements.</description>

      <title>Line-of-sight shear in SLACS strong lenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneities along the line of sight in strong gravitational lensing distort the images produced, in an effect called shear. If measurable, this shear may provide independent constraints on cosmological parameters, complementary to traditional cosmic shear. We model 50 strong gravitational lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) catalogue with the aim of measuring the line-of-sight (LOS) shear for the first time. We use the `minimal model' for the LOS shear, which has been shown to be theoretically safe from degeneracies with lens model parameters, a finding which has been confirmed using mock data. We use the dolphin automated modelling pipeline, which uses the lenstronomy software as a modelling engine, to model our selected lenses. We model the main deflector with an elliptical power law profile, the lens light with elliptical S\'ersic profiles and the source with a basis set of shapelets and an elliptical S\'ersic profile. We successfully obtain a line-of-sight shear measurement from 18 of the 50 lenses. We find that these LOS shear measurements are consistent with external shears measured in recent works using a simpler shear model, which are larger than those expected from weak lensing. Neglecting the post-Born correction to the potential of the main deflector due to foreground shear leads to a propagation of degeneracies to the LOS shear measurement, and the same effect is seen if a prior is used to connect the lens mass and light ellipticities. The inclusion of an octupole moment in the lens mass profile does not lead to shear measurements that are in better agreement with the expectations from weak lensing.</description>

      <title>TiDES: The 4MOST Time Domain Extragalactic Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Time Domain Extragalactic Survey (TiDES) conducted on the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) will perform spectroscopic follow-up of extragalactic transients discovered in the era of the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory. TiDES will conduct a 5-year survey, covering ${&gt;}14\,000\,\mathrm{square\, degrees}$, and use around 250 000 fibre hours to address three main science goals: (i) spectroscopic observations of ${&gt;}30 000$ live transients, (ii) comprehensive follow-up of ${&gt;}200 000$ host galaxies to obtain redshift measurements, and (iii) repeat spectroscopic observations of Active Galactic Nuclei to enable reverberation mapping studies. The live spectra from TiDES will be used to reveal the diversity and astrophysics of both normal and exotic supernovae across the luminosity-timescale plane. The extensive host-galaxy redshift campaign will allow exploitation of the larger sample of supernovae and improve photometric classification, providing the largest-ever sample of spec-confirmed type Ia supernovae, capable of a sub-2 per cent measurement of the equation-of-state of dark energy. Finally, the TiDES reverberation mapping experiment of 700--1\,000 AGN will complement the SN Ia sample and extend the Hubble diagram to $z\sim2.5$</description>

      <title>Azimuthal metallicity variations, spiral structure, and the failure of radial actions based on assuming axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study azimuthal variations in the mean stellar metallicity, &lt;[Fe/H]&gt;, in a self-consistent, isolated simulation in which all stars form out of gas. We find &lt;[Fe/H]&gt; variations comparable to those observed in the Milky Way and which are coincident with the spiral density waves. The azimuthal variations are present in young and old stars and therefore are not a result of recently formed stars. Similar variations are present in the mean age and alpha-abundance. We measure the pattern speeds of the &lt;[Fe/H]&gt;-variations and find that they match those of the spirals, indicating that spirals are the cause of the metallicity patterns. Because younger stellar populations are not just more [Fe/H]-rich and alpha-poor but also dynamically cooler, we expect them to more strongly support spirals, which is indeed the case in the simulation. However, if we measure the radial action, J_R, using the Stackel axisymmetric approximation, we find that the spiral ridges are traced by regions of high J_R, contrary to expectations. Assuming that the passage of stars through the spirals leads to unphysical variations in the measured J_R, we obtain an improved estimate of J_R by averaging over a 1 Gyr time interval. This time-averaged J_R is a much better tracer of the spiral structure, with minima at the spiral ridges. We conclude that the errors incurred by the axisymmetric approximation introduce correlated deviations large enough to render the instantaneous radial actions inadequate for tracing spirals.</description>

      <title>Is the James Webb Space Telescope detecting too many AGN candidates?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In less than two years of operation, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has already accelerated significantly our quest to identify active massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years of the Universe's history. At the time of writing, about 50 AGN detections and candidates have been identified through spectroscopy, photometry, and/or morphology. Broad-line AGN are about a hundred times more numerous than the faint end of the UV-bright quasar population at z~5-6. In this paper, we compare the observational constraints on the abundance of these AGN at z~5 to the populations of AGN produced in large-scale cosmological simulations. Assuming a null fraction of obscured simulated AGN, we find that while some simulations produce more AGN than discovered so far, some others produce a similar abundance or even fewer AGN in the bolometric luminosity range probed by JWST. Keeping in mind the large uncertainty on the constraints, we discuss the implications for the theoretical modeling of BH formation and evolution in case similar constraints continue to accumulate. At the redshift of interest, the simulated AGN populations diverge the most at Lbol~1e44 erg/s (by more than a dex in the bolometric luminosity function). This regime is most affected by incompleteness in JWST surveys. However, it holds significant potential for constraining the physical processes determining the assembly of BHs (e.g., seeding, feedback from supernova and AGN) and the current abundance of broad-line AGN with &gt;1e44.5 erg/s.</description>

      <title>The evolution of low-mass central galaxies in the vicinity of massive structures and its impact on the two-halo conformity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the population of low-mass central galaxies with Mstar = $10^{9.5}-10^{10}$ Msun/h, inhabiting regions near massive groups and clusters of galaxies using the TNG300 and MDPL2-SAG simulations. We set out to study their evolutionary histories, aiming to find hints about the large-scale conformity signal they produce. We also used a control sample of central galaxies with the same stellar mass range located far away from massive structures. For both samples, we find a subpopulation of galaxies accreted by another halo in the past, but now considered central galaxies; we refer to these objects as former satellites. The number of former satellites is higher for quenched central galaxies near massive systems, with fractions of 45% and 17% in TNG300 and MDPL2-SAG. Our results in TNG300 show that former satellites pollute the sample of central galaxies because they suffered environmental processes when they were satellites hosted typically by massive dark matter halos (M200 $\geq 10^{13}$ Msun/h) since z$\lesssim$0.5. After removing former satellites, the evolutionary trends for quenched central galaxies near massive structures are fairly similar to those of the quenched control galaxies, showing small differences at low redshift. For MDPL2-SAG instead, former satellites were hosted by less massive halos, with a mean halo mass around $10^{11.4}$ Msun/h, and the evolutionary trends remain equal before and after removing former satellite galaxies. We also measured the two-halo conformity, i.e, the correlation in the sSFR between low-mass central galaxies and their neighbors at Mpc scales, and how former satellites contribute to the signal at three different redshifts: z=0, 0.3, and 1. The time evolution of the conformity signal in the simulations presents apparent contradictory results: it decreases from z=0 to z=1 in MDPL2-SAG, while it increases in TNG300 (abridged).</description>

      <title>The AURORA Survey: A New Era of Emission-line Diagrams with JWST/NIRSpec</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00157v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present results on the emission-line properties of z=1.4-7.5 star-forming galaxies in the Assembly of Ultradeep Rest-optical Observations Revealing Astrophysics (AURORA) Cycle 1 JWST/NIRSpec program. Based on its depth, continuous wavelength coverage from 1--5 microns, and medium spectral resolution (R~1000), AURORA includes detections of a large suite of nebular emission lines spanning a broad range in rest wavelength. We investigate the locations of AURORA galaxies in multiple different emission-line diagrams, including traditional "BPT" diagrams of [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha, and [OI]/Halpha, and the "ionization-metallicity" diagram of [OIII]/[OII] (O32) vs. ([OIII]+[OII])/Hbeta (R23). We also consider a bluer rest-frame "ionization-metallicity" diagram introduced recently to characterize z&gt;10 galaxies: [NeIII]/[OII] vs. ([NeIII]+[OII])/Hdelta; as well as longer-wavelength diagnostic diagrams extending into the rest-frame near-IR: [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [SIII]/[SII] (S32); and HeI/Pagamma and [SIII]/Pagamma vs. [FeII]/Pabeta. With a significant boost in signal-to-noise and large, representative samples of individual galaxy detections, the AURORA emission-line diagrams presented here definitively confirm a physical picture in which chemically-young, alpha-enhanced, massive stars photoionize the ISM in distant galaxies with a harder ionizing spectrum at fixed nebular metallicity than in their z~0 counterparts. We also uncover previously unseen evolution prior to z~2 in the [OIII]/Hbeta vs. [NII]/Halpha diagram, which motivates deep NIRSpec observations at even higher redshift. Finally, we present the first statistical sample of rest-frame near-IR emission-line diagnostics in star-forming galaxies at high redshift. In order to truly interpret rest-frame near-IR line ratios including [FeII], we must obtain better constraints on dust depletion in the high-redshift ISM.</description>

      <title>Host Galaxy Demographics Of Individually Detectable Supermassive Black-hole Binaries with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>

Abstract: Massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) produce gravitational waves (GWs) that are detectable with pulsar timing arrays. We determine the properties of the host galaxies of simulated MBHBs at the time they are producing detectable GW signals. The population of MBHB systems we evaluate is from the \textit{Illustris} cosmological simulations taken in tandem with post processing semi-analytic models of environmental factors in the evolution of binaries. Upon evolving to the GW frequency regime accessible by pulsar timing arrays, we calculate the detection probability of each system using a variety of different values for pulsar noise characteristics in a plausible near-future International Pulsar Timing Array dataset. We find that detectable systems have host galaxies that are clearly distinct from the overall binary population and from most galaxies in general. With conservative noise factors, we find that host stellar metallicity, for example, peaks at $\sim 2 Z_\odot$ as opposed to the total population of galaxies which peaks at $\sim 0.6 Z_\odot$. Additionally, the most detectable systems are much brighter in magnitude and more red in color than the overall population, indicating their likely identity as large ellipticals with diminished star formation. These results can be used to develop effective search strategies for identifying host galaxies and electromagnetic counterparts following GW detection by pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>A Pride of Satellites in the Constellation Leo? Discovery of the Leo VI Milky Way Satellite Galaxy with DELVE Early Data Release 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of an ultra-faint Milky Way (MW) satellite in the constellation of Leo. This system was discovered as a spatial overdensity of resolved stars observed with Dark Energy Camera (DECam) data from an early version of the third data release of the DECam Local Volume Exploration survey (DELVE EDR3). The low luminosity ($M_V = -3.56_{-0.37}^{+0.47}$ ; $L_V = 2300_{-700}^{+1200} L_\odot$), large size ($R_{1/2} = 90_{-30}^{+30}$ pc), and large heliocentric distance ($D = 111_{-6}^{+9}$ kpc) are all consistent with the population of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs). Using Keck/DEIMOS observations of the system, we were able to spectroscopically confirm nine member stars, while measuring a tentative mass-to-light ratio of $700_{-500}^{+1400} M_\odot/L_\odot$ and a non-zero metallicity dispersion of $\sigma_{[\rm Fe/H]}=0.19_{-0.11}^{+0.14}$, further confirming Leo VI's identity as an UFD. While the system has a highly elliptical shape, $\epsilon = 0.54_{-0.29}^{+0.19}$, we do not find any conclusive evidence that it is tidally disrupting. Moreover, despite the apparent on-sky proximity of Leo VI to members of the proposed Crater-Leo infall group, its smaller heliocentric distance and inconsistent position in energy-angular momentum space make it unlikely that Leo VI is part of the proposed infall group.</description>

      <title>A candidate quadruple AGN system at $z \sim 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at kiloparsec separation from each other are exceedingly rare, and in fact, only one quadruple AGN is known so far. These extreme density peaks are expected to pinpoint protocluster environments and therefore be surrounded by large galaxy overdensities. In this letter, we present another quadruple AGN candidate at $z \sim 3$ including two SDSS quasars at a separation of roughly 480 kpc. The brighter quasar is accompanied by two AGN candidates (a type 1 AGN and a likely type 2 quasar) at close ($\sim 20$ kpc) separation identified through emission line ratios, line widths and high ionization lines like NV$\lambda1240$. The extended Ly$\alpha$ emission associated with the close triple system is more modest in extent and brightness compared to similar multiple AGN systems and could be caused by ram-pressure stripping of the type-2 quasar host during infall into the central dark matter halo. The predicted evolution of the system into a $z=0$ galaxy cluster with the AGN host galaxies forming the brightest cluster galaxy needs to be further tested by galaxy overdensity studies on large scales around the quadruple AGN candidate. If confirmed as a quadruple AGN with X-ray observations or rest-frame optical line ratios, this system would represent the second AGN quartet, the highest-redshift multiplet and the closest high-redshift triplet known.</description>

      <title>Probing Three-Dimensional Magnetic Fields: IV -- Synchrotron Polarization Derivative and Vision Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring the 3D spatial distribution of magnetic fields in the interstellar medium and the intracluster medium is crucial yet challenging. The probing of 3D magnetic field's 3D distribution, including the field plane-of-sky orientation ($\psi$), the magnetic field's inclination angle ($\gamma$) relative to the line of sight, and magnetization ($\sim$ the inverse Alfv\'en Mach number $M_A^{-1}$), at different distances from the observer makes the task even more formidable. However, the anisotropy and Faraday decorrelation effect in polarized synchrotron emission offers a unique solution. We show that due to the Faraday decorrelation, only regions up to a certain effective path length along the line of sight contribute to the statistical correlation of the measured polarization. The 3D spatial information can be consequently derived from synchrotron polarization derivatives (SPDs), which are calculated from the difference in synchrotron polarization across two wavelengths. We find that the 3D magnetic field can be estimated from the anisotropy observed in SPD: the elongation direction of the SPD structures probes $\psi$ and the degree of SPD anisotropy, along with its morphological curvature, provides insights into $M_A^{-1}$ and $\gamma$. To extract these anisotropic features and their correlation with the 3D magnetic field, we propose utilizing a machine learning approach, specifically the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, which was exemplified by the success of the ChatGPT. We train the ViT using synthetic synchrotron observations generated from MHD turbulence simulations in sub-Alfv\'enic and super-Alfv\'enic conditions. We show that ViT's application to multi-wavelength SPDs can successfully reconstruct the 3D magnetic fields' 3D spatial distribution.</description>

      <title>Future prospects for measuring 1PPN parameters using observations of S2 and S62 at the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Parameterized Post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism offers an agnostic framework for evaluating theories of gravity that extend beyond General Relativity. Departures from General Relativity are represented by a set of dimensionless parameters that, at the first order in the expansion, reduce to $\beta$ and $\gamma$, which describe deviations in spatial curvature and non-linear superposition effects of gravity, respectively. We exploit future observations of stars at the Galactic Center, orbiting the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, to forecast the ability to constrain the first-order PPN parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$. We have generated a mock catalog of astrometric and spectroscopic data for S2, based on the Schwarzschild metric, simulating observations over multiple orbital periods with the GRAVITY and SINFONI instruments. Our analysis includes the effects of relativistic orbital precession and line-of-sight (LOS) velocity gravitational redshift. Since future data for S2 can provide constraints only on a linear combination of the PPN parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ we also analyzed the impact of future observations of the gravitational lensing for stars that pass closer in the sky to Sgr A*, like the known star S62, which can potentially provide tight constraints on the parameter $\gamma$, that alone regulates the amplitude of the astrometric deviations due to lensing. When combining lensing observations for S62, and the precise orbital tracking of S2, one obtains independent constraints on both $\gamma$ (with a potential precision as good as $\sim 1\%$) and $\beta$ (with a corresponding precision of $\sim 2\%$), providing a precision test of General Relativity and its extensions.</description>

      <title>Star Formation History of the Local Group Dwarf Irregular Galaxy, NGC 6822</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NGC 6822 is an isolated dwarf irregular galaxy in the local group at a distance of 490 kpc. In this paper, we present the star formation history (SFH) within a field with a radius of 3 kpc, beyond the optical body of the galaxy (1.2 kpc). We utilized a novel method based on evolved asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We collected the Near infrared data of 329 variable stars, including long-period and amplitude variables and Carbon-rich AGB stars. We used stellar evolutionary track and theoretical isochrones to obtain the birth mass, age, and pulsation duration of the detected stars to calculate the star formation rate (SFR) and trace the SFH of the galaxy. We studied the star formation history of the galaxy for the mean metallicity value (Z) of 0.003. We reconstructed the SFH for two regions. The bar region, a central rectangular area, and the outer region, which covers a circular field beyond the bar region and extends to a radius of 3 kpc. Our results show a significant burst of star formation around 2.6 and 2.9 Gyr ago in the bar and outer regions, respectively. Additionally, we observed a notable enhancement in the SFR in the bar region over the past 200 Myr.</description>

      <title>Physical characterization of the FeLoBAL outflow in SDSS J0932+0840: Analysis of VLT/UVES observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: The study of quasar outflows is essential in understanding the connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies. We analyze the VLT/UVES spectrum of quasar SDSS J0932+0840 and identify several narrow and broad outflow components in absorption, with multiple ionization species including Fe II, which puts it among a rare class of outflows known as FeLoBALs. Aims: We study one of the outflow components to determine its physical characteristics by determining the total hydrogen column density, ionization parameter and the hydrogen number density. Through these parameters, we aim to obtain the distance of the outflow from the central source, its mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity, and to constrain the contribution of the outflow to AGN feedback. Methods: We obtain the ionic column densities from the absorption troughs in the spectrum, and use photoionization modeling to extract the physical parameters of the outflow, including the total hydrogen column density and ionization parameter. The relative population of the observed excited states of Fe II is used to model the hydrogen number density of the outflow. Results: We use the Fe II excited states to model the electron number density ($n_e$) and hydrogen number density ($n_H$) independently and obtain $n_e$ $\simeq$ $10^{3.4}$ cm$^{-3}$ and $n_H$ $\simeq$ $10^{4.8}$ cm$^{-3}$. Our analysis of the physical structure of the cloud shows that these two results are consistent with each other. This places the outflow system at a distance of $0.7_{-0.4}^{+0.9}$ kpc from the central source, with mass flow rate ($\dot{M}$) of $43^{+65}_{-26}$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and kinetic luminosity ($\dot{E_k}$) of $0.7^{+1.1}_{-0.4}$ $\times$ $10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$.</description>

Abstract: Dense, cold gas is the key ingredient for star formation. Over the last two decades, HCN(1-0) emission has been utilised as the most accessible dense gas tracer to study external galaxies. We present new measurements tracing the relationship between dense gas tracers, bulk molecular gas tracers, and star formation in the ALMA ALMOND survey, the largest sample of resolved (1-2 kpc resolution) HCN maps of galaxies in the local universe (d &lt; 25 Mpc). We measure HCN/CO, a line ratio sensitive to the physical density distribution, and SFR/HCN, a proxy for the dense gas star formation efficiency, as a function of molecular gas surface density, stellar mass surface density, and dynamical equilibrium pressure across 31 galaxies, increasing the number of galaxies by a factor of &gt; 3 over the previous largest such study (EMPIRE). HCN/CO increases (slope of ~ 0.5 and scatter of ~ 0.2 dex), while SFR/HCN decreases (slope of ~ -0.6 and scatter of ~ 0.4 dex) with increasing molecular gas surface density, stellar mass surface density and pressure. Galaxy centres with high stellar mass surface density show a factor of a few higher HCN/CO and lower SFR/HCN compared to the disc average, but both environments follow the same average trend. Our results emphasise that molecular gas properties vary systematically with the galactic environment and demonstrate that the scatter in the Gao-Solomon relation (SFR against HCN) is of physical origin.</description>

      <title>Accelerating lensed quasar discovery and modeling with physics-informed variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strongly lensed quasars provide valuable insights into the rate of cosmic expansion, the distribution of dark matter in foreground deflectors, and the characteristics of quasar hosts. However, detecting them in astronomical images is difficult due to the prevalence of non-lensing objects. To address this challenge, we developed a generative deep learning model called VariLens, built upon a physics-informed variational autoencoder. This model seamlessly integrates three essential modules: image reconstruction, object classification, and lens modeling, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to strong lens analysis. VariLens is capable of rapidly determining both (1) the probability that an object is a lens system and (2) key parameters of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model -- including the Einstein radius ($\theta_\mathrm{E}$), lens center, and ellipticity -- in just milliseconds using a single CPU. A direct comparison of VariLens estimates with traditional lens modeling for 20 known lensed quasars within the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) footprint shows good agreement, with both results consistent within $2\sigma$ for systems with $\theta_\mathrm{E}&lt;3$ arcsecs. To identify new lensed quasar candidates, we begin with an initial sample of approximately 80 million sources, combining HSC data with multiwavelength information from various surveys. After applying a photometric preselection aimed at locating $z&gt;1.5$ sources, the number of candidates was reduced to 710,966. Subsequently, VariLens highlights 13,831 sources, each showing a high likelihood of being a lens. A visual assessment of these objects results in 42 promising candidates that await spectroscopic confirmation. These results underscore the potential of automated deep learning pipelines to efficiently detect and model strong lenses in large datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation time scales of quiescent galaxies can be estimated in two different ways: by their star formation history and by their chemistry. Previously, the methods yielded conflicting results, especially when considering $\alpha$-enhanced objects. This is primarily due to the time resolution limitations of very old stellar populations, which prevent accurately constraining their star formation histories. We analysed the JWST observations of the extremely massive galaxy ZF-UDS-7329 at z$\sim$3.2 and show that the higher time resolution necessary to match the chemical formation time scales using stellar population synthesis can be achieved by studying galaxies at high redshift. We compare the massive galaxy to the well-known relic galaxy NGC~1277, arguing that ZF-UDS-7329 is an early Universe example of the cores of present-day massive elliptical galaxies or, if left untouched, a relic galaxy.</description>

      <title>Field-level simulation-based inference with galaxy catalogs: the impact of systematic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that a powerful way to constrain cosmological parameters from galaxy redshift surveys is to train graph neural networks to perform field-level likelihood-free inference without imposing cuts on scale. In particular, de Santi et al. (2023) developed models that could accurately infer the value of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ from catalogs that only contain the positions and radial velocities of galaxies that are robust to uncertainties in astrophysics and subgrid models. However, observations are affected by many effects, including 1) masking, 2) uncertainties in peculiar velocities and radial distances, and 3) different galaxy selections. Moreover, observations only allow us to measure redshift, intertwining galaxies' radial positions and velocities. In this paper we train and test our models on galaxy catalogs, created from thousands of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations run with different codes from the CAMELS project, that incorporate these observational effects. We find that, although the presence of these effects degrades the precision and accuracy of the models, and increases the fraction of catalogs where the model breaks down, the fraction of galaxy catalogs where the model performs well is over 90 %, demonstrating the potential of these models to constrain cosmological parameters even when applied to real data.</description>

Abstract: The Cygnus region, which contains massive molecular and atomic clouds and young stars, is a promising Galactic neutrino source candidate. Cosmic rays transport in the region can produce neutrinos and $\gamma$-rays. Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) detected an ultrahigh-energy $\gamma$-ray bubble (Cygnus Bubble) in this region. Using publicly available track events detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in 7 years of full detector operation, we conduct searches for correlated neutrino signals from the Cygnus Bubble with neutrino emission templates based on LHAASO $\gamma$-ray observations. No significant signals were found for any employed templates. With the 7 TeV $\gamma$-ray flux template, we set a flux upper limit of 90% confidence level (C.L.) for the neutrino emission from the Cygnus Bubble to be $5.7\times10^{-13}\, \mathrm{TeV}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at 5 TeV.</description>

      <title>Disentangling transients and their host galaxies with Scarlet2: A framework to forward model multi-epoch imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many science cases for wide-field time-domain surveys rely on accurate identification and characterization of the galaxies hosting transient and variable objects. In the era of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory the number of known transient and variable sources will grow by orders of magnitude, and many of these sources will be blended with their host galaxies and neighboring galaxies. A diverse range of applications - including the classification of nuclear and non-nuclear sources, identification of potential host galaxies, extraction of host galaxy SEDs without requiring a transient-free reference image, and combined analysis of photometry from multiple surveys - will benefit from a flexible framework to model time-domain imaging of transients. We describe a time-domain extension of the Scarlet2 scene modeling code for multi-epoch, multi-band, and multi-resolution imaging data to extract simultaneous transient and host galaxy models. Scarlet2 leverages the benefits of data-driven priors on galaxy morphology, is fully GPU compatible, and can jointly model multi-resolution data from ground and space-based surveys. We demonstrate the method on simulated LSST-like supernova imaging, low-resolution Zwicky Transient Facility imaging of tidal disruption events, and Hyper Suprime Cam imaging of variable AGN out to z = 4 in the COSMOS fields. We show that Scarlet2 models provide accurate transient and host galaxy models as well as accurate measurement of host-transient spatial offsets, and demonstrate future applications to the search for 'wandering' massive black holes.</description>

      <title>Two-temperature treatments in magnetically arrested disk GRMHD simulations more accurately predict light curves of Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) observed the Galactic centre source Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) and used emission models primarily based on single ion temperature (1T) general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. This predicted emission is strongly dependent on a modelled prescription of the ion-to-electron temperature ratio. The most promising models are magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states. However, nearly all MAD models exhibit larger temporal fluctuations in radiative submillimetre emission compared to observations. This limitation possibly stems from the fact that the actual temperature ratio depends on microphysical dissipation, radiative processes and other effects not captured in ideal fluid simulations. Therefore, we investigate the effects of two-temperature (2T) thermodynamics in MAD GRMHD simulations of Sgr A*, where the temperatures of both species are evolved. We find that the radiative submillimetre variability more closely matches historical observations when we include the 2T treatment compared to 1T simulations. For the low accretion rates of Sgr A*, a common assumption is to neglect radiative cooling. However, we find that the radiative cooling of electrons-via synchrotron, inverse Compton, and bremsstrahlung processes-reduces the electron temperature in the inner disk, where the EHT observes, by about 10%, which, in turn, decreases both the submillimetre synchrotron flux and its temporal fluctuations compared to uncooled simulations.</description>

      <title>Variability in hot sub-luminous stars and binaries: Machine-learning analysis of Gaia DR3 multi-epoch photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hot sub-luminous stars represent a population of stripped and evolved red giants that is located on the extreme horizontal branch. Since they exhibit a wide range of variability due to pulsations or binary interactions, it is crucial to unveil their intrinsic and extrinsic variability to understand the physical processes of their formation. In the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, they overlap with interacting binaries such as cataclysmic variables (CVs). By leveraging the most recent clustering algorithm tools, we investigate the variability of 1,576 candidate hot subdwarf variables using comprehensive data from Gaia DR3 multi-epoch photometry and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations. We present a novel approach that uses the t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding and the uniform manifold approximation and projection dimensionality reduction algorithms to facilitate the identification and classification of different populations of variable hot subdwarfs and CVs in a large dataset. In addition to the publicly available Gaia time-series statistics table, we adopted additional statistical features that enhanced the performance of the algorithms. The clustering results led to the identification of 85 new hot subdwarf variables based on Gaia and TESS light curves and of 108 new variables based on Gaia light curves alone, including reflection-effect systems, HW Vir, ellipsoidal variables, and high-amplitude pulsating variables. A significant number of known CVs (140) distinctively cluster in the 2D feature space among an additional 152 objects that we consider candidates for new CVs. This study paves the way for more efficient and comprehensive analyses of stellar variability from ground- and space-based observations, and for the application of machine-learning classifications of candidate variable stars in large surveys.</description>

      <title>Learning to See: Applying Inverse Recurrent Inference Machines to See through Refractive Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has produced horizon-resolving images of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A$^*$). Scattering in the turbulent plasma of the interstellar medium distorts the appearance of Sgr A$^*$ on scales only marginally smaller than the fiducial resolution of EHT. Therefore, this process both diffractive blurs and adds stochastic refractive substructures that limits the practical angular resolution of EHT images of Sgr A$^*$. We utilized a novel recurrent neural network machine learning framework to demonstrate that it is possible to mitigate interstellar scattering at wavelengths of $1.3\,{\rm mm}$ near the galactic center up to structures at the scale of $5\mu{as}$ well below the nominal instrumental resolution of EHT, $24\,\mu{\rm as}$.</description>
