      <title>Characteristics of the Invariant Measure of the Strange Attractor of the Bacteria Mathematical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bacteria metabolic process of open nonlinear dissipative system far from equilibrium point is modeled using classical methods of synergetics. The invariant measure and its convergence in the phase space of the system was obtained in strange attractor mode. The distribution of point density of trajectory intersection of phase space cells with maximum invariant measure and convergence in time of its average value was obtained. The result concluded is that the value of an invariant measure can be a characteristic of the transitional process of adaptation of cell metabolic process to change outside environment.</description>

      <title>On novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional non-conservative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present novel Hamiltonian descriptions of some three-dimensional systems including two well-known systems describing the three-wave-interaction problem and some well-known chaotic systems, namely, the Chen, L\"u, and Qi systems. We show that all of these systems can be described in a Hamiltonian framework in which the Poisson matrix $\mathcal{J}$ is supplemented by a resistance matrix $\mathcal{R}$. While such resistive-Hamiltonian systems are manifestly non-conservative, we construct higher-degree Poisson matrices via the Jordan product as $\mathcal{N} = \mathcal{J} \mathcal{R} + \mathcal{R} \mathcal{J}$, thereby leading to new bi-Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we discuss conformal Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds and demonstrate that by appropriately choosing the underlying parameters, the reduced three-wave-interaction model as well as the Chen and L\"u systems can be described in this manner where the concomitant non-conservative part of the dynamics is described with the aid of the Euler vector field.</description>

      <title>Complex multiannual cycles of Mycoplasma pneumoniae: persistence and the role of stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The epidemiological dynamics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae are characterized by complex and poorly understood multiannual cycles, posing challenges for forecasting. Using Bayesian methods to fit a seasonally forced transmission model to long-term surveillance data from Denmark (1958-1995, 2010-2025), we investigate the mechanisms driving recurrent outbreaks of M. pneumoniae. The period of the multiannual cycles (predominantly approx. 5 years in Denmark) are explained as a consequence of the interaction of two time-scales in the system, one intrinsic and one extrinsic (seasonal). While it provides an excellent fit to shorter time series (a few decades), we find that the deterministic model eventually settles into an annual cycle, failing to reproduce the observed 4-5-year periodicity long-term. Upon further analysis, the system is found to exhibit transient chaos and thus high sensitivity to stochasticity. We show that environmental (but not purely demographic) stochasticity can sustain the multi-year cycles via stochastic resonance. The disruptive effects of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on M. pneumoniae circulation constitute a natural experiment on the effects of large perturbations. Consequently, the effects of NPIs are included in the model and medium-term predictions are explored. Our findings highlight the intrinsic sensitivity of M. pneumoniae dynamics to perturbations and interventions, underscoring the limitations of deterministic epidemic models for long-term prediction. More generally, our results emphasize the potential role of stochasticity as a driver of complex cycles across endemic and recurring pathogens.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian chaos for one particle with two waves: Self-consistent dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple model of wave-particle interaction is studied in its self-consistent form, that is, where the particles are allowed to feedback on the waves dynamics. We focus on the configurations of locked solutions (equilibria) and how the energy-momentum exchange mechanism induces chaos in the model. As we explore the system, we analyse the mathematical structure that gives rise to locked states and how the model's non-linearity enables multiple equilibrium amplitudes for waves. We also explain the predominance of regularity as we vary the control parameters and the mechanism behind the emergence of chaos under limited parameter choices.</description>

      <title>Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics &amp; Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon - a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon - within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.</description>

      <title>Quantum chaos on the separatrix of the periodically perturbed Harper model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14926v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the relation between a classical periodic Hamiltonian system and an associated discrete quantum system on a torus in phase space. The model is a sinusoidally perturbed Harper model and is similar to the sinusoidally perturbed pendulum. Separatrices connecting hyperbolic fixed points in the unperturbed classical system become chaotic under sinusoidal perturbation. We numerically compute eigenstates of the Floquet propagator for the associated quantum system. For each propagator eigenstate we compute a Husimi distribution in phase space and an energy and energy dispersion from the expectation value of the unperturbed Hamiltonian operator. The Husimi distribution of each Floquet eigenstate resembles a classical orbit with a similar energy and similar energy dispersion. Chaotic orbits in the mixed classical system are related to Floquet eigenstates that appear ergodic. For a mixed regular and chaotic system, the energy dispersion can separate the Floquet eigenstates into ergodic and integrable subspaces. The width of a chaotic region in the classical system is estimated by integrating the perturbation along a separatrix orbit. We derive a related expression for the associated quantum system from the averaged perturbation in the interaction representation evaluated at states with energy close to the separatrix.</description>
