      <title>Comparison study of counting and fitting methods in search for neutrinoless double beta decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the search for neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) experiments, common methods for sensitivity calculations include the counting method and the spectrum fitting method. This research compares their difference in sensitivity under various energy resolutions. Additionally, the performance of high and low Q-value $0\nu\beta\beta$ isotopes is compared. The results of this research could provide guidance on the choice of methods for sensitivity calculations, energy resolution and $0\nu\beta\beta$ isotopes for future $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments.</description>

      <title>Micromegas with GEM preamplification for enhanced energy threshold in low-background gaseous time projection chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: we develop the concept of a Micromegas (MICRO-MEsh GAseous Structure) readout plane with an additional GEM (Gas Electron Multiplier) preamplification stage placed a few mm above it, to increase the maximum effective gain of the combined readout. We implement it and test it in realistic conditions for its application to low-background dark matter searches like the TREX-DM experiment. Methods: for this, we use a Micromegas of microbulk type, built with radiopure materials. A small test chamber allowing for systematic scanning of voltages and pressures is used. In addition, a TREX-DM full-scale set-up has also been built and tested, featuring a replica of the fully-patterned TREX-DM microbulk readout. Results: we report on GEM effective extra gain factors of about 90, 50 and 20 in 1, 4 and 10 bar of Ar-1%iC$_{4}$H$_{10}$. Conclusions: the results here obtained show promise to lower the threshold of the experiment down to 50 eV$_{ee}$, corresponding to substantially enhanced sensitivity to low-mass WIMPs (Weakly Interacting Massive Particles).</description>

      <title>A Novel Differential Frequency Dielectric Resonator Based Microwave Sensor for Angular Displacement Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A differential frequency microwave sensor for angular displacement detection is reported. A metal strip-loaded cylindrical dielectric resonator (SLCDR) is excited with a 50 ohm microstrip transmission line through a rectangular slot made on its ground plane. Analysis of the transmission coefficient (|S21|) of the circuit shows that for the parallel alignment of SLCDR, dual-transmission zeros are excited at frequencies fL and fH, while for the perpendicular alignment, a single transmission zero is excited at f0 such that fL &lt; f0 &lt; fH. In the range, frequency fL increases towards f0 while fH decreases towards f0. Based on this trend, a differential frequency parameter f = fH-fL is framed as the indicator of the angular displacement following a simulation study with ANSYS HFSS. Subsequent prototype fabrication and VNA measurement confirm the simulations with 15.5 MHz/0 sensitivity over the sensitivity over 900 dynamic range with excellent linearity. Subsequently, using linear inverse regression, the measured differential frequencies are mapped to the angular displacement, and the calculated regression metrics prove very good mapping.</description>

      <title>The Felsenkeller shallow-underground laboratory for nuclear astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Felsenkeller shallow-underground site, protected from cosmic muons by a 45 m thick rock overburden, a research laboratory including a 5 MV Pelletron ion accelerator and a number of radioactivity-measurement setups is located. The laboratory and its installations are described in detail. The background radiation has been studied, finding suppression factors of 40 for cosmic-ray muons, 200 for ambient neutrons, and 100 for the background in germanium $\gamma$-ray detectors. Using an additional active muon veto, typically the background is just twice as high as in very deep underground laboratories. The properties of the accelerator including its external and internal ion sources and beam line are given. For the radioactivity counting setup, detection limits in the 10$^{-4}$ Bq range have been obtained. Practical aspects for the usage of the laboratory by outside scientific users are discussed.</description>

      <title>Advances in Additive Manufacturing of 3D-segmented Plastic Scintillator Detectors for Particle Tracking and Calorimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastic scintillator detectors with three-dimensional granularity and sub-nanosecond time resolution offer simultaneous particle tracking, identification, and calorimetry. However, scaling to larger volumes and finer segmentation poses significant challenges in manufacturing and assembly due to high costs, extensive time, and precision requirements. To address this, the 3DET R\&amp;D collaboration has developed an innovative additive manufacturing approach, allowing for the monolithic fabrication of three-dimensional granular scintillators without the need for additional processing steps. A prototype, featuring a 5 $\times$ 5 $\times$ 5 matrix of optically isolated scintillating voxels integrated with wavelength shifting fibers, was manufactured and tested using cosmic rays and CERN test beams, demonstrating comparable light yield and reduced crosstalk compared to traditional methods. The developed additive manufacturing technique offers a viable, time-efficient, and cost-effective solution for producing next-generation scintillator detectors, maintaining high performance regardless of size and geometric complexity.</description>

      <title>Emittance Minimization for Aberration Correction II: Physics-informed Bayesian Optimization of an Electron Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) has become an essential tool in understanding materials at the atomic scale. However, tuning the aberration corrector to produce a sub-{\AA}ngstr\"om probe is a complex and time-costly procedure, largely due to the difficulty of precisely measuring the optical state of the system. When measurements are both costly and noisy, Bayesian methods provide rapid and efficient optimization. To this end, we develop a Bayesian approach to fully automate the process by minimizing a new quality metric, beam emittance, which is shown to be equivalent to performing aberration correction. In part I, we derived several important properties of the beam emittance metric and trained a deep neural network to predict beam emittance growth from a single Ronchigram. Here we use this as the black box function for Bayesian Optimization and demonstrate automated tuning of simulated and real electron microscopes. We explore different surrogate functions for the Bayesian optimizer and implement a deep neural network kernel to effectively learn the interactions between different control channels without the need to explicitly measure a full set of aberration coefficients. Both simulation and experimental results show the proposed method outperforms conventional approaches by achieving a better optical state with a higher convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Emittance Minimization for Aberration Correction I: Aberration correction of an electron microscope without knowing the aberration coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise alignment of the electron beam is critical for successful application of scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM) to understanding materials at atomic level. Despite the success of aberration correctors, aberration correction is still a complex process. Here we approach aberration correction from the perspective of accelerator physics and show it is equivalent to minimizing the emittance growth of the beam, the span of the phase space distribution of the probe. We train a deep learning model to predict emittance growth from experimentally accessible Ronchigrams. Both simulation and experimental results show the model can capture the emittance variation with aberration coefficients accurately. We further demonstrate the model can act as a fast-executing function for the global optimization of the lens parameters. Our approach enables new ways to quickly quantify and automate aberration correction that takes advantage of the rapid measurements possible with high-speed electron cameras. In part II of the paper, we demonstrate how the emittance metric enables rapid online tuning of the aberration corrector using Bayesian optimization.</description>

      <title>CubeSat single-photon detector module for investigating in-orbit laser annealing to heal radiation damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon avalanche photodiodes (SPADs) based on silicon are widely considered for quantum satellite communications but suffer from an increasing dark count rate (DCR) due to displacement damage in their active areas induced by proton radiation. When the DCR of SPADs exceeds a certain threshold, they become unusable for quantum communication protocols. Previous laboratory experiments have demonstrated that laser annealing of SPADs' active area with about 1~W optical power can significantly reduce radiation-induced DCR of synthetically irradiated SPADs. To assess the feasibility of in-orbit laser annealing on constantly irradiated SPADs in low-Earth orbit, we developed a module with a CubeSat form factor capable of both laser and thermal annealing of four silicon SPADs. Here we report the design and ground testing of this module, investigating laser annealing in a simulated space environment. Our results pave the way for an in-orbit trial that may prove this technology useful for future satellite missions with quantum receivers on board.</description>

      <title>Lower Limits on Scalar Ultralight Dark Matter from Optical Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillations of scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM) at its Compton frequency would couple to fundamental constants to coherently drive the length of nearby Fabry-Perot cavities. Resulting differences in the length of two cavities are searched for in the spectrum of the beat note between lasers traversing the cavities. The new direct ULDM bounds set near 5 kHz and between 20 and 90 kHz are one to two orders of magnitude lower for two model ULDM distributions -- a standard galactic halo, and a relaxion star bound to Earth. Laser filtering and mechanical isolation are critical.</description>

      <title>Improved ICNN-LSTM Model Classification Based on Attitude Sensor Data for Hazardous State Assessment of Magnetic Adhesion Climbing Wall Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic adhesion tracked climbing robots are widely utilized in high-altitude inspection, welding, and cleaning tasks due to their ability to perform various operations against gravity on vertical or inclined walls. However, during operation, the robot may experience overturning torque caused by its own weight and load, which can lead to the detachment of magnetic plates and subsequently pose safety risks. This paper proposes an improved ICNN-LSTM network classification method based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) attitude sensor data for real-time monitoring and assessment of hazardous states in magnetic adhesion tracked climbing robots. Firstly, a data acquisition strategy for attitude sensors capable of capturing minute vibrations is designed. Secondly, a feature extraction and classification model combining an Improved Convolutional Neural Network (ICNN) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network is proposed. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed minute vibration sensing method achieves significant results, and the proposed classification model consistently exhibits high accuracy compared to other models. The research findings provide effective technical support for the safe operation of climbing robots</description>

      <title>Robust Bayesian inference with gapped LISA data using all-in-one TDI-$\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an ESA L-class mission, is designed to detect gravitational waves in the millihertz frequency band, with operations expected to begin in the next decade. LISA will enable studies of astrophysical phenomena such as massive black hole mergers, extreme mass ratio inspirals, and compact binary systems. A key challenge in analyzing LISA's data is the significant laser frequency noise, which must be suppressed using time-delay interferometry (TDI). Classical TDI mitigates this noise by algebraically combining phase measurements taken at different times and spacecraft. However, data gaps caused by instrumental issues or operational interruptions complicate the process. These gaps affect multiple TDI samples due to the time delays inherent to the algorithm, rendering surrounding measurements unusable for parameter inference. In this paper, we apply the recently proposed variant of TDI known as TDI-$\infty$ to astrophysical parameter inference, focusing on the challenge posed by data gaps. TDI-$\infty$ frames the LISA likelihood numerically in terms of raw measurements, marginalizing over laser phase noises under the assumption of infinite noise variance. Additionally, TDI-$\infty$ is set up to incorporate and cancel other noise sources beyond laser noise, including optical bench motion, clock noise, and modulation noise, establishing it as an all-in-one TDI solution. The method gracefully handles measurement interruptions, removing the need to explicitly address discontinuities during template matching. We integrate TDI-$\infty$ into a Bayesian framework, demonstrating its superior performance in scenarios involving gaps. Compared to classical TDI, the method preserves signal integrity more effectively and is particularly interesting for low-latency applications, where the limited amount of available data makes data gaps particularly disruptive.</description>

      <title>Preliminary results on the long term operation of RPCs with eco-friendly gas mixtures under irradiation at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since 2019 a collaboration between researchers from various institutes and experiments (i.e. ATLAS, CMS, ALICE, LHCb/SHiP and the CERN EP-DT group), has been operating several RPCs with diverse electronics, gas gap thicknesses and detector layouts at the CERN Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF++). The studies aim at assessing the performance of RPCs when filled with new eco-friendly gas mixtures in avalanche mode and in view of evaluating possible ageing effects after long high background irradiation periods, e.g. High-Luminosity LHC phase. This challenging research is also part of a task of the European AidaInnova project.
  A promising eco-friendly gas identified for RPC operation is the tetrafluoruropropene (C$_{3}$H$_{2}$F$_{4}$, commercially known as HFO-1234ze) that has been studied at the CERN GIF++ in combination with different percentages of CO$_2$. Between the end of 2021 and 2022 several beam tests have been carried out to establish the performance of RPCs operated with such mixtures before starting the irradiation campaign for the ageing study.
  Results of these tests for different RPCs layouts and different gas mixtures, under increasing background rates are presented here, together with the preliminary outcome of the detector ageing tests.</description>

      <title>The optimal structure of the MRPC detector for 0.511 MeV gamma based on Monte Carlo simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detailed simulation of the Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chambers (MRPCs) provides the performance characteristics of MRPCs with different numbers of gas gaps and gap thicknesses. This helps in optimizing the structure of MRPCs under specific conditions by balancing time resolution, detection efficiency, and other performance metrics. To obtain the optimal structure of MRPCs for 0.511 MeV gammas, a complete simulation framework for gamma detection by the MRPCs based on Geant4 and Magboltz software is described in this paper. The simulation shows how gammas interact with MRPCs and the process of gas ionization, avalanche multiplication, and signal formation. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results. By analyzing the time resolution and detection efficiency, the optimal structure of MRPCs for 0.511 MeV gammas is proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting the topology and direction of low-energy nuclear and electronic recoils is broadly desirable in nuclear and particle physics, with applications in coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, astrophysical neutrino measurements, probing dark matter (DM) within the neutrino fog, and confirming the galactic origin of DM. Gaseous Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) offer the required gain and readout granularity, but must be large to achieve the required volume. Therefore, scalable, cost-effective readout technologies are essential. High-resolution x/y strip readouts, previously identified as the optimal balance between cost-efficiency and performance, are examined here. To guide the readout design of a 40-L detector under construction, we present a comparative analysis of 9 x/y strip configurations with Micromegas amplification. Each setup employs VMM3a front-end ASICs within the RD51 Scalable Readout System (SRS) for strip readout and a pulse height analyzer for reading out the Micromegas mesh. These techniques assess gain, gain resolution, x/y charge sharing, and spatial resolution of each setup. Configurations with a diamond-like carbon (DLC) layer exhibit improved spark resistance, allowing larger maximal gain and improved fractional gain resolution without notable impact on the spatial resolution. Although the DLC reduces the signal in the strips situated lower in the readout, this can be mitigated by narrowing the perpendicularly oriented strips above them. Our results allow us to select the optimal readout for future detectors. We also observe clear 3D tracks from alpha particles, with performance in good agreement with a simple simulation. Overall, Micromegas with x/y strip readout are promising for low-energy recoil observatories. However, dedicated amplification devices or improved electronics are needed to reach the fundamental performance limit of 3D electron counting.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Neutrino-Hydrogen Measurements</title>

Abstract: The limited statistics of the available (anti)neutrino-hydrogen (H) interactions has been a longstanding impediment for high-energy neutrino physics. We discuss a practical way to achieve accurate (anti)neutrino-hydrogen measurements, addressing the principal limitations of earlier experiments. Interactions on hydrogen are extracted by subtracting measurements on thin dedicated graphite (pure C) and polypropylene (CH$_2$) targets within a highly segmented low-density detector. A kinematic selection is used to increase the purities to 80-95\% before subtraction. A statistics of ${\cal O}(10^6)$ can be realistically achieved in modern neutrino beams for the various $\nu(\bar \nu)$-H event topologies. The availability of such samples would allow a precise determination of neutrino and antineutrino fluxes, as well as to directly constrain nuclear effects from a comparison with corresponding measurements on heavy materials within the same detector. The (anti)neutrino fluxes and the nuclear smearing are typically the leading sources of systematic uncertainties in long-baseline oscillation experiments. (Anti)neutrino-hydrogen interactions also provide an ideal tool for a wide range of precision tests of fundamental interactions.</description>

      <title>Ultratight confinement of atoms in a Rydberg empowered optical lattice</title>

Abstract: Optical lattices serve as fundamental building blocks for atomic quantum technology. However, the scale and resolution of these lattices are diffraction-limited to the light wavelength. In conventional lattices, achieving tight confinement of single sites requires high laser intensity, which unfortunately leads to reduced coherence due to increased scattering. This article presents a novel approach for creating an atomic optical lattice with a sub-wavelength spatial structure. The potential is generated by leveraging the nonlinear optical response of three-level Rydberg-dressed atoms, which allows us to overcome the diffraction limit of the driving fields. The resulting lattice comprises a three-dimensional array of ultra-narrow Lorentzian wells over nanometer scales. These unprecedented scales can now be accessed through a hybrid scheme that combines the dipolar interaction and optical twist of atomic eigenstates. The interaction-induced two-body resonance that forms the trapping potential, only occurs at a peculiar laser intensity, localizing the trap sites to ultra-narrow regions over the standing-wave driving field. The feasibility study shows that single-atom confinement in Lorentzian sites with 3nm width, and 37MHz depth are realizable with available lasers. The development of these ultra-narrow trapping techniques holds great promise for applications such as Rydberg-Fermi gates, atomtronics, quantum walks, Hubbard models, and neutral-atom quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>A Point-cloud Clustering &amp; Tracking Algorithm for Radar Interferometry</title>

Abstract: In data mining, density-based clustering, which entails classifying datapoints according to their distributions in some space, is an essential method to extract information from large datasets. With the advent of software-based radio, ionospheric radars are capable of producing unprecedentedly large datasets of plasma turbulence backscatter observations, and new automatic techniques are needed to sift through them. We present an algorithm to automatically identify and track clusters of radar echoes through time, using \texttt{dbscan}, a celebrated density-based clustering method for noisy point-clouds. We demonstrate our algorithm's efficiency by tracking turbulent structures in the E-region ionosphere, the so-called radar aurora. Through conjugate auroral imagery, as well as \emph{in-situ} satellite observations, we demonstrate that the observed turbulent structures generally track the motion of auroras. What is more, the radar aurora bulk motions exhibit key qualities of auroral electric field enhancements that has previously been observed with various instruments. We present preliminary statistical results using our new method, and briefly discuss the method's limitations and potential future adaptations.</description>
