      <title>Energy-Efficient Multi-Radio Microwave and IAB-Based Fixed Wireless Access for Rural Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying fiber optics as a last-mile solution in rural areas is not economically viable due to low population density. Nevertheless, providing high-speed internet access in these regions is essential to promote digital inclusion. 5G Fixed Wireless Access (5G FWA) has emerged as a promising alternative; however, its one-hop topology limits coverage. To overcome this limitation, a multi-hop architecture is required. This work proposes a unified multi-hop framework that integrates long-haul microwave, Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB), and FWA to provide wide coverage and high capacity in rural areas. As the number of hops increases, total energy consumption also rises, a challenge often overlooked in existing literature. To address this, we propose an energy-efficient multi-radio microwave and IAB-based FWA framework for rural area connectivity. When the network is underutilized, the proposed approach dynamically operates at reduced capacity to minimize energy consumption. We optimize the off, start-up, serving, deep sleep, and wake-up sates of microwave radios to balance energy use and satisfying data rate requirements. Additionally, we optimize resource block allocation for IAB-based FWA nodes connected to microwave backhaul. The formulated optimization problems aim to minimize the energy consumption of long-haul microwave and multi-hop IAB-based network while satisfying data rate constraints. These problems are solved using dual decomposition and multi-convex programming, supported by dynamic programming. Simulation results demonstrates</description>

      <title>Assessing Resilience in Authoritative DNS Infrastructure Supporting Government Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online government services are increasingly regarded as critical national infrastructure. Because these services directly influence public trust, any disruption can have significant societal and political consequences. Yet their supporting infrastructures remain vulnerable to outages from natural disasters, geopolitical tensions, and targeted attacks. Central to their operation is the authoritative Domain Name System (DNS) infrastructure, the single source of truth that maps government domain names to service endpoints. While indispensable, this infrastructure also represents a potential and critical point of system failure. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive assessment framework with purpose-designed mechanisms to systematically evaluate the operational resilience of authoritative DNS infrastructure supporting government services. Complementing prior studies on website hosting, recursive resolution, and DNS record integrity, our work provides a holistic view of authoritative DNS operation. Our first contribution develops a multi-sourced data schema that characterizes a (government) domain's authoritative DNS infrastructure across four hierarchical levels: physical hosting infrastructure, server functionality, name servers, and individual hosting instances. Using data collected from six representative countries, our second contribution identifies resilience attributes at their finest applicable hierarchy across three operational phases: infrastructure placement, service configuration, and DNS record dispatch. Our method assigns numerical scores to each attribute and aggregates them algorithmically to enable consistent and cross-domain comparisons. We apply our method to government domains in the six countries, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in authoritative DNS resilience and pinpointing operational practices that require improvement.</description>

      <title>Country-in-the-Middle: Measuring Paths between People and their Governments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding where Internet services are hosted, and how users reach them, has captured the interest of government regulators and others concerned with the privacy of data flows. In this paper we focus on government websites -- services which arguably merit a higher expectation of protection against foreign surveillance or interference -- and seek to identify countries in the middle (CitMs): countries that are neither the source nor destination in a path for a resident visiting their online government services. Finding these CitMs raises daunting methodological challenges. We propose a framework to identify CitMs and use a pilot study of 149 countries to refine our methodology before conducting an in-depth measurement study of 11 countries. For our focused study, we compile an extensive set of websites hosting government services and analyze over 9,000 IP-level paths from vantage points in those countries to these services. We conduct extensive manual validation to corroborate or discard paths based on the aforementioned challenges, and discuss paths that experience unexpected CitMs.</description>

      <title>A Threshold-Triggered Deep Q-Network-Based Framework for Self-Healing in Autonomic Software-Defined IIoT-Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic disruptions such as flash events arising from benign traffic bursts and switch thermal fluctuations are major contributors to intermittent service degradation in software-defined industrial networks. These events violate IEC~61850-derived quality-of-service requirements and user-defined service-level agreements, hindering the reliable and timely delivery of control, monitoring, and best-effort traffic in IEC~61400-25-compliant wind power plants. Failure to maintain these requirements often results in delayed or lost control signals, reduced operational efficiency, and increased risk of wind turbine generator downtime.
  To address these challenges, this study proposes a threshold-triggered Deep Q-Network self-healing agent that autonomically detects, analyzes, and mitigates network disruptions while adapting routing behavior and resource allocation in real time. The proposed agent was trained, validated, and tested on an emulated tri-clustered switch network deployed in a cloud-based proof-of-concept testbed.
  Simulation results show that the proposed agent improves disruption recovery performance by 53.84% compared to a baseline shortest-path and load-balanced routing approach and outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System by 13.1% and the Deep Q-Network and traffic prediction-based routing optimization method by 21.5%, in a super-spine leaf data-plane architecture.
  Additionally, the agent maintains switch thermal stability by proactively initiating external rack cooling when required. These findings highlight the potential of deep reinforcement learning in building resilience in software-defined industrial networks deployed in mission-critical, time-sensitive application scenarios.</description>

      <title>FUSION: Forecast-Embedded Agent Scheduling with Service Incentive Optimization over Distributed Air-Ground Edge Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a forecasting-driven, incentive-compatible service provisioning framework for distributed air-ground integrated edge networks under human-machine coexistence. We consider hybrid players where the computing capacity of edge servers (ESs) are augmented by vehicular-UAV agent pairs (AgPs) that can be proactively dispatched to overloaded hotspots. Unique key challenges should be addressed: highly uncertain spatio-temporal workloads, spatio-temporal coupling between road traffic and UAV capacity, forecast-driven contracting risks, and heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of human users (HuUs) and machine users (MaUs). To cope with these issues, we propose FUSION, a two-stage framework that tightly couples service demand prediction, agent deployment, and task scheduling. In the offline stage, a Pro-LNN module performs intelligent multi-step spatio-temporal demand forecasting at distributed ESs, whose outputs are exploited by an enhanced ant colony optimization-based routing scheme (eACO-VRP) and an auction-based incentive-compatible contracting mechanism (Off-AIC^2), to jointly determine ES-AgP contracts and pre-planned service routes. In the online stage, we formulate congestion-aware task scheduling as an potential game among HuUs, MaUs, and heterogeneous ES/UAV providers, and devise a potential-guided best-response dynamics (PG-BR) algorithm that provably converges to a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world traces show that FUSION significantly improves social welfare, latency, resource utilization, and robustness compared with state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>A Fair, Flexible, Zero-Waste Digital Electricity Market: A First-Principles Approach Combining Automatic Market Making, Holarchic Architectures and Shapley Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13871v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis presents a fundamental rethink of electricity market design at the wholesale and balancing layers. Rather than treating markets as static spot clearing mechanisms, it reframes them as a continuously online, event driven dynamical control system: a two sided marketplace operating directly on grid physics.
  Existing energy only, capacity augmented, and zonal market designs are shown to admit no shock robust Nash equilibrium under realistic uncertainty, instead relying on price caps, uplift, and regulatory intervention to preserve solvency and security. In response, the thesis develops a holarchic Automatic Market Maker (AMM) in which prices are bounded, exogenous control signals derived from physical tightness rather than emergent equilibrium outcomes.
  The AMM generalises nodal and zonal pricing through nested scarcity layers, from node to cluster to zone to region to system, such that participant facing prices inherit from the tightest binding constraint. Nodal and zonal pricing therefore emerge as special cases of a unified scarcity propagation rule.
  Beyond pricing, the AMM functions as a scarcity aware control system and a digitally enforceable rulebook for fair access and proportional allocation under shortage. Fuel costs are recovered through pay as bid energy dispatch consistent with merit order, while non fuel operating and capital costs are allocated according to adequacy, flexibility, and locational contribution.
  Large scale simulations demonstrate bounded input bounded output stability, controllable procurement costs, zero structural waste, and improved distributional outcomes. The architecture is climate aligned and policy configurable, but requires a managed transition and new operational tools for system operators and market participants.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning for Robust Access in Cognitive IoT Networks under Smart Jamming Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of dynamic spectrum access in a cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) network where a secondary user (SU) operates under both energy constraints and adversarial interference from a smart jammer. The SU coexists with primary users (PUs) and must ensure that its transmissions do not exceed a predefined interference threshold on licensed channels. At each time slot, the SU must jointly determine whether to transmit or harvest energy, which channel to access, and the appropriate transmit power while satisfying energy and interference constraints. Meanwhile, a smart jammer actively selects a channel to disrupt, aiming to degrade the SU's communication performance. This setting presents a significant challenge due to its multi-level decision structure and hybrid action space, which combines both discrete and continuous decisions. To tackle this, we propose a novel Hierarchical Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (H-DDPG) framework that decomposes the decision-making process into three levels: the high-level policy determines the mode (transmit or harvest), the mid-level policy selects the channel, and the low-level actor outputs a continuous power level. Concurrently, the jammer is modeled as a reinforcement learning agent that learns an adaptive channel jamming strategy using a discrete variant of DDPG. Simulation results show that our H-DDPG approach outperforms conventional flat reinforcement learning baselines.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Caching Towards Efficient Spectrum Utilization in Cognitive-IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks, efficient spectrum sharing is essential to address increasing wireless demands. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for joint cooperative caching and spectrum access coordination in CIoT networks, enabling the CIoT agents to collaborate with primary users (PUs) by caching PU content and serving their requests, fostering mutual benefits. The proposed DRL framework jointly optimizes caching policy and spectrum access under challenging conditions. Unlike traditional cognitive radio (CR) methods, where CIoT agents vacate the spectrum for PUs, or relaying techniques, which merely support spectrum sharing, caching brings data closer to the edge, reducing latency by minimizing retrieval distance. Simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms others in lowering latency, increasing CIoT and PU cache hit rates, and enhancing network throughput. This approach redefines spectrum sharing, offering a fresh perspective on CIoT network design and illustrating the potential of DRL-guided caching to highlight the benefits of collaboration over dynamic spectrum access scenarios, elevating CIoT performance under constrained resources.</description>

      <title>Performance and Stability of Barrier Mode Parallel Systems with Heterogeneous and Redundant Jobs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In some models of parallel computation, jobs are split into smaller tasks and can be executed completely asynchronously. In other situations the parallel tasks have constraints that require them to synchronize their start and possibly departure times. This is true of many parallelized machine learning workloads, and the popular Apache Spark processing engine has recently added support for Barrier Execution Mode, which allows users to add such barriers to their jobs. These barriers necessarily result in idle periods on some of the workers, which reduces their stability and performance, compared to equivalent workloads with no barriers.
  In this paper we will consider and analyze the stability and performance penalties resulting from barriers. We include an analysis of the stability of $(s,k,l)$ barrier systems that allow jobs to depart after $l$ out of $k$ of their tasks complete. We also derive and evaluate performance bounds for hybrid barrier systems servicing a mix of jobs, both with and without barriers, and with varying degrees of parallelism. For the purely 1-barrier case we compare the bounds and simulation results to benchmark data from a standalone Spark system. We study the overhead in the real system, and based on its distribution we attribute it to the dual event and polling-driven mechanism used to schedule barrier-mode jobs. We develop a model for this type of overhead and validate it against the real system through simulation.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Cognitive IoT with Cooperative Caching and SWIPT-EH: A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm for hybrid underlay-overlay cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) networks with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)-energy harvesting (EH) and cooperative caching. Unlike prior hierarchical DRL approaches that focus primarily on spectrum access or power control, our work jointly optimizes EH, hybrid access coordination, power allocation, and caching in a unified framework. The joint optimization problem is formulated as a weighted-sum multi-objective task, designed to maximize throughput and cache hit ratio while simultaneously minimizing transmission delay. In the proposed model, CIoT agents jointly optimize EH and data transmission using a learnable time switching (TS) factor. They also coordinate spectrum access under hybrid overlay-underlay paradigms and make power control and cache placement decisions while considering energy, interference, and storage constraints. Specifically, in this work, cooperative caching is used to enable overlay access, while power control is used for underlay access. A novel three-level hierarchical SAC (H-SAC) agent decomposes the mixed discrete-continuous action space into modular subproblems, improving scalability and convergence over flat DRL methods. The high-level policy adjusts the TS factor, the mid-level policy manages spectrum access coordination and cache sharing, and the low-level policy decides transmit power and caching actions for both the CIoT agent and PU content. Simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical SAC approach significantly outperforms benchmark and greedy strategies. It achieves better performance in terms of average sum rate, delay, cache hit ratio, and energy efficiency, even under channel fading and uncertain conditions.</description>

      <title>Improving Slow Transfer Predictions: Generative Methods Compared</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring data transfer performance is a crucial task in scientific computing networks. By predicting performance early in the communication phase, potentially sluggish transfers can be identified and selectively monitored, optimizing network usage and overall performance. A key bottleneck to improving the predictive power of machine learning (ML) models in this context is the issue of class imbalance. This project focuses on addressing the class imbalance problem to enhance the accuracy of performance predictions. In this study, we analyze and compare various augmentation strategies, including traditional oversampling methods and generative techniques. Additionally, we adjust the class imbalance ratios in training datasets to evaluate their impact on model performance. While augmentation may improve performance, as the imbalance ratio increases, the performance does not significantly improve. We conclude that even the most advanced technique, such as CTGAN, does not significantly improve over simple stratified sampling.</description>

      <title>UDFS: Lightweight Representation-Driven Open World Robust Encrypted Traffic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, sequence features such as packet length have received considerable attention due to their central role in encrypted traffic analysis. Existing sequence modeling approaches can be broadly categorized into flow-level and trace-level methods: the former suffer from high feature redundancy, limiting their discriminative power, whereas the latter preserve complete information but incur substantial computational and storage overhead. To address these limitations, we propose the \textbf{U}p-\textbf{D}own \textbf{F}low \textbf{S}equence (\textbf{UDFS}) representation, which compresses an entire trace into a two-dimensional sequence and characterizes each flow by the aggregate of its upstream and downstream traffic, reducing complexity while maintaining high discriminability. Furthermore, to address the challenge of class-specific discriminability differences, we propose an adaptive threshold mechanism that dynamically adjusts training weights and rejection boundaries, enhancing the model's classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance and robustness on both coarse-grained and fine-grained datasets, as well as under concept drift and open-world scenarios. Code and Dataset are available at https://github.com/kid1999/UDFS.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication Meets Heterogeneous Network: Emerging Trends, Opportunities, and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in machine learning (ML) techniques enable users to extract, transmit, and reproduce information semantics via ML-based semantic communication (SemCom). This significantly increases network spectral efficiency and transmission robustness. In the network, the semantic encoders and decoders among various users, based on ML, however, require collaborative updating according to new transmission tasks. The various heterogeneous characteristics of most networks in turn introduce emerging but unique challenges for semantic codec updating that are different from other general ML model updating.
