      <title>Merging multidimensional equations of state of strongly interacting matter via a statistical mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general method to merge multidimensional equations of state (EoSs) by combining them in a two-fluid equilibrium statistical mixture in the grand canonical ensemble. The merged grand potential density $\omega$ is built directly from the input EoSs and the fluid fractions are fixed by minimizing $\omega$ at fixed temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$. Thermodynamic consistency and stability are guaranteed as all thermodynamic quantities are consistently derived from a single merged grand potential $\omega(T,\mu_B)$ with the correct convexity properties. Our method can accommodate a first-order phase transition and a critical endpoint with mean-field critical exponents. We use this method to merge a van der Waals Hadron-Resonance-Gas EoS with a holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton EoS that has a critical point and a first-order line. The result is a single EoS, spanning hadronic and deconfined matter over a broad range in $(T,\mu_B)$, which can be readily used in heavy-ion hydrodynamic simulations. Our merging method can be generalized to consider a higher dimensional phase diagram (e.g., by considering more chemical potentials) and more than two input EoSs.</description>

      <title>Light Nuclei embedded in a Nuclear Medium: Clustering and Mott Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The clustering of nucleons is a fundamental phenomenon with broad implications for nuclear physics and astrophysics. In this work, we employ a microscopic in-medium few-body approach to systematically investigate the formation and dissolution of light clusters (deuteron, $\rm{^3H}$, $\rm{^3He}$, $\alpha$-particle) embedded in nuclear medium. The medium-modified cluster structures under the Pauli blocking and the picture of Mott transitions in nuclear medium are discussed in detail. We find that the weakly bound deuteron survives to higher densities as compared with the more compact $\alpha$-particle in symmetric nuclear matter, with its r.m.s. radius expanding markedly prior to its dissolution. Moreover, the Mott density of $\alpha$-particle is slightly lower in neutron-rich matter than in symmetric matter. These results may provide useful constraints for the formation of light clusters at nuclear surface and the cluster yields in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Chiral three-nucleon forces for the new local position-space two-nucleon potential in $\textit{ab initio}$ many-body calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-nucleon force (3NF) plays an important role in understanding the structure of finite nuclei and the saturation properties of infinite nuclear matter. The chiral 3NF derived from the chiral effective field theory has been successful in $\textit{ab initio}$ studies of atomic nuclei. However, challenges remain, such as parameterizing low-energy constants and applying regulators. Most of established chiral nuclear forces have a nonlocal form in the momentum space. In this work, we construct local and hybrid local-nonlocal chiral 3NFs for the newly established Idaho local position-space two-nucleon potential, and calculate binding energies and radii of nuclei up to $^{132}$Sn. The two low-energy constants of 3NF are constrained by the ground-state energies of $^3$H and $^{16}$O, as suggested in a recent work. The chiral Hamiltonian obtained with the local-nonlocal regulator can simultaneously reproduce the experimental ground-state energies and charge radii of nuclei over a large range from $^4$He to $^{132}$Sn.</description>

      <title>Coherent Absorption Dynamics: The Dual Role of Off-Diagonal Couplings in Weakly Bound Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disentangling reaction mechanisms in weakly bound nuclei remains a long-standing challenge, often compounded by the treatment of absorption as an incoherent sum of channel contributions. Within the Continuum-Discretized Coupled-Channels (CDCC) framework, we derive a generalized coupled-channel optical theorem and show that the total absorption cross section, $\sigma_{\mathrm A}\propto -\langle\Psi|W|\Psi\rangle$, decomposes as $\sigma_{\mathrm A}=\sigma_{\mathrm D}+\sigma_{\mathrm B}+\sigma_{\mathrm{int}}$, where $\sigma_{\mathrm{int}}$ is a coherent interference term between channel components. For the systems and fragment-target optical potentials considered, $\sigma_{\mathrm{int}}$ is negative and comparable in magnitude to the direct absorption terms. The off-diagonal imaginary couplings play a dual role, redistributing flux among channels and generating $\sigma_{\mathrm{int}}$, which is required for flux-balance consistency. Calculations for $d+{}^{93}\mathrm{Nb}$ and ${}^{6}\mathrm{Li}+{}^{59}\mathrm{Co}/{}^{208}\mathrm{Pb}$ show that retaining the full non-diagonal coupling matrix substantially enhances breakup-channel absorption for heavy targets while reducing the total absorption through interference effects. Neglecting off-diagonal imaginary couplings therefore leads to a systematically biased physical picture, overestimating total absorption and severely underestimating breakup contributions, implying that experimental analyses based on incoherent-sum models inherit this bias. Full-coupling CDCC calculations are thus essential for consistent, mechanism-resolved extraction of absorption cross sections in weakly bound systems.</description>

      <title>Dipole response in deformed halo nuclei $^{42}\mathrm{Mg}$ and $^{44}\mathrm{Mg}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasiparticle finite amplitude method based on the deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum has been developed for the noncharge-exchange multipole response. Taking neutron-rich magnesium isotopes as examples, the isovector electric dipole response, especially in the low-lying region, is studied. It is found that the low-energy dipole strength increases with neutron number and becomes notably enhanced in the predicted deformed halo nuclei $^{42}\mathrm{Mg}$ and $^{44}\mathrm{Mg}$. In these isotopes, the $K^\pi=1^-$ states below 3 MeV are dominated by transitions from the ``halo" part of the single-neutron orbitals. Their transition densities reveal a low-frequency, out-of-phase oscillation between the neutron halo and the core. These results provide a microscopic picture for the soft dipole resonance in $^{42}\mathrm{Mg}$ and $^{44}\mathrm{Mg}$.</description>

      <title>Graphene is neither Relativistic nor Non-Relativistic case: Thermodynamics Aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05395v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovery of electron hydrodynamics in graphene system has opened a new scope of analytic calculations in condensed matter physics, which was traditionally well cultivated in science and engineering as a non-relativistic hydrodynamics and in high energy nuclear and astro physics as relativistic hydrodynamics. Electrons in graphene follow neither non-relativistic nor relativistic hydrodynamics and thermodynamics. Present article has gone through systematic microscopic calculations of thermodynamical quantities like pressure, energy density, etc. of electron-fluid in graphene and compared with corresponding estimations for non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic cases. Identifying the Dirac fluid and Fermi liquid domains, we have sketched the transition of temperature and Fermi energy dependency of electron thermodynamics for graphene and other cases. An equivalent transition for quark matter is also discussed. The most exciting part is the general expression of specific heat, whose Fermi to Dirac fluid domain transition can be realized as a transition from a solid-based to a fluid-based picture. This understanding may be connected to the experimentally observed Wiedemann-Franz Law violation in the Dirac fluid domain of graphene system.</description>

      <title>General gravitational properties of neutron stars: curvature invariants, binding energy, and trace anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of curvature invariants for a large ensemble of neutron stars built with equations of state (EOSs) that satisfy constraints from nuclear theory and perturbative QCD, as well as measurements of neutron-star masses, radii, and gravitational waves from binary neutron-star mergers. Surprisingly, our analysis reveals that stars with negative Ricci scalar $\mathcal{R}$ are rather common and about $\sim 50\%$ of our EOSs produce one or more stars with Ricci curvature that is negative somewhere inside the star. The negative curvature is found mostly but not exclusively at the highest densities and pressures, and predominantly for stiff EOSs and for the most compact and most massive stars. Furthermore, we improve the quasi-universal relation between the stellar gravitational mass $M$ and the baryonic mass $M_\mathrm{b}$, which allows us to express analytically one in terms of the other with a maximum variance of only $\sim 3\%$. Finally, using the relation between the Ricci scalar and the trace anomaly $\Delta$, we determine the conditions under which $\Delta$ vanishes or becomes negative in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Insights into Meson and Baryon Structure using Continuum Schwinger Function Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk of visible mass is supposed to emerge from nonperturbative dynamics within quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Following years of development and refinement, continuum and lattice Schwinger function methods have recently joined in revealing the three pillars that support this emergent hadron mass (EHM); namely, a nonzero gluon mass-scale, a process-independent effective charge, and dressed-quarks with running masses that take constituent-like values at infrared momenta. One may argue that EHM and confinement are inextricably linked; and theory is now working to expose their manifold expressions in hadron observables and highlight the types of measurements that can be made in order to validate the paradigm. This contribution sketches these ideas via the unified explanation of pion and proton electromagnetic and gravitational form factors.</description>

      <title>Lattice-based equation of state with a critical point from constant entropy contours and its comparison to effective QCD approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically assess the performance of a new method from [H. Shah et al., Phys. Rev. C 113, L012201] for locating the QCD critical point using constant-entropy contours by testing it against various effective QCD approaches. We demonstrate that, while the method yields spurious critical points in purely hadronic models (HRG) due to non-parabolic contour behavior at low temperatures ($T \lesssim 120$ MeV), it accurately reproduces the CP location in frameworks that feature a genuine phase transition and benchmarked against lattice QCD, such as Holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton, and Functional QCD approaches. Building on our previous determination of constant entropy contours using lattice data, we extend that analysis to construct a complete Lattice-based Equation of State (EoS) at finite density, which features a critical point at $(T, \mu_B) \approx (114, 602)$ MeV. By integrating the extrapolated entropy density with respect to temperature, we reconstruct the pressure, baryon density, susceptibility, and speed of sound in the critical region, and analyze the focusing behavior of isentropic trajectories in the vicinity of the critical point.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Complexity of String Breaking in the Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String breaking, the process by which flux tubes fragment into hadronic states, is a hallmark of confinement in strongly-interacting quantum field theories. We examine a suite of quantum complexity measures using Matrix Product States to dissect the string breaking process in the 1+1D Schwinger model. We demonstrate the presence of nonlocal quantum correlations along the string that may affect fragmentation dynamics, and show that entanglement and magic offer complementary perspectives on string formation and breaking beyond conventional observables.</description>

      <title>Evidence for strong isovector nuclear spin-orbit interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nucleon spin-orbit interaction is a cornerstone of nuclear structure theory, yet its isospin dependence remains elusive owing to the lack of clean experimental probes. Here we show that the charge-weak form factor difference in $^{48}$Ca, recently extracted in a model-independent manner by the CREX experiment, exhibits strong sensitivity to the isovector spin-orbit interaction. Using Skyrme-like energy density functionals, we demonstrate that a significantly enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction, about four times stronger than conventional parametrizations, can resolve the PREX-CREX puzzle, which has challenged modern nuclear theories and our understanding of nuclear symmetry energy, while maintaining a good description of nuclear bulk properties and well-established shell structure of finite nuclei. This enhanced isovector spin-orbit interaction also provides a novel mechanism for the emergence of the $N = 14$, $16$, $32$ and $34$ magic numbers in neutron-rich nuclei on the mean-field level. These findings point to a strong isospin dependence of the nucleon spin-orbit interaction, which is expected to have important implications for nuclear structures, electroweak nuclear processes, and related problems in nuclear astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Two-proton emission as source of spin-entangled proton pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a two-proton emitter with a diproton-correlated initial state can act as a source of spin-correlated proton pairs. Using a time-dependent three-body model, we investigate the two-proton emission of $^{16}$Ne ($^{14}$O$+2p$) and analyze the spin correlation of the emitted protons. We find that, when the emission proceeds as a democratic three-body process from an initial state containing a spin-singlet diproton correlation, the emitted protons exhibit a pronounced spin-correlation pattern exceeding the local-hidden-variable bound. This spin correlation closely resembles that of a pure spin-singlet pair. In contrast, this pattern is lost when the process is dominated by the sequential emission or when the initial diproton correlation is absent. These results demonstrate that a certain class of two-proton emitters can deliver spin-entangled proton pairs, and their spin correlation reflects the diproton correlation embedded in the initial state.</description>

      <title>Maximal Magic for Two-qubit States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\ln (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\ln (5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identify 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</description>

      <title>Exploiting $\nu$-dependence of projected energy correlators in HICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the recently derived factorization formula for energy-energy correlators to study the analytic structure of general $\nu$-point projected energy correlators in heavy ion collisions. The $\nu$-point projected energy correlators (or, $\nu$-correlators) are an analytically continued family of the integer $N$-point projected energy correlators, which probe correlations between $N$ final-state particles. By tracking the largest separation ($\chi$) between the $N$ particles, in vacuum, their structure is closely related to the DGLAP splitting functions and exhibits a classical scaling behavior $\sim 1/\chi$ which is modified by resummation through the anomalous dimensions. We show that, in a thermal medium, the $\nu$-correlators display non-trivial angular scaling already at the leading order in perturbation theory. We find that for non-integer values, particularly $\nu&lt;1$, medium-induced jet function is enhanced compared to $\nu&gt;1$. This is particularly manifested in the ratios of $\nu$-correlators with respect to the two-point energy correlator which encode an intrinsic angular information for $\nu&lt;1$ when compared to large $\nu$ values. Moreover, for small-$\nu$ values, the $\nu$-correlators appear to saturate at $\nu=0.01$. We further confirm our leading-order numerical computations against simulated events from JEWEL for the parton level production cross-section. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the effect of BFKL resummation for various values of $\nu$.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Star Properties from Future High-Precision Measurements of Their Radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Future high-precision X-ray and gravitational-wave observations of neutron stars (NSs) are expected to constrain NS radii with uncertainties as small as $\sigma \simeq 0.1$~km. Such unprecedented precision offers a unique opportunity to extract new information about the nature and equation of state (EOS) of supradense matter in NS cores. Using mock radius data with uncertainties ranging from $\sigma = 1.0$ to $0.1$~km, together with a flexible meta-model NS EOS that allows for a first-order hadron-quark phase transition, we perform a Bayesian statistical analysis to assess the impact of radius measurements on EOS constraints. We find that high-precision radius measurements, particularly for massive NSs, significantly tighten constraints on the hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t$, the quark matter mass fraction in NS cores, and several parameters characterizing the EOS of supranuclear hadronic matter, although the degree of improvement depends on the assumed prior range of $\rho_t$. In contrast, even with the highest precision considered, NS radii -- including those of massive stars -- remain largely insensitive to the stiffness of quark matter, independent of the measurement accuracy or the prior range adopted for $\rho_t$.</description>

      <title>Lindblad-driven recombination of the X(3872) tetraquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The internal structure of the exotic meson X(3872) remains an open question. We investigate its production in heavy-ion collisions under the hypothesis that it is a compact tetraquark. To this end, we derive a coalescence model from the Lindblad equation, assuming that unbound heavy quarks are thermalized within the quark-gluon plasma and that the adiabatic approximation holds. Using this model, we predict the nuclear modification factor of the X(3872) at LHC energies, with proton-proton baseline cross sections estimated from available experimental data. We also consider the effect of simplifying assumptions on the model, and a complementary approach based on chemical equilibration. Our results indicate that recombination is the dominant production mechanism for a tetraquark X(3872). It leads to a significant yield enhancement in heavy-ion collisions, suggesting that the nuclear modification factor is a powerful observable for probing the exotic nature of this state</description>

      <title>Three-particle scattering amplitudes from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I review recent progress in calculating scattering amplitudes and resonance properties involving three particles using results from lattice QCD. The necessary input is the finite-volume spectrum, and the outputs -- via solutions of integral equations -- are scattering amplitudes that can be continued into the complex plane to search for resonance poles. I describe the outlook for future extensions and applications of this work.</description>
