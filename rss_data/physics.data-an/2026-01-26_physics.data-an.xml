      <title>D-MODD: A Diffusion Model of Opinion Dynamics Derived from Online Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first empirical derivation of a continuous-time stochastic model for real-world opinion dynamics. Using longitudinal social-media data to infer users opinion on a binary climate-change topic, we reconstruct the underlying drift and diffusion functions governing individual opinion updates. We show that the observed dynamics are well described by a Langevin-type stochastic differential equation, with persistent attractor basins and spatially sensitive drift and diffusion terms. The empirically inferred one-step transition probabilities closely reproduce the transition kernel generated from the D-MODD model we introduce. Our results provide the first direct evidence that online opinion dynamics on a polarized topic admit a Markovian description at the operator level, with empirically reconstructed transition kernels accurately reproduced by a data-driven Langevin model, bridging sociophysics, behavioral data, and complex-systems modeling.</description>

      <title>Bringing order to network centrality measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantitative method to compare arbitrary pairs of graph centrality measures, based on the ordering of vertices induced by them. The proposed method is conceptually simple, mathematically elegant, and allows for a quantitative restatement of many conjectures that were previously cumbersome to formalize. Moreover, it produces an approximation scheme useful for network scientists. We explore some of these uses and formulate new conjectures that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>PanopTag: Simultaneously Tagging All Jets in a Particle Collision Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet tagging, identifying the origin of jets produced in particle collisions, is a critical classification task in high-energy physics. Despite the revolutionary impact of deep learning on jet tagging over the past decade, the paradigm has remained unchanged. In particular, jets are classified independently, one at a time. This single-jet approach ignores correlations, overlaps, and wider event context between jets. We introduce PanopTag, a new paradigm for jet tagging that departs from traditional single-jet tagging approaches. Rather than classifying jets independently, PanopTag simultaneously tags all jets by employing an encoder-decoder architecture that uses jet kinematics as queries to cross-attend to particle flow object embeddings. We evaluate PanopTag on heavy-flavor $(b/c)$-tagging and demonstrate remarkable performance improvements over state-of-the-art single-jet baselines that are only accessible by exploiting event-level features and correlations between jets.</description>

      <title>Variational Dimension Lifting for Robust Tracking of Nonlinear Stochastic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear stochastic motion presents significant challenges for Bayesian particle tracking. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a framework to construct an invertible transformation that maps the nonlinear state-space model (SSM) into a higher-dimensional linear Gaussian SSM. This approach allows the application of standard linear-Gaussian inference techniques while maintaining a connection to the dynamics of the original system. The paper derives the necessary conditions for such transformations using Ito's lemma and variational calculus, and illustrates the method on a bistable cubic motion model, radial Brownian process model, and a logistic model with multiplicative noise. Simulations confirm that the transformed linear systems, when projected back, accurately reconstruct the nonlinear dynamics and, in distinct regimes of stiffness and singularity, yield tracking accuracy competitive with conventional filters, while avoiding their structural instabilities.</description>

      <title>Community Detection with the Map Equation and Infomap: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world networks have a complex topology comprising many elements often structured into communities. Revealing these communities helps researchers uncover the organizational and functional structure of the system that the network represents. However, detecting community structures in complex networks requires selecting a community detection method among a multitude of alternatives with different network representations, community interpretations, and underlying mechanisms. This tutorial focuses on a popular community detection method called the map equation and its search algorithm Infomap. The map equation framework for community detection describes communities by analyzing dynamic processes on the network. Thanks to its flexibility, the map equation provides extensions that can incorporate various assumptions about network structure and dynamics. To help decide if the map equation is a suitable community detection method for a given complex system and problem at hand - and which variant to choose - we review the map equation's theoretical framework and guide users in applying the map equation to various research problems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic redundancy and mortality in stochastic search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Search processes are a fundamental part of natural and artificial systems. In such settings, the number of searchers is rarely constant: new agents may be recruited while others can abandon the search. Despite the ubiquity of these dynamics, their combined influence on search efficiency remains unexplored. Here we present a general framework for stochastic search in which independent agents progressively join and leave the process, a mechanism we term dynamic redundancy and mortality (DRM). Under minimal assumptions on the underlying search dynamics, this framework yields exact first-passage time statistics. It further reveals surprising connections to stochastic resetting, including a regime in which the resetting mean first-passage time emerges as a universal lower bound for DRM, as well as regimes in which DRM search is faster. We illustrate our results through a detailed analysis of one-dimensional Brownian DRM search. Altogether, this work provides a rigorous foundation for studying first-passage processes with a fluctuating number of searchers, with direct relevance across physical, biological, and algorithmic systems.</description>
