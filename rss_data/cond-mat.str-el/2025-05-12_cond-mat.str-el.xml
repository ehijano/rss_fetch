      <title>Observation of excitons bound by antiferromagnetic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional Mott insulators host antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations that are predicted to enhance the attractive interaction between empty (holons) and doubly occupied (doublons) sites, creating a novel pathway for exciton formation. However, experimental confirmation of this spin-mediated binding mechanism remains elusive. Leveraging the distinct magnetic critical properties of the Mott antiferromagnets Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and Sr$_3$Ir$_2$O$_7$, we show using time-resolved THz spectroscopy that excitons only exist at temperatures below where short-range AFM correlation develops. The excitons remain stable up to photodoping densities approaching the predicted excitonic Mott insulator-to-metal transition, revealing a unique robustness against screening. Our results establish the viability of spin-bound excitons and introduce opportunities for excitonic control through magnetic degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>A Hubbard exciton fluid in a photo-doped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The undoped antiferromagnetic Mott insulator naturally has one charge carrier per lattice site. When it is doped with additional carriers, they are unstable to spin fluctuation-mediated Cooper pairing as well as other unconventional types of charge, spin, and orbital current ordering. Photo-excitation can produce charge carriers in the form of empty (holons) and doubly occupied (doublons) sites that may also exhibit charge instabilities. There is evidence that antiferromagnetic correlations enhance attractive interactions between holons and doublons, which can then form bound pairs known as Hubbard excitons, and that these might self-organize into an insulating Hubbard exciton fluid. However, this out-of-equilibrium phenomenon has not been detected experimentally. Here, we report the transient formation of a Hubbard exciton fluid in the antiferromagnetic Mott insulator Sr$_{2}$IrO$_{4}$ using ultrafast terahertz conductivity. Following photo-excitation, we observe rapid spectral weight transfer from a Drude metallic response to an insulating response. The latter is characterized by a finite energy peak originating from intra-excitonic transitions, whose assignment is corroborated by our numerical simulations of an extended Hubbard model. The lifetime of the peak is short, approximately one picosecond, and scales exponentially with Mott gap size, implying extremely strong coupling to magnon modes.</description>

      <title>One-third magnetization plateau in a spin-1 kagome magnet BaNi$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the structural and magnetic properties of BaNi$_3$(AsO$_4$)$_2$(OH)$_2$, focusing on its spin-1 kagome lattice and the intricate coexistence of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Powder x-ray diffraction analysis confirms a highly crystalline trigonal structure. Detailed Rietveld refinement identifies a single crystallographic Ni site, indicative of a perfect kagome lattice. Magnetic susceptibility measurements suggest predominantly ferromagnetic interactions with an effective magnetic moment consistent with Ni$^{2+}$ spins, yet the system undergoes antiferromagnetic ordering at a N$\'e$el temperature of 5.8 K. Isothermal magnetization measurements reveal a series of metamagnetic transitions culminating in a plateau-like phase near one-third of the total saturation magnetization. Analysis of the phase boundaries shows that the antiferromagnetic phase supports a substantial net moment in each kagome layer, comparable to that of the one-third plateau. This observation challenges the conventional model-where a 120$^\circ$ ground state transitions to an up-up-down configuration-commonly assumed for kagome antiferromagnets. Instead, our findings indicate that both the zero-field ground state and the field-induced phases exhibit in-plane ferrimagnetic spin arrangements on the kagome lattice, with the metamagnetic transition corresponding to a shift from layer-by-layer antiferromagnetically aligned net moments to ferromagnetically aligned ones. This configuration is stabilized by bond frustration, a network of competing interactions that can favor both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings, highlighting the essential role of frustration in governing the low-temperature magnetic behavior of spin-1 kagome systems.</description>

      <title>An Exactly Solvable Model of Phase-Fluctuating Superconductivity in Cuprates: The Role of Partially Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing an exactly solvable Hubbard-like model that exhibits a pseudogap (PG) phase and a partially flat band, we perform self-consistent microscopic calculations of the superconductivity (SC) in cuprates, incorporating both thermal and zero-point superconducting phase fluctuations in the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions. The results reveal an important role of the partially flat band in determining phase-fluctuating SC as well as several key features that are consistent with experimental observations. Specifically, we find a dome-shaped $d$-wave superconducting region in the temperature-doping phase diagram with the optimal doping point located near the quantum critical point between the PG and the metallic phases. Near the optimal doping, the partially flat band suppresses and amplifies the fluctuation-induced destructing effect on the $d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $d_{xy}$-wave pairing, respectively, ensuring an absolutely dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave SC. While the phase fluctuations of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave SC are relatively weak around optimal doping, they become significant in both underdoped and overdoped regimes. We then identify a discontinuity on the superconducting dome in underdoped regime that results from a transition from a strong- to a weak-phase-fluctuating state as doping approaches the optimal point.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo study of the quasiparticle effective mass of the two-dimensional uniform electron liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real-space variation quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) are used to calculate the quasiparticle energy bands and the quasiparticle effective mass of the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic two-dimensional uniform electron liquid (2D-UEL)\@. The many-body finite-size errors are minimized by performing simulations for three system sizes with the number of electrons $N=146$, 218, and 302 for paramagnetic and $N=151$ for ferromagnetic systems. We consider 2D-UEL to be within the metallic density range $1\leq r_s \leq 5$. The VMC and DMC results predict that the quasiparticle effective mass $m^*$ of the paramagnetic 2D-UEL at high density $r_s=1$ is very close to 1, suggesting that effective mass renormalization due to electron-electron interaction is negligible. We find that $m^*$ of the paramagnetic 2D-UEL obtained by the VMC and DMC methods increases by $r_s$ but with different slopes. Our VMC and DMC results for ferromagnetic 2D-UEL indicate that $m^*$ decreases rapidly by reducing the density due to the strong suppression of the electron-electron interaction.</description>

      <title>Algorithm for finding local integrals of motion in quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local integrals of motion (LIOMs) play a key role in understanding the stationary states of closed macroscopic systems. They were found for selected integrable systems via complex analytical calculations. The existence of LIOMs and their structure can also be studied via numerical methods, which, however, involve exact diagonalization of Hamiltonians, posing a bottleneck for such studies. We show that finding LIOMs in translationally invariant lattice models or unitary quantum circuits can be reduced to a problem for which one may numerically find an exact solution also in the thermodynamic limit. We develop and implement a simple algorithm and demonstrate the efficiency of this method by calculating LIOMs and the Mazur bounds for infinite integrable spin chains and unitary circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach correctly identifies approximate LIOMs in nearly integrable spin ladders.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo description of correlated electrons in two-dimensional FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic correlation effects on the structural properties of double-layer FeSe are studied using variation and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods. The Slater-Jastrow many-body wavefunction with two different forms for the homogeneous two-body pair-correlation term is used. The ground-state energy of the system is obtained at the thermodynamic limit using two different trial wave functions called JDFT and JSD. Only the Jastrow factor is fully optimized in the JDFT wave function, while the Slater determinant comes from the density functional approximation. In the JSD trial wave function, the Slater determinant and the Jastrow factor are fully optimized simultaneously. We calculated the VMC and DMC energies as a function of interlayer separation for two different in-plane iron-iron bond lengths. Our QMC results indicate that the optimized interlayer separation decreases with increasing iron-iron bond length, driven by stretch. We found that a three- to two-dimensional phase transition increases the electron-electron correlation effects and shifts the system from moderately correlated to strongly correlated. The value of correlation energy implies that the Hubbard $U$ value, which is widely used in DFT+U calculations, for two-dimensional FeSe is larger than its value in bulk.</description>

      <title>Topological Devil's staircase in a constrained kagome Ising antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the constrained Ising model on the kagome lattice with infinite first and third neighbor couplings undergoes an infinite series of thermal first-order transitions at which, as in the Kasteleyn transition, linear defects of infinite length condense. However, their density undergoes abrupt jumps because of the peculiar structure of the low temperature phase, which is only partially ordered and hosts a finite density of zero-energy domain walls. The number of linear defects between consecutive zero-energy domain walls is quantized to integer values, leading to a devil's staircase of topological origin. By contrast to the devil's staircase of the ANNNI and related models, the wave-vector is not fixed to commensurate values inside each phase.</description>

      <title>Electron Spin Resonance of Eu on triangular layers in EuT2P2 (T =Mn, Zn, Cd)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the electron spin resonance (ESR) of Eu$^{2+}$ in Eu$T_{2}$P$_{2}$ ($T$=Mn, Zn, Cd) single crystals. The temperature dependencies of ESR linewidth and resonance shift show a similar behaviour when approaching the Eu-ordered state -- a divergence towards $T_{\rm N}$, indicating the growing importance of magnetic correlations and the build-up of internal magnetic fields. For $T$=Mn an additional temperature scale of $\approx 47$~K has considerable impact on linewidth, resonance field and intensity. This points to the presence of Mn magnetic correlations which yet were not reported.</description>

      <title>Edelstein effect in optically driven monolayer jacutingaite Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical control of spin- and valley-selective gapless states in two-dimensional materials presents new opportunities for next-generation spintronic and valleytronic technologies. In this work, we study monolayer jacutingaite (Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$), a quantum spin Hall insulator with strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, under irradiation by circularly polarized light. The light-induced Floquet engineering gives rise to tunable topological phases, including transitions to spin- and valley-polarized semimetallic states. To probe these topological transitions, we employ the spin and orbital Edelstein effects -- non-equilibrium responses arising from spin-orbit interactions in systems lacking inversion symmetry -- without resorting to topological invariants such as Chern numbers. We identify universal signatures of the phase transitions encoded in the Edelstein response: a pronounced discontinuity in the spin Edelstein conductivity and a vanishing orbital Edelstein susceptibility mark the onset of the semimetallic regime. Furthermore, we investigate how the growth and suppression of the spin Edelstein responses across the topological phase transition depend on the interband scattering time. These findings establish the Edelstein effect as a sensitive and experimentally accessible probe of light-induced topological transitions in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>TTNOpt: Tree tensor network package for high-rank tensor compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed TTNOpt, a software package that utilizes tree tensor networks (TTNs) for quantum spin systems and high-dimensional data analysis. TTNOpt provides efficient and powerful TTN computations by locally optimizing the network structure, guided by the entanglement pattern of the target tensors. For quantum spin systems, TTNOpt searches for the ground state of Hamiltonians with bilinear spin interactions and magnetic fields, and computes physical properties of these states, including the variational energy, bipartite entanglement entropy (EE), single-site expectation values, and two-site correlation functions. Additionally, TTNOpt can target the lowest-energy state within a specified subspace, provided that the Hamiltonian conserves total magnetization. For high-dimensional data analysis, TTNOpt factorizes complex tensors into TTN states that maximize fidelity to the original tensors by optimizing the tensors and the network. When a TTN is provided as input, TTNOpt reconstructs the network based on the EE without referencing the fidelity of the original state. We present three demonstrations of TTNOpt: (1) Ground-state search for the hierarchical chain model with a system size of $256$. The entanglement patterns of the ground state manifest themselves in a tree structure, and TTNOpt successfully identifies the tree. (2) Factorization of a quantic tensor of the $2^{24}$ dimensions representing a three-variable function where each variant has a weak bit-wise correlation. The optimized TTN shows that its structure isolates the variables from each other. (3) Reconstruction of the matrix product network representing a $16$-variable normal distribution characterized by a tree-like correlation structure. TTNOpt can reveal hidden correlation structures of the covariance matrix.</description>

      <title>Witnessing Disorder in Quantum Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are no clean samples in nature. Therefore, when we come to discuss the entanglement properties of quantum materials, the effects of disorder must be taken into account. This question is of particular interest for high-entangled phases, such as quantum spin liquids, which lie outside the Landau paradigm for classifying phases of matter. In this work, we explore what experimentally-accessible measures, in the form of concurrence, residual tangle and quantum Fisher information, can teach us about the entanglement in the presence of disorder. As a representative example, we consider the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLL) and disorder-driven random singlet (RS) phases found in antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains. Using quantum Fisher information and residual tangle, we demonstrate that both TLL and RS phases exhibit multi-partite entanglement. In the case of the RS phase, we attribute this to entanglement localized below a crossover length scale. We further show that the order of disorder average matters in calculating measures like concurrence, and that this can lead to false inferences when interpreting experiment. Nonetheless, correctly interpreted, these witnesses provide useful information about the effects of disorder. We explore how information about the central charge of the TLL can be extracted from the low-temperature behavior of concurrence, and conjecture that this analysis can be extended to the effective central charge of the RS phase. Finally, we establish how RS and TLL phases can be distinguished through the growth of multi-partite entanglement, as witnessed by the equal-time structure factor. These results establish that, used carefully, experiments based on entanglement witnesses can provide important information about quantum spin systems in the presence of disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the $\eta$ symmetry of the pump-induced $\eta$-pairing state in the Hubbard chain can be transiently broken by an additionally applied probe pulse. This leads to characteristic dynamic Higgs oscillations of the $\eta$-pair correlations during the probe pulse and a sharp dynamic negative optical conductivity $\sigma(\omega;t)$, which appears above the equilibrium Mott gap $\omega&gt;\Delta_{\rm c}$, long after the pump pulse is finished. This negative peak in the real part of $\sigma(\omega;t)$ is a distinctive hallmark of the photoinduced $\eta$-pairing state, distinguishing it from phases dominated by incoherent doublon formation, which do not exhibit this feature. Remarkably the broadband probe pulse then leads to the emission of photons with the Higgs frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fascinating quantum many-body states in twisted bilayber graphene (TBG) at magic angle, due to the interplay of Coulomb interactions and the quantum metrics of flat bands, have been well understood both experimentally and theoretically. However, the phase diagram and excitations as functions of twist angle and permittivity are still largely unknown. Here, via a newly developed momentum-space continuous-field quantum Monte Carlo method fully taking into account long-ranged Coulomb interactions and flat bands' quantum metrics with system sizes that were not accessible before, we show that charge-neutral TBG realizes an angle-tuned quantum phase transition from a gapped Kramers intervalley coherence (KIVC) state to a Dirac semimetal with critical angles around 1.2$\deg$. In single-particle spectra we demonstrate the evolution of a minimum gap at $\Gamma$ at the magic angle and towards touching points at Brillouin zone corners as the angle increases. The free energy and KIVC order parameter show that the transition belongs to fermionic Gross-Neveu criticality, and is robust upon varying the permittivity or the interlayer hopping.</description>

      <title>On the relation between fractional charge and statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Ro\v{c}ek, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a one-form global ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Slow convergence of spin-wave expansion and magnon dispersion in the 1/3 plateau of the triangular XXZ antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on the quantum magnet K$_{2}$Co(SeO$_{3}$)$_{2}$, we study theoretically the excitation spectrum of the nearest-neighbour triangular XXZ model in the limit of strong easy-axis anisotropy, within the up-up-down (1/3-plateau) phase. We make an expansion in $\alpha =J_{xy}/J_{zz}$ instead of $1/S$ and calculate the magnon dispersion for any value of the spin $S$ at second order in $\alpha$, with two important conclusions: (i) the 1/S expansion converges very slowly for S=1/2, making spin-wave theory quantitatively inaccurate up to very large orders; (ii) compared to the linear spin-wave predictions, our magnon dispersion presents a much better agreement with experimental results on K$_{2}$Co(SeO$_{3}$)$_{2}$, for which $\alpha \simeq 0.08$.</description>

      <title>Boundary critical behavior of the three-dimensional Heisenberg universality class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.00039v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the boundary critical behavior of the three-dimensional Heisenberg universality class, in the presence of a bidimensional surface. By means of high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved lattice model, where leading bulk scaling corrections are suppressed, we prove the existence of a special phase transition, with unusual exponents, and of an extraordinary phase with logarithmically decaying correlations. These findings contrast with na\"ive arguments on the bulk-surface phase diagram, and allow us to explain some recent puzzling results on the boundary critical behavior of quantum spin models.</description>

      <title>A new series of 3D CFTs with $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ global symmetry on fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest to discover new 3D CFTs has been intriguing for physicists. For this purpose, fuzzy sphere reguarlisation that studies interacting quantum systems defined on the lowest Landau level on a sphere has emerged as a powerful tool. In this paper, we discover a series of new CFTs with global symmetry $\mathrm{Sp}(N)$ in the fuzzy sphere models that are closely related to the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ deconfined phase transition, and are described by a $\mathrm{Sp}(N)/(\mathrm{Sp}(M)\times \mathrm{Sp}(N-M))$ non-linear sigma model with a Wess-Zumino-Witten term. We numerically verify the emergent conformal symmetry by observing the integer-spaced conformal multiplets and studying the finite-size scaling of the conformality. We discuss possible candidates for these newly discovered CFTs, the most plausible ones being Chern-Simons-matter theories which have $N$ flavour of gapless bosons or fermions coupled to a non-Abelian (viz. $\mathrm{Sp}(1)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(2)$, etc.) Chern-Simons gauge field. Our work provides new avenues for studying interacting CFTs in 3D, possibly facilitating the non-perturbative study of critical gauge theories and previously undiscovered CFTs.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization: A disorder-induced quantum bound state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02353v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrons at the Fermi energy may lose their ability to propagate to long distances in certain random media. We use Green functions and solve parquet equations for the non-local electron-hole vertex in high spatial dimensions to describe the vanishing of diffusion in Anderson localization. It is caused by forming a quantum bound state between the diffusing particle and the hole left behind. Divergence in a new time scale proportional to the electrical polarizability signals the Anderson localization transition. Consequently, the height of the peak of the dynamical conductivity at zero frequency, the static diffusion constant, is not pushed to zero at the localization transition but rather its width. Spatially localized quantum bound states in the localized phase cannot be described by the continuity and wave equations in the Hilbert space of Bloch waves.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of the Schwinger model via gauge-invariant VUMPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the lattice Schwinger model by combining the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm with a gauge-invariant matrix product ansatz that locally enforces the Gauss law constraint. Both the continuum and lattice versions of the Schwinger model with $\theta=\pi$ are known to exhibit first-order phase transitions for the values of the fermion mass above a critical value, where a second-order phase transition occurs. Our algorithm enables a precise determination of the critical endpoint in the continuum theory. We further analyze the scaling in the simultaneous critical and continuum limits and confirm that the data collapse aligns with the Ising universality class to remarkable precision.</description>

      <title>Diversity of Superradiant Phase Transitions in the Bose-Fermi System under Tight-Binding Model in the Weak-Coupling Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic diversity associated with superradiant phase transitions within a one-dimensional tight-binding electronic chain that is intrinsically coupled to a single-mode optical cavity. By employing the quantized electromagnetic vector potential through the Peierls substitution, the gauge-invariant coupled Bose-Fermi system facilitates momentum-dependent superradiant transitions and effectively avoids the second-order spurious phase transitions typically observed in Dicke-like models. The quantum phase transitions in this system are characterized by stable dynamics, including the displacement and squeezing of the cavity mode and the redistribution of electronic momentum in the solid chain. Distinct from multimode cavity QED systems with atomic gases, this single-mode optical configuration unveils a range of nonlinear phenomena, including multistability and diversity of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The setup allows for precise manipulation of superradiant phases in the weak coupling regime, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of quantum fluctuation divergences. The diverse attributes of these quantum phase transitions enhance our understanding of tunable quantum solid devices and underscore their potential applications in quantum information processing and metrology.</description>

      <title>Classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the action of a finite group $G$ by locality preserving automorphisms (quantum cellular automata) on quantum spin chains. We refer to such group actions as ``symmetries''. The natural notion of equivalence for such symmetries is \emph{stable equivalence}, which allows for stacking with factorized group actions. Stacking also endows the set of equivalence classes with a group structure. We prove that the anomaly of such symmetries provides an isomorphism between the group of stable equivalence classes of symmetries with the cohomology group $H^3(G,U(1))$, consistent with previous conjectures. This amounts to a complete classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains. We further show that a locality preserving symmetry is stably equivalent to one that can be presented by finite depth quantum circuits with covariant gates if and only if the slant product of its anomaly is trivial in $H^2(G, U(1)[G])$.</description>

      <title>Predicting fermionic densities using a Projected Quantum Kernel method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a support vector regressor based on a projected quantum kernel method to predict the density structure of 1D fermionic systems of interest in quantum chemistry and quantum matter. The kernel is built on with the observables of a quantum reservoir implementable with interacting Rydberg atoms. Training and test data of the fermionic system are generated using a Density Functional Theory approach. We test the performance of the method for several Hamiltonian parameters, finding a general common behavior of the error as a function of measurement time. At sufficiently large measurement times, we find that the method outperforms the classical linear kernel method and can be competitive with the radial basis function method.</description>
