      <title>Hermitian metrics on complex non-K\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this survey, we consider various analytic problems related to the geometry of the Chern connection on Hermitian manifolds, such as the existence of metrics with constant Chern-scalar curvature, generalizations of the K\"ahler-Einstein condition to the non-K\"ahler setting, and the convergence of the Chern-Ricci flow on compact complex surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the Milnor fibres of initial forms of topologically equivalent holomorphic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Budur, Fernandes de Bobadilla, Le and Nguyen (2022) conjectured that if two germs of holomorphic functions are topologically equivalent, then the Milnor fibres of their initial forms are homotopy equivalent. In this note, we give affirmative answers to this conjecture in the case of plane curves. We show also that a positive answer to this conjecture implies in a positive answer to the famous Zariski multiplicity conjecture both in the case of right equivalence or in the case of hypersurfaces with isolated singularities.</description>

      <title>Diederich--Forn\ae ss index and global regularity in the $\overline{\partial}$--Neumann problem: domains with comparable Levi eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14197v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a smooth bounded pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$. Let $1\leq q_{0}\leq (n-1)$. We show that if $q_{0}$--sums of eigenvalues of the Levi form are comparable, then if the Diederich--Forn\ae ss index of $\Omega$ is $1$, the $\overline{\partial}$--Neumann operators $N_{q}$ and the Bergman projections $P_{q-1}$ are regular in Sobolev norms for $q_{0}\leq q\leq n$. In particular, for domains in $\mathbb{C}^{2}$, Diederich--Forn\ae ss index $1$ implies global regularity in the $\overline{\partial}$--Neumann problem.</description>

      <title>Partially Hyperbolic Compact Complex Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and investigate two types, the latter with two variants, of notions of partial hyperbolicity accounting for several classes of compact complex manifolds behaving hyperbolically in certain directions, defined by a vector subbundle of the holomorphic tangent bundle, but not necessarily in the other directions. A key role is played by certain entire holomorphic maps, possibly from a higher-dimensional space, into the given manifold $X$. The dimension of the origin $\C^p$ of these maps is allowed to be arbitrary, unlike both the classical $1$-dimensional case of entire curves and the $1$-codimensional case introduced in previous work of the second-named author with S. Marouani. The higher-dimensional generality necessitates the imposition of certain growth conditions, very different from those in Nevanlinna theory and those in works by de Th\'elin, Burns and Sibony on Ahlfors currents, on the entire holomorphic maps $f:\C^p\longrightarrow X$. The way to finding these growth conditions is revealed by certain special, possibly non-K\"ahler, Hermitian metrics in the spirit of Gromov's K\"ahler hyperbolicity theory but in a higher-dimensional context. We then study several classes of examples, prove implications among our partial hyperbolicity notions, give a sufficient criterion for the existence of an Ahlfors current and a sufficient criterion for partial hyperbolicity in terms of the signs of two curvature-like objects introduced recently by the second-named author.</description>

      <title>Volterra-type inner derivations on Hardy spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classical result of Calkin [Ann. of Math. (2) 42 (1941), pp. 839-873] says that an inner derivation $S\mapsto [T,S] = TS-ST$ maps the algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space into the ideal of compact operators if and only if $T$ is a compact perturbation of the multiplication by a scalar. In general, an analogous statement fails for operators on Banach spaces. To complement Calkin's result, we characterize Volterra-type inner derivations on Hardy spaces using generalized area operators and compact intertwining relations for Volterra and composition operators. Further, we characterize the compact intertwining relations for multiplication and composition operators between Hardy and Bergman spaces.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of the Bigolin complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a compact complex manifold, we develop Hodge theory for the elliptic complex of differential forms defined by Bigolin in 1969 and recently referred as the Schweitzer complex. We exhibit several $L^2$ orthogonal decompositions of spaces of forms and prove a Hodge decomposition for harmonic forms on compact K\"ahler manifolds. Then we compute the cohomology of this Bigolin complex on the small deformations of the complex structure of the Iwasawa manifold, showing that, in this example, this Bigolin cohomology is as powerful as Aeppli and Bott-Chern cohomology, in order to distinguish complex structures. Recall that the double complex of a compact complex manifold decomposes into a direct sum of so-called squares and zigzags, and the zigzags are the only components contributing to cohomology. We prove that, on any compact complex manifold of complex dimension 3, the multiplicities of zigzags in this decomposition are completely characterised by Betti, Hodge, Aeppli numbers plus Bigolin numbers, namely the dimensions of the Bigolin cohomology. This result is sharp, meaning that if we remove Hodge or Bigolin numbers from the previous statement then it becomes false. We then apply this last result to fully describe the double complexes of the small deformations of the Iwasawa manifold. Finally, we partially extend the definition of this complex on almost complex manifolds, providing a cohomological invariant on $1$-forms which is finite dimensional when the manifold is compact.</description>
