      <title>Learning to Unify Audio, Visual and Text for Audio-Enhanced Multilingual Visual Answer Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of Multilingual Visual Answer Localization (MVAL) is to locate a video segment that answers a given multilingual question. Existing methods either focus solely on visual modality or integrate visual and subtitle modalities. However, these methods neglect the audio modality in videos, consequently leading to incomplete input information and poor performance in the MVAL task. In this paper, we propose a unified Audio-Visual-Textual Span Localization (AVTSL) method that incorporates audio modality to augment both visual and textual representations for the MVAL task. Specifically, we integrate features from three modalities and develop three predictors, each tailored to the unique contributions of the fused modalities: an audio-visual predictor, a visual predictor, and a textual predictor. Each predictor generates predictions based on its respective modality. To maintain consistency across the predicted results, we introduce an Audio-Visual-Textual Consistency module. This module utilizes a Dynamic Triangular Loss (DTL) function, allowing each modality's predictor to dynamically learn from the others. This collaborative learning ensures that the model generates consistent and comprehensive answers. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the audio modality.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Lossless Event Data Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging event cameras acquire visual information by detecting time domain brightness changes asynchronously at the pixel level and, unlike conventional cameras, are able to provide high temporal resolution, very high dynamic range, low latency, and low power consumption. Considering the huge amount of data involved, efficient compression solutions are very much needed. In this context, this paper presents a novel deep-learning-based lossless event data compression scheme based on octree partitioning and a learned hyperprior model. The proposed method arranges the event stream as a 3D volume and employs an octree structure for adaptive partitioning. A deep neural network-based entropy model, using a hyperprior, is then applied. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms traditional lossless data compression techniques in terms of compression ratio and bits per event.</description>

      <title>PIAST: A Multimodal Piano Dataset with Audio, Symbolic and Text</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While piano music has become a significant area of study in Music Information Retrieval (MIR), there is a notable lack of datasets for piano solo music with text labels. To address this gap, we present PIAST (PIano dataset with Audio, Symbolic, and Text), a piano music dataset. Utilizing a piano-specific taxonomy of semantic tags, we collected 9,673 tracks from YouTube and added human annotations for 2,023 tracks by music experts, resulting in two subsets: PIAST-YT and PIAST-AT. Both include audio, text, tag annotations, and transcribed MIDI utilizing state-of-the-art piano transcription and beat tracking models. Among many possible tasks with the multi-modal dataset, we conduct music tagging and retrieval using both audio and MIDI data and report baseline performances to demonstrate its potential as a valuable resource for MIR research.</description>

      <title>Towards Context-Aware Adaptation in Extended Reality: A Design Space for XR Interfaces and an Adaptive Placement Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By converting the entire 3D space around the user into a screen, Extended Reality (XR) can ameliorate traditional displays' space limitations and facilitate the consumption of multiple pieces of information at a time. However, if designed inappropriately, these XR interfaces can overwhelm the user and complicate information access. In this work, we explored the design dimensions that can be adapted to enable suitable presentation and interaction within an XR interface. To investigate a specific use case of context-aware adaptations within our proposed design space, we concentrated on the spatial layout of the XR content and investigated non-adaptive and adaptive placement strategies. In this paper, we (1) present a comprehensive design space for XR interfaces, (2) propose Environment-referenced, an adaptive placement strategy that uses a relevant intermediary from the environment within a Hybrid Frame of Reference (FoR) for each XR object, and (3) evaluate the effectiveness of this adaptive placement strategy and a non-adaptive Body-Fixed placement strategy in four contextual scenarios varying in terms of social setting and user mobility in the environment. The performance of these placement strategies from our within-subjects user study emphasized the importance of intermediaries' relevance to the user's focus. These findings underscore the importance of context-aware interfaces, indicating that the appropriate use of an adaptive content placement strategy in a context can significantly improve task efficiency, accuracy, and usability.</description>

      <title>Speech Separation with Pretrained Frontend to Minimize Domain Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech separation seeks to separate individual speech signals from a speech mixture. Typically, most separation models are trained on synthetic data due to the unavailability of target reference in real-world cocktail party scenarios. As a result, there exists a domain gap between real and synthetic data when deploying speech separation models in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised domain-invariant pretrained (DIP) frontend that is exposed to mixture data without the need for target reference speech. The DIP frontend utilizes a Siamese network with two innovative pretext tasks, mixture predictive coding (MPC) and mixture invariant coding (MIC), to capture shared contextual cues between real and synthetic unlabeled mixtures. Subsequently, we freeze the DIP frontend as a feature extractor when training the downstream speech separation models on synthetic data. By pretraining the DIP frontend with the contextual cues, we expect that the speech separation skills learned from synthetic data can be effectively transferred to real data. To benefit from the DIP frontend, we introduce a novel separation pipeline to align the feature resolution of the separation models. We evaluate the speech separation quality on standard benchmarks and real-world datasets. The results confirm the superiority of our DIP frontend over existing speech separation models. This study underscores the potential of large-scale pretraining to enhance the quality and intelligibility of speech separation in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>pTSE-T: Presentation Target Speaker Extraction using Unaligned Text Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TSE aims to extract the clean speech of the target speaker in an audio mixture, thus eliminating irrelevant background noise and speech. While prior work has explored various auxiliary cues including pre-recorded speech, visual information (e.g., lip motions and gestures), and spatial information, the acquisition and selection of such strong cues are infeasible in many practical scenarios. Unlike all existing work, in this paper, we condition the TSE algorithm on semantic cues extracted from limited and unaligned text content, such as condensed points from a presentation slide. This method is particularly useful in scenarios like meetings, poster sessions, or lecture presentations, where acquiring other cues in real-time is challenging. To this end, we design two different networks. Specifically, our proposed TPE fuses audio features with content-based semantic cues to facilitate time-frequency mask generation to filter out extraneous noise, while another proposal, namely TSR, employs the contrastive learning technique to associate blindly separated speech signals with semantic cues. The experimental results show the efficacy in accurately identifying the target speaker by utilizing semantic cues derived from limited and unaligned text, resulting in SI-SDRi of 12.16 dB, SDRi of 12.66 dB, PESQi of 0.830 and STOIi of 0.150, respectively. Dataset and source code will be publicly available. Project demo page: https://slideTSE.github.io/.</description>

      <title>FASTER: A Font-Agnostic Scene Text Editing and Rendering Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scene Text Editing (STE) is a challenging research problem, that primarily aims towards modifying existing texts in an image while preserving the background and the font style of the original text. Despite its utility in numerous real-world applications, existing style-transfer-based approaches have shown sub-par editing performance due to (1) complex image backgrounds, (2) diverse font attributes, and (3) varying word lengths within the text. To address such limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel font-agnostic scene text editing and rendering framework, named FASTER, for simultaneously generating text in arbitrary styles and locations while preserving a natural and realistic appearance and structure. A combined fusion of target mask generation and style transfer units, with a cascaded self-attention mechanism has been proposed to focus on multi-level text region edits to handle varying word lengths. Extensive evaluation on a real-world database with further subjective human evaluation study indicates the superiority of FASTER in both scene text editing and rendering tasks, in terms of model performance and efficiency. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>POINTS: Improving Your Vision-language Model with Affordable Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04828v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, vision-language models have made significant strides, excelling in tasks like optical character recognition and geometric problem-solving. However, several critical issues remain: 1) Proprietary models often lack transparency about their architectures, while open-source models need more detailed ablations of their training strategies. 2) Pre-training data in open-source works is under-explored, with datasets added empirically, making the process cumbersome. 3) Fine-tuning often focuses on adding datasets, leading to diminishing returns. To address these issues, we propose the following contributions: 1) We trained a robust baseline model using the latest advancements in vision-language models, introducing effective improvements and conducting comprehensive ablation and validation for each technique. 2) Inspired by recent work on large language models, we filtered pre-training data using perplexity, selecting the lowest perplexity data for training. This approach allowed us to train on a curated 1M dataset, achieving competitive performance. 3) During visual instruction tuning, we used model soup on different datasets when adding more datasets yielded marginal improvements. These innovations resulted in a 9B parameter model that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. Our strategies are efficient and lightweight, making them easily adoptable by the community.</description>
