      <title>Sequential bi-level regularized inversion with application to hidden reaction law discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop and present a novel regularization scheme for ill-posed inverse problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). In [43], the author suggested a bi-level regularization framework. This study significantly improves upon the bi-level algorithm by sequential initialization, yielding accelerated convergence and demonstrable multi-scale effect, while retaining regularizing effect with respect to noise and allows for the usage of inexact PDE solvers. The sequential bi-level approach illustrates its universality through several reaction-diffusion applications, in which the nonlinear reaction law needs to be determined. To demonstrate the applicability of our algorithms, we moreover prove that the proposed tangential cone condition is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Continuous data assimilation for hydrodynamics: consistent discretization and application to moment recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the challenge of moment recovery in hydrodynamic approximation in kinetic theory, we propose a data-driven approach for the hydrodynamic models. Inspired by continuous data assimilation, our method introduces a relaxation-based nudging system coupled with a novel discretization technique. This approach facilitates the simultaneous recovery of both the force term and a high-resolution solution from sparsely observed data. To address potential numerical artifacts, we use kernel regression to fit the observed data. We also analyze the convergence of the proposed nudging system under both full and partial data scenarios. When applied to moment systems, the source term involves the derivative of higher-order moments, our approach serves as a crucial step for data preparation in machine-learning based moment closure models. Multiple numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, and we discuss its potential extension to high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Distribution Appraisal Based on Piecewise B\'ezier Curves: An Objective Evaluation Method about Finite Element Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of quasi-distribution evaluation criteria based on piecewise Bezier curves is proposed to address the issue of the inability to objectively evaluate finite element models. During the optimization design of mechanical parts, finite element modeling is performed on their stress deformation, and the mesh node shape variable values are converted into distribution histogram data for piecewise Bezier curve fitting. Being dealt with area normalization method, the fitting curve could be regarded as a kind of probability density function (PDF), and its variance could be used to evaluate the finite element modeling results. The situation with the minimum variance is the optimal choice for overall deformation. Numerical experiments have indicated that the new method demonstrated the intrinsic characteristics of the finite element models of difference mechanical parts. As an objective appraisal method for evaluating finite element models, it is both effective and feasible.</description>

      <title>FEM-based Neural Networks for Solving Incompressible Fluid Flows and Related Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical simulation and optimization of technical systems described by partial differential equations is expensive, especially in multi-query scenarios in which the underlying equations have to be solved for different parameters. A comparatively new approach in this context is to combine the good approximation properties of neural networks (for parameter dependence) with the classical finite element method (for discretization). However, instead of considering the solution mapping of the PDE from the parameter space into the FEM-discretized solution space as a purely data-driven regression problem, so-called physically informed regression problems have proven to be useful. In these, the equation residual is minimized during the training of the neural network, i.e. the neural network "learns" the physics underlying the problem. In this paper, we extend this approach to saddle-point and non-linear fluid dynamics problems, respectively, namely stationary Stokes and stationary Navier-Stokes equations. In particular, we propose a modification of the existing approach: Instead of minimizing the plain vanilla equation residual during training, we minimize the equation residual modified by a preconditioner. By analogy with the linear case, this also improves the condition in the present non-linear case. Our numerical examples demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces the training effort and greatly increases accuracy and generalizability. Finally, we show the application of the resulting parameterized model to a related inverse problem.</description>

      <title>A Method of Fundamental Solutions for Large-Scale 3D Elastance and Mobility Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of fundamental solutions (MFS) is known to be effective for solving 3D Laplace and Stokes Dirichlet boundary value problems in the exterior of a large collection of simple smooth objects. Here we present new scalable MFS formulations for the corresponding elastance and mobility problems. The elastance problem computes the potentials of conductors with given net charges, while the mobility problem -- crucial to rheology and complex fluid applications -- computes rigid body velocities given net forces and torques on the particles. The key idea is orthogonal projection of the net charge (or forces and torques) in a rectangular variant of a "completion flow". The proposal is compatible with one-body preconditioning, resulting in well-conditioned square linear systems amenable to fast multipole accelerated iterative solution, thus a cost linear in the particle number. For large suspensions with moderate lubrication forces, MFS sources on inner proxy-surfaces give accuracy on par with a well-resolved boundary integral formulation. Our several numerical tests include a suspension of 10000 nearby ellipsoids, using 26 million total preconditioned degrees of freedom, where GMRES converges to five digits of accuracy in under two hours on one workstation.</description>

      <title>Novel and refined stability estimates for kernel matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kernel matrices are a key quantity within kernel based approximation, and important properties like stability or convergence of algorithms can be analyzed with help of it. In this work we refine a multivariate Ingham-type theorem, which is then leveraged to obtain novel and refined stability estimates on kernel matrices, focussing on the case of finitely smooth kernels. In particular we obtain results that relate the Rayleigh quotients of kernel matrices for kernels of different smoothness to each other. Finally we comment on conclusions for the eigenvectors of these kernel matrices.</description>

      <title>Fast Algorithms for Fourier extension based on boundary interval data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper present a new algorithm for the computation of Fourier extension based on boundary data, which can obtain a super-algebraic convergent Fourier approximation for non-periodic functions. The algorithm calculates the extension part through boundary data and connects it with the original function to form a periodic smooth function. By testing the key parameters involved, their impact on the algorithm is clarified and the optimization setting scheme of the parameters is proposed. Compared with FFT, the algorithm only needs to increase the computational complexity by a fixed small amount.</description>

      <title>Minimization of the Pseudospectral Abscissa of a Quadratic Matrix Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a quadratic matrix polynomial dependent on parameters and a given tolerance $\epsilon &gt; 0$, the minimization of the $\epsilon$-pseudospectral abscissa over the set of permissible parameter values is discussed, with applications in damping optimization and brake squeal reductions in mind. An approach is introduced that is based on nonsmooth and global optimization (or smooth optimization techniques such as BFGS if there are many parameters) equipped with a globally convergent criss-cross algorithm to compute the $\epsilon$-pseudospectral abscissa objective when the matrix polynomial is of small size. For the setting when the matrix polynomial is large, a subspace framework is introduced, and it is argued formally that it solves the minimization problem globally. The subspace framework restricts the parameter-dependent matrix polynomial to small subspaces, and thus solves the minimization problem for such restricted small matrix polynomials. It then expands the subspaces using the minimizers for the restricted polynomials. The proposed approach makes the global minimization of the $\epsilon$-pseudospectral abscissa possible for a quadratic matrix polynomial dependent on a few parameters and for sizes up to at least a few hundreds. This is illustrated on several examples originating from damping optimization.</description>

      <title>Approximating Symplectic Realizations: A General Framework for the Construction of Poisson Integrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the construction of symplectic integrators for Hamiltonian dynamics is well understood, an analogous general theory for Poisson integrators is still lacking. The main challenge lies in overcoming the singular and non-linear geometric behavior of Poisson structures, such as the presence of symplectic leaves with varying dimensions. In this paper, we propose a general approach for the construction of geometric integrators on any Poisson manifold based on independent geometric and dynamic sources of approximation. The novel geometric approximation is obtained by adapting structural results about symplectic realizations of general Poisson manifolds. We also provide an error analysis for the resulting methods and illustrative applications.</description>

      <title>Active Sampling of Interpolation Points to Identify Dominant Subspaces for Model Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model reduction is an active research field to construct low-dimensional surrogate models of high fidelity to accelerate engineering design cycles. In this work, we investigate model reduction for linear structured systems using dominant reachable and observable subspaces. When the training set $-$ containing all possible interpolation points $-$ is large, then these subspaces can be determined by solving many large-scale linear systems. However, for high-fidelity models, this easily becomes computationally intractable. To circumvent this issue, in this work, we propose an active sampling strategy to sample only a few points from the given training set, which can allow us to estimate those subspaces accurately. To this end, we formulate the identification of the subspaces as the solution of the generalized Sylvester equations, guiding us to select the most relevant samples from the training set to achieve our goals. Consequently, we construct solutions of the matrix equations in low-rank forms, which encode subspace information. We extensively discuss computational aspects and efficient usage of the low-rank factors in the process of obtaining reduced-order models. We illustrate the proposed active sampling scheme to obtain reduced-order models via dominant reachable and observable subspaces and present its comparison with the method where all the points from the training set are taken into account. It is shown that the active sample strategy can provide us $17$x speed-up without sacrificing any noticeable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Multiple right hand side multigrid for domain wall fermions with a multigrid preconditioned block conjugate gradient algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of efficient multiple right-hand side multigrid algorithm for domain wall fermions. The simultaneous solution for a modest number of right hand sides concurrently allows for a significant reduction in the time spent solving the coarse grid operator in a multigrid preconditioner. We introduce a preconditioned block conjuate gradient with a multigrid preconditioner, giving additional algorithmic benefit from the multiple right hand sides. There is also a very significant additional to computation rate benefit to multiple right hand sides. This both increases the arithmetic intensity in the coarse space and increases the amount of work being performed in each subroutine call, leading to excellent performance on modern GPU architectures. Further, the software implementation makes use of vendor linear algebra routines (batched GEMM) that can make use of high throughput tensor hardware on recent Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPUs. The cost of the coarse space is made sub-dominant in this algorithm, and benchmarks from the Frontier supercomputer system show up to a factor of twenty speed up over the standard red-black preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm on a large system with physical quark masses.</description>

      <title>A high-order procedure for computing globally optimal Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A standard task in solid state physics and quantum chemistry is the computation of localized molecular orbits known as Wannier functions. In this manuscript, we propose a new procedure for computing Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline materials. Our approach proceeds by first performing parallel transport of the Bloch functions using numerical integration. Then, using novel analysis, we show that a simple correction can be analytically computed that yields the optimally localized Wannier function. The resulting scheme is robust and capable of achieving high-order accuracy. We illustrate this in a number of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A geometric approach to approximating the limit set of eigenvalues for banded Toeplitz matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is about finding the limit set for banded Toeplitz matrices. Our main result is a new approach to approximate the limit set $\Lambda(b)$ where $b$ is the symbol of the banded Toeplitz matrix. The new approach is geometrical and based on the formula $\Lambda(b) = \cap_{\rho \in (0, \infty)} \text{sp } T(b_\rho)$, where $\rho$ is a scaling factor, i.e. $b_\rho(t) := b(\rho t)$, and $\text{sp }(\cdot)$ denotes the spectrum. We show that the full intersection can be approximated by the intersection for a finite number of $\rho$'s, and that the intersection of polygon approximations for $\text{sp } T(b_\rho)$ yields an approximating polygon for $\Lambda(b)$ that converges to $\Lambda(b)$ in the Hausdorff metric. Further, we show that one can slightly expand the polygon approximations for $\text{sp } T(b_\rho)$ to ensure that they contain $\text{sp } T(b_\rho)$. Then, taking the intersection yields an approximating superset of $\Lambda(b)$ which converges to $\Lambda(b)$ in the Hausdorff metric, and is guaranteed to contain $\Lambda(b)$. Combining the established algebraic (root-finding) method with our approximating superset, we are able to give an explicit bound on the Hausdorff distance to the true limit set. We implement the algorithm in Python and test it. It performs on par to and better in some cases than existing algorithms. We argue, but do not prove, that the average time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n^2 + mn\log m)$, where $n$ is the number of $\rho$'s and $m$ is the number of vertices for the polygons approximating $\text{sp } T(b_\rho)$. Further, we argue that the distance from $\Lambda(b)$ to both the approximating polygon and the approximating superset decreases as $O(1/\sqrt{k})$ for most of $\Lambda(b)$, where $k$ is the number of elementary operations required by the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Some convergence analysis for multicontinuum homogenization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12799v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an analysis of a recently proposed multicontinuum homogenization technique. The analysis differs from those used in classical homogenization methods for several reasons. First, the cell problems in multicontinuum homogenization use constraint problems and can not be directly substituted into the differential operator. Secondly, the problem contains high contrast that remains in the homogenized problem. The homogenized problem averages the microstructure while containing the small parameter. In this analysis, we first based on our previous techniques, CEM-GMsFEM, to define a CEM-downscaling operator that maps the multicontinuum quantities to an approximated microscopic solution. Following the regularity assumption of the multicontinuum quantities, we construct a downscaling operator and the homogenized multicontinuum equations using the information of linear approximation of the multicontinuum quantities. The error analysis is given by the residual estimate of the homogenized equations and the well-posedness assumption of the homogenized equations.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis for high-order methods for variable-exponent fractional diffusion-wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers the variable-exponent fractional diffusion-wave equation, which describes, e.g. the propagation of mechanical diffusive waves in viscoelastic media with varying material properties. Rigorous numerical analysis for this model is not available in the literature, partly because the variable-exponent Abel kernel in the leading term may not be positive definite or monotonic. We adopt the idea of model reformulation to obtain a more tractable form, which, however, still involves an ``indefinite-sign, nonpositive-definite, nonmonotonic'' convolution kernel that introduces difficulties in numerical analysis. We address this issue to design two high-order schemes and derive their stability and error estimate based on the proved solution regularity, with $\alpha(0)$-order and second-order accuracy in time, respectively. Numerical experiments are presented to substantiate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>When big data actually are low-rank, or entrywise approximation of certain function-generated matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article concerns low-rank approximation of matrices generated by sampling a smooth function of two $m$-dimensional variables. We refute an argument made in the literature to prove that, for a specific class of analytic functions, such matrices admit accurate entrywise approximation of rank that is independent of $m$ -- a claim known as "big-data matrices are approximately low-rank". We provide a theoretical explanation of the numerical results presented in support of this claim, describing three narrower classes of functions for which $n \times n$ function-generated matrices can be approximated within an entrywise error of order $\varepsilon$ with rank $\mathcal{O}(\log(n) \varepsilon^{-2} \mathrm{polylog}(\varepsilon^{-1}))$ that is independent of the dimension $m$: (i) functions of the inner product of the two variables, (ii) functions of the Euclidean distance between the variables, and (iii) shift-invariant positive-definite kernels. We extend our argument to tensor-train approximation of tensors generated with functions of the multi-linear product of their $m$-dimensional variables. We discuss our results in the context of low-rank approximation of (a) growing datasets and (b) attention in transformer neural networks.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of an L2-type method on graded meshes for semilinear subdiffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A semilinear initial-boundary value problem with a Caputo time derivative of fractional order $\alpha\in(0,1)$ is considered, solutions of which typically exhibit a singular behaviour at an initial time. For an L2-type discretization of order $3-\alpha$, we give sharp pointwise-in-time error bounds on graded temporal meshes with arbitrary degree of grading.</description>

      <title>Unbiased Kinetic Langevin Monte Carlo with Inexact Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an unbiased method for Bayesian posterior means based on kinetic Langevin dynamics that combines advanced splitting methods with enhanced gradient approximations. Our approach avoids Metropolis correction by coupling Markov chains at different discretization levels in a multilevel Monte Carlo approach. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our proposed estimator is unbiased, attains finite variance, and satisfies a central limit theorem. It can achieve accuracy $\epsilon&gt;0$ for estimating expectations of Lipschitz functions in $d$ dimensions with $\mathcal{O}(d^{1/4}\epsilon^{-2})$ expected gradient evaluations, without assuming warm start. We exhibit similar bounds using both approximate and stochastic gradients, and our method's computational cost is shown to scale independently of the size of the dataset. The proposed method is tested using a multinomial regression problem on the MNIST dataset and a Poisson regression model for soccer scores. Experiments indicate that the number of gradient evaluations per effective sample is independent of dimension, even when using inexact gradients. For product distributions, we give dimension-independent variance bounds. Our results demonstrate that in large-scale applications, the unbiased algorithm we present can be 2-3 orders of magnitude more efficient than the ``gold-standard" randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Modeling, Inference, and Prediction in Mobility-Based Compartmental Models for Epidemiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical compartmental models in epidemiology often assume a homogeneous population for simplicity, which neglects the inherent heterogeneity among individuals. This assumption frequently leads to inaccurate predictions when applied to real-world data. For example, evidence has shown that classical models overestimate the final pandemic size in the H1N1-2009 and COVID-19 outbreaks. To address this issue, we introduce individual mobility as a key factor in disease transmission and control. We characterize disease dynamics using mobility distribution functions for each compartment and propose a mobility-based compartmental model that incorporates population heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate that, for the same basic reproduction number, our mobility-based model predicts a smaller final pandemic size compared to the classical models, effectively addressing the common overestimation problem. Additionally, we infer mobility distributions from the time series of the infected population. We provide sufficient conditions for uniquely identifying the mobility distribution from a dataset and propose a machine-learning-based approach to learn mobility from both synthesized and real-world data.</description>
