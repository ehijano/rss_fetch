      <title>Computing Certificates of Strictly Positive Polynomials in Archimedean Quadratic Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New results on computing certificates of strictly positive polynomials in Archimedean quadratic modules are presented. The results build upon (i) Averkov's method for generating a strictly positive polynomial for which a membership certificate can be more easily computed than the input polynomial whose certificate is being sought, and (ii) Lasserre's method for generating a certificate by successively approximating a nonnegative polynomial by sums of squares. First, a fully constructive method based on Averkov's result is given by providing details about the parameters; further, his result is extended to work on arbitrary subsets, in particular, the whole Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, producing globally strictly positive polynomials. Second, Lasserre's method is integrated with the extended Averkov construction to generate certificates. Third, the methods have been implemented and their effectiveness is illustrated. Examples are given on which the existing software package RealCertify appears to struggle, whereas the proposed method succeeds in generating certificates. Several situations are identified where an Archimedean polynomial does not have to be explicitly included in a set of generators of an Archimedean quadratic module. Unlike other approaches for addressing the problem of computing certificates, the methods/approach presented is easier to understand as well as implement.</description>
