      <title>A rainbow Dirac theorem for loose Hamilton cycles in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A meta-conjecture of Coulson, Keevash, Perarnau and Yepremyan states that above the extremal threshold for a given spanning structure in a (hyper-)graph, one can find a rainbow version of that spanning structure in any suitably bounded colouring of the host (hyper-)graph. We solve one of the most pertinent outstanding cases of this conjecture, by showing that for any $1\leq j\leq k-1$, if $G$ is a $k$-uniform hypergraph above the $j$-degree threshold for a loose Hamilton cycle, then any globally bounded colouring of $G$ contains a rainbow loose Hamilton cycle.</description>

      <title>Circle graphs and the automorphism group of the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that $Aut({\mathbb S}^1)$ coincides with the automorphism group of the \emph{circle graph} $\mathcal{C}$, i.e. the intersection graph of the family of chords of ${\mathbb S}^1$.
  We prove that the countable subgraph of $\mathcal{C}$ induced by the rational chords is a strongly universal element of the family of circle graphs, and that it is invariant under local complementation. The only other known connected graphs that have the latter property are $K_2$ and the Rado graph.</description>

      <title>Loose elements in binary and ternary matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a matroid element "loose" if it is contained in no circuits of size less than the rank of the matroid. A matroid in which all elements are loose is a paving matroid. Acketa determined all binary paving matroids, while Oxley specified all ternary paving matroids. We characterize the binary matroids that contain a loose element. For ternary matroids with a loose element, we show that their size is linear in terms of their rank. Moreover, for a prime power $q$, we give a partial characterization of $GF(q)$-representable matroids that have two or more loose elements; we note Rajpal's partial characterization of $GF(q)$-representable paving matroids as a consequence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a well-shuffled deck of cards, what is the probability that somewhere in the deck there are adjacent cards of the same rank? What is the average number of adjacent matches? What is the probability distribution for the number of matches? We answer these and related questions for both the standard $52$-card deck with four suits and $13$ ranks and for generalized decks with $k$ suits and $n$ ranks. We also determine the limiting distribution as $n$ goes to infinity with $k$ fixed.</description>

      <title>The existence of pyramidal Steiner triple systems over abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Steiner triple system STS$(v)$ is called $f$-pyramidal if it has an automorphism group fixing $f$ points and acting sharply transitively on the remaining ones. In this paper, we focus on the STSs that are $f$-pyramidal over some abelian group. Their existence has been settled only for the smallest admissible values of $f$, that is, $f=0,1,3$.
  In this paper, we complete this result and determine, for every $f&gt;3$, the spectrum of values $(f,v)$ for which there is an $f$-pyramidal STS$(v)$ over an abelian group. This result is obtained by constructing difference families relative to a suitable partial spread.</description>

      <title>On subgroup perfect codes in vertex-transitive graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset $C$ of the vertex set $V$ of a graph $\Gamma$ is called a perfect code in $\Gamma$ if every vertex in $V\setminus C$ is adjacent to exactly one vertex in $C$. Given a group $G$ and a subgroup $H$ of $G$, a subgroup $A$ of $G$ containing $H$ is called a perfect code of the pair $(G,H)$ if there exists a coset graph $\mathrm{Cos}(G,H,U)$ such that the set of left cosets of $H$ in $A$ is a perfect code in $\mathrm{Cos}(G,H,U)$. In particular, $A$ is called a perfect code of $G$ if $A$ is a perfect code of the pair $(G,1)$. In this paper, we give a characterization of $A$ to be a perfect code of the pair $(G,H)$ under the assumption that $H$ is a perfect code of $G$. As a corollary, we derive an additional sufficient and necessary condition for $A$ to be a perfect code of $G$. Moreover, we establish conditions under which $A$ is not a perfect code of $(G,H)$, which is applied to construct infinitely many counterexamples to a question posed by Wang and Zhang [\emph{J.~Combin.~Theory~Ser.~A}, 196 (2023) 105737]. Furthermore, we initiate the study of determining which maximal subgroups of $S_n$ are perfect codes.</description>

      <title>Spectral radius and rainbow $k$-factors of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{G}=\{G_1,\ldots, G_{\frac{kn}{2}}\}$ be a set of graphs on the same vertex set $V=\{1,\dots,n\}$ where $k\cdot n$ is even. We say $\mathcal{G}$ admits a rainbow $k$-factor if there exists a $k$-regular graph $F$ on the vertex set $V$ such that all edges of $F$ are from different members of $\mathcal{G}$. Guo, Lu, Ma, and Ma [Spectral radius and rainbow matchings of graphs, Linear Algebra Appl., 2023] showed a sufficient spectral condition for the existence of a rainbow 1-factor. In this paper, we extend this result to all $k$-factors for $k\geq 2$, which is that if $\rho(G_i)\geq\rho(K_{k-1}\vee(K_1\cup K_{n-k}))$ for each $G_i\in \mathcal{G}$, then $\mathcal{G}$ admits a rainbow $k$-factor unless $G_1=G_2=\cdots=G_{\frac{kn}{2}}\cong K_{k-1}\vee(K_1\cup K_{n-k})$.</description>

      <title>Strictly Metrizable Graphs are Minor-Closed</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A consistent path system in a graph $G$ is an collection of paths, with exactly one path between any two vertices in $G$. A path system is said to be consistent if it is intersection-closed. We say that $G$ is strictly metrizable if every consistent path system in $G$ can be realized as the system of unique geodesics with respect to some assignment of positive edge weight. In this paper, we show that the family of strictly metrizable graphs is minor-closed.</description>

      <title>Dimension of dismantlable lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $1941$ Dushnik and Miller introduced the concept of dimension of a poset. In $2020$ Bhavale and Waphare introduced the concept of an RC-lattice as a lattice in which all the reducible elements are lying on a chain. In this paper, we obtain the dimension of adjunct sum of two lattices. We obtain a bound on the dimension of a dismantlable lattice in terms of its nullity. We also prove that the dimension of an RC-lattice on $n$ elements is at the most three. Consequently, we prove that an RC-lattice is non planar if and only if its dimension is three.</description>

      <title>Generalized Euler numbers and ordered set partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euler numbers have been widely studied. A signed version of the Euler numbers of even subscript are given by the coefficients of the exponential generating function 1/(1+x^2/2!+x^4/4!+...). Leeming and MacLeod introduced a generalization of the Euler numbers depending on an integer parameter d where one takes the coefficients of the expansion of 1/(1+x^d/d!+x^{2d}/(2d)!+...). These numbers have been shown to have many interesting properties despite being much less studied. And the techniques used have been mainly algebraic. We propose a combinatorial model for them as signed sums over ordered partitions. We show that this approach can be used to prove a number of old and new results including a recursion, integrality, and various congruences. Our methods include sign-reversing involutions and M\"obius inversion over partially ordered sets.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic Subgraphs in Randomly Colored Dense Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of graphs $G_n$ and a fixed graph $H$, denote by $T(H, G_n)$ the number of monochromatic copies of the graph $H$ in a uniformly random $c$-coloring of the vertices of $G_n$. In this paper we study the joint distribution of a finite collection of monochromatic graphs in networks with multiple layers (multiplex networks). Specifically, given a finite collection of graphs $H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_r$ we derive the joint distribution of $(T(H_1, G_n^{(1)}), T(H_2, G_n^{(2)}), \ldots, T(H_r, G_n^{(r)}))$, where $\boldsymbol{G}_n = (G_n^{(1)}, G_n^{(2)}, \ldots, G_n^{(d)})$ is a collection of dense graphs on the same vertex set converging in the joint cut-metric. The limiting distribution is the sum of 2 independent components: a multivariate Gaussian and a sum of independent bivariate stochastic integrals. This extends previous results on the marginal convergence of monochromatic subgraphs in a sequence of graphs to the joint convergence of a finite collection of monochromatic subgraphs in a sequence of multiplex networks. Several applications and examples are discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we obtain the asymptotic expansions of super intersection numbers and prove that the associated coefficients are polynomials. Moreover, we give an algorithm which can explicitly compute these coefficients. As an application, we prove the existence of a complete asymptotic expansion of super Weil-Petersson volumes in the large genus. This generalizes the celebrated work of Mirzakhani-Zograf. We also confirm two conjectural formulae proposed by Griguolo-Papalini-Russo-Seminara.</description>

      <title>Computing the $p$-Laplacian eigenpairs of signed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a nonlinear extension of the graph Laplacian, the graph $p$-Laplacian has various applications in many fields. Due to the nonlinearity, it is very difficult to compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of graph $p$-Laplacian. In this paper, we establish the equivalence between the graph $p$-Laplacian eigenproblem and the tensor eigenproblem when $p$ is even. Building on this result, algorithms designed for tensor eigenproblems can be adapted to compute the eigenpairs of the graph $p$-Laplacian. For general $p&gt;1$, we give a fast and convergent algorithm to compute the largest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenfunction of the signless graph $p$-Laplacian. As an application, we provide a new criterion to determine when a graph is not a subgraph of another one, which outperforms existing criteria based on the linear Laplacian and adjacency matrices. Our work highlights the deep connections and numerous similarities between the spectral theories of tensors and graph $p$-Laplacians.</description>

      <title>Optimization algorithms for Carleson and sparse collections of sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carleson and sparse collections of sets play a central role in dyadic harmonic analysis. We employ methods from optimization theory to study such collections. First, we present a strongly polynomial algorithm to compute the Carleson constant of a collection of sets, improving on the recent approximation algorithm of Rey. Our algorithm is based on submodular function minimization. Second, we provide an algorithm showing that any Carleson collection is sparse, achieving optimal dependence of the respective constants and thus providing a constructive proof of a result of H\"anninen. Our key insight is a reformulation of the duality between the Carleson condition and sparseness in terms of the duality between the maximum flow and the minimum cut in a weighted directed graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02487v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite point set $P \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, denote by $\text{diam}(P)$ the ratio of the largest to the smallest distances between pairs of points in $P$. Let $c_{d, \alpha}(n)$ be the largest integer $c$ such that any $n$-point set $P \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ in general position, satisfying $\text{diam}(P) &lt; \alpha\sqrt[d]{n}$, contains an $c$-point convex independent subset. We determine the asymptotics of $c_{d, \alpha}(n)$ as $n \to \infty$ by showing the existence of positive constants $\beta = \beta(d, \alpha)$ and $\gamma = \gamma(d)$ such that $\beta n^{\frac{d-1}{d+1}} \le c_{d, \alpha}(n) \le \gamma n^{\frac{d-1}{d+1}}$ for $\alpha\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>The strong chromatic index of 1-planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.14680v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromatic index $\chi'(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the smallest $k$ for which $G$ admits an edge $k$-coloring such that any two adjacent edges have distinct colors. The strong chromatic index $\chi'_s(G)$ of $G$ is the smallest $k$ such that $G$ has an edge $k$-coloring with the condition that any two edges at distance at most 2 receive distinct colors. A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane so that each edge is crossed by at most one other edge. In this paper, we show that every graph $G$ with maximum average degree $\bar{d}(G)$ has $\chi'_{s}(G)\le (2\bar{d}(G)-1)\chi'(G)$. As a corollary, we prove that every 1-planar graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$ has $\chi'_{\rm s}(G)\le 14\Delta$, which improves a result, due to Bensmail et al., which says that $\chi'_{\rm s}(G)\le 24\Delta$ if $\Delta\ge 56$.</description>

      <title>Applications of infinite lower triangular matrices and their group structure in combinatorics and the theory of orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the set of lower-triangular, infinite matrices with natural operations such as addition, multiplication by a number or matrix multiplication. With respect to every of these operations separately, the set preserves the group structure. With respect to all three operations considered jointly, the set becomes an algebra with unity. We indicate important properties of the obtained in this way algebraic structures. In particular, we indicate several sub-groups or sub-rings. Among sub-groups, we consider the group of Riordan matrices and indicate its several sub-groups. We also present many examples (in fact around 20) of such matrices composed of the sequences of important families of polynomials or numbers as entries of certain lower-triangular infinite matrices. By applying well-known matrix operations such as multiplication and calculating an inverse, we see that such representation can be and is a source of getting new, important relationships between these families.</description>

      <title>A canonical Ramsey theorem with list constraints in random (hyper-)graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated canonical Ramsey theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Rado implies that for a given $k$-uniform hypergraph (or $k$-graph) $H$, if $n$ is sufficiently large then any colouring of the edges of the complete $k$-graph $K^{(k)}_n$ gives rise to copies of $H$ that exhibit certain colour patterns. We are interested in sparse random versions of this result and the threshold at which the random $k$-graph ${\mathbf{G}}^{(k)}(n,p)$ inherits the canonical Ramsey properties of $K^{(k)}_n$. Our main result here pins down this threshold when we focus on colourings that are constrained by some prefixed lists. This result is applied in an accompanying work of the authors on the threshold for the canonical Ramsey property (with no list constraints) in the case that $H$ is a (2-uniform) even cycle.</description>

      <title>The tropical polytope is the set of all weighted tropical Fermat-Weber points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{v}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{v}_m$ be points in a metric space with distance $d$, and let $w_1,\ldots,w_m$ be positive real weights. The weighted Fermat-Weber points are those points $\mathbf{x}$ which minimize $\sum w_i d(\mathbf{v}_i, \mathbf{x})$. We extend a result of Com\u{a}neci and Joswig, that the set of unweighted Fermat-Weber points agrees with the "central" covector cell of the tropical convex hull of $\mathbf{v}_1,\ldots,\mathbf{v}_m$, to the weighted setting. In particular, we show that for any fixed data points $\mathbf{v}_1, \ldots, \mathbf{v}_m$, and any covector cell of the tropical convex hull of the data, there is a choice of weights that makes that cell the Fermat-Weber set. We similarly extend the method of Com\u{a}neci and Joswig for computing consensus trees in phylogenetics.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Hamiltonicity and the spectral radius</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{G}=\{G_1,\ldots,G_n \}$ be a family of graphs of order $n$ with the same vertex set. A rainbow Hamiltonian cycle in $\mathcal{G}$ is a cycle that visits each vertex precisely once such that any two edges belong to different graphs of $\mathcal{G}$. We show that if each $G_i$ has more than $\binom{n-1}{2}+1$ edges, then $\mathcal{G}$ admits a rainbow Hamiltonian cycle and pose the problem of characterizing rainbow Hamiltonicity under the condition that all $G_i$ have at least $\binom{n-1}{2}+1$ edges. Towards a solution of that problem, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of a rainbow Hamiltonian cycle in terms of the spectral radii of the graphs in $\mathcal{G}$ and completely characterize the corresponding extremal graphs.</description>

      <title>Towards a Stallings-type theorem for finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent development in graph-minor theory is to study local separators, vertex-sets that separate graphs locally but not necessarily globally. The local separators of a graph roughly correspond to the genuine separators of its local covering: a usually infinite graph obtained by keeping all local structure of the original graph while unfolding all other structure as much as possible.
  We use local separators and local coverings to discover and prove a low-order Stallings-type result for finite nilpotent groups $\Gamma$: the $r$-local covering of some Cayley graph $G$ of $\Gamma$ has $\geq 2$ ends that are separated by $\leq 2$ vertices iff $G$ has an $r$-local separator of size $\leq 2$ and $\Gamma$ has order $&gt;r$, iff $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to $C_i\times C_j$ for some $i&gt;r$ and $j\in\{1,2\}$.</description>

      <title>A biased edge coloring game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We combine the ideas of edge coloring games and asymmetric graph coloring games and define the \emph{$(m,1)$-edge coloring game}, which is alternatively played by two players Maker and Breaker on a finite simple graph $G$ with a set of colors $X$. Maker plays first and colors $m$ uncolored edges on each turn. Breaker colors only one uncolored edge on each turn. They make sure that adjacent edges get distinct colors. Maker wins if eventually every edge is colored; Breaker wins if at some point, the player who is playing cannot color any edge. We define the \emph{$(m,1)$-game chromatic index} of $G$ to be the smallest nonnegative integer $k$ such that Maker has a winning strategy with $|X|=k$. We give some general upper bounds on the $(m,1)$-game chromatic indices of trees, determine the exact $(m,1)$-game chromatic indices of some caterpillars and all wheels, and show that larger $m$ does not necessarily give us smaller $(m,1)$-game chromatic index.</description>

      <title>The existence of a spanning tree with leaf distance at least $d$ and leaf degree at most $k$ via the size or the spectral radius with respect to the minimum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06699v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$, $d$ be a positive integer, $G$ be a connected graph of order $n$, $T$ be a tree. The leaf distance of a tree is defined as the minimum distance between any two leaves. For $v\in V(T)$, the leaf degree of $v$ in $T$ is the number of leaves adjacent to $v$, and the leaf degree of $T$ is defined as maximum leaf degree among the vertices of $T$. In this paper, motivated by the conjecture proposed by Kaneko (2001) and its subsequent partial confirmation by Erbes, Molla, Mousley and Santana (2017), we obtain lower bounds in terms of the size and the adjacent spectral radius to guarantee that $G$ contains a spanning tree with leaf distance at least $d$, where $4\leq d \leq n-1$. Furthermore, we obtain some tight conditions in $G$ for its size and spectral radius to ensure that $G$ has a spanning tree with leaf degree at most $k$, which improves the result of Ao, Liu, Yuan, Ng and Cheng (2023).</description>

      <title>Optical orthogonal codes from a combinatorial perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) are sets of $(0,1)$-sequences with good auto- and cross-correlation properties. They were originally introduced for use in multi-access communication, particularly in the setting of optical CDMA communications systems. They can also be formulated in terms of families of subsets of $\mathbb{Z}_v$, where the correlation properties can be expressed in terms of conditions on the internal and external differences within and between the subsets. With this link there have been many studies on their combinatorial properties. However, in most of these studies it is assumed that the auto- and cross-correlation values are equal; in particular, many constructions focus on the case where both correlation values are $1$. This is not a requirement of the original communications application. In this paper, we "decouple" the two correlation values and consider the situation with correlation values greater than $1$. We consider the bounds on each of the correlation values, and the structural implications of meeting these separately, as well as associated links with other combinatorial objects. We survey definitions, properties and constructions, establish some new connections and concepts, and discuss open questions.</description>

Abstract: Fix integers $d,r\ge 2$ and suppose that the edge set of the $d$-fold Cartesian product of the $N$-clique $K_N^d$ is $r$-colored. We show that there is a copy of $K_n^d$ whose edges in each direction are monochromatic provided $N &gt; 2^{2^{c n^{d-1}}}$, where $c$ depends only on $r$ and $d$. This improves the previous best exponent of $n^d$ proved by Gir\~ao, Kronenberg, and Scott while also improving the best known bound due to them for a multidimensional Erd\H os-Szekeres monotone subsequence theorem introduced by Fishburn and Graham.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Throttling in graphs optimizes a sum or product of resources used, such as the number of vertices in an initial set, and time required, such as the propagation time, to complete a given task. We introduce a new technique to establish sharp upper bounds in terms of graph order for sum throttling and initial cost product throttling for power domination. Furthermore, we establish sharp bounds on possible changes of the product throttling number, both with and without initial cost, caused by certain graph operations for standard zero forcing, positive semidefinite forcing, and power domination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the conjugacy class growth function in finitely generated virtually abelian groups. That is, the number of elements in the ball of radius $n$ in the Cayley graph which intersect a fixed conjugacy class. In the class of virtually abelian groups, we prove that this function is always asymptotically equivalent to a polynomial. Furthermore, we show that in any affine Coxeter group, the degree of polynomial growth of a conjugacy class is equivalent to the reflection length of any element of that class.</description>

      <title>Iterated Entropy Derivatives and Binary Entropy Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We embark on a systematic study of the $(k+1)$-th derivative of $x^{k-r}H(x^r)$, where $H(x):=-x\log x-(1-x)\log(1-x)$ is the binary entropy and $k&gt;r\geq 1$ are integers. Our motivation is the conjectural entropy inequality $\alpha_k H(x^k)\geq x^{k-1}H(x)$, where $0&lt;\alpha_k&lt;1$ is given by a functional equation. The $k=2$ case was the key technical tool driving recent breakthroughs on the union-closed sets conjecture. We express $ \frac{d^{k+1}}{dx^{k+1}}x^{k-r}H(x^r)$ as a rational function, an infinite series, and a sum over generalized Stirling numbers. This allows us to reduce the proof of the entropy inequality for real $k$ to showing that an associated polynomial has only two real roots in the interval $(0,1)$, which also allows us to prove the inequality for fractional exponents such as $k=3/2$. The proof suggests a new framework for proving tight inequalities for the sum of polynomials times the logarithms of polynomials, which converts the inequality into a statement about the real roots of a simpler associated polynomial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we study the Dao numbers $\mathfrak{d}_1(I),\mathfrak{d}_2(I)$ and $\mathfrak{d}_3(I)$ of an ideal $I$ of a Noetherian local ring $(R,\mathfrak{m},K)$ or a standard graded Noetherian $K$-algebra. They are defined as the smallest $\ell\ge0$ such that $I\mathfrak{m}^k$ is $\mathfrak{m}$-full, full, weakly $\mathfrak{m}$-full, respectively, for all $k\ge\ell$. We provide general bounds for the Dao numbers in terms of the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of certain modules over the Rees algebra $\mathcal{R}(\mathfrak{m})$. If $R$ is a Koszul algebra, we prove that the Dao numbers are less or equal to $\text{reg}_{\text{gr}_\mathfrak{m}(R)}\text{gr}_\mathfrak{m}(I)$, where $\text{gr}_\mathfrak{m}(I)$ is the associated graded module of $I$. Finally, for monomial ideals, we combinatorially bound the Dao numbers in terms of asymptotic linear quotients and bounding multidegrees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider random matrices whose shape is the dilation $N\lambda$ of a self-conjugate Young diagram $\lambda$. In the large-$N$ limit, the empirical distribution of the squared singular values converges almost surely to a probability distribution $F^{\lambda}$. The moments of $F^{\lambda}$ enumerate two combinatorial objects: $\lambda$-plane trees and $\lambda$-Dyck paths, which we introduce and show to be in bijection. We also prove that the distribution $F^{\lambda}$ is algebraic, in the sense of Rao and Edelman. In the case of fat hook shapes we provide explicit formulae for $F^{\lambda}$ and we express it as a free convolution of two measures involving a Marchenko-Pastur and a Bernoulli distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study new identities related to the sums of adjacent terms in the Pell sequence, defined by $P_{n} := 2P_{n-1}+P_{n-2}$ for $ n\geq 2$ and $P_{0}=0, P_{1}=1$, and generalize these identities for many similar sequences. We prove that the sum of $N&gt;1$ consecutive Pell numbers is a fixed integer multiple of another Pell number if and only if $4\mid N$. We consider the generalized Pell $(k,i)$-numbers defined by $p(n) :=\ 2p(n-1)+p(n-k-1) $ for $n\geq k+1$, with $p(0)=p(1)=\cdots =p(i)=0$ and $p(i+1)=\cdots = p(k)=1$ for $0\leq i\leq k-1$, and prove that the sum of $N=2k+2$ consecutive terms is a fixed integer multiple of another term in the sequence. We also prove that for the generalized Pell $(k,k-1)$-numbers such a relation does not exist when $N$ and $k$ are odd. We give analogous results for the Fibonacci and other related second-order recursive sequences.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to Zagier's Duality Conjecture on Nahm Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09701v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given any positive integer $r$, Nahm's problem is to determine all $r\times r$ rational positive definite matrix $A$, $r$-dimensional rational vector $B$ and rational scalar $C$ such that the rank $r$ Nahm sum associated with $(A,B,C)$ is modular. Around 2007, Zagier conjectured that if the rank $r$ Nahm sum for $(A,B,C)$ is modular, then so is the dual Nahm sum associated with $(A^{-1},A^{-1}B,B^\mathrm{T} A^{-1}B/2-{r}/{24}-C)$. We construct some explicit rank four Nahm sums which are modular while their duals are not modular. This provides counterexamples to Zagier's duality conjecture.</description>

      <title>Construction, Transformation and Structures of 2x2 Space-Filling Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 2x2 space-filling curve is a type of generalized space-filling curve characterized by a basic unit is in a "U-shape" that traverses a 2x2 grid. In this work, we propose a universal framework for constructing general 2x2 curves where self-similarity is not strictly required. The construction is based on a novel set of grammars that define the expansion of curves from level 0 (a single point) to level 1 (units in U-shapes), which ultimately determines all $36 \times 2^k$ possible forms of curves on any level $k$ initialized from single points. We further developed an encoding system in which each unique form of the curve is associated with a specific combination of an initial seed and a sequence of codes that sufficiently describes both the global and local structures of the curve. We demonstrated that this encoding system is a powerful tool for studying 2x2 curves and we established comprehensive theoretical foundations from the following three key perspectives: 1) We provided a deterministic encoding for any unit on any level and position on the curve, enabling the study of curve generation across arbitrary parts on the curve and ranges of iterations; 2) We gave deterministic encodings for various curve transformations, including rotations, reflections and reversals; 3) We provided deterministic forms of families of curves exhibiting specific structures, including homogeneous curves, curves with identical shapes, and with completely distinct shapes. We also explored families of recursive curves, subunit identically shaped curves, symmetric curves and closed curves. Finally, we proposed a method to calculate the location of any point on the curve arithmetically, within a time complexity linear to the level of the curve.</description>

      <title>On the jump of the cover time in random geometric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02433v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the cover time of the simple random walk on the giant component of supercritical $d$-dimensional random geometric graphs on $n$ vertices. We show that the cover time undergoes a jump at the connectivity threshold radius $r_c$: with $r_g$ denoting the threshold for having a giant component, we show that if the radius $r$ satisfies $(1+\eps)r_g \le r \le (1-\eps)r_c$ for $\eps &gt; 0$ arbitrarily small, the cover time of the giant component is asymptotically almost surely $\Theta(n \log^2 n$). On the other hand, we show that for $r \ge (1+\eps)r_c$, the cover time of the graph is asymptotically almost surely $\Theta(n \log n)$ (which was known for $d=2$ only for a radius larger by a constant factor).</description>

      <title>Parsings of Stationary Processes, Stopping Times and the Fundamental Pointwise Convergence Theorems of Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of a parsing of a stationary process according to a collection of words is introduced, and the basic framework required for the asymptotic analysis of these parsings is presented. We demonstrate how the pointwise ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem can be deduced from their respective weaker convergence in probability versions combined with our observations regarding parsings, where the parsings are done according to collections that originate in stopping times tailored for that purpose.</description>
