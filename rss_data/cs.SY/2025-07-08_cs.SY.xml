      <title>A Compositional Approach to Diagnosing Faults in Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the cause of a system-level failure in a cyber-physical system (CPS) can be like tracing a needle in a haystack. This paper approaches the problem by assuming that the CPS has been designed compositionally and that each component in the system is associated with an assume-guarantee contract. We exploit recent advances in contract-based design that show how to compute the contract for the entire system using the component-level contracts. When presented with a system-level failure, our approach is able to efficiently identify the components that are responsible for the system-level failure together with the specific predicates in those components' specifications that are involved in the fault. We implemented this approach using Pacti and demonstrate it through illustrative examples inspired by an autonomous vehicle in the DARPA urban challenge.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Aerocapture Guidance Through a Probabilistic Indicator Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerocapture is sensitive to trajectory errors, particularly for low-cost missions with imprecise navigation. For such missions, considering the probability of each failure mode when computing guidance commands can increase performance. A risk-aware aerocapture guidance algorithm is proposed that uses a generative-modeling-based probabilistic indicator function to estimate escape, impact, or capture probabilities. The probability of each mode is incorporated into corrective guidance commands to increase the likelihood of successful capture. The proposed method is evaluated against state-of-the-art numeric predictor-corrector guidance algorithms in high-uncertainty scenarios where entry interface dispersions lead to nontrivial failure probabilities. When using a probabilistic indicator function in guidance, 69% to 100% of recoverable cases are saved in near-escape and near-impact scenarios. In addition, the probabilistic indicator is compared to a first-order fading memory filter for density estimation, showing improvements in apoapsis error even when a fading filter is included. The probabilistic indicator function can also accurately predict failure probability for dispersions outside its training data, showing generalizability. The proposed risk-aware aerocapture guidance algorithm improves capture performance and robustness to entry interface state dispersions, especially for missions with high navigation uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Constraint Hypergraphs as a Unifying Framework for Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins, used to represent physical systems, have been lauded as tools for understanding reality. Complex system behavior is typically captured in domain-specific models crafted by subject experts. Contemporary methods for employing models in a digital twin require prescriptive interfaces, resulting in twins that are difficult to connect, redeploy, and modify. The limited interoperability of these twins has prompted calls for a universal framework enabling observability across model aggregations. Here we show how a new mathematical formalism called a constraint hypergraph serves as such a framework by representing system behavior as the composition of set-based functions. A digital twin is shown to be the second of two coupled systems where both adhere to the same constraint hypergraph, permitting the properties of the first to be observable from the second. Interoperability is given by deconstructing models into a structure enabling autonomous, white-box simulation of system properties. The resulting digital twins can interact immediately with both human and autonomous agents. This is demonstrated in a case study of a microgrid, showing how both measured and simulated data from the aggregated twins can be provided regardless of the operating environment. By connecting models, constraint hypergraphs supply scientists and modelers robust means to capture, communicate, and combine digital twins across all fields of study. We expect this framework to expand the use of digital twins, enriching scientific insights and collaborations by providing a structure for characterizing complex systems.</description>

      <title>Basic Computations in Fault Tree Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is a well-established method in failure analysis and is widely used in safety and reliability assessments. While FTA tools enable users to manage complex analyses effectively, they can sometimes obscure the underlying calculation processes. As a result, the soundness of FTA results often hinges on the user's expertise and familiarity with the methodology and the tool. This paper aims to explore the fundamental principles underlying both qualitative and quantitative FTA analyses, while addressing broader conceptual considerations such as coherence and consensus. By developing a deeper understanding of these concepts, engineers can improve their ability to interpret, verify, and make informed use of the outputs generated by FTA tools. This paper does not propose a novel concept in FTA but aims to compile and present a concise overview of the fundamental computations in FTA.</description>

      <title>Sparsity-Promoting Dynamic Mode Decomposition Applied to Sea Surface Temperature Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we leverage Koopman mode decomposition to analyze the nonlinear and high-dimensional climate systems acting on the observed data space. The dynamics of atmospheric systems are assumed to be equation-free, with the linear evolution of observables derived from measured historical long-term time-series data snapshots, such as monthly sea surface temperature records, to construct a purely data-driven climate dynamics. In particular, sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition is exploited to extract the dominant spatial and temporal modes, which are among the most significant coherent structures underlying climate variability, enabling a more efficient, interpretable, and low-dimensional representation of the system dynamics. We hope that the combined use of Koopman modes and sparsity-promoting techniques will provide insights into the significant climate modes, enabling reduced-order modeling of the climate system and offering a potential framework for predicting and controlling weather and climate variability.</description>

      <title>Robust Bandwidth Estimation for Real-Time Communication with Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate bandwidth estimation (BWE) is critical for real-time communication (RTC) systems. Traditional heuristic approaches offer limited adaptability under dynamic networks, while online reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from high exploration costs and potential service disruptions. Offline RL, which leverages high-quality data collected from real-world environments, offers a promising alternative. However, challenges such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, policy extraction from behaviorally diverse datasets, and reliable deployment in production systems remain unsolved. We propose RBWE, a robust bandwidth estimation framework based on offline RL that integrates Q-ensemble (an ensemble of Q-functions) with a Gaussian mixture policy to mitigate OOD risks and enhance policy learning. A fallback mechanism ensures deployment stability by switching to heuristic methods under high uncertainty. Experimental results show that RBWE reduces overestimation errors by 18% and improves the 10th percentile Quality of Experience (QoE) by 18.6%, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world RTC applications.</description>

      <title>Assessing Linear Control Strategies for Zero-Speed Fin Roll Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Roll stabilization is a critical aspect of ship motion control, particularly for vessels operating in low-speed or zero-speed conditions, where traditional hydrodynamic fins lose their effectiveness. In this paper, we consider a roll damping system, developed by Navis JSC, based on two actively controlled zero-speed fins. Unlike conventional fin stabilizers, zero-speed fins employ a drag-based mechanism and active oscillations to generate stabilizing forces even when the vessel is stationary. We propose a simple linear control architecture that, however, accounts for nonlinear drag forces and actuator limitations. Simulation results on a high-fidelity vessel model used for HIL testing demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Low voltage user phase reconfiguration as a planning problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considerable levels of phase imbalance in low voltage (LV) distribution networks imply that grid assets are suboptimally utilized and can cause additional losses, equipment failure and degradation. With the ongoing energy transition, the installation of additional single-phase distributed energy resources may further increase the phase imbalance if no countermeasures are taken.
  Phase reconfiguration is a cost-effective solution to reduce imbalance. However, dynamic reconfiguration, through real-time phase swapping of loads using remotely controlled switches, is often impractical because these switches are too costly for widespread installation at LV users. Approaching phase reconfiguration as a planning problem, i.e. static reconfiguration, is an underaddressed but promising alternative. Effective static approaches that allow appropriate imbalance objectives are currently lacking.
  This paper presents reliable and expressive static phase reconfiguration methods that grid operators can easily integrate into routine maintenance for effective phase balancing.
  We present and compare three static methods, an exact mixed-integer nonlinear formulation (MINLP), a mixed-integer quadratic approximation (MIQP), and a genetic algorithm (GA), each supporting different imbalance objectives. The MIQP approach, despite using proxy objectives, efficiently mitigates the different types of imbalance considered, and outperforms both MINLP and GA in scalability and consistency.</description>

      <title>Optimal Placement of Smart Hybrid Transformers in Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid transformers are a relatively new technology that combine conventional power transformers with power electronics to provide voltage and reactive power control capabilities in distribution networks. This paper proposes a novel method of determining the optimal location and utilisation of hybrid transformers in 3-phase distribution networks to maximise the net present value of hybrid transformers based on their ability to increase the export of power produced by distributed generators over their operational lifespan. This has been accomplished through sequential linear programming, a key feature of which is the consideration of nonlinear characteristics and constraints relating to hybrid transformer power electronics and control capabilities. Test cases were carried out in a modified version of the Cigre European Low Voltage Distribution Network Benchmark, which has been extended by connecting it with two additional low voltage distribution test networks. All test case results demonstrate that the installation and utilisation of hybrid transformers can improve the income earned from exporting excess active power, justifying their installation cost (with the highest net present value being {\pounds}6.56 million, resulting from a 45.53 percent increase in estimated annual profits due to coordinated HT compensation).</description>

      <title>Cross-Subject DD: A Cross-Subject Brain-Computer Interface Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) based on motor imagery (MI) enables direct control of external devices by decoding the electroencephalogram (EEG) generated in the brain during imagined movements. However, due to inter-individual variability in brain activity, existing BCI models exhibit poor adaptability across subjects, thereby limiting their generalizability and widespread application. To address this issue, this paper proposes a cross-subject BCI algorithm named Cross-Subject DD (CSDD), which constructs a universal BCI model by extracting common features across subjects. The specific methods include: 1) training personalized models for each subject; 2) transforming personalized models into relation spectrums; 3) identifying common features through statistical analysis; and 4) constructing a cross-subject universal model based on common features. The experiments utilized the BCIC IV 2a dataset, involving nine subjects. Eight of these subjects were selected for training and extracing the common features, and the cross-subject decoding performance of the model was validated on the remaining subject. The results demonstrate that, compared with existing similar methods, our approach achieves a 3.28% improvement in performance. This paper introduces for the first time a novel method for extracting pure common features and constructing a universal cross-subject BCI model, thereby facilitating broader applications of BCI technology.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Specific Neural Response and Cross-Correlation Analysis of Envelope Following Responses to Native Speech and Music Using Multichannel EEG Signals: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although native speech and music envelope following responses (EFRs) play a crucial role in auditory processing and cognition, their frequency profile, such as the dominating frequency and spectral coherence, is largely unknown. We have assumed that the auditory pathway - which transmits envelope components of speech and music to the scalp through time-varying neurophysiological processes - is a linear time-varying system, with the envelope and the multi-channel EEG responses as excitation and response, respectively. This paper investigates the transfer function of this system through two analytical techniques - time-averaged spectral responses and cross-spectral density - in the frequency domain at four different positions of the human scalp. Our findings suggest that alpha (8-11 Hz), lower gamma (53-56 Hz), and higher gamma (78-81 Hz) bands are the peak responses of the system. These frequently appearing dominant frequency responses may be the key components of familiar speech perception, maintaining attention, binding acoustic features, and memory processing. The cross-spectral density, which reflects the spatial neural coherence of the human brain, shows that 10-13 Hz, 27-29 Hz, and 62-64 Hz are common for all channel pairs. As neural coherences are frequently observed in these frequencies among native participants, we suggest that these distributed neural processes are also dominant in native speech and music perception.</description>

      <title>Automated Reasoning for Vulnerability Management by Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For securing systems, it is essential to manage their vulnerability posture and design appropriate security controls. Vulnerability management allows to proactively address vulnerabilities by incorporating pertinent security controls into systems designs. Current vulnerability management approaches do not support systematic reasoning about the vulnerability postures of systems designs. To effectively manage vulnerabilities and design security controls, we propose a formally grounded automated reasoning mechanism. We integrate the mechanism into an open-source security design tool and demonstrate its application through an illustrative example driven by real-world challenges. The automated reasoning mechanism allows system designers to identify vulnerabilities that are applicable to a specific system design, explicitly specify vulnerability mitigation options, declare selected controls, and thus systematically manage vulnerability postures.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Communication Through Exploiting RIS, SSK, and CIM for Improved Reliability and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel communication system model that integrates reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), spatial shift keying (SSK), and code index modulation (CIM) based on Hadamard coding called RIS based transmit SSK-CIM (RIS-CIM-TSSK). By leveraging RIS, the system adapts rapidly to dynamic environments, enhancing error rates and overall reliability. SSK facilitates the transmission of additional passive information while eliminating the need for multiple radio frequency (RF) chains, thereby reducing complexity. CIM enhances passive information transmission through frequency domain spreading, which may increase signal obfuscation. This proposed scheme not only improves energy efficiency but also offers a robust solution for reliable communication in modern wireless networks, paving the way for smarter and more adaptable implementations. We consider a suboptimal, low-complexity detector for the proposed scheme and also address the blind case for phase adjustment of the RIS. Finally, we present the simulation results for the proposed system model across various configurations, including different numbers of receive and transmit antennas, varying reflecting elements of the RIS, and different code lengths.</description>

      <title>Robust Power System State Estimation using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern power systems face significant challenges in state estimation and real-time monitoring, particularly regarding response speed and accuracy under faulty conditions or cyber-attacks. This paper proposes a hybrid approach using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to enhance the accuracy and robustness, of power system state estimation. By embedding physical laws into the neural network architecture, PINNs improve estimation accuracy for transmission grid applications under both normal and faulty conditions, while also showing potential in addressing security concerns such as data manipulation attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms traditional machine learning models, achieving up to 83% higher accuracy on unseen subsets of the training dataset and 65% better performance on entirely new, unrelated datasets. Experiments also show that during a data manipulation attack against a critical bus in a system, the PINN can be up to 93% more accurate than an equivalent neural network.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data. However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless, low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by 4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.</description>

      <title>Distributed Estimation with Decentralized Control for Quadruple-Tank Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified modeling, control, and estimation framework for the quadruple-tank process, a benchmark multivariable system that exhibits either minimum phase or nonminimum phase behavior depending on valve flow ratios. A decentralized PI control strategy is employed to regulate water levels, while a distributed state estimation scheme is developed using local Luenberger observers and inter-agent communication. Each observer uses only local output measurements and exchanges information with neighboring nodes over a strongly connected communication graph. To address the limitations of partial observability, the observer design incorporates an observability decomposition and consensus-based coupling that ensures convergence to the true system state. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating accurate state reconstruction and stable closed loop performance under both minimum-phase and nonminimum phase configurations. These results highlight the potential of combining decentralized control with distributed estimation for scalable, networked control of complex multivariable systems.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Mean Field Equilibrium Computation in Large-Population LQG Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel data-driven approach for approximating the $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in continuous-time linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) games, where multiple agents interact with each other through their dynamics and infinite horizon discounted costs. The core of our method involves solving two algebraic Riccati equations (AREs) and an ordinary differential equation (ODE) using state and input samples collected from agents, eliminating the need for a priori knowledge of their dynamical models. The standard ARE is addressed through an integral reinforcement learning (IRL) technique, while the nonsymmetric ARE and the ODE are resolved by identifying the drift coefficients of the agents' dynamics under general conditions. Moreover, by imposing specific conditions on models, we extend the IRL-based approach to approximately solve the nonsymmetric ARE. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Predictive Runtime Verification under Spatio-Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) designed in simulators, often consisting of multiple interacting agents (e.g. in multi-agent formations), behave differently in the real-world. We want to verify these systems during runtime when they are deployed. We thus propose robust predictive runtime verification (RPRV) algorithms for: (1) general stochastic CPS under signal temporal logic (STL) tasks, and (2) stochastic multi-agent systems (MAS) under spatio-temporal logic tasks. The RPRV problem presents the following challenges: (1) there may not be sufficient data on the behavior of the deployed CPS, (2) predictive models based on design phase system trajectories may encounter distribution shift during real-world deployment, and (3) the algorithms need to scale to the complexity of MAS and be applicable to spatio-temporal logic tasks. To address the challenges, we assume knowledge of an upper bound on the statistical distance between the trajectory distributions of the system at deployment and design time. We are motivated by our prior work [1, 2] where we proposed an accurate and an interpretable RPRV algorithm for general CPS, which we here extend to the MAS setting and spatio-temporal logic tasks. Specifically, we use a learned predictive model to estimate the system behavior at runtime and robust conformal prediction to obtain probabilistic guarantees by accounting for distribution shifts. Building on [1], we perform robust conformal prediction over the robust semantics of spatio-temporal reach and escape logic (STREL) to obtain centralized RPRV algorithms for MAS. We empirically validate our results in a drone swarm simulator, where we show the scalability of our RPRV algorithms to MAS and analyze the impact of different trajectory predictors on the verification result. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first statistically valid algorithms for MAS under distribution shift.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Foundations of Waste Factor and Waste Figure with Applications to Fixed Wireless Access and Relay Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exponential rise in energy consumption across wireless communication systems, particularly in anticipation of next-generation wireless systems, necessitates rigorous frameworks for evaluating and optimizing energy efficiency. This paper revisits and expands the concept of the Waste Factor (W), or Waste Figure (WF) in decibel scale, as a unifying metric that captures both utilized and wasted power in cascaded communication systems. Building upon its foundation in system-level power modeling, we integrate the Waste Factor into a refined formulation of the Consumption Factor (CF), the ratio of data rate to total consumed power, linking it directly to Shannon's theoretical limit on energy per bit. This analysis introduces additive energy waste into the classical energy-per-bit derivation through the Waste Factor term.
  We derive closed-form expressions for energy-per-bit expenditure in both direct and relay-assisted links and develop a decision rule to determine which communication path is more energy efficient under given conditions. While not modeled explicitly, Reflective Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) can be interpreted as a special case of relay-based architectures within this unified formulation, suggesting broader applicability of the Waste Factor framework to emerging 6G use cases. The framework is then extended to a Fixed Wireless Access (FWA) scenario, where uplink and downlink asymmetries, traffic directionality, and component inefficiencies are jointly considered to analyze energy-optimal deployment strategies.</description>

      <title>On the Robotic Uncertainty of Fully Autonomous Traffic: From Stochastic Car-Following to Mobility-Safety Trade-Offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12611v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent transportation research highlights the potential of autonomous vehicles (AV) to improve traffic flow mobility as they are able to maintain smaller car-following distances. However, as a unique class of ground robots, AVs are susceptible to robotic errors, particularly in their perception and control modules with imperfect sensors and actuators, leading to uncertainties in their movements and an increased risk of collisions. Consequently, conservative operational strategies, such as larger headway and slower speeds, are implemented to prioritize safety over mobility in real-world operations. To reconcile the inconsistency, this paper presents an analytical model framework that delineates the endogenous reciprocity between traffic safety and mobility that arises from AVs' robotic uncertainties. Using both realistic car-following data and a stochastic intelligent driving model (IDM), the stochastic car-following distance is derived as a key parameter, enabling analysis of single-lane capacity and collision probability. A semi-Markov process is then employed to model the dynamics of the lane capacity, and the resulting collision-inclusive capacity, representing expected lane capacity under stationary conditions, serves as the primary performance metric for fully autonomous traffic. The analytical results are further utilized to investigate the impacts of critical parameters in AV and roadway designs on traffic performance, as well as the properties of optimal speed and headway under mobility-targeted or safety-dominated management objectives. Extensions to scenarios involving multiple non-independent collisions or multi-lane traffic scenarios are also discussed, which demonstrates the robustness of the theoretical results and their practical applications.</description>

      <title>Policy Verification in Stochastic Dynamical Systems Using Logarithmic Neural Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the verification of neural network policies for discrete-time stochastic systems with respect to reach-avoid specifications. We use a learner-verifier procedure that learns a certificate for the specification, represented as a neural network. Verifying that this neural network certificate is a so-called reach-avoid supermartingale (RASM) proves the satisfaction of a reach-avoid specification. Existing approaches for such a verification task rely on computed Lipschitz constants of neural networks. These approaches struggle with large Lipschitz constants, especially for reach-avoid specifications with high threshold probabilities. We present two key contributions to obtain smaller Lipschitz constants than existing approaches. First, we introduce logarithmic RASMs (logRASMs), which take exponentially smaller values than RASMs and hence have lower theoretical Lipschitz constants. Second, we present a fast method to compute tighter upper bounds on Lipschitz constants based on weighted norms. Our empirical evaluation shows we can consistently verify the satisfaction of reach-avoid specifications with probabilities as high as 99.9999%.</description>

      <title>A Runtime-Adaptive Transformer Neural Network Accelerator on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18148v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformer neural networks (TNN) excel in natural language processing (NLP), machine translation, and computer vision (CV) without relying on recurrent or convolutional layers. However, they have high computational and memory demands, particularly on resource-constrained devices like FPGAs. Moreover, transformer models vary in processing time across applications, requiring custom models with specific parameters. Designing custom accelerators for each model is complex and time-intensive. Some custom accelerators exist with no runtime adaptability, and they often rely on sparse matrices to reduce latency. However, hardware designs become more challenging due to the need for application-specific sparsity patterns. This paper introduces ADAPTOR, a runtime-adaptive accelerator for dense matrix computations in transformer encoders and decoders on FPGAs. ADAPTOR enhances the utilization of processing elements and on-chip memory, enhancing parallelism and reducing latency. It incorporates efficient matrix tiling to distribute resources across FPGA platforms and is fully quantized for computational efficiency and portability. Evaluations on Xilinx Alveo U55C data center cards and embedded platforms like VC707 and ZCU102 show that our design is 1.2$\times$ and 2.87$\times$ more power efficient than the NVIDIA K80 GPU and the i7-8700K CPU respectively. Additionally, it achieves a speedup of 1.7 to 2.25$\times$ compared to some state-of-the-art FPGA-based accelerators.</description>

      <title>Safe Beyond the Horizon: Efficient Sampling-based MPC with Neural Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common problem when using model predictive control (MPC) in practice is the satisfaction of safety specifications beyond the prediction horizon. While theoretical works have shown that safety can be guaranteed by enforcing a suitable terminal set constraint or a sufficiently long prediction horizon, these techniques are difficult to apply and thus are rarely used by practitioners, especially in the case of general nonlinear dynamics. To solve this problem, we impose a tradeoff between exact recursive feasibility, computational tractability, and applicability to ``black-box'' dynamics by learning an approximate discrete-time control barrier function and incorporating it into a variational inference MPC (VIMPC), a sampling-based MPC paradigm. To handle the resulting state constraints, we further propose a new sampling strategy that greatly reduces the variance of the estimated optimal control, improving the sample efficiency, and enabling real-time planning on a CPU. The resulting Neural Shield-VIMPC (NS-VIMPC) controller yields substantial safety improvements compared to existing sampling-based MPC controllers, even under badly designed cost functions. We validate our approach in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments. Project website: https://mit-realm.github.io/ns-vimpc/.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA): An Integrated Framework for AI-Enabled Government</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence transforms public sector operations, governments struggle to integrate technological innovations into coherent systems for effective service delivery. This paper introduces the Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA), a novel four-layer framework conceptualising how Digital Public Infrastructure, Data-for-Policy, Algorithmic Government/Governance, and GovTech interact as an integrated system in AI-enabled states. Unlike approaches that treat these as parallel developments, ASA positions them as interdependent layers with specific enabling relationships and feedback mechanisms. Through comparative analysis of implementations in Estonia, Singapore, India, and the UK, we demonstrate how foundational digital infrastructure enables systematic data collection, which powers algorithmic decision-making processes, ultimately manifesting in user-facing services. Our analysis reveals that successful implementations require balanced development across all layers, with particular attention to integration mechanisms between them. The framework contributes to both theory and practice by bridging previously disconnected domains of digital government research, identifying critical dependencies that influence implementation success, and providing a structured approach for analysing the maturity and development pathways of AI-enabled government systems.</description>

      <title>Gradient Field-Based Dynamic Window Approach for Collision Avoidance in Complex Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For safe and flexible navigation in multi-robot systems, this paper presents an enhanced and predictive sampling-based trajectory planning approach in complex environments, the Gradient Field-based Dynamic Window Approach (GF-DWA). Building upon the dynamic window approach, the proposed method utilizes gradient information of obstacle distances as a new cost term to anticipate potential collisions. This enhancement enables the robot to improve awareness of obstacles, including those with non-convex shapes. The gradient field is derived from the Gaussian process distance field, which generates both the distance field and gradient field by leveraging Gaussian process regression to model the spatial structure of the environment. Through several obstacle avoidance and fleet collision avoidance scenarios, the proposed GF-DWA is shown to outperform other popular trajectory planning and control methods in terms of safety and flexibility, especially in complex environments with non-convex obstacles.</description>

Abstract: Grey wolf optimizer (GWO) is a nature-inspired stochastic meta-heuristic of the swarm intelligence field that mimics the hunting behavior of grey wolves. Differential evolution (DE) is a popular stochastic algorithm of the evolutionary computation field that is well suited for global optimization. In this part, we introduce a new algorithm based on the hybridization of GWO and two DE variants, namely the GWO-DE algorithm. We evaluate the new algorithm by applying various numerical benchmark functions. The numerical results of the comparative study are quite satisfactory in terms of performance and solution quality.</description>
