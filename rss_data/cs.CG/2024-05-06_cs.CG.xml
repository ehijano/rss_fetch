      <title>Efficient computation of topological integral transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological integral transforms have found many applications in shape analysis, from prediction of clinical outcomes in brain cancer to analysis of barley seeds. Using Euler characteristic as a measure, these objects record rich geometric information on weighted polytopal complexes. While some implementations exist, they only enable discretized representations of the transforms, and they do not handle weighted complexes (such as for instance images). Moreover, recent hybrid transforms lack an implementation.
  In this paper, we introduce Eucalc, a novel implementation of three topological integral transforms -- the Euler characteristic transform, the Radon transform, and hybrid transforms -- for weighted cubical complexes. Leveraging piecewise linear Morse theory and Euler calculus, the algorithms significantly reduce computational complexity by focusing on critical points. Our software provides exact representations of transforms, handles both binary and grayscale images, and supports multi-core processing. It is publicly available as a C++ library with a Python wrapper. We present mathematical foundations, implementation details, and experimental evaluations, demonstrating Eucalc's efficiency.</description>

      <title>Topologically Interlocking Blocks inside the Tetroctahedrille</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A topological interlocking assembly consists of rigid blocks together with a fixed frame, such that any subset of blocks is kinematically constrained and therefore cannot be removed from the assembly. In this paper we pursue a modular approach to construct (non-convex) interlocking blocks by combining finitely many tetrahedra and octahedra. This gives rise to polyhedra whose vertices can be described by the tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb, also known as tetroctahedrille. We show that the resulting interlocking blocks are very versatile and allow many possibilities to form topological interlocking assemblies consisting of copies of a single block. We formulate a generalised construction of some of the introduced blocks to construct families of topological interlocking blocks. Moreover, we demonstrate a geometric application by using the tetroctahedrille to approximate given geometric objects. Finally, we show that given topological interlocking assemblies can be deformed continuously in order to obtain new topological interlocking assemblies.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Shape of a Point Set with a Line Segment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting location-correlated groups in point sets is an important task in a wide variety of applications areas. In addition to merely detecting such groups, the group's shape carries meaning as well. In this paper, we represent a group's shape using a simple geometric object, a line segment. Specifically, given a radius $r$, we say a line segment is representative of a point set $P$ if it is within distance $r$ of each point $p \in P$. We aim to find the shortest such line segment. This problem is equivalent to stabbing a set of circles of radius $r$ using the shortest line segment. We describe an algorithm to find the shortest representative segment in $O(n \log h + h \log^3 h)$ time. Additionally, we show how to maintain a stable approximation of the shortest representative segment when the points in $P$ move.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Wormhole: Scalable Optimal Transport Distance with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) and the related Wasserstein metric (W) are powerful and ubiquitous tools for comparing distributions. However, computing pairwise Wasserstein distances rapidly becomes intractable as cohort size grows. An attractive alternative would be to find an embedding space in which pairwise Euclidean distances map to OT distances, akin to standard multidimensional scaling (MDS). We present Wasserstein Wormhole, a transformer-based autoencoder that embeds empirical distributions into a latent space wherein Euclidean distances approximate OT distances. Extending MDS theory, we show that our objective function implies a bound on the error incurred when embedding non-Euclidean distances. Empirically, distances between Wormhole embeddings closely match Wasserstein distances, enabling linear time computation of OT distances. Along with an encoder that maps distributions to embeddings, Wasserstein Wormhole includes a decoder that maps embeddings back to distributions, allowing for operations in the embedding space to generalize to OT spaces, such as Wasserstein barycenter estimation and OT interpolation. By lending scalability and interpretability to OT approaches, Wasserstein Wormhole unlocks new avenues for data analysis in the fields of computational geometry and single-cell biology.</description>
