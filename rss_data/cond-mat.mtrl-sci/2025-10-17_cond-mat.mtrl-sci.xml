      <title>CBVB-nH complexes as prevalent defects in metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy-grown hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are promising candidates for active components in emerging quantum technologies, such as single-photon emitters and spin centers. However, further progress in hBN-based quantum technologies requires a deeper understanding of the physics and chemistry of hBN defects. In this work, we employ ab initio calculations to investigate the thermodynamic stability and optical properties of defect complexes involving carbon, boron vacancies, and hydrogen. We demonstrate that the formation of CBVB-nH complexes (n from 0 to 3) is energetically favorable under nitrogen-rich conditions in the presence of carbon and hydrogen. The low formation energies and high binding energies of these complexes arise from the strong electrostatic attraction between the positively charged carbon substitutional defect (CB) and the negatively charged hydrogen-passivated boron vacancies (VB-nH). These complexes are particularly likely to form in metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy (MOVPE)-grown samples, where growth occurs in the presence of carbon and hydrogen and is accompanied by a high density of boron vacancies. The optical properties of CBVB-nH complexes are analyzed and compared to recent photoluminescence measurements on MOVPE-grown hBN samples. In particular, we investigate the origin of the emission peaks at 1.90 eV and 2.24 eV and demonstrate that both the energies and lineshapes are consistent with hole capture by negatively charged CBVB and CBVB-H complexes.</description>

      <title>Turn-on of Current-Induced Spin Torque upon Noncollinear Antiferromagnetic Ordering in Delafossite PdCrO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report measurements of the current-induced spin torque produced by the delafossite antiferromagnet PdCrO2 and acting on an adjacent ferromagnetic permalloy layer. The spin torque increases strongly as the temperature is reduced through the Neel temperature, when the PdCrO2 transitions from a paramagnetic phase to a noncollinear antiferromagnetic state. This result is qualitatively consistent with density functional theory calculations regarding how spin-current generation changes upon antiferromagnetic ordering in PdCrO2.</description>

      <title>A large spin-splitting altermagnet designed from the hydroxylated MBene monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of altermagnets is fundamentally important for advancing spintronic device technology, but remains unpractical for the weak spin splitting in most cases, especially in two-dimensional materials. Based on spin group symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, a novel hydroxyl rotation strategy in collinear antiferromagnets has been proposed to design altermagnets. This approach achieves a large chirality-reversible spin splitting exceeding $1130$ meV in $\alpha_{60}$-Mn$_2$B$_2$(OH)$_2$ monolayer. The system also exhibits intrinsic features of a node-line semimetal in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Besides, the angles of hydroxyl groups serve as the primary order parameter, which can switch on/off the altermagnetism coupled with the ferroelastic mechanism. The corresponding magnetocrystalline anisotropy have also been modulated. Moreover, an interesting spin-related transport property with the spin-polarized conductivity of 10$^{19}$ $\Omega^{-1}m^{-1}s^{-1}$ also emerges. These findings uncover the hydroxyl rotation strategy as a versatile tool for designing altermagnetic node-line semimetals and opening new avenues for achieving exotic chemical and physical characteristics associated with large spin splitting.</description>

      <title>Ferroelasticity tunable altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets have garnered great interest due to their non-relativistic spin splitting and novel physical properties. However, the control of altermagnetic states remains underexplored. Here, we propose a new multiferroic state, i.e. ferroelastic altermagnetic state, in which ferroelastic strain couples directly to the spin-splitting. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify the ferroelastic $d$-wave altermagnetism of puckered pentagonal CoSe$_2$ monolayer. Interestingly, uniaxial stress can induce a ferroelastic phase transition, accompanied by a $90^\circ$ rotation of the spin-splitting bands. Cooperative rotation of the lattice and N\'eel vectors preserves the sign of Kerr angle, whereas noncooperative rotation reverses it. Our work provides a general strategy for manipulating altermagnetism in multiferroic systems and opens new avenues for exploring emergent magnetoelastic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Electroluminescence and Photoluminescence Imaging of Mixed-Cation Mixed-Halide Perovskite Solar Cells at Low Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for high-performance solar cells. This study investigates the temperature-dependent optoelectronic properties of mixed-cation mixed-halide perovskite solar cells using electroluminescence (EL) and photoluminescence (PL) hyperspectral imaging, along with current-voltage analysis. Luminescence images, which were converted to EL and PL external radiative efficiency (ERE) maps, revealed significant changes in the optoelectronic behavior of these devices at low temperatures. Specifically, we found that a significant source of heterogeneity in the low-temperature EL ERE maps below 240 K is related to local charge injection and extraction bottlenecks, whereas PL ERE maps show suppressed non-radiative recombination and significant improvements in efficiency throughout the investigated temperature range. The spatial distribution of ERE and its variation with applied current were analyzed, offering insights into charge-carrier dynamics and defect behavior. Our results reveal that while the perovskite layer exhibits enhanced ERE at low temperatures, charge injection barriers at the interfaces of the perovskite solar cells significantly suppress EL and degrade the fill factor below 240 K. These findings reveal that a deeper understanding of the performance of perovskite solar cells under low-temperature conditions is an essential step toward their potential application in space power systems and advanced semiconductor devices.</description>

      <title>Magnetization, excitations, and microwave power absorption in transition-metal/rare-earth ferrites with disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient numerical routines are developed for numerical studies of the dependence of the equilibrium magnetic states, excitations, and microwave power absorption on temperature and composition in transition-metal/rare-earth ferrites, including the reversal of the N\'eel vector occurring on both temperature and the concentration of the rare-earth atoms. It results in a drastic change in the behavior at the magnetization and angular-momentum compensation points. Dominant uniform oscillation modes are obtained by computing the magnetization correlation function. They are compared with the analytical solution, which is analyzed in detail. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem is used to compute the frequency dependence of the absorbed microwave power. A good agreement with analytical results is demonstrated. Disorder caused by random positions of rare-earth atoms in a diluted RE system leads to multiple localized modes that converge into broad absorption maxima as the size of the system increases. The power absorption integrated over frequency exhibits a minimum at the compensation point.</description>

      <title>Laser-Induced Heating in Diamonds: Influence of Substrate Thermal Conductivity and Interfacial Polymer Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diamonds hosting color centers possess intrinsically high thermal conductivity; therefore, laser-induced heating has often received little attention. However, when placed on substrates with low thermal conductivity, localized heating of diamonds under laser excitation can become significant, and the presence of an interfacial polymer layer between substrate and diamond further amplifies this effect. Yet, the relationship between substrate thermal conductivity, polymer thickness, and laser heating remains to be established. Here, a systematic investigation is presented on laser-induced heating of silicon-vacancy diamond on substrates with varying thermal conductivity and interfacial polymer thickness. Results reveal that even at a low excitation power of 737~$\mu$W/$\mu$m$^2$, thin amorphous holey carbon -- the lowest-conductivity substrate ($\sim$0.2~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$) studied -- exhibits substantial heating, while glass ($\sim$1.4~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, $\sim$0.35~W~m$^{-1}$~K$^{-1}$) show noticeable heating only above 2.95~mW/$\mu$m$^2$. For polymer interlayers, a thickness of just 2.2~$\mu$m induces significant heating at 2.95~mW/$\mu$m$^2$ and above, highlighting strong influence of both substrate and polymer thickness on local heating response. Experimental findings are further validated using COMSOL Multiphysics simulations with a steady-state 3D heat transfer model. These results provide practical guidance for substrate selection and sample preparation, enabling optimization of conditions for optical thermometry and quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Models For Perovskite Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a multiscale approach to evaluate perovskite solar cell performance which determines material properties at the atomistic scale with first-principles calculations, and applies them in macro-scale device models. This work focuses on the MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) perovskite and how its phase transitions impact on its optical, electronic, and structural properties which are investigated at the first-principles level. The obtained data are coupled to a numerical drift-diffusion device model enabling evaluation of the performance of corresponding single junction devices. The first-principles simulation applies a hybrid exchange-correlation functional adapted to the studied family of compounds. Validation by available experimental data is presented from materials properties to device performance, justifying the use of the approach for predictive evaluation of existing and novel perovskites. The coupling between atomistic and device models is described in terms of a framework for exchange of optical, vibrational, and electronic parameters between the two scales. The result of this theoretical investigation is a methodology for designing and optimising perovskite materials for both cell performance and stability, the key obstacle in the societal implementation of these record-breaking new materials.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Approach to Spin Excitations in Noncollinear Magnetic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-principles method based on density functional theory and many-body perturbation theory for computing spin excitations in magnetic systems with noncollinear spin textures. Traditionally, the study of magnetic excitations has relied on spin models that assume magnetic moments to be localized. Beyond this restriction, recent $ab~initio$ methods based on Green's functions within the local spin-density approximation have emerged as a general framework for calculating magnetic susceptibilities. However, their application has so far been largely limited to collinear ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems. In this work, we extend this framework and enable the treatment of large-scale noncollinear magnetic systems by leveraging a Wannier-basis representation and implementing an ansatz potential method to reduce computational cost. We apply our method to the spin-spiral state of LiCu$_2$O$_2$, successfully capturing its steady-state spin-rotation pitch in agreement with the experimental measurement and resolving the characteristic magnon dispersion. We further analyze the interplay between the spiral spin structure and the on-site spin-exchange splitting, and elucidate the crucial role of magnetic dipoles on ligand ions in mediating effective ferromagnetic interaction among the primary spins on Cu$^{2+}$ ions. Finally, we provide a theoretical prediction of the magnon dispersion on top of the helical spin background in high agreement with the experimental measurement. Overall, this work establishes a general and computationally efficient framework for simulating collective spin dynamics in noncollinear magnetic systems from first principles, exemplified by -- but not limited to -- spin-spiral states.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric amplitude switching and continuous memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although ferroelectric systems inherently exhibit binary switching behavior, recent advances in analog memory device have spurred growing interest in achieving continuous memory states. In this work, we demonstrate ferroelectric amplitude switching at the mesoscopic scale in compositionally graded Ba1-xSrxTiO3 heterostructures, enabling continuous modulation of polarization magnitude without altering its direction, which we defined as amplitude switching. Using switching current measurement, piezoresponse force microscopy and Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire simulations, we reveal that compositionally graded ferroelectric heterostructure can possess amplitude switching behavior through a double well potential with flattened minima. This behavior supports stable, continuous polarization states and establishes a new platform for analog memory applications. These findings introduce amplitude switching as a new dynamic of the order parameter, paving the way for energy-efficient and reliable analog memory systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Secondary Electron Detection of Single Ion Implants in Silicon Through Thin SiO2 Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic placement of single dopants is essential for scalable quantum devices based on group-V donors in silicon. We demonstrate a non-destructive, high-efficiency method for detecting individual ion implantation events using secondary electrons (SEs) in a focused ion beam (FIB) system. Using low-energy Sb ions implanted into undoped silicon, we achieve up to 98% single-ion detection efficiency, verified by calibrated ion-current measurements before and after implantation. The technique attains ~30 nm spatial resolution without requiring electrical contacts or device fabrication, in contrast to ion-beam-induced-current (IBIC) methods. We find that introducing a controlled SiO2 capping layer significantly enhances SE yield, consistent with an increased electron mean free path in the oxide, while maintaining high probability of successful ion deposition in the underlying substrate. The yield appears to scale with ion velocity, so higher projectile mass (e.g. Yb, Bi etc) requires increased energy to maintain detection efficiency. Our approach provides a robust and scalable route to precise donor placement and extends deterministic implantation strategies to a broad range of material systems and quantum device architectures.</description>

      <title>Uniaxial Magnetic Anisotropy and Type-X/Y Current-Induced Magnetization Switching in Oblique-Angle-Deposited Ta/CoFeB/Pt and W/CoFeB/Pt Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT) requires an in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA), which can be induced by oblique-angle sputter deposition of the heavy-metal underlayer. To enhance the SOT efficiency, we employ trilayer heterostructures of (Ta or W)/CoFeB/Pt, where the bottom layer exhibits a UMA of 50 mT at 2 nm thickness. The magnetization reversal in Hall-bar devices is detected through unidirectional spin Hall magnetoresistance (USMR) for the Type Y geometry (easy axis transverse to current) and planar Hall measurements for the Type X geometry (easy axis parallel to current). Both configurations exhibit CIMS with sub-microsecond current pulses, reaching switching current densities as low as $2 \times 10^{11}$ A/m$^2$ for a W (4 nm)/CoFeB (1.4 nm)/Pt (2 nm) stack with a UMA of 146 mT. Macrospin simulations reproduce the Type Y switching as coherent magnetization rotation, whereas the Type X devices switch at much lower currents than predicted, indicating that nucleation and domain-wall propagation dominate reversal in this geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report persistent photoconductivity in $p$-type Sb$_2$Se$_3$ single crystals doped with Cd or Zn, where enhanced conductivity remains for hours after illumination ceases at temperatures below $\sim$25~K. Comparative transport and infrared absorption measurements, including on $n$-type Cl-doped counterparts, reveal strong indications that hole transport in Sb$_2$Se$_3$ is more strongly affected by intrinsic carrier scattering than electron transport. These results point to a fundamental asymmetry in charge carrier dynamics and highlight the potential role of polaronic effects in limiting hole mobility in this quasi-one-dimensional semiconductor.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetization in Sierpinski fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital magnetization (OM) in Sierpinski carpet (SC) and triangle (ST) fractal is theoretically investigated by using Haldane model as a prototypical example. The OM calculation is performed following two distinct approaches; employing the definition and local markers formalism. Both methods coincides for all systems analyzed. For the SC, higher fractal generations create a dense set of edge states, resulting in a staircase profile, leading to oscillations in the magnetization as a function of the chemical potential. In contrast, the ST self-similarity produces distinct fractal-induced spectral gaps, which manifest as constant plateaus in the magnetization. The STs exhibit a pronounced sensitivity to edge terminations. Our results reveal how quantum confinement in fractal structures affects the electronic orbital angular momentum, pointing to possible pathways for exploring novel orbitronics in systems with complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Substitutional sulfur and its vibrational fingerprints in Sb$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The configurational behavior of sulfur in antimony triselenide (Sb$_2$Se$_3$) is investigated by combining infrared absorption spectroscopy with density functional theory. Four sulfur-related local vibrational modes are identified at 249, 273, 283, and 312~cm$^{-1}$ in melt-grown single crystals prepared from Sb$_2$Se$_3$ granulate. Their assignment to sulfur is confirmed through controlled indiffusion experiments using Sb$_2$S$_3$ and elemental sulfur, as well as isotope-substitution studies with $^{34}$S, which produce the expected frequency shifts. Polarization-resolved measurements, together with theoretical calculations of local vibrational modes, demonstrate that the observed spectral features are fully consistent with substitutional sulfur on the three inequivalent selenium sites of Sb$_2$Se$_3$.</description>

      <title>Unique Hierarchical Rotational Dynamics Induces Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity in Cyanide-bridged Framework Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of materials combining light constituent elements with ultralow lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$) is crucial to advancing technologies like thermoelectrics and thermal barrier coatings, yet it remains a formidable challenge to date. Herein, we achieve ultralow $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ in lightweight cyanide-bridged framework materials (CFMs) through the rational integration of properties such as the hierarchical vibrations exhibited in superatomic structures and rotational dynamics exhibited in perovskites. Unique hierarchical rotation behavior leads to multiple negative peaks in Gr\"uneisen parameters across a wide frequency range, thereby inducing pronounced negative thermal expansion and strong cubic anharmonicity in CFMs. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect between large four-phonon scattering phase space (induced by phonon quasi-flat bands and wide bandgaps) and strong quartic anharmonicity (associated with rotation modes) leads to giant quartic anharmonic scattering rates in these materials. Consequently, the $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ of these CFMs decreases by one to two orders of magnitude compared to the known perovskites or perovskite-like materials with equivalent average atomic masses. For instance, the Cd(CN)$_{2}$, NaB(CN)$_{4}$, LiIn(CN)$_{4}$, and AgX(CN)$_{4}$ (X = B, Al, Ga, In) exhibit ultralow room-temperature $\kappa_{\mathrm{L}}$ values ranging from 0.35 to 0.81 W/mK. This work not only establishes CFMs as a novel and rich platform for studying extreme phonon anharmonicity, but also provides a new paradigm for achieving ultralow thermal conductivity in lightweight materials via the conscious integration of hierarchical and rotational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Identification of formation of amorphous Si phase in SiOxNy films produced by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peculiarities of formation of inclusions of amorphous Si (a-Si) phase in Si-rich Si oxynitride films grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) are studied by combined Raman scattering and infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy. The Raman scattering results identify presence of a-Si phase in the studied films at the relative Si content exceeding a threshold value of about 0.4. The a-Si amount correlates with the concentration of hydrogen in the films, the presence of which is detected by characteristic IR absorption bands corresponding to Si-H bending (about 660 cm-1) and stretching (a composite band in the range of about 1900-2400 cm-1) vibrations. The method of deconvolution of IR absorbance spectra in the range of about 600 to 1300 cm-1 developed earlier is used to reliably separate the IR band at about 660 cm-1. This band is identified to origin from the amorphous Si phase within the studied Si oxynitride films. This makes it possible to propose IR spectroscopy with analysis of the low-wavenumber part of the spectra as an efficient method of identifying phase composition of Si-rich Si oxynitride films. The obtained results contribute to understanding of the regularities of formation of phase compositions of PECVD grown Si oxynitride films and are useful for controlling the films properties for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Breaking of the SU(3) Flavor Symmetry in a Quantum Hall Valley Nematic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional quantum materials can host original electronic phases that arise from the interplay of electronic correlations, symmetry and topology. In particular, the spontaneous breaking of internal symmetry that acts simultaneously on the pseudospin and the spatial degree of freedom realizes a nematic ordering. We report evidence of a quantum Hall valley nematic phase with an underlying SU(3) order parameter space obtained by a spontaneous polarization between the threefold degenerate valley pseudospins in Pb1-xSnxSe quantum wells. In the presence of a Zeeman field, we demonstrate a further control of the nematic ordering with an explicit symmetry breaking. Evidence of both spontaneous and explicit SU(3) symmetry breaking, reminiscent of the quark flavor paradigm, is of fundamental interest to shape the many body physics in a SU(3) system.</description>

      <title>Representation of tensor functions using lower-order structural tensor set: three-dimensional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The representation theory of tensor functions is a powerful mathematical tool for constitutive modeling of anisotropic materials. A major limitation of the traditional theory is that many point groups require fourth- or sixth-order structural tensors, which significantly impedes practical engineering applications. Recent advances have introduced a reformulated representation theory that enables the modeling of anisotropic materials using only lower-order structural tensors (i.e., second-order or lower). Building upon the reformulated theory, this work establishes the representations of tensor functions for three-dimensional centrosymmetric point groups. For each point group, we propose a lower-order structural tensor set and derive the representations of tensor functions explicitly. For scalar-valued and second-order symmetric tensor-valued functions, our theory is indeed applicable to all three-dimensional point groups because their representations are determined by the corresponding centrosymmetric groups. The representation theory presented here is broadly applicable for constitutive modeling of anisotropic materials.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of phonon-limited carrier transport in the Weyl semimetal TaAs family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic first-principles study of phonon-limited transport in the TaAs family of Weyl semimetals using the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation. The calculated electrical conductivities show excellent agreement with experimental data for high-quality samples, confirming that transport in these systems is predominantly limited by phonon scattering. Among the four compounds, NbP achieves the highest conductivity, governed primarily by its large Fermi velocities that offset its stronger scattering rates. In contrast, TaAs displays the lowest conductivity, linked to reduced carrier pockets and limited carrier velocities. Additionally, NbP conductivity remains largely unaffected by small hole or electron doping, whereas TaAs exhibits pronounced electron-hole asymmetry. NbAs and TaP show intermediate behavior, reflecting their Fermi surface topologies and scattering phase space. These findings provide microscopic insight into the transport mechanisms of the TaAs family and emphasize the critical role of phonons, doping, and carrier dynamics in shaping their electronic response.</description>

      <title>Impurity-induced spin density wave in the thermoelectric layered cobaltite [Ca$_2$CoO$_3$]$_{0.62}$[CoO$_2$]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Sn-substitution effect on the thermoelectric transport properties of the layered cobaltite [Ca$_2$CoO$_3$]$_{0.62}$[CoO$_2$] single crystals, which exhibit a non-monotonic temperature variation of the electrical resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient owing to the complex electronic and magnetic states. We find that the onset temperature of the short-range spin-density-wave (SDW) formation increases with the substituted Sn content, indicating the impurity-induced stabilization of the SDW order, reminiscent of the disorder/impurity-induced spin order in the cuprate superconductors. The Seebeck coefficient is well related to such impurity effects, as it is slightly enhanced below the onset temperatures, implying a decrease in the carrier concentration due to a pseudo-gap formation associated with the SDW ordering. We discuss the site-dependent substitution effects including earlier studies, and suggest that substitution to the conducting CoO$_2$ layers is essential to increase the onset temperature, consistent with the impurity-induced SDW picture realized in the conducting layers with the cylindrical Fermi surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The influence of adding 23 nm NiO nanoparticles on the magnetic hysteresis loops and critical current density of the high-temperature superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-d has been investigated. The samples were prepared using a fast annealing method that prevents chemical interaction between the components and does not reduce the critical temperature of the superconductor. Compared to the undoped YBCO sample, the critical current density increases in the samples doped with NiO nanoparticles in magnetic fields greater than 6 kOe. The sample containing 0.5 weight percent of NiO nanoparticles exhibits the greatest enhancement in critical current density at 10 kOe (1.36 times greater than the undoped sample).</description>

      <title>Unifying Frictional Transients Reveals the Origin of Static Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frictional motion is harder to initiate than to sustain, as evident when pushing a heavy object. This disparity between static and kinetic friction drives instabilities and stick-slip dynamics in systems ranging from nanodevices and MEMS to squealing brakes, glaciers and tectonic faults, yet its origin and the transition mechanism remain poorly understood. Empirical rate-and-state friction laws predict that during the static-to-kinetic transition, friction increases for nanometer-per-second slip rates, but decreases for micrometers-per-second rates and above. These transients are believed to be associated with contact strengthening (aging) at static interfaces, although their physical basis is unclear and the crossover between regimes has never been observed directly. Here we show, through nanometer-resolution sliding experiments on macroscopic rough surfaces, that these transients are segments of a single, universal non-monotonic response whose peak defines static friction. We show that this behavior arises from mechanical reorganization of interlocking surface asperities under shear, fundamentally distinct from contact aging, which is governed by thermal molecular processes. We derive, from first principles and without invoking any empirical postulates, a differential equation that quantitatively captures the friction peak. These results unify frictional transients across scales and speeds, and establish a physics-based framework for understanding frictional instabilities and failure processes in engineering and geosciences.</description>

      <title>Disorder-assisted Spin-Filtering at Metal/Ferromagnet Interfaces: An Alternative Route to Anisotropic Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal interface-scattering mechanism that produces a sizable anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in metal/ferromagnet bilayers (e.g., Pt/YIG) without invoking bulk spin or orbital Hall currents. In a $\delta$-layer model with interfacial exchange and Rashba spin-orbit coupling, charge transfer at a high-quality interface creates a spin-selective phase condition (interfacial spin filtering) that suppresses backscattering for one spin projection while enhancing momentum relaxation for the other. The resulting resistance anisotropy peaks at an optimal metal thickness of a few nanometers, quantitatively reproducing the thickness and angular dependences typically attributed to spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), as well as its characteristic magnitude. Remarkably, the maximal AMR scales linearly with the smaller of the two coupling strengths - exchange or spin-orbit, highlighting a mechanism fundamentally distinct from SMR. Our scattering formulation maps onto Boltzmann boundary conditions and predicts other clear discriminants from SMR, including strong sensitivity to interfacial charge transfer and disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate electron transport in junctions between the two AMs in strong and weak altermagnetic phases. The charge and spin conductivities are analyzed as functions of angle between the N\'eel vectors of the two AMs $\theta$. In the strong AM regime, the charge conductivity vanishes as $\theta \to \pi$, while in the weak AM phase it remains finite. Introducing a normal metal between two AMs leads to Fabry-P\'erot-type oscillations in charge conductivity. In the strong phase, transport is dominated by up-spin electrons, whereas both spin channels contribute in the weak phase. These results highlight the potential of AM-based heterostructures for spintronic applications, such as spin filters, and quantum interference-based spintronic devices, where tunable spin-dependent transport and interference effects can be utilized in electronic devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In wavefunction-based $\textit{ab-initio}$ quantum mechanical calculations, achieving absolute convergence with respect to the one-electron basis set is a long-standing challenge. In this work, using the random phase approximation (RPA) electron correlation energy as an example, we show how to compute the basis-error-free RPA correlation energy for diatomic molecules by iteratively solving the Sternheimer equations for first-order wave functions in the prolate spheroidal coordinate system. Our approach provides RPA correlation energies across the periodic table to any desired precision; in practice, the convergence of the absolute RPA energies to the meV-level accuracy can be readily attained. Our method thus provides unprecedented reference numbers that can be used to assess the reliability of the commonly used computational procedures in quantum chemistry, such as the counterpoise correction to the basis set superposition errors, the frozen-core approximation, and the complete-basis-set extrapolation scheme. Such reference results can also be used to guide the development of more efficient correlation-consistent basis sets. The numerical techniques developed in the present work also have direct implications for the development of basis error-free schemes for the GW method or the \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry methods such as MP2.</description>

      <title>(Anti-)Altermagnetism from Orbital Ordering in the Ruddlesden-Popper Chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are collinear antiferromagnets with spin-split electronic states. We introduce Ruddlesden-Popper chromates Sr$_{n+1}$Cr$_n$O$_{3n+1}$ (including SrCrO$_3$) as candidate materials in which altermagnetism can emerge from spontaneous orbital ordering rather than crystal symmetry. First-principles calculations reveal a layer-dependent spin splitting: if the spin and orbital orders align in adjacent layers, the system exhibits non-relativistic spin splitting, and thus altermagnetism. In contrast, if either the spin or the orbital order is reversed in adjacent layers, we observe a layerwise uncompensated spin splitting, that is compensated in the adjacent layer, giving rise to the concept of anti-altermagnetism. In the RP series, odd $n$ members support coexistence of altermagnetism and anti-altermagnetism, whereas even $n$ and the perovskite limit are strictly anti-altermagnetic. In both cases, larger $n$ favors metallicity, and in odd $n$ compounds strain can further stabilize altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Diffuseness for the Non-Relaxor Type Ferroelectric to Paraelectric Phase Transition in BaTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The normal ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition in model ferroelectric materials such as BaTiO3 is typically characterized by a sharp, well-defined dielectric constant peak at a specific transition temperature. However, under certain modifications of the parent material, this transition can become diffuse over a broad range of temperatures. This has garnered significant research attention over the past few decades, primarily because of its intriguing and not yet fully understood physical properties. The parameters developed to measure the diffuseness are also ambiguous. In this work, an investigation has been conducted to understand the transition dynamics of the non-relaxor ferroelectric systems in the temperature interval over which the diffuse phase transition occurs. This is achieved by modelling the dielectric response phenomenologically, using a distribution of local transition temperatures. Moreover, a temperature dependent differential analysis is introduced, enabling the clear demarcation of distinct dielectric regimes and providing enhanced insight into the evolution of the phase transition. It is strongly recommended that the degree of diffuseness is skeptical in many senses. Hence, following the establishment, a simple yet effective new measure of diffuseness is being proposed, offering a more accurate and physically meaningful estimation of the diffuse phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate interatomic potentials (IAPs) are essential for modeling the potential energy surfaces (PES) that govern atomic interactions in materials. However, most existing IAPs are developed for bulk materials and struggle to accurately and efficiently capture the diverse chemical environment of two-dimensional (2D) materials. This limitation poses a significant barrier to the large-scale design and simulation of emerging 2D systems. To address this challenge, we present a universal interatomic potential tailored for 2D materials. Our model is trained on a dataset comprising 327,062 structure-energy-force-stress mappings derived from 20,114 2D materials, spanning 89 chemical elements. The results show high predictive accuracy, with mean absolute errors of 6 meV/atom for energies, 80 meV/\AA for atomic forces, and 0.067 GPa for stress tensors. It demonstrates broad applicability across a range of atomistic tasks, including structural relaxation, lattice dynamics, molecular dynamics, material discovery, and so on. To further enhance usability and accessibility, we introduce an intelligent agent powered by a large language model (LLM), enabling natural language interaction for 2D materials property simulations. Our work provides not only a precise and universal IAP for 2D systems, but also an intelligent, user-friendly platform that enables high-throughput screening, property prediction, and theoretical exploration, thereby accelerating advances in 2D materials research.</description>

Abstract: The study of thin films and 2D materials, including transition metal dichalcogenides such as WSe$_2$ offers opportunities to leverage their properties in advanced sensors, quantum technologies, and device to optimize functional performance. In this work, we characterize thin WSe$_2$ samples with variable thicknesses using scanning electron microscope (SEM)-based techniques focused on analysis of backscattered electron signal and Kikuchi diffraction patterns. These data were collected via a pixelated electron-counting direct electron detector positioned below the pole piece primarily configured for reflection Kikuchi diffraction (RKD), and a similar detector placed in the more conventional electron backscatter diffraction geometry. In addition to conventional pattern analysis for orientation microscopy, multivariate statistical methods (MSA) based on principal component analysis were applied to analyze diffraction patterns and differentiate thickness variations and crystal orientations within the thin films through data clustering. These results were compared with atomic force microscopy to validate thickness measurements. Our findings indicate that RKD combined with MSA is highly effective for characterizing 2D materials, enabling simultaneous assessment of thickness and crystallographic orientation. Systematic acceleration voltage variations in RKD experiments and comparisons with EBSD data suggest that the thickness dependency arises from inelastic scattering of diffracted electrons, which affects pattern contrast in the thin film regime. Collection and analysis of patterns obtained from monolayer, bilayer and tri-layer of WSe$_2$ are also demonstrated. This work reinforces the utility of SEM-based techniques, such as RKD, as valuable tools for the materials characterization toolkit, particularly for thin films and 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Engineering Quantum Wire States for Atom Scale Circuitry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in hydrogen lithography on silicon surfaces now enable the fabrication of complex and error-free atom-scale circuitry. The structure of atomic wires, the most basic and common circuit elements, plays a crucial role at this scale, as the exact position of each atom matters. As such, the characterization of atomic wire geometries is critical for identifying the most effective configurations. In this study, we employed low-temperature (4.5 K) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to systematically fabricate and characterize six planar wire configurations made up of silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on the H-Si(100) surface. Crucially, the characterization was performed at the same location and under identical tip conditions, thereby eliminating artifacts due to the local environment to reveal true electronic differences among the line configurations. By performing dI/dV line spectroscopy on each wire, we reveal their local density of states (LDOS) and demonstrate how small variations in wire geometry affect orbital hybridization and induce the emergence of new electronic states. Complementarily, we deploy density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's functions to compute the LDOS and evaluate transmission coefficients for the most promising wire geometries. Our results indicate that dimer and wider wires exhibit multiple discrete mid-gap electronic states which could be exploited for signal transport or as custom quantum dots. Furthermore, wider wires benefit from additional current pathways and exhibit increased transmission, while also demonstrating enhanced immunity to hydrogen defects.</description>

      <title>Efficient $GW$ band structure calculations using Gaussian basis functions and application to atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a $GW$ space-time algorithm for periodic systems in a Gaussian basis including spin-orbit coupling. We employ lattice summation to compute the irreducible density response and the self-energy, while we employ $k$-point sampling for computing the screened Coulomb interaction. Our algorithm enables accurate and computationally efficient quasiparticle band structure calculations for atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides. For monolayer MoS$_\text{2}$, MoSe$_\text{2}$, WS$_\text{2}$, and WSe$_\text{2}$, computed $GW$ band gaps agree on average within 50 meV with plane-wave-based reference calculations. $G_0W_0$ band structures are obtained in less than two days on a laptop (Intel i5, 192 GB RAM) or in less than 30 minutes using 1024 cores. Overall, our work provides an efficient and scalable framework for $GW$ calculations on atomically thin materials.</description>

      <title>Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04468</link>

Abstract: Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.</description>

      <title>Coupling Magnons to an Opto-Electronic Parametric Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as versatile modular components for quantum signal transduction and sensing applications owing to their capability of connecting distinct quantum platforms. To date, the majority of the magnonic systems have been explored in a local, near-field scheme, due to the close proximity required for realizing a strong coupling between magnons and other excitations. This constraint greatly limits the applicability of magnons in developing remotely-coupled, distributed quantum network systems. On the contrary, opto-electronic architectures hosting self-sustained oscillations has been a unique platform for longhaul signal transmission and processing. Here, we integrated an opto-electronic oscillator with a magnonic oscillator consisting of a microwave waveguide and a Y3Fe5O12(YIG) sphere, and demonstrated strong and coherent coupling between YIG's magnon modes and the opto-electronic oscillator's characteristic photon modes - revealing the hallmark anti-crossing gap in the measured spectrum. In particular, the photon mode is produced on-demand via a nonlinear, parametric process as stipulated by an external seed pump. Both the internal cavity phase and the external pump phase can be precisely tuned to stabilize either degenerate or nondegenerate auto-oscillations. Our result lays out a new, hybrid platform for investigating long-distance coupling and nonlinearity in coherent magnonic phenomena, which may be find useful in constructing future distributed hybrid magnonic systems.</description>
