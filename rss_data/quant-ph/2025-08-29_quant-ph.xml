      <title>Symmetry enforces entanglement at high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body quantum systems with local interactions undergo "sudden death of entanglement" at high temperatures, whereby thermal states become classical mixtures of product states. We investigate whether symmetry constraints can prevent this phenomenon. We prove that strongly symmetric thermal states (canonical ensemble) of generic Hamiltonians with on-site Abelian symmetries remain entangled with non-zero entanglement negativity at arbitrarily high temperatures, under mild conditions on the symmetry actions and the charge sector of the strong symmetry. Our results extend to weakly symmetric thermal states (Gibbs ensemble) under superselection rules, which restrict state decompositions to be symmetric. In particular, we show that fermionic Gibbs states do not exhibit sudden death of entanglement and have persistent fermionic negativity at high temperatures. These findings demonstrate that global symmetry correlations can preserve quantum entanglement despite thermal decoherence, providing new insights into the interplay between symmetry and quantum information in thermal equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Compilation-informed probabilistic quantum error cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential of quantum computers to outperform classical ones in practically useful tasks remains challenging in the near term due to scaling limitations and high error rates of current quantum hardware. While quantum error correction (QEC) offers a clear path towards fault tolerance, overcoming the scalability issues will take time. Early applications will likely rely on QEC combined with quantum error mitigation (QEM). We introduce a QEM scheme against both compilation errors and logical-gate noise that is circuit-, QEC code-, and compiler-agnostic. The scheme builds on quasi-probability distribution methods and uses information about the circuit's gates' compilations to attain an unbiased estimation of noiseless expectation values incurring a constant sample-complexity overhead. Moreover, it features maximal circuit size and QEC code-distance both independent of the target precision, in contrast to strategies based on QEC alone. We formulate the mitigation procedure as a linear program, demonstrate its efficacy through numerical simulations, and illustrate it for estimating the Jones polynomials of knots. Our method significantly reduces quantum resource requirements for high-precision estimations, offering a practical route towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with precision-independent overheads.</description>

      <title>Any gate of a quantum computer can be certified device-independently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-independent (DI) certification allows the verification of quantum systems based solely on observed statistics, without assumptions about their internal structure. While self-testing, the strongest DI certification, of a wide range of quantum states and measurements is done, the self-testing of quantum operations remains underdeveloped. Here, we show in a proof-of-principle way that any quantum unitary can be self-tested within the DI paradigm. For our purpose, we utilise the framework of quantum networks with multiple independent sources. Our work provides a fundamental step toward certifying quantum interactions directly from data, without detailed modelling assumptions. Moreover, the result also serves as a crucial ingredient for quantum computation, where verifying that quantum gates perform as intended is essential for building secure and reliable quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order correlators bridge classical transport and quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) has emerged as a central tool for quantifying decoherence across wide-ranging physical platforms. Here we demonstrate its direct measurement in a classical ensemble using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with a modulated gradient spin echo (MGSE) sequence and extend the method into a multidimensional correlation to track exchange phenomena. Position is encoded through magnetic field gradients and momentum through the velocity autocorrelation function, enabling experimental access to OTOCs for proton motion confined within the self-similar lattice of the metal-organic framework MOF-808. Here, water confined to specified geometries within the MOF pores gives rise to spatially distinct diffusive eigenmodes with characteristic relative entropies. We demonstrate that periodic radiofrequency (rf) driving combined with gradient modulation yields entropy evolution through the selection of distinct diffusion modes. Frequency-resolved diffusion spectra connect these entropy dynamics to classical heat-exchange laws, revealing how operational features of quantum systems are mirrored in confined, macroscopic spin ensembles.</description>

      <title>Classical Simulations of Low Magic Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop classical simulation algorithms for adaptive quantum circuits that produce states with low levels of ``magic'' (i.e., non-stabilizerness). These algorithms are particularly well-suited to circuits with high rates of Pauli measurements, such as those encountered in quantum error correction and monitored quantum circuits. The measurements serve to limit the buildup of magic induced by non-Clifford operations arising from generic noise processes or unitary gates, respectively. Our algorithms also allow a systematic truncation procedure to achieve approximate simulation. To benchmark our approach, we study the dynamics of all-to-all monitored quantum circuits with a sub-extensive rate of $T$-gates per unit of circuit depth, where we can simulate previously inaccessible system sizes and depths. We characterize measurement-induced phase transitions in the output wavefunction, including in the entanglement, purification, and magic. We outline the utility of our algorithms to simulate dynamics with low magic and high entanglement, complementary to the leading matrix-product state approaches.</description>

      <title>Engineering Non-Gaussian Bosonic Gates through Quantum Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian operations are essential for most bosonic quantum technologies. Yet, realizable non-Gaussian gates are rather limited in type and generally suffer from accuracy-duration trade-offs. In this work, we propose to use quantum signal processing (QSP) techniques to engineer non-Gaussian gates on hybrid qumode-qubit systems. For systems with dispersive coupling, our scheme can generate a new non-Gaussian gate that produces a phase shift depending on the modulus of the boson number. This gate reproduces the selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gates under certain parameter choices, but with higher accuracy within a short, fixed and excitation-independent interaction time. The gate unlocks new applications, for example, in entangling logical qudits and deterministically generating multi-component cat states. Additionally, our versatile QSP formalism can be extended to systems with other interactions, and also engineer non-unitary operations, such as noiseless linear amplification and generalized-parity measurement.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Federated Quantum Learning via Quantum Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) enables collaborative training of quantum machine learning (QML) models across distributed quantum devices without raw data exchange. However, QFL remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where shared QML model updates can be exploited to undermine information privacy. In the context of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, a key question arises: How can inherent quantum noise be leveraged to enforce differential privacy (DP) and protect model information during training and communication? This paper explores a novel DP mechanism that harnesses quantum noise to safeguard quantum models throughout the QFL process. By tuning noise variance through measurement shots and depolarizing channel strength, our approach achieves desired DP levels tailored to NISQ constraints. Simulations demonstrate the framework's effectiveness by examining the relationship between differential privacy budget and noise parameters, as well as the trade-off between security and training accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate the framework's robustness against an adversarial attack designed to compromise model performance using adversarial examples, with evaluations based on critical metrics such as accuracy on adversarial examples, confidence scores for correct predictions, and attack success rates. The results reveal a tunable trade-off between privacy and robustness, providing an efficient solution for secure QFL on NISQ devices with significant potential for reliable quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Crosstalk Insensitive Trapped-Ion Entanglement through Coupling Matrix Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control crosstalk due to imperfect optical addressing in trapped-ion entangling gates results in unwanted entanglement between the target ions and their neighbors. These errors are highly non-local, making them particularly difficult to correct using error correcting codes. We introduce a method to design entangling gates that are insensitive to optical crosstalk by controlling the excitation of the ions' motional modes to engineer an effective qubit-qubit coupling matrix that entirely excludes crosstalk-affected ions from the entangling operation. This method requires no knowledge of the crosstalk level and relies only on optimization of the laser pulse, avoiding the need to modify the optical setup or use additional gate operations. We experimentally demonstrate the method on a three-ion string by performing an entangling gate that is completely insensitive to optical crosstalk.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Assisted Pulse Design for State Preparation in a Noisy Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision quantum control is essential for quantum computing and quantum information processing. However, its practical implementation is challenged by environmental noise, which affects the stability and accuracy of quantum systems. In this paper, using machine learning techniques we propose a quantum control approach that incorporates environmental factors into the design of control schemes, improving the control fidelity in noisy environments. Specifically, we investigate arbitrary quantum state preparation in a two-level system coupled to a bosonic bath. We use both Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Supervised Learning (SL) algorithms to design specific control pulses that mitigate the noise. These two neural network (NN) based algorithm both have the advantage that the well trained NN can output the optimal pulse sequence for any environmental parameters. Comparing the performance of these two algorithms, our results show that DRL is more effective in low-noise environments due to its strong optimization capabilities, while SL provides greater stability and performs better in high-noise conditions. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning techniques to enhance the quantum control fidelity in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Non-spatial symmetries in quantum nonlinear spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear spectroscopy is a powerful approach to extracting information, in particular higher-order correlations of physical quantities. Quantum nonlinear spectroscopy (QNS) can access exponentially more types of correlations than its classical counterpart, since the responses to ``classical forces'' correspond to contour-time-ordered correlations (CTOCs) that involve only commutators, while in QNS ``quantum forces'' from a quantum sensor induce responses corresponding to CTOCs that involve both commutators and anti-commutators. Symmetries are important for constraining and analyzing nonlinear spectroscopy. Quantum and classical nonlinear spectroscopy have similar spatial symmetry properties. QNS, however, is expected to have its characteristic non-spatial symmetry properties since commutators and anti-commutators of physical quantities can behave differently under non-spatial transformations (such as exchange of operators). Here, we investigate how higher-order correlations extracted by QNS are constrained by non-spatial symmetries, including particle-hole (C), time-reversal (T), and their combination, i.e., chiral (S) symmetry. We find that the generalized C-symmetry imposes special selection rules on QNS, and the generalized T- and S-symmetry relate CTOCs to out-of-time-order correlations (OTOCs). This work discloses deep structures in higher-order quantum correlations due to non-spatial symmetries and provides access to certain types of OTOCs that are not directly observable.</description>

      <title>Modulation Instability-Induced Multimode Squeezing in Quadratic Frequency Combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LN) microring resonators, characterized by an exceptionally high second-order nonlinear coefficient and superior electro-optic tunability, serve as an outstanding platform for the precise control of integrated quantum frequency combs (QFCs). In this study, we introduce a bipartite entanglement criterion to investigate the pairwise entanglement characteristics of QFCs generated via the spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) process in lithium niobate microring resonators operating below threshold. Furthermore, we propose a universal framework for analyzing multimode squeezing in quadratic frequency combs, enabling the realization of ultrabroadband and high-degree multimode squeezing. We further reveal the underlying physical mechanism: modulation instability (MI), regulated by temporal walk-off control, not only enables the formation of frequency combs but also induces multimode squeezing in the corresponding resonant modes. This study uncovers the previously unexplored role of on-chip multimode squeezing in quadratic frequency combs while facilitating collective noise suppression across multiple modes, thus holding substantial potential for advancing quantum precision measurement and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Optimal Work Extraction from Finite-Time Closed Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting useful work from quantum systems is a fundamental problem in quantum thermodynamics. In scenarios where rapid protocols are desired -- whether due to practical constraints or deliberate design choices -- a fundamental trade-off between power and efficiency emerges as a key concern. Here, we investigate the problem of finite-time optimal work extraction from closed quantum systems, subject to a constraint on the magnitude of the control Hamiltonian. We first establish the trade-off relation between power and work under a general setup, stating that these fundamental performance metrics cannot be maximized simultaneously. Next, we introduce a framework of Lie-algebraic control, which involves a wide range of control problems including many-body control of the Heisenberg model and the SU(n)-Hubbard model. Within this framework, the optimal work extraction protocol becomes remarkably simple: it suffices to use a time-independent Hamiltonian, which is determined by a nonlinear self-consistent equation. We obtain an analytical solution for su(2) control, and a numerical solution for more complex cases like su(n) control using the steepest gradient descent method. Moreover, by exploiting the Lie-algebraic structure of the controllable terms, our approach is applicable to quantum many-body systems, enabling an efficient numerical computation. Our results highlight the necessity of rapid protocols to achieve the maximum power and establish a theoretical framework for designing optimal work extraction protocols under realistic time constraints.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg spin chain models for realising quantum battery with the aid of Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the energy storage properties of quantum spin chains in the context of quantum batteries by introducing Heisenberg spin chain models composed of eight qubits, organized into three configurations: open, closed, and supercube geometries. The charging dynamics of the mentioned systems are examined using Hamiltonians that include contributions from the battery, spin-spin interactions, and a transverse magnetic field. The inclusion of the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (DMI) within the charging Hamiltonian is found to improve the ergotropy in the XXZ model, particularly for the supercube configuration, leading to enhanced quantum battery performance. We further study the effects of varying neighboring coupling strengths and system size (8 and 12 qubits) on the charging power and ergotropy. The analysis identifies the supercube configuration, under specific interaction strengths, as achieving near-optimal charging and discharging efficiency. In the case of a 12-qubit icosahedral structure, the superior results and ergotropy are obtained, comparable to the supercube.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a branch of quantum machine learning, quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) aims to solve complex sequential decision-making problems more efficiently and effectively than its classical counterpart by exploiting quantum resources. However, in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, its realization is challenged by the ubiquitous noise-induced decoherence. Here, we propose a noise-resilient QRL scheme for a quantum eigensolver. By investigating the non-Markovian decoherence effect on the QRL for solving the eigen states of a two-level system as an agent, we find that the formation of a bound state in the energy spectrum of the total agent-noise system restores the QRL performance to that in the noiseless case. Providing a universal physical mechanism to suppress the decoherence effect in quantum machine learning, our result lays the foundation for designing the NISQ algorithms and offers a guideline for their practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Multimode rotationally symmetric bosonic codes from group-theoretic construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of multi-mode, rotationally symmetric bosonic codes inspired by the group-theoretic framework of [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 240603 (2024)]. Such a construction inverts the traditional paradigm of code design by identifying codes from the requirement that a group of chosen logical gates should be implemented by means of physically simple logical operations, such as linear optics. Leveraging previously unexplored degrees of freedom within this framework, our construction preserves rotational symmetry across multiple modes, enabling linear-optics implementation of the full Pauli group. These codes exhibit improved protection against dephasing noise, outperforming both single-mode analogues and earlier multi-mode constructions. Notably, they allow exact correction of correlated dephasing and support qudit encoding in arbitrary dimensions. We analytically construct and numerically benchmark two-mode binomial codes instances, and demonstrate that, unlike single-mode rotationally symmetric bosonic codes, these exhibit no trade-off between protection against dephasing and photon loss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a relativistic quantum Otto engine with a harmonic oscillator as its working medium, analyzing how relativistic motion and nonadiabatic driving affect its performance and efficiency bounds. In the adiabatic regime, a closed-form analytical expression is derived for the generalized Carnot efficiency, which incorporates the effects of relativistic motion and reduces to the standard Carnot efficiency in the nonrelativistic limit. For nonadiabatic driving, we consider sudden compression and expansion work strokes and show that the maximum efficiency achievable by the engine is limited to 1/2, even in the ultra-relativistic limit. Going one step further, we also derive an analytical expression for the efficiency bound in the sudden-switch protocol, which can be regarded as the nonadiabatic counterpart of the generalized Carnot efficiency. Together, these results provide analytical bounds for the efficiency of relativistic quantum heat engines and constitute the first systematic study of the interplay between relativistic motion and frictional effects arising from nonadiabatic driving.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research and usage of artificial intelligence, particularly generative and large language models, have rapidly progressed over the last years. This has, however, given rise to issues due to high energy consumption. While quantum computing is not (yet) mainstream, its intersection with machine learning is especially promising, and the technology could alleviate some of these energy challenges. In this perspective article, we break down the lifecycle stages of large language models and discuss relevant enhancements based on quantum algorithms that may aid energy efficiency and sustainability, including industry application examples and open research problems.</description>

      <title>Overhead in Quantum Circuits with Time-Multiplexed Qubit Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When scaling up quantum processors in a cryogenic environment, it is desirable to limit the number of qubit drive lines going into the cryostat, since fewer lines makes cooling of the system more manageable and the need for complicated electronics setups is reduced. However, although time-multiplexing of qubit control enables using just a few drive line to steer many qubits, it comes with a trade-off: fewer drive lines means fewer qubits can be controlled in parallel, which leads to an overhead in the execution time for quantum algorithms. In this article, we quantify this trade-off through numerical and analytical investigations. For standard quantum processor layouts and typical gate times, we show that the trade-off is favorable for many common quantum algorithms $\unicode{x2014}$ the number of drive lines can be significantly reduced without introducing much overhead. Specifically, we show that couplers for two-qubit gates can be grouped on common drive lines without any overhead up to a limit set by the connectivity of the qubits. For single-qubit gates, we find that the serialization overhead generally scales only logarithmically in the number of qubits sharing a drive line. These results are promising for the continued progress towards large-scale quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Observation of Inelastic Meson Scattering in a Floquet System using a Digital Quantum Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice gauge theories provide a non-perturbative framework for understanding confinement and hadronic physics, but their real-time dynamics remain challenging for classical computations. However, quantum simulators offer a promising alternative for exploring such dynamics beyond classical capabilities. Here, we experimentally investigate meson scattering using a superconducting quantum processor. Employing a digital protocol, we realize a Floquet spin chain equivalent to a one-dimensional Floquet $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory. We observe Bloch oscillations of single kinks and strong binding between adjacent kinks, signaling confinement and the formation of stable mesons in this Floquet system. Using full-system joint readout, we resolve meson populations by string length, enabling identification of meson scattering channels. Our results reveal the fragmentation of a long-string meson into multiple short-string mesons, which is also an experimental signature of string breaking. Moreover, we directly observe inelastic meson scattering, where two short-string mesons can merge into a longer one. Our results pave the way for studying interacting gauge particles and composite excitations on digital quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Equally entangled multiqubit states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a protocol for generating multiqubit quantum states with translationally invariant pairwise entanglement. Our approach is tailored for digital quantum computers with restricted qubit connectivity, a common limitation in state-of-the-art hardware platforms. We examine two configurations: star connectivity, which enables rotationally invariant entanglement, and linear connectivity, which achieves translationally invariant entanglement. For the linear configuration, we use a variant of the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) algorithm to demonstrate that our protocol is independent of the qubits' number. A slight modification of the protocol reveals the presence of quantum states that exhibit periodicity of entanglement among nearest-neighbor qubits. The configurations and protocols of this work are well-suited for near-term quantum devices, offering a feasible route for the experimental realization of symmetric entangled states.</description>

      <title>A predictive solution of the EPR paradox</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work an incorrect argument in EPR's paper is corrected. A predictive approach to further confirm the validity of quantum theory is also proposed. The essence of the detail that EPR missed is that in a state of given total momentum (in their example the total momentum is zero), since the total momentum operator $\hat{\bp}=\hat{\bp}_1+\hat{\bp}_2$ does not commute with any of the position operators $\hat{\bx}_1$ and $\hat{\bx}_2,$ then in an eigenstate of the total momentum operator, the standard deviation on the measurement of the position of any of the two particles has to be infinite. Below we compute the (quantum) conditional expectation of the momentum of any of the particles (say, the first) given the value of a measurement of the total momentum. Since the predictor of the momentum of the particle depends on the total momentum, and the total momentum does not commute with the position operator of any of the particles, the uncertainty principle is not violated, and no contradiction appears. We also prove, using the basic tenets of quantum measurement theory, that after measurement of the total momentum, the probability density (computed as the absolute square of the wave function), coincides with the (quantum) conditional density given the total momentum.</description>

      <title>Quantum Telegraph Behavior as a Result of Continuous Weak Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a simple model of continuous weak measurement gives rise to the telegraph switching behavior seen in experiments with single qubits. This lends support to a continuous collapse interpretation of quantum mechanics, but can also be viewed as a model of continuous detection of a steady-state process in the incoherent limit. We show explicitly that such a system obeys the Born rule for particle counting statistics, even though no particle behavior has been invoked.</description>

      <title>Louvre: Relaxing Hardware Requirements of Quantum LDPC Codes by Routing with Expanded Quantum Instruction Set</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized bicycle codes (GB codes) represent a promising family of quantum low-density parity-check codes, characterized by high code rates and relatively local qubit connectivity. A subclass of the GB code called bivariate bicycle codes (BB codes) has garnered significant interest due to their compatibility with two-layer connectivity architectures on superconducting quantum processors. However, one key limitation of BB codes is their high qubit connectivity degree requirements (degree 6), which exacerbates the noise susceptibility of the system. Building on the recent progress in implementing multiple two-qubit gates on a single chip, this work introduces Louvre -- a routing-based framework designed to reduce qubit connectivity requirements in GB codes. Specifically, Louvre-7 achieves degree reduction while preserving the depth of the syndrome extraction circuit, whereas Louvre-8 further minimizes the connectivity by slightly increasing the circuit depth. When applied to BB codes, these two schemes could reduce the average degree to 4.5 and 4, respectively. Crucially, Louvre eliminates some of the long-range, error-prone connections, which is a distinct advantage over prior approaches. Numerical simulations demonstrate that Louvre-7 has an indistinguishable logical error rate as the standard syndrome extraction circuits of GB codes, while Louvre-8 only incurs a slight error rate penalty. Furthermore, by reordering some of the gates in the circuit, we can reduce the coupler length without degrading the performance. Though most of our analysis focuses on GB codes defined on periodic boundary conditions, we further discuss the adaptability of Louvre to open-boundary lattices and defect-containing grids, underscoring its broader applicability in practical quantum error correction architectures.</description>

      <title>Fourier Fingerprints of Ansatzes in Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical schemes to encode classical data in variational quantum machine learning (QML) lead to quantum Fourier models with $\mathcal{O}(\exp(n))$ Fourier basis functions in the number of qubits. Despite this, in order for the model to be efficiently trainable, the number of parameters must scale as $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}(n))$. This imbalance implies the existence of correlations between the Fourier modes, which depend on the structure of the circuit. In this work, we demonstrate that this phenomenon exists and show cases where these correlations can be used to predict ansatz performance. For several popular ansatzes, we numerically compute the Fourier coefficient correlations (FCCs) and construct the Fourier fingerprint, a visual representation of the correlation structure. We subsequently show how, for the problem of learning random Fourier series, the FCC correctly predicts relative performance of ansatzes whilst the widely-used expressibility metric does not. Finally, we demonstrate how our framework applies to the more challenging problem of jet reconstruction in high-energy physics. Overall, our results demonstrate how the Fourier fingerprint is a powerful new tool in the problem of optimal ansatz choice for QML.</description>

      <title>Quantum Verifiable Rewards for Post-Training Qiskit Code Assistant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qiskit is an open-source quantum computing framework that allows users to design, simulate, and run quantum circuits on real quantum hardware. We explore post-training techniques for LLMs to assist in writing Qiskit code. We introduce quantum verification as an effective method for ensuring code quality and executability on quantum hardware. To support this, we developed a synthetic data pipeline that generates quantum problem-unit test pairs and used it to create preference data for aligning LLMs with DPO. Additionally, we trained models using GRPO, leveraging quantum-verifiable rewards provided by the quantum hardware. Our best-performing model, combining DPO and GRPO, surpasses the strongest open-source baselines on the challenging Qiskit-HumanEval-hard benchmark.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Computational Chemistry?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For decades, computational chemistry has been posited as one of the areas in which quantum computing would revolutionize. However, the algorithmic advantages that fault-tolerant quantum computers have for chemistry can be overwhelmed by other disadvantages, such as error correction, processor speed, etc. To assess when quantum computing will be disruptive to computational chemistry, we compare a wide range of classical methods to quantum computational methods by extending the framework proposed by Choi, Moses, and Thompson. Our approach accounts for the characteristics of classical and quantum algorithms, and hardware, both today and as they improve.
  We find that in many cases, classical computational chemistry methods will likely remain superior to quantum algorithms for at least the next couple of decades. Nevertheless, quantum computers are likely to make important contributions in two important areas. First, for simulations with tens or hundreds of atoms, highly accurate methods such as Full Configuration Interaction are likely to be surpassed by quantum phase estimation in the coming decade. Secondly, in cases where quantum phase estimation is most efficient less accurate methods like Couple Cluster and Moller-Plesset, could be surpassed in fifteen to twenty years if the technical advancements for quantum computers are favorable. Overall, we find that in the next decade or so, quantum computing will be most impactful for highly accurate computations with small to medium-sized molecules, whereas classical computers will likely remain the typical choice for calculations of larger molecules.</description>

      <title>Classical fractional time series from quantum XXZ spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled quantum mechanical states in one dimension can be used to represent and simulate classical stochastic processes with nontrivial statistical properties. Long-range quantum correlations translate into fractional processes with their asymptotic Hurst exponents characterizing roughness and persistence. We explore this analogy in the case of the spin-1/2 XXZ chain and investigate properties of four different classical two-state processes that this quantum system can generate. These processes show fractional characteristics with varying Hurst exponents. We argue that the continuous quantum symmetries such as U(1) or SU(2) of the XXZ chain give rise to $H=0$ with logarithmic scaling. Processes generated without these symmetries can produce $H \geq0.5$ but likely not $H &lt; 0.5$ unless the dominant term responsible for $H=0.5$ gets canceled. This does not seem to happen for the XXZ model. We use standard quantum methods, including MERA and TEBD, to numerically substantiate our findings.</description>

      <title>Quenched Quantum Feature Maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum feature mapping technique that leverages the quench dynamics of a quantum spin glass to extract complex data patterns at the quantum-advantage level for academic and industrial applications. We demonstrate that encoding a dataset information into disordered quantum many-body spin-glass problems, followed by a nonadiabatic evolution and feature extraction via measurements of expectation values, significantly enhances machine learning (ML) models. By analyzing the performance of our protocol over a range of evolution times, we empirically show that ML models benefit most from feature representations obtained in the fast coherent regime of a quantum annealer, particularly near the critical point of the quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the generalization of our technique by benchmarking on multiple high-dimensional datasets, involving over a hundred features, in applications including drug discovery and medical diagnostics. Moreover, we compare against a comprehensive suite of state-of-the-art classical ML models and show that our quantum feature maps can enhance the performance metrics of the baseline classical models up to 210%. Our work presents the first quantum ML demonstrations at the quantum-advantage level, bridging the gap between quantum supremacy and useful real-world academic and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>How many qubits does a machine learning problem require?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a machine learning paradigm to be generally applicable, it should have the property of universal approximation, that is, it should be able to approximate any target function to any desired degree of accuracy. In variational quantum machine learning, the class of functions that can be learned depend on both the data encoding scheme as well as the architecture of the optimizable part of the model. Here, we show that the property of universal approximation is constructively and efficiently realized by the recently proposed bit-bit encoding scheme. Further, we show that this construction allows us to calculate the number of qubits required to solve a learning problem on a dataset to a target accuracy, giving rise to the first resource estimation framework for variational quantum machine learning. We apply bit-bit encoding to a number of medium-sized datasets from OpenML and find that they require only $20$ qubits on average for encoding. Further, we extend the basic bit-bit encoding scheme to one that can handle batching very large datasets. As a demonstration, we apply this new scheme to the giga-scale transcriptomic Tahoe-100M dataset, concluding that the number of qubits required for encoding it lies beyond classical simulation capabilities. Remarkably, we find that the number of qubits does not necessarily increase with the number of features of a dataset, but may sometimes even decrease.</description>

      <title>Spectral Gaps with Quantum Counting Queries and Oblivious State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximating the $k$-th spectral gap $\Delta_k=|\lambda_k-\lambda_{k+1}|$ and the corresponding midpoint $\mu_k=\frac{\lambda_k+\lambda_{k+1}}{2}$ of an $N\times N$ Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues $\lambda_1\geq\lambda_2\geq\ldots\geq\lambda_N$, is an important special case of the eigenproblem with numerous applications in science and engineering. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm which approximates these values up to additive error $\epsilon\Delta_k$ using a logarithmic number of qubits. Notably, in the QRAM model, its total complexity (queries and gates) is bounded by $O\left( \frac{N^2}{\epsilon^{2}\Delta_k^2}\mathrm{polylog}\left( N,\frac{1}{\Delta_k},\frac{1}{\epsilon},\frac{1}{\delta}\right)\right)$, where $\epsilon,\delta\in(0,1)$ are the accuracy and the success probability, respectively. For large gaps $\Delta_k$, this provides a speed-up against the best-known complexities of classical algorithms, namely, $O \left( N^{\omega}\mathrm{polylog} \left( N,\frac{1}{\Delta_k},\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)\right)$, where $\omega\lesssim 2.371$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. A key technical step in the analysis is the preparation of a suitable random initial state, which ultimately allows us to efficiently count the number of eigenvalues that are smaller than a threshold, while maintaining a quadratic complexity in $N$. In the black-box access model, we also report an $\Omega(N^2)$ query lower bound for deciding the existence of a spectral gap in a binary (albeit non-symmetric) matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows secure key exchange based on the principles of quantum mechanics, with higher-dimensional photonic states offering enhanced channel capacity and resilience to noise. Free-space QKD is crucial for global networks where fibres are impractical, but atmospheric turbulence introduces severe states distortions, particularly for spatial modes. Adaptive optics (AO) provides a pathway to correct these errors, though its effectiveness depends on the encoding basis. Here, we experimentally evaluate a high-speed AO system for orbital angular momentum (OAM) modes, mutually unbiased bases (MUB), and symmetric, informationally complete, positive operator-valued measures (SIC-POVM) up to dimension $d=8$ in a turbulent free-space channel. While OAM states are strongly distorted, their cylindrical symmetry makes them optimally corrected by AO, yielding error rates below QKD security thresholds. MUB and SIC-POVM exhibit greater intrinsic robustness to turbulence but are less precisely corrected, though their performance remains within protocol tolerances. These results establish AO as a key enabler of secure, high-dimensional QKD and highlight the role of basis choice in optimizing resilience and correction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The class of languages having polynomial-time classical or quantum interactive proof systems ($\mathsf{IP}$ or $\mathsf{QIP}$, respectively) is identical to $\mathsf{PSPACE}$. We show that $\mathsf{PSPACE}$ (and so $\mathsf{QIP}$) is subset of $\mathsf{AM(2QCFA)}$, the class of languages having Arthur-Merlin proof systems where the verifiers are two-way finite automata with quantum and classical states (2QCFAs) communicating with the provers classically. Our protocols use only rational-valued quantum transitions and run in double-exponential expected time. Moreover, the member strings are accepted with probability 1 (i.e., perfect-completeness).</description>

      <title>Introducing the Quantum Economic Advantage Online Calculator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing a systematic view of where quantum computers will outperform classical ones is important for researchers, policy makers and business leaders. But developing such a view is challenging because quantum advantage analyses depend not only on algorithm properties, but also on a host of technical characteristics (error correction, gate speeds, etc.). Because various analyses make different assumptions about these technical characteristics, it can be challenging to make comparisons across them. In this paper, we introduce an open-access web-tool designed to make such comparisons easy. Built on the framework introduced by Choi, Moses, and Thompson (2023), it calculates when quantum systems will outperform classical computers for a given algorithmic problem. These estimates can be easily updated based on various assumptions for error correction, overhead, and connectivity. Different hardware roadmaps can also be used and algorithm running times can be customized to particular applications. It can currently be accessed at https://futuretech.mit.edu/quantum-economic-advantage-calculator.
  This integrated prediction tool also allows us to explore which technical factors are most important for quantum ``economic" advantage (outperforming on a cost-equivalent basis). Overall, we find that for some algorithms (e.g. Shor's) the timing of advantage is quite robust, whereas for others (e.g. Grover's) it is contingent, with numerous technical characteristics substantially impacting these dates. In the paper, we discuss both why this occurs and what we can learn from it.</description>

      <title>Physical constraints on effective non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting and open quantum systems can be formulated in terms of an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH), however, there are important constraints that must be satisfied by the effective action and the associated Green's functions. One common approach to many-body non-Hermitian (NH) systems is to incorporate the anti-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian directly in the Matsubara Green's function. Here, we show that such an approach is incompatible with the standard framework for systems with interactions. Furthermore, we furnish a consistent physical description for such systems by determining their distinction from conventional interacting physics, and find that they are described by pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we characterize the zero-temperature distribution functions within several frameworks for NH systems. As an application of our results, we consider the electromagnetic response of a NH quasiparticle Hamiltonian based on the (1+1)-dimensional NH Dirac model subject to various physical descriptions.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of multimode quantum phase transitions in a superconducting Bose-Hubbard simulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of phase transitions and critical phenomena arising in quantum driven-dissipative systems, and whether a correspondence can be drawn to their equilibrium counterparts, is a pressing question in contemporary physics. The development of large-scale superconducting circuits provides an experimental platform for these theoretical models. We report an experimental study of a multi-mode dissipative first-order phase transition in a 1D Bose-Hubbard chain consisting of 21 superconducting resonators. This phase transition manifests itself as a simultaneous frequency jump in all resonator modes as the frequency or power of a pump tone is swept. By measuring the system's emission spectrum through the transition, we characterize the dim-to-bright phase transition and construct the full phase diagram. We further perform time-dependent measurements of the switching between the two phases in the transition region, from which we corroborate the transition line and extract transition times ranging from a few ms up to 143~s. Our model, based on single-mode mean-field theory and cross-Kerr interactions, captures the features at moderate pump powers and quantitatively reproduces the transition line. Our results open a new window into non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics and mark a step toward realizing and understanding dissipative phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit using superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>QAgent: An LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Autonomous OpenQASM programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper, we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context, predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\% compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Probing disorder-driven topological phase transitions via topological edge modes with ultracold atoms in Floquet-engineered honeycomb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most fascinating properties of topological phases of matter is their robustness to disorder and imperfections. Although several experimental techniques have been developed to probe the geometric properties of engineered topological Bloch bands with cold atoms, they almost exclusively rely on the translational invariance of the underlying lattice. This prevents direct studies of topology in the presence of disorder, further hindering an extension to disordered interacting topological phases. Here, we identify disorder-driven phase transitions between two distinct Floquet topological phases using the characteristic properties of topological edge modes with ultracold atoms in periodically-driven two-dimensional (2D) optical lattices. Our results constitute an important step towards studying the rich interplay between topology and disorder with cold atoms. Moreover, our measurements confirm that disorder indeed favors the anomalous Floquet topological regime over conventional Hall systems, indicating an enhanced robustness and paving the way towards observing exotic out-of-equilibrium phases such as the anomalous Floquet Anderson insulator.</description>

      <title>Bosonization and Kramers-Wannier dualities in general dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the noninteracting Majorana chain is dual to the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model, either through the Jordan-Wigner transformation or by gauging fermion parity. In this correspondence, the minimal translation of the Majorana chain maps to the celebrated Kramers-Wannier (KW) duality of the spin model, with the critical point mapped to the self-dual point. In this work, we generalize this mapping to two and higher dimensions by constructing a unitary equivalence between the parity-gauged fermionic system and a spin system defined on arbitrary polyhedral decompositions of space. Imposing the flatness condition on the gauge field yields a bosonization duality between the original (ungauged) fermionic system and a gauged spin system obeying a Gauss law. The dependence of the Gauss law in the spin system on the Kasteleyn orientation (and the discrete spin structure) of the fermionic system is made explicit. Applying this bosonization to one or two copies of Majorana fermions on translationally invariant lattices, we derive higher-dimensional analogs of KW (self-)dualities in spin systems arising from fermionic minimal translations. The KW (self-)dualities are non-invertible due to projections onto eigenspaces of higher-form symmetries in the associated symmetry operators. The bosonization framework we present is intuitive, general, and systematic, encompassing other known exact bosonization methods while offering a novel approach to establish new connections between fermionic and spin systems in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that a black hole (or any Killing horizon) will decohere any quantum superposition in their vicinity. I review three distinct but equivalent arguments that illustrate how this phenomenon arises: (1) entanglement with "degrees of freedom" in the interior (2) the absorption of soft, entangling radiation emitted by the superposition and (3) interactions with the quantum, fluctuating multipole moments of a black hole arising from ultra low frequency Hawking quanta. The relationship between "soft hair" and interactions with "internal degrees of freedom" is emphasized and some implications for the nature of horizons in a quantum theory of gravity are discussed.</description>

      <title>Interfacing Rydberg atoms with a chip-based superconducting microwave resonator using an ac Stark shifted single-photon transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Helium atoms in the 1s50s $^3$S$_1$ Rydberg level have been resonantly coupled to the $2\pi\times11.721$ GHz second harmonic mode of a chip-based superconducting coplanar waveguide microwave resonator. To achieve this, the single-photon electric-dipole-allowed 1s50s $^3$S$_1\rightarrow$ 1s50p $^3$P$_J$ transition was tuned into resonance with the resonator mode through the ac Stark shift induced by a second strong $2\pi\times3.350$ GHz microwave dressing field. The effects of this dressing field, and residual uncanceled dc electric fields at the location of the atoms close to the superconducting chip surface were interpreted with support from Floquet calculations of the energy level structure of the Rydberg states. To observe appreciable population transfer in the $1~\mu$s atom-resonator interaction time using this transition, which had an electric dipole moment of $1500 e a_0$, pulsed microwave fields were injected into the resonator. From the photon occupation number in the resonator mode under these conditions, the single-photon Rabi frequency associated with the coupling of the atoms to the resonator was estimated to be $\sim2\pi\times100$ Hz. These results represent an important step toward operation of this Rydberg-atom-superconducting-circuit interface in the single-photon strong coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Ultranarrow Superradiant Laser via Dressed Dark State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superradiant laser, which exploits the clock transition of alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms to generate ultrastable light in the bad-cavity limit, has garnered much attention in the past few decades. Unlike their odd counterpart, the even isotopes of alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms possess simpler structures and longer-lived transitions, which would relax the field control requirements and enhance the frequency stability of the output light. However, due to the absence of hyper-fine interaction in even isotopes, the transition from the state $^{3}\mathrm{P}_{0}$ to $^{1}$S$_{0}$ is strictly forbidden, leading to a vanishing coupling strength between the cavity mode and the atoms (the state $^{3}\mathrm{P}_{0}$ as a dark state). In this work, we suggest a superradiant laser scheme by dressing this dark state with a small bright component by virtue of a static magnetic field. In contrast to other proposals utilizing natural atomic transitions, our dressed-state protocol can work from the crossover regime (coherence in both atoms and photons) to the superradiant lasing regime (coherence solely in atoms). Specially, by operating deep into the superradiant lasing regime, our scheme witnesses a dramatic line-narrowing feature (mHz level) while maintaining its power. Furthermore, compared to the crossover regime, the laser frequency in the superradiant lasing regime is more robust against the fluctuations of the cavity length and magnetic field strength. Our proposal demonstrates the potential for extracting ultranarrow light from even isotopes of the alkaline-earth-metal-like atoms and may find its role in frequency stabilization and related precision measurement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Density Matrix: Formalism and Properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the general formalism and properties of the spacetime density matrix, which captures correlations among different Cauchy surfaces and can be regarded as a natural generalization of the standard density matrix defined on a single Cauchy surface. We present the construction of the spacetime density matrix in general quantum systems and its representation via the Schwinger Keldysh path integral. We further introduce a super-operator framework, within which the spacetime density matrix appears as a special case, and discuss possible generalizations from this perspective. We also show that the spacetime density matrix satisfies a Liouville von Neumann type equation of motion. When considering subsystems, a reduced spacetime density matrix can be defined by tracing over complementary degrees of freedom. We study the general properties of its moments and, in particular, derive universal short time behavior of the second moment. We find that coupling between subsystems plays a crucial role in obtaining nontrivial results. Assuming weak coupling, we develop a perturbative method to compute the moments systematically.</description>

      <title>Bosonization in $R$-paraparticle Luttinger models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reintroduce the parafermion-paraboson classification in $R$-paraparticles in terms of their average occupation numbers, analogous to Green's parastatistics. The notion of $p$-order in $R$-parafermions is also redefined as the maximum number of particles that can occupy a quantum state. An example of an order-$2$ $R$-parafermion with $m=2$ internal degrees of freedom is presented, which obeys an exclusion principle that is not Pauli's. The interacting $R$-parafermions are studied in the context of bosonization. Specifically, we show that while density waves are generally bosonic in nature and that flavor-charge separation naturally occurs for any one-dimensional $R$-parafermion system described by the Luttinger model, flavor waves do not always satisfy bose statistics. Comparison of the partition functions further show that only $(p=1)$-ordered $R$-parafermions are compatible with the bosonization procedure in the low-energy limit. Based from these results, we discuss a potential realization of parafermion signatures in one-dimensional systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing Bose-Einstein condensation of polar molecules is a long-standing challenge in ultracold physics and quantum science due to near-universal two-body collisional losses. Here, we report the production of a Bose-Einstein condensate of ground-state sodium-rubidium molecules via high efficiency evaporative cooling, with losses suppressed using the dual microwave shielding technique. The ability to tune the dipolar interaction between these ultracold polar molecules is crucial for producing the condensate and enables exciting prospects for future applications. We explore different regimes of dipolar interactions, realizing both the gas phase and the quantum droplet phase of the molecular condensate. This work opens new avenues for investigating quantum matter with strong dipolar interactions and for quantum simulation of long-range many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Toward 48 dB Spin Squeezing and 96 dB Signal Magnification for Cosmic Relic Searches with Nuclear Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently showed that macroscopic nuclear spin ensembles prepared in coherent spin states can dramatically enhance the interaction rates of weakly interacting cosmic relics-such as dark matter and the cosmic neutrino background-through collective quantum effects analogous to Dicke superradiance, where the de-excitation and excitation rates scale as the square of the number of spins, $N^2$. We thus coined these processes superradiant interactions. In this paper, we propose a protocol to realize this enhancement and boost the discovery potential for such relics. We show how concepts from quantum optics can be adapted to nuclear spins coupled to superconducting circuits, enabling high-sensitivity systems. The spins are first initialized into a coherent spin state via a $\pi/2$ Rabi pulse from the ground state. When the circuit is sufficiently detuned from resonance, the spin-circuit interaction implements a squeezing Hamiltonian. Because squeezing must outpace spin relaxation and dephasing, the protocol favors macroscopic ensembles and high-quality superconducting circuits. During this squeezing phase, the standard quantum variance is reduced by up to 4.8 orders of magnitude-equivalent to 48 dB of squeezing-for circuits with quality factors $Q \sim 10^8$-$10^9$. The signal imprinted on the spins during the squeezing protocol can be magnified by further utilizing the squeezing interactions, easing the requirement for shot-noise-limited readout. This protocol has the potential to significantly accelerate axion and dark photon dark matter searches and extend the reach of existing axion experiments to probe QCD axion-nuclear spin couplings. More broadly, it paves the way for detecting coherent inelastic interactions from other cosmic relics-most notably the cosmic neutrino background-and establishes nuclear-spin-based systems as a new class of quantum, ultra-low-threshold detectors.</description>

      <title>Extensive entanglement between coupled Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids in and out of equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement exists in nature but is absent in classical physics, hence it fundamentally distinguishes quantum from classical theories. While entanglement is routinely observed for few-body systems, it is significantly more challenging to witness in quantum many-body systems. Here, we theoretically study entanglement between two parallel and spatially separated Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) partitioned along the longitudinal axis. In particular, we focus on 1D Bose gases as a realization of TLLs and investigate two experimentally relevant situations: tunnel-coupled gases at finite temperatures and after coherent splitting. In both scenarios, we analytically calculate the logarithmic negativity and identify a threshold temperature below which the system is entangled. Notably, this threshold temperature is accessible in near-term coherent splitting experiments. Furthermore, we investigate the crossover between quantum and classical correlations in the vicinity of the threshold temperature by comparing logarithmic negativity with mutual information. We argue that the initial mutual information established by the coherent splitting is conserved in TLL dynamics, thus preventing certain generalized Gibbs ensembles from being reached during prethermalization. Moreover, both logarithmic negativity and mutual information are found to scale extensively with the subsystem's length. Although the ground-state entanglement between coupled TLLs has been predicted to be extensive, this setting is largely overlooked compared to other partitions. Our work extends the study of entanglement between coupled TLLs to finite temperatures and out-of-equilibrium regimes, and provides a strategy towards experimental detection of extensive entanglement in quantum many-body systems at finite temperatures.</description>

      <title>Role of sub-barrier dynamics in coherent and incoherent radiation during tunneling ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation during strong-field tunneling ionization is investigated. The spontaneous as well as the coherent component of the radiation are calculated and the role of the under-the-barrier dynamics is analyzed. The competition of the contribution of different mechanisms in different spectral regions is examined. Transition-like radiation (Brunel radiation) is dominated at low-frequencies, Thomson scattering -- at the laser frequencies, and radiative recombination via the three-step process -- at high-order harmonics. The under-the-barrier dynamics is shown to enhance the Brunel radiation for near-zero-frequencies in asymmetric laser pulses for spontaneous as well as for the coherent radiation.</description>

      <title>Electric-field metrology of a terahertz frequency comb using Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terahertz radiation finds an increasing number of applications, yet efficient generation and detection remain a challenge and an active area of research. In particular, the precise detection of weak and narrowband terahertz signals is notoriously difficult. Here, we employ a novel type of single-photon detector based on Rydberg atoms to both detect and calibrate a terahertz frequency comb over an octave-spanning range, yet with a MHz-level selectivity. We calibrate the intensity of the electric field of the comb against the fundamental atomic properties, while achieving the intensity (power) sensitivity down to 35.9 $\mathrm{fW\ cm^{-2}\ Hz^{-0.5}}$ (1.46 $\mathrm{fW\ Hz^{-0.5}}$) within a single mode of the frequency comb, all in a room-temperature operated setup. Our results elucidate the transition of terahertz frequency combs into the quantum regime, enabling high-precision and high-sensitivity spectroscopy. This breakthrough allows terahertz science to better leverage revolutionary techniques developed for optical frequency combs.</description>

      <title>Integrability from a Single Conservation Law in Quantum Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e., integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.</description>

      <title>Toward triggered generation of indistinguishable single-photons from MoTe$_2$ quantum emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon sources operating in the telecom band are fundamental components for long-distance optical quantum communication and information processing. Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer a promising platform for such sources, but their development has been hindered by limited spectral range and poor single-photon indistinguishability. Here, we demonstrate a reproducible and systematic approach for generating near-infrared (1090-1200 nm) quantum emitters in bilayer MoTe$_2$ using deterministic strain and defect engineering. These emitters exhibit strong linear polarization (DOLP $&gt;70\%$), sub-nanosecond lifetimes ($\tau \leqslant$ ~450 ps), high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0)&lt;0.1$), and resolution-limited emission ($\sim$200 $\mu$eV). Electrostatic biasing enables Stark tuning over a $\sim$3 meV range, reduced photon bunching, and significantly shortened radiative lifetimes, yielding narrow emission with ratios of experimental to transform-limited linewidths as low as $R\sim55$. Most notably, two-photon interference measurements reveal a Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility of $V_\text{HOM}\sim $10$\%$, and up to $V_\text{HOM}\sim$ 40$\%$ with post-selection by temporal filtering, representing the highest reported indistinguishability for any TMD quantum emitters and the first such demonstration in the near-infrared regime. These results establish MoTe$_2$ as a viable platform for tunable, low-noise, high-purity single-photon sources with promising indistinguishability, paving the way for their integration into telecom-compatible quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments with ultracold quantum gases are a rapidly advancing research field with many applications in fundamental physics and quantum technology. Here, we report on a high-flux generation of Bose-Einstein condensate mixtures of $^{41}$K and $^{87}$Rb, using a fully integrated sounding rocket setup. We investigate the release and the free expansion of the quantum mixtures for different orientations to gravity. The release dynamics are governed by the mixture interactions as well as the decaying magnetic field during the release. The latter can be minimized by a dedicated switch-off protocol of the trap generating currents where an exact model enabled us to characterize the interaction effects. Our results establish a new benchmark for generating ultracold mixtures on mobile platforms, with direct relevance for future experiments on interacting quantum gases and tests of the equivalence principle in space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While tremendous research has revealed that symmetry enriches topological phases of matter, more general principles that protect topological phases have yet to be explored. In this Letter, we elucidate the roles of subspaces in free-fermionic topological phases. A subspace property for Hamiltonians enables us to define new topological invariants. They result in peculiar topological boundary phenomena, i.e., the emergence of an unpaired zero mode or zero-winding skin modes, characterizing subspace-protected topological phases. We establish and demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence in subspace-protected topological phases. We further discuss the interplay of the subspace property and internal symmetries. Toward application, we also propose possible platforms possessing the subspace property.</description>

      <title>Bohr--Sommerfeld rules for systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete, self-contained formulation of the Bohr--Sommerfeld quantization rule for a semiclassical self-adjoint $2 \times 2$ system on the real line, arising from a simple closed curve in phase space. We focus on the case where the principal symbol exhibits eigenvalue crossings within the domain enclosed by the curve -- a situation commonly encountered in Dirac-type operators. Building on earlier work on scalar Bohr--Sommerfeld rules and semiclassical treatments of the Harper operator near rational flux quanta, we identify additional contributions to the quantization condition, and derive concise expressions for general self-adjoint $2 \times 2$ systems. The resulting formulas give explicit geometric phase corrections and clarify when these phases take quantized values.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Direct Randomized Benchmarking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized benchmarking (RB) protocols are widely used to measure an average error rate for a set of quantum logic gates. However, the standard version of RB is limited because it only benchmarks a processor's native gates indirectly, by using them in composite $n$-qubit Clifford gates. Standard RB's reliance on $n$-qubit Clifford gates restricts it to the few-qubit regime, because the fidelity of a typical composite $n$-qubit Clifford gate decreases rapidly with increasing $n$. Furthermore, although standard RB is often used to infer the error rate of native gates, by rescaling standard RB's error per Clifford to an error per native gate, this is an unreliable extrapolation. Direct RB is a method that addresses these limitations of standard RB, by directly benchmarking a customizable gate set, such as a processor's native gates. Here we provide a detailed introduction to direct RB, we discuss how to design direct RB experiments, and we present two complementary theories for direct RB. The first of these theories uses the concept of error propagation or scrambling in random circuits to show that direct RB is reliable for gates that experience stochastic Pauli errors. We prove that the direct RB decay is a single exponential, and that the decay rate is equal to the average infidelity of the benchmarked gates, under broad circumstances. This theory shows that group twirling is not required for reliable RB. Our second theory proves that direct RB is reliable for gates that experience general gate-dependent Markovian errors, using similar techniques to contemporary theories for standard RB. Our two theories for direct RB have complementary regimes of applicability, and they provide complementary perspectives on why direct RB works. Together these theories provide comprehensive guarantees on the reliability of direct RB.</description>

Abstract: Optically accessible solid state defect spins serve as a primary platform for quantum information processing, where precise control of the electron spin and ancillary nuclear spins is essential for operation. Using the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color center in diamond as an example, we employ a combined group theory and density functional theory study to demonstrate that spin-lattice relaxation of the $^{14}$N nuclear spin is significantly enhanced due to strong entanglement with orbital degrees of freedom in the $|^3E\rangle$ optical excited state of the defect. This mechanism is common to other solid-state defect nuclear spins with similar optical excited states. Additionally, we propose a straightforward and versatile \textit{ab initio} scheme for predicting orbital-dependent spin Hamiltonians for trigonal defects exhibiting orbital degeneracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of coupling a local electromagnetic cavity to a segment of a topological Kitaev chain (KC), with particular emphasis on the interplay between photons and Majorana zero modes (MZMs). In addition to the well-known {\it scissor effect}-which effectively partitions the chain and isolates free MZMs in the bulk-we provide evidence of non-trivial fusion rules and braiding operations, hallmark signatures of non-Abelian anyons, enabled by spatially selective ultrastrong KC-cavity coupling. We propose that these distinctive MZM properties can be experimentally probed via fermionic parity measurements and photon-induced Berry phases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the so-called sweet-spot regime, the coupled system can be mapped onto a Rabi-like model with a homodyne-rotated quadrature, offering a simplified yet powerful theoretical description. Exploiting the symmetry of fermionic modes within a two-site cavity configuration, we also show the feasibility of generating hybrid MZM-polariton Schr\"odinger cat states. Our findings offer a novel approach to manipulating topological quantum matter through local light-matter interactions and provide theoretical tools for future experimental realizations in platforms such as quantum materials or superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>High-Q cavity coupled to a high permittivity dielectric resonator for sensing applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of high-quality factor resonators is of undoubted interest for high-precision measurements and for applications in quantum technologies. Novel types of microwave sensors can be realized by coupling a first resonator acting as a stable frequency reference with a second resonator that is sensitive to a particular physical quantity. Here we report on a coupled cavity configuration in which a high $Q$ factor elliptical TESLA-shaped superconducting cavity is coupled with a high permittivity ($\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$) SrTiO$_3$ puck, whose resonant frequency varies as a function of temperature due to the temperature dependence of the permittivity that reaches values higher than 30000 below 1 K. Extensive electromagnetic simulations are used to test different coupling configurations, showing great versatility in tuning the coupling in the weak or strong regime, depending on the puck's position within the cavity. Moreover, for the coupled system, they allow investigation of the dependence of the zero transmission frequency (notch frequency) on changes in permittivity $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$, obtaining a maximum value of 2.8 MHz per unit change of $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r}$, for $\varepsilon_\mathrm{r} \approx 230$. Finally, we discuss the use of the coupled system as a sensor that operates in different temperature ranges.</description>

Abstract: Thermodynamic principles governing energy and information are important tools for a deeper understanding and better control of quantum systems. In this work, we experimentally investigate the interplay of the thermodynamic costs and information flow in a quantum system undergoing iterative quantum measurement and feedback. Our study employs a state stabilization protocol involving repeated measurement and feedback on an electronic spin qubit associated with a Silicon-Vacancy center in diamond, which is strongly coupled to a diamond nanocavity. This setup allows us to verify the fundamental laws of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics, including the second law and the fluctuation theorem, both of which incorporate measures of quantum information flow induced by iterative measurement and feedback. We further assess the reducible entropy based on the feedback's causal structure and quantitatively demonstrate the thermodynamic advantages of non-Markovian feedback over Markovian feedback. For that purpose, we extend the theoretical framework of quantum thermodynamics to include the causal structure of the applied feedback protocol. Our work lays the foundation for investigating the entropic and energetic costs of real-time quantum control in various quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Cutting is All You Need: Execution of Large-Scale Quantum Neural Networks on Limited-Qubit Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement in Quantum Computing, particularly through Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, has spurred significant interest in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) applications. Despite their potential, fully-quantum algorithms remain impractical due to the limitations of current NISQ devices. Hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQNNs) have emerged as a viable alternative, leveraging both quantum and classical computations to enhance machine learning capabilities. However, the constrained resources of NISQ devices, particularly the limited number of qubits, pose significant challenges for executing large-scale quantum circuits.
  This work addresses these current challenges by proposing a novel and practical methodology for quantum circuit cutting of HQNNs, allowing large quantum circuits to be executed on limited-qubit NISQ devices. Our approach not only preserves the accuracy of the original circuits but also supports the training of quantum parameters across all subcircuits, which is crucial for the learning process in HQNNs. We propose a cutting methodology for HQNNs that employs a greedy algorithm for identifying efficient cutting points, and the implementation of trainable subcircuits, all designed to maximize the utility of NISQ devices in HQNNs. The findings suggest that quantum circuit cutting is a promising technique for advancing QML on current quantum hardware, since the cut circuit achieves comparable accuracy and much lower qubit requirements than the original circuit.

      <title>Quantum Optimization for Optimal Power Flow: CVQLS-Augmented Interior Point Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers - Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS - revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization to select the best one. We evaluate our approaches on multiple systems to show their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Simulations for the 2-bus system are conducted on a commercial IBMQ quantum device, while simulations for the other larger cases are performed using the IBM quantum simulator. While promising, CVQLS is limited by current quantum hardware, especially for larger systems. We use a quantum noise simulator to test scalability.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field fluctuations induced decoherence of a diamagnetic nanosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a simple derivation of the decoherence rate for a diamagnetic nanoparticle in the presence of fluctuations of the magnetic field in a thermal environment. Diamagnetic levitation is one of the key techniques for trapping, cooling, and creating a macroscopic quantum spatial superposition in many experiments. It is widely applied in many theoretical and experimental endeavours to test fundamental physics in matter-wave interferometers. To estimate the decoherence rate originating from magnetic-field fluctuations, we use the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We show that our resulting decoherence rate expression is analogous to that of a dielectric material interacting with the electric field component of the background field; however, it is often relatively suppressed due to the material properties.</description>

      <title>Realization of a doped quantum antiferromagnet with dipolar tunnelings in a Rydberg tweezer array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Doping an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly-correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors. To describe the competition between tunneling $t$ of hole dopants and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin interactions $J$, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic $t$-$J$ model, and the direct analog quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought. Here, we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest neighbour (NNN) tunnelings $t'$ and hard-core bosonic holes using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We utilize coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes, to implement a tunable bosonic $t$-$J$-$V$ model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for $|t/J|\ll 1$, and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnelings $t'$ and perturbative pair tunneling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of $t$. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets. The model we implement extends the toolbox of Rydberg tweezer experiments beyond spin-1/2 models to a larger class of $t$-$J$ and spin-$1$ models.</description>

      <title>Controlling Quantum Coherence of V-type Atom in Dissipative Cavity by Detuning and Weak Measurement Reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11010v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, an interactive system composed of a V-type atom and a dissipative single-mode cavity is considered and the atomic quantum coherences are investigated under parameters including spontaneously generated interference (SGI), cavity-environment coupling, weak measurement and its reversal, and detuning between the atom and the cavity. The results indicate that, the strong coupling can induce coherence sudden death (CSD) and coherence sudden birth (CSB), and the non-zero SGI parameter only induces CSB but the detuning may avoid CSD and CSB. Moreover, detuning and weak measurement reversal can very effectively protect quantum coherence, while the SGI parameter, weak measurement, and strong coupling can accelerate its attenuation. The SGI parameter, detuning, weak measurement reversal, and strong coupling all promote the generation of coherence, whereas weak measurement alone can suppress it. In particular, the maximal coherent state can be very effectively protected and the coherent state can be prepared if all parameters are selected appropriately. Physical interpretations are also provided for these results.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Verification of Non-Gaussian Coherence in Bosonic Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Gaussianity, a distinctive characteristic of bosonic quantum states, is pivotal in advancing quantum networks, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and high-precision metrology. Verifying the quantum nature of a state, particularly its non-Gaussian features, is essential for ensuring the reliability and performance of these technologies. However, the specific properties required for each application demand tailored validation thresholds. Here, we introduce a hierarchical framework comprising absolute, relative, and qubit-specific thresholds to assess the non-Gaussianity of local coherences. We illustrate this framework using heralded optical non-Gaussian states with the highest purities available in optical platforms. This comprehensive framework presents the first detailed evaluation of number state coherences and can be extended to a wide range of bosonic states.</description>

      <title>Hierarchies of quantum non-Gaussian coherences for bosonic systems: A theoretical study</title>

Abstract: Quantum coherence in bosonic systems is a fundamental resource for quantum technology applications. In this work, we introduce a framework for analyzing coherence in the Fock-state basis, utilizing context-dependent certification to reveal the quantum non-Gaussian nature of the tested coherence. Rather than relying on global coherence measures, our approach targets specific aspects of coherence, enabling a tailored hierarchical classification. We derive and compare two distinct hierarchies, each representing a different context for coherence in bosonic systems. Motivated by current advancements in optical quantum state engineering, we assess the feasibility and depth of these hierarchies under conditions of loss and thermal noise. The methodology introduced here is versatile and can be extended to multi-state and multi-mode coherences, making it adaptable to a wide range of experimental scenarios and platforms.</description>

Abstract: We introduce Superstate Quantum Mechanics (SQM) as a theory that considers states in Hilbert space subject to multiple quadratic constraints. Traditional quantum mechanics corresponds to a single quadratic constraint of wavefunction normalization. In its simplest form, SQM considers states in the form of unitary operators, where the quadratic constraints are conditions of unitarity. In this case, the stationary SQM problem is a quantum inverse problem with multiple applications in physics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The SQM stationary problem is equivalent to a new algebraic problem that we address in this paper. The SQM non-stationary problem considers the evolution of a quantum system itself, distinct from the explicit time dependence of the Hamiltonian, $H(t)$. Two options for the SQM dynamic equation are considered: (1) within the framework of linear maps from higher-order quantum theory, where 2D-type quantum circuits are introduced to transform one quantum system into another; and (2) in the form of a Gross-Pitaevskii-type nonlinear map. Although no known physical process currently describes such 2D dynamics, this approach naturally bridges direct and inverse quantum mechanics problems, allowing for the development of a new type of computer algorithms. Beyond computer modeling, the developed theory could be directly applied if or when a physical process capable of solving a quantum inverse problem in a single measurement act (analogous to how an eigenvalue arises from a measurement in traditional quantum mechanics) is discovered in the future.</description>

Abstract: As quantum analogs of the classical Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy, quantum dynamical entropies have emerged as important tools to characterize complex quantum dynamics. In particular, Alicki-Fannes-Lindblad (AFL) entropy, which quantifies the information production of a coherent quantum system subjected to repeated measurement, has received considerable attention as a potential diagnostic for quantum chaos. Despite this interest, the precise behavior of quantum dynamical entropy in the presence of symmetry has seen little study. In this work, we establish rigorous inequalities of the AFL entropy for arbitrary unitary dynamics (single-particle and many-body) in the presence of various types of symmetry. Our theorems encompass three cases: Abelian symmetry, an anticommuting unitary, and non-Abelian symmetries. We motivate our main results with numerical simulations of the perturbed quantum cat maps. Our findings highlight the role of symmetry in quantum dynamics under measurements, and our framework is easily adaptable for study of symmetry in other probes of quantum chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16404v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has recently been considerable interest in studying quantum systems via dynamical Lie algebras (DLAs) -- Lie algebras generated by the terms which appear in the Hamiltonian of the system. However, there are some important properties that are revealed only at a finer level of granularity than the DLA. In this work we explore, via the commutator graph, average notions of scrambling, chaos and complexity over ensembles of systems with DLAs that possess a basis consisting of Pauli strings. Unlike DLAs, commutator graphs are sensitive to short-time dynamics, and therefore constitute a finer probe to various characteristics of the corresponding ensemble. We link graph-theoretic properties of the commutator graph to the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), the frame potential, the frustration graph of the Hamiltonian of the system, and the Krylov complexity of operators evolving under the dynamics. For example, we reduce the calculation of average OTOCs to a counting problem on the graph; separately, we connect the Krylov complexity of an operator to the module structure of the adjoint action of the DLA on the space of operators in which it resides, and prove that its average over the ensemble is lower bounded by the average shortest path length between the initial operator and the other operators in the commutator graph.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, squeezed cat codes with resilience to specific types of loss have been proposed as a step toward realizing fault-tolerant optical quantum computers. However, error correction for squeezed cat codes requires a strong nonlinearity, which makes its implementation challenging with current technology. We propose a novel hybrid code that combines the squeezed cat code and the polarization qubit. First, we propose a generation method and a universal gate set that can be implemented with a linear optical system. Then, we show the superiority of the hybrid squeezed cat code over the hybrid cat code and the squeezed cat code through numerical simulations. These results demonstrate that the hybrid squeezed cat code is a promising candidate as a new resource for optical quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: Here we consider an analytically tractable model of a two level quantum system subject to random shocks and prove that it decays asymptotically to a trivial state, that is, to a state in which the two levels have equal probability of occupation. In a two qubit system, if the shocks affect each qubit independently, the equilibrium density matrix becomes a simple product of the one qubit equilibrium density matrices regardless of the nature of the initial state. This has potential applications to entangles qubits in quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Constraints on Information Transmission in Quantum Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The processing of quantum information is limited by fundamental physical constraints on how information can be encoded, transmitted, and extracted. In particular, the non-orthogonality of quantum states limits their distinguishability, and thermodynamic constraints, including the energetic cost of state preparation and quantum operations, further restrict the viability of realistic information protocols. This work explores the impact of such constraints on the preparation, evolution, and readout of quantum information. We demonstrate that preparing the system for encoding and measurement affects the distinguishability and purity of the resulting ensemble of states. Furthermore, we analyze a noisy communication channel and propose an optimal protocol for encoding and decoding the transmitted information. For this realistic protocol, we show that the maximum probability of successfully retrieving the information is equal to the maximum correlation that can be achieved between the system and the register. The protocol uses only Gibbs states as free resources, ensuring minimal thermodynamic cost. Based on this, we provide a thermodynamic interpretation of the Holevo information, which quantifies the capacity of the transmitted information and establishes a fundamental limit on its retrieval in thermodynamically constrained scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We devise tractable models of unitary quantum many-body dynamics on tree graphs, as a first step towards a deeper understanding of dynamics in non-Euclidean spaces. To this end, we first demonstrate how to construct strictly local quantum circuits that preserve the symmetries of trees, such that their dynamical light cones grow isotropically. For trees with coordination number z, such circuits can be built from z-site gates. We then introduce a family of gates for which the dynamics is exactly solvable; these satisfy a set of constraints that we term 'tree-unitarity'. Notably, tree-unitarity reduces to the previously-established notion of dual-unitarity for z = 2, when the tree reduces to a line. Among the unexpected features of tree-unitarity is a trade-off between 'maximum butterfly velocity' dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators and the existence of non-vanishing correlation functions in multiple directions, a tension absent in one-dimensional dual-unitary models and their Euclidean generalizations. We connect the existence of (a wide class of) solvable dynamics with non-maximal butterfly velocity directly to a property of the underlying circuit geometry called $\delta$-hyperbolicity, and argue that such dynamics can only arise in non-Euclidean geometries. We give various examples of tree-unitary gates, discuss dynamical correlations, out-of-time-order correlators, and entanglement growth, and show that the kicked Ising model on a tree is a physically-motivated example of maximum-velocity tree-unitary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimization Benchmarking Library - The Intractable Decathlon</title>

Abstract: Through recent progress in hardware development, quantum computers have advanced to the point where benchmarking of (heuristic) quantum algorithms at scale is within reach. Particularly in combinatorial optimization - where most algorithms are heuristics - it is key to empirically analyze their performance on hardware and track progress towards quantum advantage. To this extent, we present ten optimization problem classes that are difficult for existing classical algorithms and can (mostly) be linked to practically relevant applications, with the goal to enable systematic, fair, and comparable benchmarks for quantum optimization methods. Further, we introduce the Quantum Optimization Benchmarking Library (QOBLIB) where the problem instances and solution track records can be found. The individual properties of the problem classes vary in terms of objective and variable type, coefficient ranges, and density. Crucially, they all become challenging for established classical methods already at system sizes ranging from less than 100 to, at most, an order of 100,000 decision variables, allowing to approach them with today's quantum computers. We reference the results from state-of-the-art solvers for instances from all problem classes and demonstrate exemplary baseline results obtained with quantum solvers for selected problems. The baseline results illustrate a standardized form to present benchmarking solutions, which has been designed to ensure comparability of the used methods, reproducibility of the respective results, and trackability of algorithmic and hardware improvements over time. We encourage the optimization community to explore the performance of available classical or quantum algorithms and hardware platforms with the benchmarking problem instances presented in this work toward demonstrating quantum advantage in optimization.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Speedup in Localizing Transmission Loss Change in Optical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to localize transmission loss change to a subset of links in optical networks is crucial for maintaining network reliability, performance and security. \emph{Quantum probes}, implemented by sending blocks of $n$ coherent-state pulses augmented with continuous-variable (CV) squeezing ($n=1$) or weak temporal-mode entanglement ($n&gt;1$) over a lossy channel to a receiver with homodyne detection capabilities, are known to be more sensitive than their quasi-classical counterparts in detecting a sudden increase in channel loss. The enhanced sensitivity can be characterized by the increased Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the homodyne output, before and after the loss change occurs. When combined with the theory of quickest change detection (QCD), the increase in KL divergence translates into a decrease in detection latency.
  In this work, we first revisit quantum probes over a channel, generalizing previous results on $n=1$ (CV squeezed states) to arbitrary values of $n$. Assuming a subset of nodes in an optical network is capable of sending and receiving such probes through intermediate nodes with all-optical switching capabilities, we present a scheme for quickly detecting the links that have suffered a sudden drop in transmissivity. Since quantum probes lose their sensitivity with increasing loss in the channel, we first propose a probe construction algorithm that makes the set of links suffering transmission loss change identifiable, while minimizing the longest distance a probe traverses. We then introduce new cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistics with a stopping rule, which allows us to run the CUSUM algorithm to quickly localize the lossy links using our constructed probes. Finally, we show that the proposed scheme achieves a quantum speedup in decreasing the detection delay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (i) We point out that every local unitary circuit of depth smaller than the linear system size is easily distinguished from a global Haar random unitary if there is a conserved quantity that is a sum of local operators. This is always the case with a continuous onsite symmetry or with a local energy conservation law. (ii) We explain a simple algorithm for a formulation of the shallow unitary circuit learning problem and relate it to an open question on strictly locality-preserving unitaries (quantum cellular automata). (iii) We show that any translation-invariant quantum cellular automaton in $D$-dimensional lattice of volume $V$ can be implemented using only $O(V)$ local gates in a staircase fashion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The preparation of quantum many-body systems faces the difficulty that in a realistic scenario only few control parameters of the system may be accessible. In this context, an interesting connection between the energy fluctuations during state preparation and its geometric length as measured by the Fubini-Study metric was discussed in Bukov et al., "Geometric Speed Limit of Accessible Many-Body State Preparation", Phys. Rev. X 9, 011034 (2019). An inspiring conjecture was put forward lower bounding the energy fluctuations by the minimal geometric length of all accessible state preparation protocols. We here show that the conjecture holds if the accessible parameter space has no extrinsic curvature, when embedded into the space of all dynamically accessible states. However, we present counterexamples to the conjecture for a number of generic qubit, qutrit and harmonic oscillator systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum circuit lower bounds in the magic hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the magic hierarchy, a quantum circuit model that alternates between arbitrary-sized Clifford circuits and constant-depth circuits with two-qubit gates ($\textsf{QNC}^0$). This model unifies existing circuit models, such as $\textsf{QAC}^0_f$ and models with adaptive intermediate measurements. Despite its generality, we are able to prove nontrivial lower bounds.
  We prove new lower bounds in the first level of the hierarchy, showing that certain explicit quantum states cannot be approximately prepared by circuits consisting of a Clifford circuit followed by $\textsf{QNC}^0$. These states include ground states of some topologically ordered Hamiltonians and nonstabilizer quantum codes. Our techniques exploit the rigid structure of stabilizer codes and introduce an infectiousness property: if even a single state in a high distance code can be approximately prepared by one of these circuits, then the entire subspace must lie close to a perturbed stabilizer code. We also show that proving state preparation lower bounds beyond a certain level of the hierarchy would imply classical circuit lower bounds beyond the reach of current techniques in complexity theory.
  More broadly, our techniques go beyond lightcone-based methods and highlight how the magic hierarchy provides a natural framework for connecting circuit complexity, condensed matter, and Hamiltonian complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to broaden the adoption of highly-demanded quantum functionalities such as QKD, there is a need for having quantum signals coexist with classical traffic over the same physical medium, typically optical fibers in already-deployed networks. Beyond the experimental point-to-point demonstrations of the past few years, efforts are now underway to integrate QKD at the network level: developing interfaces with the software-defined-network ecosystem; but also network planning tools that satisfy physical-layer contraints jointly on the classical and quantum signals. We have found that in certain situations, na\"ive network planning prioritizing quantum traffic drastically degrades classical capacity, whereas a quantum-aware wavelength assignment heuristic allows coexistence with minimal impact on both capacities. More such techniques will be required to enable widespread deployment of QKD and other future quantum functionalities.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian and Hamiltonian exceptional points of atomic vapors: The spectral signatures of quantum jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spectral singularities in an alkali-metal atomic vapor modeled using four and effectively three hyperfine states. By comparing the eigenvalue spectra of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) and a Liouvillian superoperator, we analyze the emergence and characteristics of both semiclassical and quantum exceptional points. Our results reveal that, for atomic systems, the NHH approach alone may be insufficient to fully capture the system's spectral properties. While NHHs can yield accurate predictions in certain regimes, a comprehensive description typically requires the Liouvillian formalism, which governs the Lindblad master equation and explicitly incorporates quantum jump processes responsible for repopulation dynamics. We demonstrate that the inclusion of quantum jumps fundamentally alters the spectral structure of the system. In particular, we present examples in which the existence, location in parameter space, or even the order of spectral degeneracies differ significantly between the two approaches, thereby highlighting the impact of quantum jumps and the limitations of the NHH method. Finally, using the hybrid-Liouvillian formalism, we show how quantum jumps reshape spectral features initially predicted by the NHH, ultimately determining the full Liouvillian spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elucidate the profound connection between physics and computation by proposing and examining the model of the non-Hermitian quantum computer (NQC). In addition to conventional quantum gates such as the Hadamard, phase, and CNOT gates, this model incorporates a non-unitary quantum gate $G$. We show that NQC is extraordinarily powerful, capable of solving not only all NP problems but also all problems within the complexity class $\text{P}^{\sharp\text{P}}$ in polynomial time. We investigate two physical schemes for implementing the non-unitary gate $G$ and find that the remarkable computational power of NQC originates from the exponentially large physical resources required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four-component Schr\"odinger cat (4C) states are the quantum superpositions of four coherent states arranged with fourfold symmetry in phase space. 4C states are important physical resources for fault-tolerant quantum computing. In this paper, a Floquet-engineering scheme is proposed for generating 4C states in a hybrid ferromagnet-superconductor system. Numerical simulations show that the high-fidelity 4C states can be generated even if the decoherence of the system is considered. These results provide a scalable route to multi-component cat-state engineering in solid-state platforms and open new avenues for quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Approximate universality and large measurement gain of Rabi model in a linear potential under strong Doppler broadening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Harnessing quantum resources in the atomic external degrees of freedom, particularly matter-wave states with large momentum broadening, holds significant potential for enhancing the sensitivity of Kasevich-Chu atom gravimeters at the standard quantum limit. However, a fully quantum-mechanical investigation of the critical Doppler effect inherent to this approach remains lacking. Employing SU(2) Lie group theory, we derive a generic scalar Riccati equation governing the unitary dynamics of the Rabi model within a linear potential and analyze the Doppler effect's impact on Rabi oscillations because of the strong coupling between the internal and external states. Furthermore, by integrating Fisher information theory, we demonstrate the approximate universality and high metrological gain of phase-rotation measurement protocols under strong Doppler broadening induced by large-momentum width. This theoretical work provides insightful implications for broader generalization, such as extensions to finite-temperature scenarios or multi-pulse sequences, exemplified by the $\pi/2-\pi-\pi/2$ pulse sequence characteristic of Kasevich-Chu atom gravimeters. Thus this study lays a theoretical foundation for developing high-sensitivity, noise-resistant atom gravimeters that leverage external-state quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Quantum-informed machine learning for the prediction of chaotic dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum-informed machine learning (QIML) framework for the long-term dynamical behavior of high-dimensional chaotic systems. The method combines a one-time, offline-trained quantum generative model with a classical autoregressive predictor for spatiotemporal field generation. The quantum model learns a quantum prior (Q-Prior) that guides the representation of small-scale interactions and improves the modeling of fine-scale dynamics. We evaluate QIML on three representative systems: the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, the two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow, and a cross-section of fully developed three-dimensional turbulent channel flow used as a realistic inflow condition. Compared to the classical baseline, QIML yields up to 17.25% improvement in predictive distribution accuracy and a 29.36% improvement in the fidelity of the predicted full energy spectrum. For turbulent channel inflow, the Q-Prior is essential: without it, the model fails to evolve in time, while QIML produces stable, physically consistent forecasts that surpass leading machine learning models for PDEs, including the Fourier Neural Operator and Markov Neural Operator, whose errors diverge. Beyond accuracy, QIML also achieves a memory advantage, compressing multi-megabyte datasets into a kilobyte-scale Q-Prior that captures only the invariant measure needed to guide the classical model, thus circumventing Holevo's bound by avoiding full data reconstruction. Our findings provide a practical and scalable pathway for integrating the advantages brought by quantum devices into large-scale scientific, engineering modeling and simulation.</description>

      <title>Free Independence and Unitary Design from Random Matrix Product Unitaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of unitary randomness underpins the modern theory of quantum chaos and fundamental tasks in quantum information. In one research direction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) have recently been shown to probe freeness between Heisenberg operators, the non-commutative generalization of statistical independence. In a distinct setting, approximate unitary designs look random according to small moments and for forward-in-time protocols. Bridging these two concepts, we study the emergence of freeness in a random matrix product unitary (RMPU) ensemble, an efficient unitary design. We prove that, with only polynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of higher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables -- precisely those predicted to thermalize in chaotic many-body systems according to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We further compute the frame potential of the RMPU ensemble, showing convergence to the Haar value also with only polynomial deviations, indicating that freeness is reached on-average for global observables. On the other hand, to reproduce freeness for traceless observables, volume-law operator entanglement is required. Our results highlight the need to refine previous notions of unitary design in the context of operator dynamics, guiding us towards protocols for quantum advantage while shedding light on the emergent complexity of chaotic many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: In this short-length paper, we will present some math that play a central role in quantum hydrodynamics and that were presented by Mita in the past. In this formulation of QM, a quantity is involved which is called the diffusion flux. As we will see, this quantity plays a crucial role on the evolution of wave packets. More specifically, we will initially briefly explain some results derived in Mita's papers, by analyzing Gaussian and soliton wave packets, while our main focus is on the role of diffusion in the evolution of super-luminal wave packets. Also, A very brief discussion will be made about the presence of the osmotic velocity field in quantum dynamics</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Operating superconducting qubits at elevated temperatures offers increased cooling power and thus system scalability, but requires suppression of thermal photons to preserve coherence and readout fidelity. This motivates migration to higher operation frequencies, which demands high-frequency amplification with near-quantum-limited noise characteristics for qubit readout. Here, we report the design and experimental realization of a wireless Josephson parametric amplifier (WJPA) operating above 20~GHz. The wireless design eliminates losses and impedance mismatches that become problematic at high frequencies. The WJPA achieves more than 20~dB of gain across a tunable frequency range of 21--23.5~GHz, with a typical dynamic bandwidth of 3~MHz. Through Y-factor measurements and a qubit-based photon number calibration, we show that the amplifier exhibits an added noise of approximately two photons.</description>

      <title>Distributed Implementation of Variational Quantum Eigensolver to Solve QUBO Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a distributed algorithm and implementation of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), termed distributed VQE (DVQE). DVQE, provided as an open-source Python package, enables the execution of parameterized quantum circuits across multiple logical quantum processing units (QPUs) in a distributed fashion. This approach addresses key hardware limitations of near-term quantum devices, including restricted qubit counts and limited circuit depth. Distributed ansatz circuits are constructed to preserve the quantum state fidelity of their monolithic counterparts, allowing consistent energy estimation while distributing the computational load. To improve the convergence and robustness of the optimization loop for identifying the variational parameters of the DVQE ansatz circuit, we use the ADAM optimizer in combination with metaheuristic initialization strategies, which outperform random initialization across various test cases. The complete DVQE pipeline is implemented in a modular Python package that accepts QUBO problems as input and supports monolithic and distributed execution modes. The framework leverages Qiskit to construct and simulate distributed circuits, and includes an internal greedy algorithm for automatic qubit allocation across multiple QPUs. Simulation results on QUBO benchmarks confirm the correctness of the approach, paving the way for real QPU deployment and further exploration of distributed quantum optimization. \textbf{The simulator is publicly available on \href{https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/DVQE.git}{GitHub} under a package named raiselab, with a collection of tutorial examples.}</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Origin of Detachable Boundary States in Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09458</link>

Abstract: While topology can impose obstructions to exponentially localized Wannier functions, certain topological insulators are exempt from such Wannier obstructions. The absence of the Wannier obstructions can further accompany topological boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. Here, we elucidate a close connection between these detachable topological boundary states and non-Hermitian topology. Identifying topological boundary states as non-Hermitian topology, we demonstrate that intrinsic non-Hermitian topology leads to the inevitable spectral flow. By contrast, we show that extrinsic non-Hermitian topology underlies the detachment of topological boundary states and clarify anti-Hermitian topology of the detached boundary states. Based on this connection and $K$-theory, we complete the tenfold classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states.</description>

      <title>$K$-theory classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hallmark of certain topology, including the Chern number, is the obstruction to constructing exponentially localized Wannier functions in the bulk bands. Conversely, other types of topology do not necessarily impose Wannier obstructions. Remarkably, such Wannier-localizable topological insulators can host boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. In our accompanying Letter [D. Nakamura {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 096601 (2025), arXiv:2407.09458], we demonstrate that non-Hermitian topology underlies detachable boundary states in Hermitian topological insulators and superconductors, thereby establishing their tenfold classification based on internal symmetry. Here, using $K$-theory, we elucidate the relationship between Wannier localizability and detachability of topological boundary states. From the boundary perspective, we classify intrinsic and extrinsic non-Hermitian topology, corresponding to nondetachable and detachable topological boundary states, respectively. From the bulk perspective, on the other hand, we classify Wannier localizability through the homomorphisms of topological phases from the tenfold Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes to the threefold Wigner-Dyson symmetry classes. Notably, these two approaches from the boundary and bulk perspectives lead to the same classification. We clarify this agreement and develop a unified understanding of the bulk-boundary correspondence on the basis of $K$-theory.</description>

      <title>Variational Calculation of the Hyperfine Stark Effect in Atomic $^{87}$Rb, $^{133}$Cs, and $^{169}$Tm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An electronically variational approach to the calculation of atomic hyperfine structure transition energies under the influence of static external electric fields is presented. The method avoids the calculation of intermediate atomic states entirely and requires only the wavefunctions of the electronic states involved in the respective hyperfine levels. These wavefunctions are obtained through relativistic general-excitation-rank configuration interaction theory. A variant of the method also enables for calculations on atoms with the most complicated of shell structures.
  Applications to $^{87}$Rb, $^{133}$Cs and a specific clock transition in $^{169}$Tm are presented. The final results $k_{\text{Rb}} = -1.234 \pm 0.0223$ [$10^{-10}$ Hz/((V/m)$^2$)] and $k_{\text{Cs}} = -2.347 \pm 0.084$ [$10^{-10}$ Hz/((V/m)$^2$)] obtained under inclusion of up to quintuple excitations in the atomic wavefunction expansion are compatible with previous calculations and, in the case of Cs, confirm that one of the earlier experimental measurements is not reliable. For $^{169}$Tm that is used in the development of atomic clocks the differential static scalar electric dipole polarizability between ground levels $J=\frac{7}{2}$ and $J=\frac{5}{2}$ is calculated to be $\Delta\alpha^s_0 = -0.134 \pm 0.11$ a.u. This result from a pure {\it{ab initio}} calculation confirms the result of $\Delta\alpha^s_0 = -0.063^{+0.01}_{-0.005}$ a.u. obtained in {\it{Nat. Comm.}} {\bf{10}} (2019) 1724 where a combination of measurement and theoretical modeling has been used.</description>

      <title>Quantum One-Time Programs, Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-time programs (Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum, CRYPTO 2008) are functions that can be run on any single input of a user's choice, but not on a second input. Classically, they are unachievable without trusted hardware, but the destructive nature of quantum measurements seems to provide a quantum path to constructing them. Unfortunately, Broadbent, Gutoski and Stebila showed that even with quantum techniques, a strong notion of one-time programs, similar to ideal obfuscation, cannot be achieved for any non-trivial quantum function. On the positive side, Ben-David and Sattath (Quantum, 2023) showed how to construct a one-time program for a certain (probabilistic) digital signature scheme, under a weaker notion of one-time program security. There is a vast gap between achievable and provably impossible notions of one-time program security, and it is unclear what functionalities are one-time programmable under the achievable notions of security.
  In this work, we present new, meaningful, yet achievable definitions of one-time program security for probabilistic classical functions. We show how to construct one time programs satisfying these definitions for all functions in the classical oracle model and for constrained pseudorandom functions in the plain model. Finally, we examine the limits of these notions: we show a class of functions which cannot be one-time programmed in the plain model, as well as a class of functions which appears to be highly random given a single query, but whose one-time program form leaks the entire function even in the oracle model.</description>

      <title>Soft edges: the many links between soft and edge modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boundaries in gauge theory and gravity give rise to symmetries and charges at both finite and asymptotic distance. Due to their structural similarities, it is often held that soft modes are some kind of asymptotic limit of edge modes. Here, we show in Maxwell theory that there is an arguably more interesting relationship between the asymptotic symmetries and their charges, on one hand, and their finite-distance counterparts, on the other, without the need of a limit. Key to this observation is to embed the finite region in the global spacetime and identify edge modes as dynamical $\rm{U}(1)$-reference frames for dressing subregion variables. Distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic frames, according to whether they are built from field content in- or outside the region, we find that non-trivial corner symmetries arise only for extrinsic frames. Further, the asymptotic-to-finite relation requires asymptotically charged ones (like Wilson lines). Such frames, called soft edges, extend to asymptotia and, in fact, realize the corner charge algebra in multiple ways, for example, by "pulling in" the asymptotic one from infinity, or physically through the addition of asymptotic soft and hard radiation. Realizing an infinite-dimensional algebra requires a new set of soft boundary conditions, relying on the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic data. We identify the subregion Goldstone mode as the relational observable between extrinsic and intrinsic frames and clarify the meaning of vacuum degeneracy. We also connect the asymptotic memory effect with a more operational quasi-local one. A main conclusion is that the relationship between asymptotia and finite distance is frame-dependent; each choice of soft edge mode probes distinct cross-boundary data of the global theory.</description>

      <title>Photon State Evolution in Arbitrary Time-Varying Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the instantaneous eigenstate method to study the evolution of quantum states in media with arbitrary time-varying permittivity and permeability. This method leverages the Heisenberg equation to bypass the Schr\"odinger equation, which leads to a complicated infinite set of coupled differential equations. Instead, the method allows the computation of the state evolution by solving only two coupled differential equations. Using this approach, we draw general conclusions about photon statistics in time-varying media. Our findings reveal that the maximum probability of generating a single photon pair from vacuum in such media is 25%, while Bell states can be created with a maximum probability of 84%. Additionally, we demonstrate that the spectral profile of emitted photons can be precisely controlled through the temporal profiles of permittivity and permeability. These results provide deeper insights into photon state manipulation in time-varying media. Furthermore, the instantaneous eigenstate method opens new opportunities to study state evolution in other systems where the Heisenberg equation offers a more tractable solution than the Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry dynamics in random quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of entanglement asymmetry in random unitary circuits (RUCs). Focusing on a local $U(1)$ charge, we consider symmetric initial states evolved by both local one-dimensional circuits and geometrically non-local RUCs made of two-qudit gates. We compute the entanglement asymmetry of subsystems of arbitrary size, analyzing the relaxation time scales. We show that the entanglement asymmetry of the whole system approaches its stationary value in a time independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits. For subsystems, we find qualitative differences depending on their size. When the subsystem is larger than half of the full system, the equilibration time scales are again independent of the system size for both local and non-local circuits and the entanglement asymmetry grows monotonically in time. Conversely, when the subsystems are smaller than half of the full system, we show that the entanglement asymmetry is non-monotonic in time and that it equilibrates in a time proportional to the quantum-information scrambling time, providing a physical intuition. As a consequence, the subsystem-equilibration time depends on the locality of interactions, scaling linearly and logarithmically in the system size, respectively, for local and non-local RUCs. Our work confirms the entanglement asymmetry as a versatile and computable probe of symmetry in many-body physics and yields a phenomenological overview of entanglement-asymmetry evolution in typical non-integrable dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Gate-tunable transmon qubits are based on quantum conductors used as weak links within hybrid Josephson junctions. These gatemons have been implemented in just a handful of systems, all relying on extended conductors, namely epitaxial semiconductors or exfoliated graphene. Here we present the coherent control of a gatemon based on a single molecule, a one-dimensional carbon nanotube, which is integrated into a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture. The measured qubit spectrum can be tuned with a gate voltage and reflects the quantum dot behaviour of the nanotube. Our ultraclean integration, using a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, results in record coherence times of 200ns for carbon nanotube-based qubits. Furthermore, we investigate its decoherence mechanisms, thus revealing a strong gate dependence and identifying charge noise as a limiting factor. On top of positioning carbon nanotubes as contenders for future quantum technologies, our work paves the way for studying microscopic fermionic processes in low-dimensional quantum conductors.</description>

      <title>Accurate myocardial T1 mapping at 5T using an improved MOLLI method: A validation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop Coefficient-based Fitting with Adjustment (COFIA), a 5T myocardial T1 mapping method for MOLLI that corrects inversion inefficiency and readout disturbance via empirically estimated factors, addressing limits from inversion factor, readout perturbations, and imperfect recovery. Methods: COFIA uses a modified 5-(3)-3 MOLLI with ECG gating and GRE readout. Inversion at 5T was improved by redesigning the adiabatic pulse (Tan/Tanh vs HSn). The signal model recursively includes an inversion factor (delta) and a correction factor (C); T1 is estimated by nonlinear optimization. Validation included phantom scans and in vivo studies at 5T (21 healthy volunteers, 9 patients). Results: With peak amplitude 10.6 uT, the Tan/Tanh pulse outperformed HSn, yielding average delta = 0.9014 across Delta B0 = +/-250 Hz and B1 = 225-540 kHz. Phantom experiments showed errors within 5%. In vivo, native myocardial T1 (mean+/-SD) was 1468+/-48 ms (apex), 1514+/-39 ms (middle), and 1545+/-50 ms (base); blood T1 was 2182+/-132 ms, 2124+/-153 ms, and 2131+/-158 ms at the three levels. Conclusion: COFIA achieved accurate phantom T1 and feasible in vivo mapping at 5T. Using the standard 5(3)3 MOLLI acquisition, it supports clinical translation of 5T cardiac imaging.</description>

      <title>Measuring work in quantum many-body systems using a dynamical "work agent"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a generic quantum many-body system initiated at thermal equilibrium and driven by an external parameter, and discuss the prospect for measuring the work done by the varying parameter on the system. While existing methods are based on a full control of the system's Hamiltonian and are thus limited to few-level quantum systems, measuring work in many-body quantum systems remains challenging. Our approach relies on transforming the external parameter into a dynamical ``work agent", for which we consider an harmonic oscillator in a semiclassical coherent state with a large photon number. We define a work generating function which coincides with the standard two-point measurement protocol for work measurement in the limit of a large photon number. While \emph{in principle} it allows to relate the moments of work $\langle W^n \rangle$ to observables of the work agent, we focus on the average work, which is obtained from energy conservation by the change of the energy of the agent, which can be measured using photon number detection. We illustrate this concept on a transmon-microcavity system, which displays various quantum coherent effects including Landau-Zener St\"{u}kelberg interference and collapse and revival of Rabi oscillations. We discuss how our setup allows to measure work in a variety of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Pruned-ADAPT-VQE: compacting molecular ans\"atze by removing irrelevant operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adaptive derivative-assembled problem-tailored variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) is one of the most widely used algorithms for electronic structure calculations in quantum computers. It adaptively selects operators based on their gradient, constructing ans\"atze that continuously evolve to match the energy landscape, helping avoid local traps and barren plateaus. However, this flexibility in reoptimization can lead to the inclusion of redundant or inefficient operators that have almost zero parameter value, barely contributing to the ansatz. We identify three phenomena responsible for the appearance of these operators: poor operator selection, operator reordering, and fading operators. In this work, we propose an automated, cost-free refinement method that removes unnecessary operators from the ansatz without disrupting convergence. Our approach evaluates each operator after ADAPT-VQE optimization by using a function that considers both its parameter value and position in the ansatz, striking a balance between eliminating low-coefficient operators while preserving the natural reduction of coefficients as the ansatz grows. Additionally, a dynamic threshold based on the parameters of recent operators enables efficient convergence. We apply this method to several molecular systems and find that it reduces ansatz size and accelerates convergence, particularly in cases with flat energy landscapes. The refinement process incurs, at most, a small additional computational cost and consistently improves or maintains ADAPT-VQE performance.</description>

Abstract: Polariton chemistry has been hailed as a potential new route to direct molecular processes with electromagnetic fields. To make further strides, it is essential for the community to clarify which unusual polaritonic phenomena are true hallmarks of cavity quantum electrodynamics and which can be rationalized with classical optical physics. Here, we provide a tutorial perspective on the formation, spectroscopy, and behavior of molecular polaritons using classical optics. Where possible, we draw connections to cavity-enhanced spectroscopy and recast open questions in terms that may be more familiar to the broader community of physical chemists.</description>

      <title>ER = EPR in Loop Quantum Gravity: the Immirzi Parameter and the Continuum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We recast the finite-region analysis of Einstein's equations that underpins the ER=EPR program into the loop quantum gravity (LQG) framework. By translating curvature-energy uncertainty relations into holonomy-flux kinematics, and by identifying Planckian Einstein-Rosen throats with single-puncture cuts through spin networks, we obtain a precise dictionary between entanglement and quantum geometry. Within this dictionary we derive the Barbero-Immirzi parameter directly from the entanglement/area increment of a minimal bridge, and show that a boundary edge-mode construction renders the Bekenstein - Hawking entropy coefficient universal and independent of $\gamma$ under a natural complex polarization. We further establish a refinement renormalization flow for spin-foam amplitudes driven by the finite-region curvature energy bound, which suppresses bubble divergences and yields a regulator-independent continuum limit under explicit conditions. Finally, we indicate observational consequences that follow from an $N$-party generalized uncertainty relation.</description>

Abstract: Although recent advances in quantum machine learning (QML) offer significant potential for enhancing generative models, particularly in molecular design, a large array of classical approaches still face challenges in achieving high fidelity and validity. In particular, the integration of QML with sequence-based tasks, such as Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) string reconstruction, remains underexplored and usually suffers from fidelity degradation. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical architecture for SMILES reconstruction that integrates quantum encoding with classical sequence modeling to improve quantum fidelity and classical similarity. Our approach achieves a quantum fidelity of approximately 84% and a classical reconstruction similarity of 60%, surpassing existing quantum baselines. Our work lays a promising foundation for future QML applications, striking a balance between expressive quantum representations and classical sequence models and catalyzing broader research on quantum-aware sequence models for molecular and drug discovery.</description>
