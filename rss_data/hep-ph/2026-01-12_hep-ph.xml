      <title>Updated $(g-2)_\mu$, $(g-2)_e$ and PADME-Favored Couplings Narrowly Compatible with the Preferred Region of ATOMKI X17, Given a Protophobic Vector Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-evaluate the viability of a kinetically mixed dark photon ($A^{\prime}$) as a solution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment $(g-2)\mu$ discrepancy and the ATOMKI nuclear anomalies near 17~MeV, using the final FNAL measurement and the latest theory predictions (BMW21, WP25). For $m_{A^{\prime}} = 17$~MeV, the allowed kinetic mixing parameter narrows to $\varepsilon_\mu = 7.03(58)\times10^{-4}$ (WP25). We then directly compare the allowed region for the muon and X17 bands to those preferred by the electron magnetic moment measurements. For the electron, we obtain $\varepsilon_e = 1.19(15)\times10^{-3}$ (Cs, 2018) and $\varepsilon_e = 0.69(15)\times10^{-3}$ (Rb, 2020), based on two recent measurements of the fine structure constant compared to the most recent experimental value determined using a one-electron quantum cyclotron. While a mild tension persists, we identify a narrow overlapping region, $3.4\times10^{-4} \lesssim \varepsilon \lesssim 5.6\times10^{-4}$, between recent PADME results and NA64 exclusions, compatible with a protophobic gauge boson interpretation. These results provide well-defined targets for future experimental searches and motivate further theoretical refinements, both of which will play a decisive role in assessing the validity of the ATOMKI anomaly claims.</description>

      <title>A universal vision transformer for fast calorimeter simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-dimensional complex nature of detectors makes fast calorimeter simulations a prime application for modern generative machine learning. Vision transformers (ViTs) can emulate the Geant4 response with unmatched accuracy and are not limited to regular geometries. Starting from the CaloDREAM architecture, we demonstrate the robustness and scalability of ViTs on regular and irregular geometries, and multiple detectors. Our results show that ViTs generate electromagnetic and hadronic showers statistically indistinguishable from Geant4 in multiple evaluation metrics, while maintaining the generation time in the $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ ms on a single GPU. Furthermore, we show that pretraining on a large dataset and fine-tuning on the target geometry leads to reduced training costs and higher data efficiency, or altogether improves the fidelity of generated showers.</description>

      <title>Polarisation fractions in $B\to V_1 V_2$: U-Spin constraints and new physics signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the decays of $B$ mesons, i.e., $B_d$, $B_s$, $B^+$, and their antiparticles, to two light vector mesons ($B \to V_1V_2$), focusing on the implications of SU(2) U-spin symmetry, which relates $\Delta S = 0$ and $\Delta S = 1$ decay amplitudes through the interchange $d \leftrightarrow s$. Performing a global fit, we find that the Standard Model (SM) yields only a very poor agreement with the data, both in the exact U-spin limit as well as when substantial U-spin breaking is allowed for. The tension is primarily driven by the unexpectedly small longitudinal polarisation fraction in almost all $\Delta S = 1$ decays, especially for $B_s \to K^{*0} \overline{K^{*0}}$, for which the individual disagreement with U-spin based expectation is about $3.5\sigma$. Within the SM framework, the only effective resolution would be to disregard entirely the hierarchy between the longitudinal and transverse helicity amplitudes, in the heavy quark limit, as dictated by naive factorisation. An alternative would be to invoke new physics (NP) in the $b\to s$ sector that does not respect the hierarchy, and hence can reduce the tension for all the $\Delta S=1$ modes. We demonstrate that certain colour suppressed NP operators can alleviate the tension significantly without adversely affecting the agreement for the other modes.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic astrophysical uncertainties in the effective theory of dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of astrophysical uncertainties in direct detection searches can vary significantly across particle dark matter models and detector targets, due to the different velocity and momentum dependencies of the scattering cross section. We address these uncertainties for all operators of the non-relativistic effective field theory of dark matter-nucleon interactions, making use of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information divergence to measure the deviation of the true dark matter velocity distribution from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form. This approach quantifies how astrophysical uncertainties affect each operator in the effective theory, without assuming any specific functional form for the velocity distribution. While for some operators the uncertainties are smaller than one order of magnitude for entropically-motivated deviations from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form, for other operators these uncertainties can be as large as three orders of magnitude near threshold. Furthermore, we identify the dependence of the scattering rate for various operators of the effective theory with different velocity-weighted moments of the velocity distribution, functionally analogous to the mean, variance, or skewness. This provides new analytic insight into which features of the velocity distribution are most relevant to detect a given particle dark matter model. Our technique is general and could be applied to a broader class of physics problems where a physical observable depends on the statistical moments of an uncertain theoretical distribution.</description>

      <title>Dipole Radiation and Kinetic Mixing from Dark Photon Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave-like dark matter composed of spin-1 particles, known as dark photons, is theorized to form clumps called "vector solitons". These solitons are compact astrophysical objects that exhibit coherent oscillations and a high concentration relative to the local dark matter density. A significant portion of dark matter in galactic halos today may consist of these solitons. This study explores how photons can be produced from these vector solitons by the influence of external electromagnetic fields or charge densities, via a dimension-6 dark photon-photon coupling and a kinetic mixing, respectively. We further explore the astrophysical implications of these phenomena, highlighting a novel avenue for dark matter discovery that our research provides.</description>

      <title>Achieving Full Coverage of the SME Minimal Matter Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing experiments and data sets can be leveraged to obtain additional sensitivities to Lorentz violation, beyond those originally sought, through a more precise consideration of the boost of the experiment through the background. In fact, access to the full coefficient space of the flat-spacetime single-fermion limit of the minimal matter sector of the Standard-Model Extension can be obtained. In this work we present this coverage for a sample particle in the context of a simplified model of Earth's motion.</description>

      <title>A Penning trap single-photon counter for axion detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering the microscopic composition of dark matter is one of the most important open problems in physics today. Axions are a leading candidate to be dark matter; however, a search of the full range of all likely axion masses is hampered by the standard quantum noise limit. This makes haloscope searches for axions with masses above 0.1 meV unfeasible with current technologies. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new photon counting technique designed to operate at 30-60 GHz for detecting axions with masses between 0.124 meV and 0.248 meV, based on a single electron in a Penning trap. The electron cyclotron mode absorbs microwave photons, and, via the continuous Stern-Gerlach effect, this absorption imparts a measurable phase shift onto the axial motion. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze this photon detection method. We introduce a new type of fast, phase-sensitive axial detection technique, using axial-magnetron parametric amplification to overcome detector Johnson noise and cancel associated frequency shifts. This method may find other applications in precision Penning trap frequency measurements. We compare the efficiency of the electron single-photon counter with an ideal device, and find that our proposed photon counter has sufficient performance to search for high mass axions.</description>

      <title>$J/\psi$ Production Within Jets at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical predictions for the transverse-momentum distribution of $J/\psi$ produced within jets at the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). Utilizing the semi-inclusive fragmenting jet function (FJF) framework, our calculation achieves next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in the strong coupling and leading-logarithmic (LL) accuracy by resumming both collinear and threshold logarithms. In contrast to the gluon-dominated regime of the LHC, EIC photoproduction is characterized by an enhanced quark-initiated component, offering a complementary probe into the charmonium production mechanism governed by nonperturbative long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs). We examine the impact of representative LDME sets, demonstrating the EIC's distinct discriminating power for the mechanisms. We find that quark contributions are particularly significant in the small momentum fraction region. This region is also shown to be sensitive to both the jet radius $R$ and the experimental muon identification criteria for the $J/\psi \to \mu^+\mu^-$ decay channel. These findings establish quarkonium-in-jet observables at the EIC as a vital, independent probe for constraining the production mechanisms and advancing our understanding of heavy quarkonium formation.</description>

      <title>Analytical description of the distributions of primary and secondary cosmogenic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an analytical description of the energy distributions of primary and secondary cosmogenic particles on Earth in terms of parameters having clear physical meaning. A modified power law is assumed for energy distributions, incorporating terms such as energy loss/decay, which are effective at low energies, and a source term, which is dominant at high energies. The parametrizations of the momentum distribution of primary protons and helium have been obtained including energy loss term. For muons, both the energy loss and decay terms have been included. It is shown analytically that zenith angle distributions is given by $\cos^{n-1}\theta$ in terms of energy index $n$ and the presence of decay term does not affect it. The analytical function describes the muon momentum distribution data at different altitudes and zenith angles. The same form is also applied to describe the atmospheric muon and electron-type neutrino distributions simulated at various sites. The presented analytical functions provide an excellent description of all kinds of cosmogenic particles.</description>

      <title>The Hadronization Impact on $J/\psi$ Energy Correlators: A Pythia8 Study from Partonic to Hadronic Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive study of the $J/\psi$ energy correlator as a probe of non-perturbative hadronization in color-octet $c\bar{c}$ production is performed. The energy correlator measures the energy flow as a function of the angular distance ($\chi$) from the identified $J/\psi$ meson. Using the PYTHIA 8 Monte Carlo event generator, the correlator is computed at both parton and hadron levels. At high $J/\psi$ transverse momentum ($p_T &gt; 7\ \text{GeV}/c$), the parton-level correlator in the $\cos\chi &gt; 0$ region is dominated by soft gluon emission during the hadronization of the color-octet state, a contribution clearly distinguishable from other partonic sources, such as underlying multi-parton interactions. The transition to the hadron level, however, introduces substantial modifications, suppressing the correlator in this region by approximately an order of magnitude and underscoring the complexity of the hadronization mapping. Further analysis reveals that the hadron-level observable exhibits notable sensitivity to model parameters: increasing the mass splitting between colored $c\bar{c}$ pre-resonances and the $J/\psi$ meson from 0.2 to 0.8 GeV/$c^{2}$ enhances the correlator by up to $60\%$, while extending the color reconnection range yields a milder enhancement of about $10\%$. These findings demonstrate that precise measurements of the hadron level $J/\psi$ energy correlator, when interpreted within robust event-generator frameworks, can provide novel constraints on hadronization dynamics and help clarify the production mechanisms of $J/\psi$ state.</description>

      <title>Towards Accurate Gravitational Wave Predictions: Gauge-Invariant Nucleation in the Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vacuum decay in the early Universe should be gauge-invariant. In this work, we study the gauge dependence of the vacuum decay occurring through a first-order phase transition and the associated gravitational wave production. We investigate the gauge dependence of the bubble nucleation and phase transition parameters within the framework of the Standard model effective field theory in three dimension. By considering the power-counting and utilizing the Nielsen identity at finite temperature, we show that, depending on the power-counting scheme favored by the new physics scale, the perturbative computation methodology allow we get the gauge-independent nucleation rates and phase transition, this enables more accurate predictions of gravitational wave signatures.</description>

      <title>Near-threshold heavy quarkonium photoproduction in a light-front spectator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near-threshold photo- and electroproduction of heavy vector quarkonia off the proton provides direct access to its gluonic structure. In particular, the cross section for $J/\Psi$ photoproduction near threshold is governed by the proton's gluon gravitational form factors (GFFs). In this work, we employ the generalized parton distribution framework together with gluon GFFs calculated in a light-front gluon-spectator model inspired by soft-wall AdS/QCD to predict both the differential and total cross sections for near-threshold $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$ photoproductions. Our results for $J/\Psi$ photoproduction show good agreement with recent experimental data from the $J/\Psi$-007 and GlueX Collaborations at Jefferson Lab, as well as with earlier measurements from SLAC and Cornell.</description>

      <title>Dispersive description of the $K \to \pi \ell^+ \ell^-$ radiative amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a description of the $K^+$, $K_S$ radiative decay form factors $W_+$, $W_S$ based on general properties of analyticity and unitarity. Starting from the simple consideration of the asymptotic behaviour of the two combinations $2W_+-W_S$ and $W_+ +W_S$ we derive a dispersive representation involving only two parameters. Using the rich experimental information on the $K\to3\pi$ amplitudes, extended beyond the low energy region using the Khuri-Treiman formalism, we show that the sign of the $W_+$ form factor is unambiguously determined and its energy dependence can be well reproduced. We also show that the yet unknown $\Delta{I}=1/2$ part of the $K_S \to \pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ can be determined from the value of $W_+(0)+W_S(0)$. The possibility of fixing the sign of $W_S$ from experiment is discussed.</description>

      <title>Naturally small Dirac neutrino mass and $B-L$ dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the conventional gauged ${B-L}$ extension of the standard model, the $B-L$ charge of the singlet scalar $\chi$, responsible for the breaking of $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, is taken to be 2 such that it can anchor type-I seesaw by giving Majorana masses to the right-handed neutrinos, $\nu_R$. In this paper, we consider instead the cases $\chi \sim 3$ or 4 under $B-L$, so that $\nu_R$ may not acquire any Majorana mass and neutrinos are Dirac fermions. We then consider a vector-like fermion $S$ with 2 units of $B-L$ charge, which becomes a good candidate for dark matter, either Dirac for $\chi \sim 3$ or Majorana for $\chi \sim 4$. In both cases, spontaneous $B-L$ breaking can induce a strong first-order phase transition, producing stochastic gravitational waves (GW) which can be tested at GW experiments. Moreover, the presence of light $\nu_R$s gives rise to an additional contribution to the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta{N}_{\rm eff}$, providing complementary constraints from current and upcoming CMB observations.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are theorized to form from the collapse of overdensities in the very early Universe. PBHs in the asteroid-mass range $10^{17} \, {\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$ could serve as all or most of the dark matter today, but are particularly difficult to detect due to their modest rates of Hawking emission and sub-micron Schwarzschild radii. We consider whether the steep gradients of a PBH's gravitational field could generate tidal forces strong enough to disrupt atoms and nuclei. Such phenomena may yield new observables that could uniquely distinguish a PBH from a macroscopic object of the same mass. We first consider the gravitational ionization of ambient neutral hydrogen and evaluate prospects for detecting photon radiation from the recombination of ionized atoms. During the present epoch, this effect would be swamped by Hawking radiation -- which would itself be difficult to detect for PBHs at the upper end of the asteroid-mass window. We then consider the gravitational ionization and heating of neutral hydrogen immediately following recombination at $z\simeq1090$, and identify a broad class of PBH distributions with typical mass $5\times10^{21}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23}\, {\rm g}$ within which gravitational interactions would have been the dominant form of energy deposition to the medium. We also identify conditions under which tidal forces from a transiting PBH could overcome the strong nuclear force, either by dissociating deuterons, which would be relevant during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), or by inducing fission of heavy nuclei. We find that gravitational dissociation of deuterons dominates photodissociation rates due to Hawking radiation for PBHs with masses $10^{14}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$. We additionally identify the phenomenon of gravitationally induced fission of heavy nuclei via tidal deformation.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating Dark Photon Halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for the generation of gravitationally bound dark photon halos during the matter-dominated era. Coupled to an ultralight axion field through a parity-violating Chern-Simons term, dark photons can be produced by the tachyonic instability of axion coherent oscillation. The dark photons with a net helicity lead to a metric vorticity and can generate chiral substructures. For axion masses in the range $10^{-28} \, \mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-22} \, \mathrm{eV}$, the resulting inhomogeneities collapse to form halos with masses spanning $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$ to $10^{11} \, M_{\odot}$, with halo sizes ranging from $O(1)$ to $O(10^{6}) \, \mathrm{pc}$. During halo collapse, the induced vorticity could mediate efficient angular-momentum transport, which enables monolithic collapse and provides primordial seeds for the early formation of supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>First comments on a descoped/staged FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to its remit, the European Strategy Group (ESG) recommended the electron-positron Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee) as the preferred option for the next flagship collider at CERN; and a descoped FCC-ee as the preferred alternative option (with reduced synchrotron radiation (SR) power, without a run at the $\rm t \bar t$ threshold, and with only two interaction regions) in the event that the preferred option turns out not to be feasible. Upon request of the ESG, a basic comparison of the physics potential of the descoped option with that of the baseline version is presented in this short note. Our first observations about the alternative proposal of a descoped FCC-ee are that (i) the same performance as the baseline, apart from $\rm t \bar t$-run related, is achieved with the longer proposed period of operation; and (ii) the top run remains essential, but can be staged at a later date. The full appraisal of the consequences of descoping and a proposal for the best way to integrate possible staging wherever feasible, and possible improvements, will need further joint studies by the physics and accelerator groups.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe and may account for all or part of the dark matter. In this review, we summarize the current observational constraints on PBHs across the full mass range, highlight potential evidence for their existence, and outline the prospects for future searches, particularly with gravitational-wave observatories. We also discuss different PBH formation scenarios, identify the corresponding mass functions, and present the observational constraints in each case.</description>

      <title>Update on non-unitary mixing in the recent NO$\nu$A and T2K data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have tested the non-unitary mixing hypothesis with the latest data from NO$\nu$A and T2K experiments. We have also analysed their combined data. We have provided the best-fit values of the standard and non standard parameters after the analysis. $90\%$ limits on the non-unitary mixing parameters have also been provided. The constraints on unitary violation is stronger, compared to the constraints obtained from previous data from NO$\nu$A and T2K. The tension between NO$\nu$A and T2K at the $1\,\sigma$ for normal mass hierarchy can be reduced for non-unitary mixing due to $\alpha_{10}$, albeit for a value of $|\alpha_{10}|$ larger than the present global $90\%$ limit. Additionally a study of the future sensitivity of NO$\nu$A, T2K and DUNE has been provided.</description>

      <title>A universal bound on the duration of a kination era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that primordial adiabatic curvature fluctuations generate an instability of the scalar field sourcing a kination era. We demonstrate that the generated higher Fourier modes constitute a radiation-like component dominating over the kination background after about $11$ e-folds of cosmic expansion. Current constraints on the extra number of neutrino flavors $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ thus imply the observational bound of approximately 10 e-folds, representing the most stringent bound to date on the stiffness of the equation of state of the pre-Big-Bang-Nucleosynthesis universe.</description>

      <title>New Source for QCD Axion Dark Matter Production: Curvature Induced</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a novel mechanism for generating dark matter from a fast-rolling scalar field, relevant for both inflation and rotating axion models, and apply it specifically to the (QCD) axion. Dark matter comes from scalar field fluctuations generated by the product of the curvature perturbation and the fast-rolling background field. These fluctuations can explain the totality of dark matter in a vast axion parameter space, particularly for the QCD axion, which will be targeted by upcoming experiments. We review the constraints on this mechanism and potential gravitational-wave signatures.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter in an Evanescent Three-Brane Randall-Sundrum Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Apart from its gravitational interactions, dark matter (DM) has remained so far elusive in laboratory searches. One possible explanation is that the relevant interactions to explain its relic abundance are mainly gravitational. In this work we consider an extradimensional Randall-Sundrum scenario with a TeV-PeV IR brane, where the Standard Model is located, and a GeV-TeV deep IR (DIR) one, where the DM lies. When the curvatures of the bulk to the left and right of the IR brane are very similar, the tension of the IR brane is significantly smaller than that of the other two branes, and therefore we term it \evanescent". In this setup, the relic abundance of DM arises from the freezeout mechanism, thanks to DM annihilations into radions and gravitons. Focusing on a scalar singlet DM candidate, we compute and apply current and future constraints from direct, indirect and collider-based searches. Our findings demonstrate the viability of this scenario and highlight its potential testability in upcoming experiments. We also discuss the possibility of inferring the number of branes if the radion and several Kaluza-Klein graviton resonances are detected at a future collider.</description>

      <title>On the Standard Model Mass Spectrum and Interactions In the Holomorphic Unified Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02747v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified, ultraviolet-finite framework for the full Standard Model particle mass spectrum based on the Holomorphic Unified Field Theory augmented by nonlocal entire-function regulators. Starting from a single holomorphic action on the complexified spacetime manifold \( M^4_{\mathbb{C}} \), with a Hermitian metric unifying gravity, gauge, and matter sectors, we embed exponential regulator insertions to render all loop integrals finite without breaking gauge or diffeomorphism invariance. After spontaneous breaking of the electroweak and grand unified symmetries, analytic expressions for the charged lepton, quark, and neutrino mass matrices are derived in terms of holomorphic Yukawa textures and regulator form factors. A minimal Froggatt-Nielsen flavon sector fixes all \( \mathcal{O}(1) \) coefficients in terms of two continuous inputs. Regulator-suppressed one- and two-loop renormalization group evolution then yields predictions for all fermion masses, CKM and PMNS mixing angles, \( W \) and \( Z \) boson masses, and the Higgs boson mass and self-couplings. Finally, under a mild set of geometric and topological assumptions, we show that gauge coupling unification, three chiral families, hypercharge quantization, and the shape of the Higgs potential are genuine predictions of the holomorphic nonlocal framework.</description>

      <title>Charge dependence of mesons with flavored contact-interaction couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective interaction models of quantum chromodynamics, based on quark degrees of freedom, have been successfully employed to compute the properties of a large array of ground and excited meson and baryon states, along with their electromagnetic form factors, distribution functions and thermal behavior. Amongst them, the contact-interaction model, while non-renormalizable, implements confinement, satisfies Lorentz covariance and correctly describes chiral symmetry and its dynamical breaking pattern. Original studies focused on the light hadron sector in the isospin limit and were thereafter extended to heavy mesons and baryons. The strong effective couplings, as well as infrared and ultraviolet regulators, are flavor-dependent model parameters adjusted to reproduce hadronic observables. In contrast, in this study we combine SU(4) flavor-symmetry breaking couplings, obtained from one-loop vacuum polarization amplitudes in the presence of background constituent quark currents, with the contact-interaction model. This allows us to reduce the number of mass-dimensioned parameters and to consistently relate all flavored couplings to a single mass scale, while the masses and weak decay constants of the pions, kaons, $D$ and $D_s$ mesons are in good agreement with average reference values. Allowing for realistic isospin breaking, $m_d/m_u = 1.7$, in conjunction with the effect of the flavored couplings, leads to a mass splitting, $m_{\pi^+}- m_{\pi^0} \approx 0.3$ MeV, that agrees with lattice QCD values. For the kaons, the mass difference is $m_{K^0}- m_{K^\pm} \approx 2.3$ MeV, whereas $m_{D^\pm} - m_{D^0} \approx 0.5$ MeV and the $\eta_c$ is 6\% lighter than the experimental mass.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the nature of $X(2300)$ with the PACIAE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the BESIII newest observation of an axial-vector particle $X(2300)$ in the $\psi(3686)\rightarrow \phi\eta \eta'$ process, we simulate its production in $e^+e^-$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=4.95$ GeV using the parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE 4.0. In this model, the final partonic state (FPS) and hadronic state (FHS) are simulated and recorded sequentially. We propose, for the first time, that $X(2300)$ could be a $q\bar{q}s\bar{s}$ ($q=u/d$) state or a hadro-strangeonium state, i.e., a bound system of a strangeonium and a light hadron. The excited strangeonium candidate is formed by coalescing an $s\bar{s}$ quark pair in the FPS with the quantum statistical mechanics inspired dynamically constrained phase-space coalescence model. The tetraquark candidates of $q\bar{q}s\bar{s}$ and $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ are similarly produced by coalescing four constituent quarks in the FPS. In contrast, a hadro-strangeonium candidate emerges from the recombination of the constituent $\phi$ and $\eta/\eta$ in the FHS. We then calculate the $X(2300)$'s orbital angular momentum quantum number in its rest frame and perform the spectral classification for each of the above candidates. Given its quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$, $X(2300)$ is identified as a $P$-wave $s\bar{s}$, an $S$-wave $q\bar{q}s\bar{s}/ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ or $S$-wave $\phi\eta'/\phi \eta$ candidate. For the first time, we estimate the production rates for these configurations. The $P$-wave $s\bar{s}$ and $S$-wave $q\bar{q}s\bar{s}$ states are produced at rates on the order of $10^{-5}$, whereas the $S$-wave $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ and $\phi\eta'/\phi \eta$ states appear at rates on the order of $10^{-6}$. Moreover, significant discrepancies are observed in the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions among different candidates. These discrepancies could be served as valuable criteria for deciphering the nature of $X(2300)$.</description>

Abstract: The rise of foundation models -- large, pretrained machine learning models that can be finetuned to a variety of tasks -- has revolutionized the fields of natural language processing and computer vision. In high-energy physics, the question of whether these models can be implemented directly in physics research, or even built from scratch, tailored for particle physics data, has generated an increasing amount of attention. This review, which is the first on the topic of foundation models in high-energy physics, summarizes and discusses the research that has been published in the field so far.</description>

      <title>Interactions of the deuteron with a hadronic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interactions of the deuteron with light mesons during the hadronic phase in heavy-ion collisions. We treat the deuteron as a weakly bound state and employ the quasi-free approximation to describe the $d\pi$ interaction. The underlying elementary $N\pi$ amplitudes are described by a hybrid effective model, combining the non-resonant background from chiral perturbation theory with resonant contributions via Breit-Wigner parameterizations. These amplitudes are used to calculate the vacuum and thermally-averaged cross-sections for deuteron dissociation and production, namely, $d + \pi \rightarrow N + N' + \pi$ and the corresponding inverse reaction. We then use these cross sections in a rate equation to estimate the time evolution of the deuteron multiplicity. For the initial conditions we consider two models: the statistical hadronization model and the coalescence model, where the deuteron is treated as a hadronic molecule. Our findings suggest that the final deuteron yield does not retain a memory of its initial production mechanism.</description>

      <title>Searches for heavy neutrinos at a 3 TeV CLIC in fat jet final states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy Majorana neutrinos ($N$) are predicted in many models of physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we explore the production and detection prospects of TeV-scale heavy neutrinos ($m_N \gtrsim 1$ TeV) at a future 3 TeV Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). We focus on two distinct decay topologies: (i) $N \to \ell^{\pm} W^{\mp}$ with hadronic $W$ boson decay, leading to a final state with one charged lepton and a hadronic fat-jet $J_W$; and (ii) $N \to \nu h$ with subsequent Higgs decay $h \to b\bar{b}$, yielding a Higgs-tagged fat-jet $J_h$ and $\slashed{E}_T$. Based on comprehensive detector-level simulations and background analysis, we present both $2\sigma$ exclusion limits and $5\sigma$ discovery reaches in the $m_N$-$|V_{\ell N}|^2$ plane. We further extract 95\% confidence level upper limits on the mixing parameter $|V_{\ell N}|^2$, and perform a detailed comparison with existing constraints from direct searches at future colliders and indirect global fits. Our findings demonstrate that a 3 TeV CLIC can improve the sensitivity to $|V_{\ell N}|^2$ by about two orders of magnitude compared to the projected reaches of future hadron colliders, while remaining competitive with other CLIC search channels.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb Z_2$-Stable Dark Matter via Broken $\text{SU}(5)$ Gauge Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$. An exact $\mathbb Z_2$ renders the dark matter stable. I give a gauge-covariant definition of projectors onto the unbroken Standard Model and broken ($X,Y$) subspaces, demonstrate that the covariant derivative of dark matter selects only $X,Y$, and integrate out $X,Y$ at tree level to obtain the leading effective operators. I also derive the loop-induced $\chi^2\,G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}$ coupling to gluons, prove color neutrality, and show consistency with cold dark matter phenomenology. Cosmological production proceeds via UV freeze-in or even more suppressed channels in.</description>

      <title>ALP-mediated Dark Matter-Nucleon Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of dark matter-nucleon scattering via the exchange of axion-like particles (ALPs). At first sight, this might appear of little practical use, as non-relativistic scattering through pseudo-scalar interactions is momentum-suppressed and spin-dependent, resulting in scattering rates below any experimental sensitivity. We show that the scattering rate can be drastically enhanced in two ways. First, light ALPs with masses below the typical momentum transfer at direct detection experiments lift the momentum suppression by acting as essentially massless mediators. Second, ALP exchange through loops induces coherent spin-independent scattering. If the ALP has flavor-changing couplings to up-type quarks, loop-induced scattering receives an extra strong enhancement by the top-quark mass. We deduce that, contrary to common lore, XENONnT and PandaX-4T are already sensitive to ALP-mediated dark matter-nucleon scattering. The next generation of direct detection experiments will probe far into the parameter space of the ALP effective theory, potentially exceeding the sensitivity of collider searches.</description>

      <title>Notes on Magnetic Monopoles from Partial Electromagnetic Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel partial electromagnetic duality and construct its consistent realization using an extended gauge group $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{q}}^{}\otimes\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{d}}^{}$ over a localized space region, where $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{q}}^{}$ is the conventional gauge group of QED and $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{d}}^{}$ serves as its dual gauge group. In this framework, the "electric" charge associated with $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{d}}^{}$ plays the role of the magnetic (monopole) charge in QED $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{q}}^{}$, whereas the electric charge of $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{q}}^{}$ is reinterpreted as the "magnetic" charge of $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{d}}^{}$. Importantly, our theory preserves the exact Bianchi identity, as it provides a genuinely singularity-free and stringless formulation that involves only electric charges under each U(1) gauge group. We show that the two gauge sectors, $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{q}}^{}$ and $\mathrm{U}(1)_{\mathrm{d}}^{}$, exhibit a partial duality within a localized region of space. Based on this consistent formulation, we present the first fully gauge-invariant computation of scattering amplitudes and cross sections for monopole production processes, including $\mathrm{e}^-\mathrm{e}^+\rightarrow\chi\chi^*$ and $\mathrm{e}^-\mathrm{e}^+\rightarrow\chi\bar{\chi}$.</description>

      <title>A solution to the S8 tension through neutrino-dark matter interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos and dark matter (DM) are two of the least understood components of the Universe, yet both play crucial roles in cosmic evolution. Clues about their fundamental properties may emerge from discrepancies in cosmological measurements across different epochs of cosmic history. Possible interactions between them could leave distinctive imprints on cosmological observables, offering a rare window into dark sector physics beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework. We present compelling evidence that DM-neutrino interactions can resolve the persistent structure growth parameter discrepancy, $S_8 = \sigma_8\,\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$, between early and late universe observations. By incorporating cosmic shear measurements from current Weak Lensing surveys, we demonstrate that an interaction strength of $u \sim 10^{-4}$ not only provides a coherent explanation for the high-multipole observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (\texttt{ACT}), but also alleviates the $S_8$ discrepancy. Combining early universe constraints with \texttt{DES Y3 cosmic shear} data yields a nearly $3\sigma$ preference for non-zero DM neutrino interactions. This strengthens previous observational claims and provides a clear path toward a significant breakthrough in cosmological research. Our findings challenge the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm and highlight the potential of future large-scale structure surveys, which can rigorously test this interaction and unveil the fundamental properties of DM.</description>

      <title>Testing the Shock-cooling Emission Model from Star-disk Collisions for Quasi-periodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12762v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), the repeated outbursts observed in soft X-ray bands, have attracted broad interest, but their physical origin is under debate. One of the popular models, the star-disk collision model, suggests that QPEs can be produced through periodic collisions of an orbiting star with the accretion disk of a central black hole (BH). However, previous tests of the star-disk collision model mainly focus on the timing analysis. Other observed properties, such as peak luminosities $L_{\rm{p}}$, durations $t_{\rm{e}}$, and radiation temperatures $T_{\rm{p}}$ of the eruptions, are not systematically investigated. For a sample of six QPE sources and two QPE-like sources, we test the shock-cooling emission model from star-disk collisions by using these observables to derive the constraints on the stellar radius $R_\star$. We find that, except for two sources (eRo-QPE3 and eRo-QPE4), the rest of the sample either has no allowed $R_\star$ to simultaneously reproduce the observed $L_{\rm{p}}$ and $t_{\rm{e}}$, or the required $R_\star$ is too large to avoid being disrupted by the central BH. For the two exceptions, a stellar radius of the order of $1\ R_{\rm{\odot}}$ is necessary to satisfy all the constraints. Another issue with the simplest version of this model is that it predicts $k T_{\rm{p}} \sim 10\ \rm{eV}$, one order of magnitude lower than the observed value.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Fermion-Rotor System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of the fermion-rotor system, a simple impurity model in d=1+1 dimensions that consists of a collection of purely right-moving fermions interacting with a quantum mechanical rotor localised at the origin. This was first introduced by Polchinski as a toy model for monopole-fermion scattering and is surprisingly subtle, with ingoing and outgoing fermions carrying different quantum numbers. We show that the rotor acts as a twist operator in the low-energy theory, changing the quantum numbers of excitations that have previously passed through the origin to ensure scattering consistent with all symmetries.
  We further show how generalisations of this model with multiple rotors and unequal charges can be viewed as a UV-completion of boundary states for chiral theories, including the well-studied 3450 model. We compute correlation functions between ingoing and outgoing fermions and show that fermions dressed with the rotor degree of freedom act as local operators and create single-particle states, generalising an earlier result obtained in a theory with a single rotor and equal charges. Finally, we point out a mod 2 anomaly in these models that descends from the Witten anomaly in 4d</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Truncation Framework for Gauge Theories on the Interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate gauge theories in two dimensions nonperturbatively using the Hamiltonian truncation approach. Working on a spatial interval and adopting the axial gauge, we remove all gauge field degrees of freedom and express the interacting Hamiltonian in the eigenbasis of the free Dirac theory, truncated at a finite energy. As a benchmark we analyse the Schwinger model, where our numerical spectra agree closely with the exact results from bosonization across a wide range of couplings, validating the construction of the Hamiltonian. We then generalize the formulation to nonabelian gauge groups and apply it to SU(3) gauge theory with a single massless Dirac fermion. These results demonstrate that gauge theories can be explored nonperturbatively using a truncated Hamiltonian that generates evolutions in ordinary time, offering a complementary alternative to lattice field theory.</description>

      <title>Locality constraints in AdS$_2$ without parity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20749v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study bulk locality constraints in quantum field theories in AdS$_2$. The known derivation of locality sum rules in AdS$_{d+1}$ does not apply for $d=1$ due to the different singularity structure of the conformal blocks and the inequivalence of operator orderings on the boundary. Assuming unitarity and a mild growth condition, we establish power-law bounds for correlators, derive dispersion relations and an expansion in terms of ``even'' and ``odd'' local blocks that converges in the entire AdS$_2$. These yield two novel families of symmetric and antisymmetric locality sum rules. We test these sum rules explicitly in the free scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of Feynman-integral geometries at two loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the Feynman-integral geometries at two-loop order in four-dimensional Quantum Field Theory with standard quadratic propagators. Concretely, we consider a finite basis of integrals in the 't Hooft--Veltman scheme, i.e. with $D$-dimensional loop momenta and four-dimensional external momenta, which belong to 79 independent topologies, or sectors. Then, we analyze the leading singularities of the integrals in those sectors for generic values of the masses and momenta, using the loop-by-loop Baikov representation. Aside from the Riemann sphere, we find that elliptic curves, hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 and 3 as well as K3 surfaces occur. Moreover, we find a smooth and non-degenerate Del Pezzo surface of degree 2, a particular Fano variety known to be rationalizable, resulting in a curve of geometric genus 3. These geometries determine the space of functions relevant for Quantum Field Theories at two-loop order, including in the Standard Model.</description>
