      <title>LHC EFT WG Note: Basis for Anomalous Quartic Gauge Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we give a definitive basis for the dimension-eight operators leading to quartic -- but no cubic -- interactions among electroweak gauge bosons. These are often called anomalous quartic gauge couplings, or aQGCs. We distinguish in particular the CP-even ones from their CP-odd counterparts.</description>

      <title>New Physics Through Flavor Tagging at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging recent advancements in machine learning-based flavor tagging, we develop an optimal analysis for measuring the hadronic cross-section ratios $R_b$, $R_c$, and $R_s$ at the FCC-ee during its $WW$, $Zh$, and $t\bar{t}$ runs. Our results indicate up to a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in precision, providing an unprecedented test of the SM. Using these observables, along with $R_\ell$ and $R_t$, we project sensitivity to flavor non-universal four-fermion (4F) interactions within the SMEFT, contributing both at the tree level and through the renormalization group (RG). We highlight a subtle complementarity with RG-induced effects at the FCC-ee's $Z$-pole. Our analysis demonstrates significant improvements over the current LEP-II and LHC bounds in probing flavor-conserving 4F operators involving heavy quark flavors and all lepton flavors. As an application, we explore simplified models addressing current $B$-meson anomalies, demonstrating that FCC-ee can effectively probe the relevant parameter space. Finally, we design optimized search strategies for quark flavor-violating 4F interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars have been recognized as optimal laboratories to probe axion properties. In the last decades there have been significant advances in this field due to a better modelling of stellar systems and accurate observational data. In this work we review the current status of constraints on axions from stellar physics. We focus in particular on the Sun, globular cluster stars, white dwarfs and (proto)-neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Generative Unfolding with Distribution Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning enables unbinned, highly-differential cross section measurements. A recent idea uses generative models to morph a starting simulation into the unfolded data. We show how to extend two morphing techniques, Schr\"odinger Bridges and Direct Diffusion, in order to ensure that the models learn the correct conditional probabilities. This brings distribution mapping to a similar level of accuracy as the state-of-the-art conditional generative unfolding methods. Numerical results are presented with a standard benchmark dataset of single jet substructure as well as for a new dataset describing a 22-dimensional phase space of Z + 2-jets.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Thermal Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review article provides the basics and discusses some important applications of thermal field theory, namely the combination of statistical mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory. In a first part the fundamentals are covered: the density matrix, the corresponding averages and the treatment of fields of various spin in a medium. A second part is dedicated to the computation of thermal Green's function for scalars, vectors and fermions with path-integral methods. These functions play a crucial role in thermal field theory, as explained here. A more applicative part of the review is dedicated to the production of particles in a medium and to phase transitions in field theory, including the process of vacuum decay in a general theory featuring a first-order phase transition. To understand this review, the reader should only have a good knowledge of non-statistical quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Limits on Kaluza-Klein Portal Dark Matter Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the phenomenology of dark-matter (DM) scenarios within radius-stabilized Randall-Sundrum models. Specifically, we consider models where the dark matter candidates are Standard Model (SM) singlets confined to the TeV brane and interact with the SM via spin-2 and spin-0 gravitational Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes. We compute the thermal relic density of DM particles in these models by applying recent work showing that scattering amplitudes of massive spin-2 KK states involve an intricate cancellation between various diagrams. Considering the resulting DM abundance, collider searches, and the absence of a signal in direct DM detection experiments, we show that spin-2 KK portal DM models are highly constrained. We confirm that within the usual thermal freeze-out scenario, scalar dark matter models are essentially ruled out. In contrast, we show that fermion and vector dark matter models are viable in a region of parameter space in which dark matter annihilation through a KK graviton is resonant. Specifically, vector models are viable for dark matter masses ranging from 1.1 TeV to 5.5 TeV for theories in which the scale of couplings of the KK modes is of order 40 TeV or lower. Fermion dark matter models are viable for a similar mass region, but only for KK coupling scales of order 20 TeV. In this work, we provide a complete description of the calculations needed to arrive at these results and, in an appendix, a discussion of new KK-graviton couplings needed for the computations, which have not previously been discussed in the literature. Here, we focus on models in which the radion is light, and the back-reaction of the radion stabilization dynamics on the gravitational background can be neglected. The phenomenology of a model with a heavy radion and the consideration of the effects of the radion stabilization dynamics on the DM abundance are being addressed in forthcoming work.</description>

      <title>The Dark HyperCharge Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of $U(1)_X$ symmetries where all Standard Model fermions are "chiral", i.e. the left and right-handed components have different charges under the $U(1)_X$ symmetry. Gauge anomaly cancellation is achieved by introducing three Standard Model gauge singlet dark fermions ($f^i$; $i=1,2,3$) charged under this symmetry. We systematically present chiral solutions for cases in which (a) one, (b) two, or (c) all three generations of Standard Model fermions are charged under the $U(1)_X$ symmetry. The $U(1)_X$ charges of these dark fermions are uniquely determined by anomaly cancellation conditions. These new fermions belong to the dark sector, with the lightest of them being a good dark matter candidate. Additionally, the $Z'$ gauge boson mediates interactions between the dark and visible sectors, and we call this $U(1)_X$ symmetry as the "Dark HyperCharge" symmetry. Using a benchmark model, we explore phenomenological implications in the heavy $Z'$ case ($M_{Z'} &gt; M_Z$), analyzing collider constraints and examining the lightest dark fermion's viability as dark matter. Our analysis shows that it satisfies all current DM constraints over a wide range of dark matter mass.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Interference between the Atmospheric and Solar Neutrino Oscillation Sub-Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interference between the atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillation sub-amplitudes is said to be responsible for CP violation (CPV) in neutrino appearance channels. More precisely, CPV is generated by the interference between the parts of the neutrino oscillation amplitude which are CP even and CP odd: even or odd when the neutrino mixing matrix is replaced with its complex conjugate. This is the CPV interference term, as it gives a contribution to the oscillation probability, the square of the amplitude, which is opposite in sign for neutrinos and anti-neutrinos and is unique. For this interference to be non-zero, at least two sub-amplitudes are required. There are, however, other interference terms, which are even under the above exchange, these are the CP conserving (CPC) interference terms. In this paper, we explore in detail these CPC interference terms and show that they cannot be uniquely defined, as one can move pieces of the amplitude from the atmospheric sub-amplitude to the solar sub-amplitude and vice versa. This freedom allows one to move the CPC interference terms around, but does not let you eliminate them completely. We also show that there is a reasonable definition of the atmospheric and solar sub-amplitudes for the appearance channels such that in neutrino disappearance probability there is no atmospheric-solar CPC interference term. However, with this choice, there is a CPC interference term within the atmospheric sector.</description>

      <title>Shedding Light on Evanescent Shadows -- Exploration of non-anticommuting $\gamma_5$ in Dimensional Regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mathematical consistency of the BMHV scheme of dimensional regularisation (DReg) comes at the cost of requiring symmetry-restoring counterterms to cancel the regularisation-induced breaking of gauge and BRST invariance. There is no unique way to extend a 4-dimensional theory to $D$ dimensions, and different choices can be made for the dimensionally regularised fermions, evanescent parts of their kinetic terms and evanescent gauge interactions. Here we present a detailed study of the impact of changing such evanescent details. We leverage this freedom to identify a particularly convenient formulation that simplifies practical calculations. In order to thoroughly study the available options, we focus on a general abelian chiral gauge theory including scalar fields and adopt a general approach to the BMHV implementation. This allows for specialisation to various models and different approaches, including those from the literature. Importantly, our model can be specialised to the abelian sector of the Standard Model (SM). Consequently, this article also serves as a roadmap for upcoming applications to the full SM.</description>

      <title>The Fundamental Limit of Jet Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the origin of high-energy hadronic jets ('jet tagging') has been a critical benchmark problem for machine learning in particle physics. Jets are ubiquitous at colliders and are complex objects that serve as prototypical examples of collections of particles to be categorized. Over the last decade, machine learning-based classifiers have replaced classical observables as the state of the art in jet tagging. Increasingly complex machine learning models are leading to increasingly more effective tagger performance. Our goal is to address the question of convergence -- are we getting close to the fundamental limit on jet tagging or is there still potential for computational, statistical, and physical insights for further improvements? We address this question using state-of-the-art generative models to create a realistic, synthetic dataset with a known jet tagging optimum. Various state-of-the-art taggers are deployed on this dataset, showing that there is a significant gap between their performance and the optimum. Our dataset and software are made public to provide a benchmark task for future developments in jet tagging and other areas of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Sketch of the resolution of the axial U(1) problem without chiral anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism which explains the masses of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ mesons without invoking the explicit violation of $U(1)_A$ symmetry by the chiral anomaly. It is shown that the U(1) problem, the problem for which the prediction of $\eta$ and $\eta'$ masses in the simple chiral perturbation theory largely deviates from the experimental values, is actually resolved by considering the first order contribution of the disconnected meson correlator with respect to the quark mass. The bound of Weinberg $m_\eta^2 \le 3 m_\pi^2$ is fulfilled by considering the negative squared mass of $\eta$ or $\eta'$ which is just the saddle point of the QCD effective potential, and 20% level agreements with experimental data are obtained by just fitting one low energy constant. We provide the leading chiral Lagrangian due to the disconnected contribution in 3-flavor QCD, and also discuss the 2- and 4-flavor cases as well as the consistency of our mechanism with the chiral restoration at high temperature found in lattice calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the electroweak symmetry breaking in a five dimensional $Sp(6)$ gauge-Higgs unification model where the weak mixing angle is predicted to be $\sin^2 \theta_W=1/4$ at the compactification scale. We find that the correct pattern of electroweak symmetry breaking and a viable Higgs mass are realized by introducing a 4-rank totally symmetric representation and several adjoint fermions additionally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the decay processes of $B\rightarrow \rho\eta$, $\rho\eta^{\prime}$ in perturbative QCD approach with a few improvements incorproated in it, where the contributions with large momentum transfer are calculated perturbatively, and the contributions with lower energy scale are treated by introuducing soft transition form factors. In addition, color-octet conributions are introduced which are essentially long-distance contributions. With resonanble input parameters selected, we find that the theoretical results of the branching ratios and $CP$ violations are all consistent with experimental data. We also predict some unmeasured quantities, which can be tested by experiment in the future.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and decay properties of the charmed mesons involving the coupled channel effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass spectrum of the charmed mesons is investigated by considering the coupled channel effects within the nonrelativistic potential model. The predicted masses of the charmed mesons are in agreement with experimental data. The strong decay properties are further analyzed within the $^3P_0$ model by using numerical wave functions obtained from nonrelativistic potential model. Based on the predicted masses and decay properties, we give a classification of the recently observed charmed states. Especially, we have effectively explained the masses and decay properties of the $D_1^*(2600)$ and $D_1^*(2760)$ by considering the $S$-$D$ mixing. Furthermore, the predicted masses and decay properties of the $2P$ wave states are helpful to search for them experimentally in future.</description>

      <title>Predicting New Above-Threshold Molecular States Via Triangular Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering that the experimentally observed molecular states are significantly fewer than those predicted theoretically, and that these states are traditionally classified as lying below thresholds while several candidates are found above them, we propose to broaden the definition of molecular states to include those that exist just above the thresholds. Identifying resonance peaks in invariant mass distributions and scattering cross-sections is crucial for probing these states, yet the mechanisms responsible for such enhancements remain unclear, complicating our understanding of new particle production. While the peaks linked to triangular singularities do not correspond to true hadronic states, the associated production mechanisms may provide valuable insight into the search for genuine hadrons. In this work, we propose employing the triangular singularity mechanism to theoretically investigate yet-to-be-observed molecular states, particularly those that could test heavy quark symmetry. We argue that these states may have true masses surpassing the thresholds of their constituent components, rather than being predicted to be below them by theoretical models. Our findings suggest the possible existence of 16 additional heavy quark molecular states, including $Y(4320)$, $Z(4430)$, and $\Upsilon(11020)$, which are posited to contain $D_1\bar{D}$, $D_1\bar{D}^{*}$, and $B_{s1}\bar{B}$ constituents, respectively. The recognition of these states would substantiate heavy quark symmetry and enhance our understanding of hadronic dynamics and molecular states formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos are neutral in the Standard Model, but they have tiny charge radii generated by radiative corrections. In theories Beyond the Standard Model, neutrinos can also have magnetic and electric moments and small electric charges (millicharges). We review the general theory of neutrino electromagnetic form factors, which reduce, for ultrarelativistic neutrinos and small momentum transfers, to the neutrino charges, effective charge radii, and effective magnetic moments. We discuss the phenomenology of these electromagnetic neutrino properties and we review the existing experimental bounds. We briefly review also the electromagnetic processes of astrophysical neutrinos and the neutrino magnetic moment portal in the presence of sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the new physics effects in semileptonic decay $\bar{B_s} \to K^{*+}(\to K\pi) \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$ induced by the $b \to u \ell \nu_{\ell}$ quark level transition. We consider the vector, axial vector, scalar, pseudoscalar and tensor new physics Lorentz structures in addition to the SM in effective field theory approach. New physics wilson coefficients are contrained by the available experimental measurements of leptonic and semileptonic decays of $B$ mesons induced by the same quark level transition $b \to u \ell \nu_{\ell}$. We explore the new physics effects in differential branching fraction, lepton forward-backward asymmetry and longitudinal polarization fraction of $K^*$ meson in $\bar{B_s} \to K^{*+}(\to K\pi) \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$ decay. In addition, we also provide the predictions for the integrated values of normalized angular obseravbles in different new physics scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Leptoquarks are known to generate a wide range of potentially observable phenomena, and have been searched for in different experiments. We show that the observed baryon asymmetry and neutrino mass scale can both be simultaneously produced in a model featuring scalar leptoquarks while avoiding existing experimental constraints and potentially leading to future observable signatures.</description>

      <title>Recent Developments in Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18234v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor (DHOST) theories are the most general scalar-tensor theories whose Lagrangian depends on the metric tensor and a single scalar field and its derivatives up to second order. They propagate only one scalar degree of freedom, without being plagued by Ostrogradsky instabilities. This is achieved through certain degeneracies of the functions forming their Lagrangian. They generalise the Horndeski and beyond-Horndeski theories. Originally proposed to describe the late-time acceleration of the expansion of the universe, generalising the cosmological constant, they can also be used to build models of the early universe, to describe inflation or alternatives to standard inflation. In the late universe, they modify the standard Vainstein screening mechanism from Horndeski theories (which can have observable consequences) and are suited to build black hole models, featuring non-stealth Kerr black hole solutions. In this work their phenomenology is reviewed, looking at their basic properties, their parameterisations and classifications, focusing on solutions in the early and the late universe and at cosmological and astrophysical constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The clustering dipole in the 2MASS galaxy survey converges on a scale of ~400Mpc to the local peculiar velocity inferred from the Cosmic-Microwave-Background dipole. I show that this limits the graviton mass in Yukawa theories of gravity to less than 5x10^{-32}eV. The new limit is 2.5x10^8 times tighter than the latest constraint from gravitational waves detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Simulations of Scattering in Scalar Field Theory on 120 Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of collisions of fundamental particles on a quantum computer are expected to have an exponential advantage over classical methods and promise to enhance searches for new physics. Furthermore, scattering in scalar field theory has been shown to be BQP-complete, making it a representative problem for which quantum computation is efficient. As a step toward large-scale quantum simulations of collision processes, scattering of wavepackets in one-dimensional scalar field theory is simulated using 120 qubits of IBM's Heron superconducting quantum computer ibm_fez. Variational circuits compressing vacuum preparation, wavepacket initialization, and time evolution are determined using classical resources. By leveraging physical properties of states in the theory, such as symmetries and locality, the variational quantum algorithm constructs scalable circuits that can be used to simulate arbitrarily-large system sizes. A new strategy is introduced to mitigate errors in quantum simulations, which enables the extraction of meaningful results from circuits with up to 4924 two-qubit gates and two-qubit gate depths of 103. The effect of interactions is clearly seen, and is found to be in agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations. The developments that will be necessary to simulate high-energy inelastic collisions on a quantum computer are discussed.</description>

      <title>Scattering of Quantum Particles in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes in maximally symmetric de Sitter spacetime with compact spatial dimensions. We describe quantum states by using the representation theory of de Sitter symmetry group and link the Hilbert space to geodesic observers. The positive and negative ``energy'' wavefunctions are uniquely determined by the requirement that in observer's neighborhood, short wavelengths propagate as plane waves with positive and negative frequencies, respectively. By following the same steps as in Minkowski spacetime, we show that the scattering amplitudes are given by a generalized Dyson's formula. Compared to the flat case, they describe the scattering of wavepackets with the frequency spectrum determined by geometry. The frequency spread shrinks as the masses and/or momenta become larger than the curvature scale. Asymptotically, de Sitter amplitudes agree with the amplitudes evaluated in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Constraining ultralight scalar dark matter couplings with the European Pulsar Timing Array second data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) offer an independent method for searching for ultralight dark matter (ULDM), whose wavelike nature induces periodic oscillations in the arrival times of radio pulses. In addition to this gravitational effect, the direct coupling between ULDM and ordinary matter results in pulsar spin fluctuations and reference clock shifts, leading to observable effects in PTAs. The second data release from the European PTA (EPTA) indicates that ULDM cannot account for all dark matter in the mass range $m_{\phi} \in [10^{-24.0}, 10^{-23.3}] \text{ eV}$ based solely on gravitational effects. In this work, we derive constraints on the coupling coefficients by considering both gravitational and coupling effects. Our results demonstrate that EPTA provides stronger constraints on these couplings than previous PTA experiments, and it establishes similar or even tighter constraints compared to other precise experiments, such as atomic clock experiments.</description>

      <title>Gauge theory for topological waves in continuum fluids with odd viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional continuum fluids with odd viscosity under a chiral body force. The chiral body force makes the low-energy excitation spectrum of the fluids gapped, and the odd viscosity allows us to introduce the first Chern number of each energy band in the fluids. Employing a mapping between hydrodynamic variables and U(1) gauge-field strengths, we derive a U(1) gauge theory for topologically nontrivial waves. The resulting U(1) gauge theory is given by the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory with an additional term associated with odd viscosity. We then solve the equations of motion for the gauge fields concretely in the presence of the boundary and find edge-mode solutions. We finally discuss the fate of bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC) in the context of continuum systems.</description>

      <title>Multivariate hypergeometric solutions of cosmological (dS) correlators by $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give the analytic expression for homogeneous part of solutions of arbitrary tree-level cosmological correlators, including massive propagators and time-derivative interactions cases. The solutions are given in the form of multivariate hypergeometric functions. It is achieved by two step. Firstly, we indicate the factorization of the homogeneous part of solutions, i.e., the homogeneous part of solutions of multiple vertices is the product of the solutions of the single vertex. Secondly, we give the solution to the $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations of arbitrary single vertex integral family. We also show how to determine the boundary conditions for the differential equations. There are two techniques we developed for the computation. Firstly, we analytically solve $\text{d} \log$-form differential equations via power series expansion. Secondly, we handle degenerate multivariate poles in power series expansion of differential equations by blow-up. They could also be useful in the evaluation of multi-loop Feynman integrals in flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>Combining strongly lensed and unlensed fast radio bursts: to be a more precise late-universe probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Macquart relation and time-delay cosmography are now two promising ways to fast radio burst (FRB) cosmology. In this work, we propose a joint method that combines strongly lensed and unlensed FRBs for improving cosmological parameter estimation by using simulated FRB data from the future sensitive coherent all-sky monitor survey, which is expected to detect a large number of FRBs including galaxy-galaxy strongly lensed events. We find that using a detectable sample of 100,000 localized FRBs including $40$ lensed events can simultaneously constrain the Hubble constant and the equation of state of dark energy, with high precision of $\varepsilon(H_0)=0.4\%$ and $\varepsilon(w)=4.5\%$ in the simplest dynamical dark energy model. The joint analysis of unlensed and lensed FRBs significantly improves the constraint on $H_0$, which could be more effective than combining either the unlensed FRBs with future gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens or the lensed FRBs with CMB. Furthermore, combining the full FRB sample with the CMB+BAO+SNe data yields $\sigma(H_0)=0.29~{\rm km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$, $\sigma(w_0)=0.046$, and $\sigma(w_a)=0.15$ in the two-parameter dynamical dark energy model, which outperform the results from the CMB+BAO+SNe+GW data. This reinforces the cosmological implications of a multi-wavelength observational strategy in optical and radio bands. We conclude that the future FRB observations will shed light on the nature of dark energy and also the Hubble tension if enough events with long-duration lensing are incorporated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The subtraction function plays a pivotal role in calculations involving the forward Compton amplitude, which is crucial for predicting the Lamb shift in muonic atom, as well as the proton-neutron mass difference. In this work, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the subtraction function using two domain wall fermion gauge ensembles at the physical pion mass. We utilize a recently proposed subtraction point, demonstrating its advantage in mitigating statistical and systematic uncertainties by eliminating the need for ground-state subtraction. Our results reveal significant contributions from $N\pi$ intermediate states to the subtraction function. Incorporating these contributions, we compute the proton, neutron and nucleon isovector subtraction functions at photon momentum transfer $Q^2\in[0,2]$ GeV$^2$. For the proton subtraction function, we compare our lattice results with chiral perturbation theory prediction at low $Q^2$ and with the results from the perturbative operator-product expansion at high $Q^2$. Finally, using these subtraction functions as input, we determine their contribution to two-photon exchange effects in the Lamb shift and isovector nucleon electromagnetic self-energy.</description>

      <title>Revisiting constraints on primordial magnetic fields from spectral distortions of cosmic microwave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magneto-hydrodynamic decay of primordial magnetic fields can distort the black-body spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) by draining magnetic energy into thermal plasmas and photons. The current limits on CMB distortion place constraints on small-scale primordial magnetic fields. The constraints crucially depend on the decay laws of primordial magnetic fields. Recent numerical simulations reveal that non-linear effects play a significant role in the magnetic field decay although these effects are neglected in previous works. In this paper, by adopting a reconnection-driven turbulent decay as a non-linear evolution model, we demonstrate the potential impact of non-linear effects on CMB spectral distortions. The reconnection-driven turbulent decay model is an analytical description which provides the consistent results with numerical simulation. Our results rule out magnetic fields with shorter coherence lengths. While the result is independent of the spectral index of the magnetic energy spectrum, it is influenced by the magnetic helicity fraction.</description>

      <title>The tidal evolution of anisotropic subhaloes: A new pathway to creating isotropic and cored satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is common practice, both in dynamical modelling and in idealised numerical simulations, to assume that galaxies and/or dark matter haloes are spherical and have isotropic velocity distributions, such that their distribution functions are ergodic. However, there is no good reason to assume that this assumption is accurate. In this paper we use idealised $N$-body simulations to study the tidal evolution of subhaloes that are anisotropic at infall. We show that the detailed velocity anisotropy has a large impact on the subhalo's mass loss rate. In particular, subhaloes that are radially anisotropic experience much more mass loss than their tangentially anisotropic counterparts. In fact, in the former case, the stripping of highly radial orbits can cause a rapid cusp-to-core transformation, without having to resort to any baryonic feedback processes. Once the tidal radius becomes comparable to the radius of the core thus formed, the subhalo is tidally disrupted. Subhaloes that at infall are tangentially anisotropic are far more resilient to tidal stripping, and are never disrupted when simulated with sufficient resolution. We show that the preferential stripping of more radial orbits, combined with re-virialisation post stripping, causes an isotropisation of the subhalo's velocity distributions. This implies that subhaloes that have experienced significant mass loss are expected to be close to isotropic, which may alleviate the mass-anisotropy degeneracies that hamper the dynamical modelling of Milky Way satellites.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Model of Credence in Low Energy Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out a quantitative Bayesian analysis of the evolution of credences in low energy supersymmetry (SUSY) in light of the most relevant empirical data. The analysis is based on the assumption that observers apply principles of optimism or pessimism about theory building in a coherent way. On this basis, we provide a rough assessment of the current range of plausible credences in low energy SUSY and determine in which way LHC data changes those credences. For observers who had been optimistic about low energy SUSY before the LHC, the method reports that LHC data does lead to decreased credences in accordance with intuition. The decrease is moderate, however, and keeps posteriors at very substantial levels. The analysis further establishes that a very high but not yet indefensible degree of pessimism regarding the success chances of theory building still results in quite significant credences in GUT and low energy SUSY for the time right before the start of the LHC. The pessimist's credence in low energy SUSY remains nearly unchanged once LHC data is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Three-loop helicity amplitudes for four-quark scattering in massless QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.00055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the three-loop corrections to the helicity amplitudes for $q\bar{q}\to Q\bar{Q}$ scattering in massless QCD. In the Lorentz decomposition of the scattering amplitude we avoid evanescent Lorentz structures and map the corresponding form factors directly to the physical helicity amplitudes. We reduce the amplitudes to master integrals and express them in terms of harmonic polylogarithms. The renormalised amplitudes exhibit infrared divergences of dipole and quadrupole type, as predicted by previous work on the infrared structure of multileg scattering amplitudes. We derive the finite remainders and present explicit results for all relevant partonic channels, both for equal and different quark flavours.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Debye mass within Gribov-Zwanziger action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study we have investigated the electromagnetic Debye mass by computing the static limit of the temporal component of the one-loop photon polarization tensor involving effective quarks in the loop. These effective quarks have been considered within the Gribov-Zwanziger action, thereby incorporating the necessary non-perturbative effects. As an academic exercise, we have also shown one of the applications of this Gribov modified Debye mass by using it to evaluate the real and imaginary parts of the heavy quark potential in a QED system. This computation of the electromagnetic Debye mass and the corresponding estimations of the heavy quark potential can be seen as stepping stones in the direction of further practical QCD calculations in the non perturbative domain.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass mechanisms from a nonstandard Higgs Lagrangian and implications for flavor hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an alternative framework to establish the neutrino mass scale from the Higgs mechanism in a minimalist approach, which does not introduce new scalar bosons or extend the symmetry group of the standard model (SM). A nonstandard form of the Higgs Lagrangian, constructed via the inverse problem of calculus of variations, is proposed. Only one dimensionful parameter in the TeV scale is incorporated into the SM Lagrangian. The multiplicative Lagrangian model of the Higgs field plays an essential role in explaining the vast mass difference between charged fermions and Dirac neutrinos, while the Yukawa couplings for these two groups of particles naturally fall within the same scale. On the other hand, if the neutrino mass term has both Dirac and Majorana components, the mass of the mostly right-handed neutrinos in the Type-I seesaw mechanism can range from the keV scale up to slightly below the grand unification scale without requiring extremely small Yukawa couplings outside the SM regime. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of this mechanism to explain the hierarchical structure in the Yukawa couplings between first- and third-generation particles.</description>

      <title>Diffusion coefficient matrix for multiple conserved charges: a Kubo approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strongly interacting matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions possesses several conserved quantum numbers, such as baryon number, strangeness, and electric charge. The diffusion process of these charges can be characterized by a diffusion matrix that describes the mutual influence of the diffusion of various charges. We derive the Kubo relations for evaluating diffusion coefficients as elements of a diffusion matrix. We further demonstrate that in the weak coupling limit, the diffusion matrix elements obtained through Kubo relations reduce to those obtained from kinetic theory with an appropriate identification of the relaxation times. We illustrate this evaluation in a toy model of two interacting scalar fields with two conserved charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extensions of the Standard Model with masses at or below the GeV scale are motivated by searches for dark matter and precision measurements in the quark and lepton flavour sectors, including that of the muon anomalous magnetic moment. An excellent experimental environment to test such light new physics is given by the Belle II experiment, which foresees to take up to 50 ab$^{-1}$ of data. Here we consider a model with an additional gauged $U(1)_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ symmetry that introduces a neutral gauge boson, a Dark Photon, with possibly large couplings to muon- and tau-flavored leptons, including neutrinos. Dark Photon mixing with the Standard Model photon is loop induced, allowing it to couple to electrically charged fermions other than muons and taus. We systematically investigate the possible search strategies for Dark Photons with four fermions final states. We identified search channels with muons as the most promising ones, and we analyse the kinematic distributions to obtain cuts that optimise the sensitivity of Belle II searches for the Dark Photon. Summarising the sensitivities from the most promising search channels we provide a comprehensive overview of future searches at Belle II.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings from Tribrid Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tribrid inflation is a class of supersymmetric inflation models where the scalar component of a matter superfield, or a $D$-flat direction of matter fields, drives inflation. Similar to Hybrid inflation, the end of inflation is reached when a "waterfall field", which was stabilized during inflation at a field value where the scalar potential features a large vacuum energy, starts rapidly rolling towards its minimum where a symmetry group $G$ is spontaneously broken. In contrast to standard supersymmetric Hybrid inflation, where the inflaton is a gauge singlet, in Tribrid inflation it can be a gauge non-singlet, which, via its vacuum expectation value, already breaks the gauge symmetry. This raises the question whether topological defects can still form after inflation in this class of models, and if so, which types of defects are generated. We investigate this question systematically in realisations of Tribrid inflation where $G = U(1)$ and we analyse under which conditions cosmic strings form. We find that in the considered cases where domain walls form, these are only temporary and do not invalidate the model realisations. We also discuss how our results can be used to analyse models of Tribrid inflation associated with the final step of $SO(10)$ breaking, where cosmic strings can be metastable and provide a promising explanation of the recent PTA results hinting at a stochastic gravitational wave background at nanohertz frequencies.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Interactions of the Cosmic Neutrino Background, Axions, Dark Matter, and Reactor Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we do three things. First, we outline the conditions under which the interaction rate of inelastic processes that change the internal state of a system of $N$ targets scales as $N^2$. This is an effect distinct from coherent elastic scattering, but with the same scaling. Second, we compute rates for such processes for various weakly interacting particles. Finally, we point to potential quantum observables for these processes, beyond energy exchange. Maximal coherence in inelastic processes is achieved when the targets are placed in an equal superposition of the ground and excited states. These coherent inelastic processes are analogous to Dicke superradiance, and we thus refer to them as superradiant interactions. We compute the superradiant interaction rates for the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B), dark matter scattering and absorption, and late-universe particles, such as reactor neutrinos, when the two-level system is realized by nuclear or electron spins in a magnetic field. The rates can be sizeable on macroscopic yet small targets. For example, the C$\nu$B interacts with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\text{Hz})$ when scattering off a 10~cm liquid or solid-state density spin-polarized sphere, a $\mathcal{O}(10^{21})$ enhancement compared to the incoherent contribution. For QCD axion dark matter, similar rates can be achieved with much smaller samples, $N \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{15})\left(\frac{m}{2\times 10^{-8}~\text{eV}}\right)^{-1/2}$, where $m$ is the axion mass. Using the Lindblad formalism, we show that these superradiant interactions can manifest as a source of noise on the system. This points to new observables, sensitive to the sum of the excitation and de-excitation rates, and can be viewed as introducing diffusion and decoherence to the system. The effects presented in this paper may point to a new class of ultra-low threshold detectors.</description>

      <title>Color superconductivity and speed of sound in the two-flavor quark-meson diquark model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the properties of the two-flavor quark-meson diquark (QMD) model as a renormalizable low-energy model for QCD in the 2SC phase of QCD. The effective degrees of freedom are the mesons (sigma and pions), quarks, and diquarks. Some of the parameters of the model can be determined by expressing them in terms of the vacuum meson masses and the pion decay constant using the on-shell renormalization scheme. The remaining parameters are considered free, although they in principle can be calculated from QCD. The thermodynamic potential is calculated in a mean-field approximation taking only quark loops into account. In this approximation, we derive a set of renormalization group equations for the running masses and couplings. The solutions to these equations are used to improve the thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ and thereby thermodynamic quantities. Four parameter sets are chosen and the phase diagram in the $\bar{\mu}$--$T$ plane is obtained (with $\bar{\mu}={1\over3}\mu_B$). We also calculate the speed of sound $c_s$ as a function of $\bar{\mu}$ at vanishing temperature. For large values of $\bar{\mu}$, the speed of sound approaches the conformal limit $c_s={1\over\sqrt{3}}$ from above, in disagreement with perturbative calculations, but agreement with hard-dense-loop resummed perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the exclusive semileptonic decays $\Upsilon(1S)\to B_{(c)}\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell$, where $\ell = e,\mu,\tau$. The relevant hadronic form factors are calculated using the Covariant Confined Quark Model developed previously by our group. We predict the branching fractions $\mathcal{B}(\Upsilon(1S)\to B_{(c)}\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell)$ to be of the order of $10^{-13}$ and $10^{-10}$ for the case of $B$ and $B_c$, respectively. Our predictions agree well with other theoretical calculations. We also consider the effects of possible New Physics in the case of $\Upsilon(1S)\to B_c\tau\bar{\nu}_\tau$. We show that the branching fraction of this decay can be enhanced by an order of magnitude using constraints from the $B\to D^{(*)}\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell$ and $B_c\to J/\psi\ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$ experimental data.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic behavior of Lorentz-violating photon fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss the Lorentz-violating modifications of the propagation properties of the massless photon in the null formalism. Starting with the Maxwell Lagrangian in the minimal standard model extension, we derive the Maxwell equations in the null formalism based on the fact that at leading order of optical approximation, the light cone structure for the CPT-violating (CPTV) $(k_{AF})^\mu$ term is unaltered. Assuming the order expansion as $\phi_0=\sum_{n=1}\phi^{n-1}_0/r^{n+2}$ and reserving only linear order corrections of the $(k_{AF})^\mu$ term, we find that the asymptotic behaviors of the three complex scalars deviate from $\phi_a^0\sim\mathcal{O}(r^{a-3})$, the behaviors of the LI counterparts, provided one of the spherically symmetric $k^2\neq0$. Our results also gives unnatural constraints: $k^2+4k^1=0$ and $\mathrm{Re}[\phi_1^0]=0$. We attribute this unnaturalness to the flaw of our perturbative treatment, in comparison with the formal dipole radiation solutions in Ref. [13]. In other words, it is highly plausible that the non-perturbative nature of the CPTV modified polarization structure may forbid a consistent perturbative treatment of Maxwell equations in the Newman-Penrose form. By the way, the exact formal results reveal that CPTV not only modifies the phase factor (dispersion relations) as a kinematic effect, it also modifies the amplitude and asymptotic behaviors of the radiation and Coulomb modes as dynamical effects. This dramatic changes of the peeling theorem may provide novel signals of the deviation from exact Lorentz symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We study quantum entanglement and test violation of Bell-type inequality at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), which is one of the most attractive future colliders. It's a promising particle collider designed to search new physics, make Standard Model (SM) precision measurements, and serving as a Higgs factory. Our study is based on a fast simulation of the $Z$ boson pair production from Higgs boson decay at $\sqrt{s} = 250$ GeV. The detector effects are also included in the simulation. The spin density matrix of the joint $ZZ$ system is parametrized using irreducible tensor operators and reconstructed from the spherical coordinates of the decay leptons. To test Bell inequalities, we construct observable quantities for the $H \to ZZ*$ process in CEPC by using the (Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu) CGLMP inequality, whose value is determined from the density matrix of the Z boson pairs. The sensitivity of the Bell inequality violation is observed with more than 1$\sigma$ and the presence of the quantum entanglement is probed with more than 2$\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful tool for studying dynamics in QFT: it provides selection rules, constrains RG flows, and often simplifies analysis. Currently, our understanding is that the most general form of symmetry is described by categorical symmetries which can be realized via Symmetry TQFTs or ``SymTFTs." In this paper, we show how the framework of the SymTFT, which is understood for discrete symmetries (i.e. finite categorical symmetries), can be generalized to continuous symmetries. In addition to demonstrating how $U(1)$ global symmetries can be incorporated into the paradigm of the SymTFT, we apply our formalism to study cubic $U(1)$ anomalies in $4d$ QFTs, describe the $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ non-invertible chiral symmetry in $4d$ theories, and conjecture the SymTFT for general continuous $G^{(0)}$ global symmetries.</description>

      <title>Scattering wave packets of hadrons in gauge theories: Preparation on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation holds promise of enabling a complete description of high-energy scattering processes rooted in gauge theories of the Standard Model. A first step in such simulations is preparation of interacting hadronic wave packets. To create the wave packets, one typically resorts to adiabatic evolution to bridge between wave packets in the free theory and those in the interacting theory, rendering the simulation resource intensive. In this work, we construct a wave-packet creation operator directly in the interacting theory to circumvent adiabatic evolution, taking advantage of resource-efficient schemes for ground-state preparation, such as variational quantum eigensolvers. By means of an ansatz for bound mesonic excitations in confining gauge theories, which is subsequently optimized using classical or quantum methods, we show that interacting mesonic wave packets can be created efficiently and accurately using digital quantum algorithms that we develop. Specifically, we obtain high-fidelity mesonic wave packets in the $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter in 1+1 dimensions. Our method is applicable to both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of couplings. The wave-packet creation circuit for the case of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory is built and implemented on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using 13 qubits and up to 308 entangling gates. The fidelities agree well with classical benchmark calculations after employing a simple symmetry-based noise-mitigation technique. This work serves as a step toward quantum computing scattering processes in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermal false vacuum decay in (1+1)-dimensions: Evidence for non-equilibrium dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically study the evolution of a classical real scalar field in ${(1+1)}$ dimensions with initial conditions describing thermal fluctuations around a metastable vacuum. We track false vacuum decay in real time and compare several observables to the predictions of the standard Euclidean formalism. We find agreement for the shape of the critical bubble and the exponential suppression of the decay rate. However, the decay rate prefactor is almost an order of magnitude lower than the predicted value. We argue that this signals a breakdown of thermal equilibrium during the bubble nucleation. In addition, the inefficient thermalization in the system biases the properties of the statistical ensemble and leads to further decrease of the decay rate with time. We substantiate our interpretation with a suite of stochastic field simulations with controlled thermalization time. Varying this time we find that the predictions of the standard equilibrium formalism are recovered when it is sufficiently short. We propose an upper bound on the thermalization time that must be satisfied in order to ensure the applicability of the Euclidean rate calculation. We discuss that this bound is unavoidably violated in common single-field models, irrespective of the number of spacetime dimensions, implying that deviations from equilibrium in these models cannot be neglected. In theories with multiple fields, the bound may or may not hold, depending on the setup details. We investigate one more signature of non-equilibrium dynamics -- coherent oscillonic precursors to the critical bubble nucleation. We show that they get suppressed in the stochastic dynamical simulations when the thermalization time is reduced.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in the bumblebee theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, theoretical studies on the bumblebee gravity model, a nonminimally-coupled vector-tensor theory that violates the Lorentz symmetry, have flourished, with a simultaneous increase in the utilization of observations to impose constraints. The static spherical solutions of neutron stars (NSs) in the bumblebee theory are calculated comprehensively in this work. These solutions with different coupling constants reveal a rich theoretical landscape for NSs, including vectorized NSs and NSs with finite radii but divergent masses. With these solutions, preliminary constraints on the asymptotic vector field values are obtained through restrictions on the stellar radius.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? Electromagnetic and Gravitational Mode Mixing in NSBH Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of electromagnetic fields leaving imprints on gravitational wave (GW) signals from Neutron Star-Black hole (NSBH) mergers, specifically in the context of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Using black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) in the context of a minimally coupled Einstein-Maxwell system, we demonstrate that electromagnetic quasi normal modes(QNMs) can excite gravitational QNMs with frequencies that are linear or quadratic in the electromagnetic QNMs, at first level of mixing. Moreover, We then study the electromagnetism-gravity coupling by approximating the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli potentials with Dirac delta functions. In this example, we examine gravitational perturbations induced by the electromagnetic field of an ideal dipole radially free fall towards the blackhole, building on calculations from a companion paper [1]. Our results show that both linear and quadratic electromagnetic QNMs appear in gravitational perturbations. In addition, linear gravitational QNMs are also excited due to the electromagnetic source, with their amplitudes depending on the details of the electromagnetic and gravitational potentials, analogous to gravitational mode mixing analysis. Furthermore, at late stages, gravitational perturbations might exhibit polynomial tails induced by electromagnetic perturbations. This article sets the stage for future numerical investigations aimed at identifying such modes in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Relativistic fluid dynamics in a 'hydro' frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate how field redefinition influences the spectrum of linearized perturbations in relativistic fluid dynamics. We show that the hydrodynamic modes do not get affected under local field redefinition, whereas the non-hydrodynamic modes do. These non-hydrodynamic modes can be removed through a suitable all-order field redefinition. This process leads to a new frame containing only hydrodynamic modes, which we refer to as the hydro frame. Additionally, we demonstrate that the resulting stress-energy tensor may constitute an infinite series in momentum space, with the radius of convergence associated with the removed non-hydrodynamic mode, highlighting its role in the hydrodynamic expansion's validity.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? II. A Short Guide of First- and Second-Order Electromagnetic Perturbations in the Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study second-order electromagnetic perturbations in the Schwarzschild background and derive the effective source terms for Regge-Wheeler equation which are quadratic in first-order gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations. In addition to the induced mixed quadratic modes, we find that linear gravitational modes are also excited, with amplitudes dependent on the electromagnetic potential. A toy model involving a Dirac delta function potential demonstrates mixing of linear gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations with frequencies \( \omega^{(1)} \) and \( \Omega^{(1)} \), resulting in the second-order QNM mixing in the electromagnetic field at \( \Omega^{(2)} =\Omega^{(1)} + \omega^{(1)} \). This complements prior work in [1] on the second-order gravitational perturbation mixing and highlights potential applications in multi-messenger astrophysics for systems observed by LIGO and upcoming LISA. We also study first-order perturbations due to a point charge and show it could be reduced to a one-dimensional path integral. Within the toy model, we investigate the first-order electromagnetic perturbation due to a radially free-falling single charge \( q \) and radial dipole moment \( p = q \eta \), employing semi-analytical and numerical methods. For the dipole case, we show that the QNM perturbation is excited with a nearly constant amplitude. Future work will focus on incorporating mixing in more realistic potentials and exploring numerical approach in the context of rotating spacetimes.</description>
