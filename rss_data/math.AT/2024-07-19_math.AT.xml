      <title>Power operations preserve Thom classes in twisted equivariant Real K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct power operations for twisted KR-theory of topological stacks. Standard algebraic properties of Clifford algebras imply that these power operations preserve universal Thom classes. As a consequence, we show that the twisted Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro orientation commutes with power operations.</description>

      <title>An $\infty$-Category of 2-Segal Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebra objects in $\infty$-categories of spans admit a description in terms of $2$-Segal objects. We introduce a notion of span between $2$-Segal objects and extend this correspondence to an equivalence of $\infty$-categories. Additionally, for every $\infty$-category with finite limits $\mathcal{C}$, we introduce a notion of a birelative $2$-Segal object in $\mathcal{C}$ and establish a similar equivalence with the $\infty$-category of bimodule objects in spans. Examples of these concepts arise from algebraic and hermitian K-theory through the corresponding Waldhausen $S_{\bullet}$-construction. Apart from their categorical relevance, these concepts can be used to construct homotopy coherent representations of Hall algebras.</description>

      <title>Complexity and speed of semi-algebraic multi-persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{R}$ be a real closed field, $S \subset \mathrm{R}^n$ a closed and bounded semi-algebraic set and $\mathbf{f} = (f_1,\ldots,f_p):S \rightarrow \mathrm{R}^p$ a continuous semi-algebraic map. We study the poset module structure in homology induced by the simultaneous filtrations of $S$ by the sub-level sets of the functions $f_i$ from an algorithmic and quantitative point of view. For fixed dimensional homology we prove a singly exponential upper bound on the complexity of these modules which are encoded as certain semi-algebraically constructible functions on $\mathrm{R}^p \times \mathrm{R}^p$. We also deduce for semi-algebraic filtrations of bounded complexity, upper bounds on the number of equivalence classes of finite poset modules that such a filtration induces -- establishing a tight analogy with a well-known graph theoretical result on the "speed'' of algebraically defined graphs.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to homotopy invariance of loop coproduct via parametrised fixed-point theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $f: M \to N$ a homotopy equivalence of compact manifolds with boundary, we use a construction of Geoghegan and Nicas to define its Reidemeister trace $[T] \in \pi_1^{st}(\mathcal{L} N, N)$. We realize the Goresky-Hingston coproduct as a map of spectra, and show that the failure of $f$ to entwine the spectral coproducts can be characterized by Chas-Sullivan multiplication with $[T]$. In particular, when $f$ is a simple homotopy equivalence, the spectral coproducts of $M$ and $N$ agree.</description>

      <title>Cyclic A-infinity Algebras and Calabi--Yau Structures in the Analytic Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers $A_\infty$-algebras whose higher products satisfy an analytic bound with respect to a fixed norm. We define a notion of right Calabi--Yau structures on such $A_\infty$-algebras and show that these give rise to cyclic minimal models satisfying the same analytic bound. This strengthens a theorem of Kontsevich--Soibelman, and yields a flexible method for obtaining analytic potentials of Hua-Keller.
  We apply these results to the endomorphism DGAs of polystable sheaves considered by Toda, for which we construct a family of such right CY structures obtained from analytic germs of holomorphic volume forms on a projective variety. As a result, we can define a canonical cyclic analytic $A_\infty$-structure on the Ext-algebra of a polystable sheaf, which depends only on the analytic-local geometry of its support. This shows that the results of Toda can be extended to the quasi-projective setting, and yields a new method for comparing cyclic $A_\infty$-structures of sheaves on different Calabi--Yau varieties.</description>

      <title>Quantitative upper bounds on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gromov-Hausdorff distance between two metric spaces measures how far the spaces are from being isometric. It has played an important and longstanding role in geometry and shape comparison. More recently, it has been discovered that the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between unit spheres equipped with the geodesic metric has important connections to Borsuk-Ulam theorems and Vietoris-Rips complexes.
  We develop a discrete framework for obtaining upper bounds on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between spheres, and provide the first quantitative bounds that apply to spheres of all possible pairs of dimensions. As a special case, we determine the exact Gromov-Hausdorff distance between the circle and any higher-dimensional sphere, and determine the asymptotic behavior of the distance from the 2-sphere to the $k$-sphere up to constants.</description>

      <title>Detecting out-of-distribution text using topological features of transformer-based language models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To safeguard machine learning systems that operate on textual data against out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs that could cause unpredictable behaviour, we explore the use of topological features of self-attention maps from transformer-based language models to detect when input text is out of distribution. Self-attention forms the core of transformer-based language models, dynamically assigning vectors to words based on context, thus in theory our methodology is applicable to any transformer-based language model with multihead self-attention. We evaluate our approach on BERT and compare it to a traditional OOD approach using CLS embeddings. Our results show that our approach outperforms CLS embeddings in distinguishing in-distribution samples from far-out-of-domain samples, but struggles with near or same-domain datasets.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis of Monopole Current Networks in $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $4$-dimensional pure compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we analyse topological aspects of the dynamics of monopoles across the deconfinement phase transition. We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly locate the critical inverse coupling $\beta_{c}$ through finite-size scaling. Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Persistence Diagram Estimation : Beyond Plug-in Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) used to summarize the topology underlying data. It can be conveniently represented through persistence diagrams. Observing a noisy signal, common strategies to infer its persistence diagram involve plug-in estimators, and convergence properties are then derived from sup-norm stability. This dependence on the sup-norm convergence of the preliminary estimator is restrictive, as it essentially imposes to consider regular classes of signals. Departing from these approaches, we design an estimator based on image persistence. In the context of the Gaussian white noise model, and for large classes of piecewise-H\"older signals, we prove that the proposed estimator is consistent and achieves minimax rates. Notably, these rates coincide with the well known minimax rates for H\"older continuous signals.</description>

      <title>Classification of Cellular Fake Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generic polyhedra are interesting mathematical objects to study in their own right. In this paper, we initialize a systematic study of two-dimensional generic polyhedra with an eye towards applications to low-dimensional topology, especially the Andrews-Curtis and Zeeman conjectures. After recalling the basic notions of generic polyhedra and fake surfaces, we derive some interesting properties of fake surfaces. Our main result is a complete classification of acyclic cellular fake surfaces up to complexity 4 and a classification of acyclic cellular fake surfaces without small disks of complexity 5. From this classification, we prove the contractibility conjecture for acyclic cellular fake surfaces of complexity 4, and the embedded disk conjecture up to complexity 5. We provide evidence for the conjectures that the probability of being a spine among fake surfaces is 0 and that every contractible fake surface has an embedded disk.</description>
