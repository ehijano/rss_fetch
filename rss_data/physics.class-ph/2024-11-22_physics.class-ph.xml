      <title>Engineering spectro-temporal light states with physics-trained deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency synthesis and spectro-temporal control of optical wave packets are central to ultrafast science, with supercontinuum (SC) generation standing as one remarkable example. Through passive manipulation, femtosecond (fs) pulses from nJ-level lasers can be transformed into octave-spanning spectra, supporting few-cycle pulse outputs when coupled with external pulse compressors. While strategies such as machine learning have been applied to control the SC's central wavelength and bandwidth, their success has been limited by the nonlinearities and strong sensitivity to measurement noise. Here, we propose and demonstrate how a physics-trained convolutional neural network (P-CNN) can circumvent such challenges, showing few-fold speedups over the direct approaches. We highlight three key advancements enabled by the P-CNN approach: (i) on-demand control over spectral features of SC, (ii) direct generation of sub-3-cycle pulses from the highly nonlinear fiber, and (iii) the production of high-order solitons, capturing distinct "breather" dynamics in both spectral and temporal domains. This approach heralds a new era of arbitrary spectro-temporal state engineering, with transformative implications for ultrafast and quantum science.</description>

      <title>Modeling the amplitude and energy decay of a weakly damped harmonic oscillator using the energy dissipation rate and a simple trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate how to derive the exponential decrease of amplitude and an excellent approximation of the energy decay of a weakly damped harmonic oscillator without solving the associated equation of motion and without insight into the analytical form of its solution. This is achieved using a basic understanding of the undamped harmonic oscillator and the connection between the damping force's power and the energy dissipation rate. The trick is adding the energy dissipation rates corresponding to two specific pairs of initial conditions with the same energy. In this way, we obtain a first-order differential equation from which we get the time-dependent amplitude and the energies corresponding to each pair of considered initial conditions. Comparing the results of our model to the exact solutions and energies yielded an excellent agreement. The physical concepts and mathematical techniques we employ are well-known to first-year undergraduates.</description>

      <title>On the locus formed by the maximum heights of an ultra-relativistic projectile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of relativistic projectiles in a uniform gravitational force field in an inertial frame. For the first time, we have found the curve that joins the points of maximum height of all trajectories followed by a projectile in the ultra-relativistic limit. The parametric equations of this curve produce an onion-like curve; in fact, it is one of the loops of a lemniscate-type curve. We also verify that the curve is an ellipse in the nonrelativistic approximation. These two limiting results are obtained by following two slightly distinct approaches. In addition, we calculate the nonrelativistic and ultra-relativistic approximations of the trajectory equation and parametric equations of the trajectory as functions of time. We also find the asymptotic behavior of the ultra-relativistic trajectory equations for points that are very distant from the launching point. All limiting cases in the article are studied in detail. Additionally, we discuss various physical issues related to some of our results. The content of the article is appropriate for advanced undergraduate students.</description>

      <title>Particle manipulations based on acoustic valley topological rainbow defect-state trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Acoustic microfluidic is an important technology in particle manipulations in biomedical analyses and detections. However, the particle-movement manipulations achieved by the standing surface acoustic wave is suitable for particles in a thin layer of fluids, however it is difficult to manipulate particles in deeper solutions due to the energy loss of surface acoustic waves. The traditional standing bulk wave method can realize the particle manipulation in deep solutions, but it cannot work properly for particle manipulation within a long distance due to the energy loss. In this work, the topological rainbow defect-state trapping is realized, the results show that an effect of point accumulation of acoustic pressure in the waveguide path exists, the position of maximum acoustic pressure can be adjusted flexibly by changing the frequency of the incident acoustic wave, based on which, long-distance movement and capture manipulations of particles in deep solution have been realized. The phenomenon presented in this work can provide a reliable method for manipulations of continuous long-distance particle movement and capture to meet the demand of multiple processing steps in biochemical analyses and detections. The experiment verification results will be presented in the near future.</description>

      <title>Topologically invisible defects in chiral mirror lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the hallmark of topological insulators is having conductivity properties that are unaffected by the possible presence of defects. In this work, we go beyond backscattering immunity and obtain topological invisibility across defects or disorder. Using a combination of chiral and mirror symmetry, the transmission coefficient is guaranteed to be unity. Importantly, but no phase shift is induced making the defect completely invisible. Many lattices possess the chiral-mirror symmetry, and we choose to demonstrate the principle on an hexagonal lattice model with Kekule distortion displaying topological edge waves, and we show analytically and numerically that the transmission across symmetry preserving defects is unity. We then realize this lattice in an acoustic system, and confirm the invisibility with numerical experiments. We foresee that the versatility of our model will trigger new experiments to observe topological invisibility in various wave systems, such as photonics, cold atoms or elastic waves.</description>
