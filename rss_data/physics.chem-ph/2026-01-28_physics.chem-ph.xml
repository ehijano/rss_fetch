      <title>Locally Scaled Self-Interaction Corrected Energy Functionals with Complex Optimal Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully variational locally scaled self-interaction corrected (SIC) energy functional using complex optimal orbitals. This represents an important milestone for fully variational SIC energy functionals, which have been shown to improve the prediction of the properties of atomic, molecular and solid state systems in general, in both ground and excited states. However, it depends on the system and property of the system whether it is beneficial to scale the SIC correction by a factor of one-half, which makes the application of SIC inconsistent. In the limit of a single electron the SIC exactly cancels the self interaction error, but overcorrects the error in regions of high density where there is large overlap between occupied orbitals. The newly implemented local scaling function, $z(\mathbf{r})$, which is based on an iso-orbital indicator derived from considering the kinetic energy density in the iso-electron and many electron case, and takes into account that the orbitals are complex, naturally scales the SIC correction from $0\leq z(\mathbf{r}) \leq 1$ in regions of high and low (isolated orbital) electron density. The locally scaled and fully variational SIC framework is general and applicable to atomic, molecular and solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Orthogonally Constrained CASSCF Framework: Newton-Raphson Orbital Optimization and Nuclear Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, we introduced the foundations of an orthogonally constrained complete active space self-consistent field (OC-CASSCF) framework that produces state-specific molecular orbitals for mutually orthogonal multiconfigurational electronic states. In the present study, we extend this approach by incorporating a Newton-Raphson orbital-optimization scheme, for which we derive analytical expressions of the orbital gradient and Hessian. Furthermore, we outline a practical route toward the evaluation of analytical nuclear gradients, enabling geometry optimizations within the OC-CASSCF formalism. Benchmark calculations on the three lowest singlet states of LiH and H$_2$O molecules demonstrate a systematic improvement as compared to conventional state-averaged CASSCF, even when using modestly sized active spaces.</description>

      <title>Fault-tolerant quantum simulation of the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian for ab initio hybrid quantum-classical molecular design with applications to photodynamic therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic spin effects drive subtle molecular phenomena ranging from intersystem crossing in photodynamic therapy to spin-mediated catalysis and high-resolution spectroscopy. These effects are described by the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian, which extends the nonrelativistic electronic Hamiltonian by including one- and two-electron spin-orbit and spin-spin interactions. First-principles simulations of the full Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian rapidly become intractable on classical computers due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space and the complexity of two-body spin-dependent terms. We propose a fault-tolerant quantum algorithm for computing molecular energy levels and properties governed by the Pauli-Breit Hamiltonian. Our approach block-encodes the relativistic Hamiltonian in a second-quantized, doubly factorized representation. By reformulating the Hamiltonian in a symmetry-adapted Majorana basis, we construct efficient linear-combination-of-unitaries circuits that encode spin-orbit interactions without effective or mean-field approximations. We introduce spin-controlled Pauli-SWAP networks that decouple spin and orbital control logic, enabling a unified treatment of relativistic spin mixing with only modest overhead relative to spin-free simulations. We analyze quantum resources in terms of logical qubits and T-gate complexity, showing that explicit spin degrees of freedom do not worsen the asymptotic scaling. The prefactor is reduced by a factor of two compared to direct linear-combination-of-unitaries approaches. Finally, we outline a hybrid quantum-classical workflow for designing photodynamic therapy photosensitizers, artificial photosynthesis catalysts, and other systems where accurate relativistic spin effects are essential.</description>

      <title>Frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function of IDTBT single-molecule fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function (g(2)({\tau})) of single-molecule fluorescence has recently been proposed as a powerful new quantum light spectroscopy that can reveal intrinsic quantum coherence in excitation energy transfer in molecular systems ranging from simple dimers to photosynthetic complexes. Yet, no experiments have been reported to date. Here, we have developed a single-molecule fluorescence g(2)({\tau}) quantum light spectroscopy (SMFg2-QLS) that can simultaneously measure the fluorescence intensity, lifetime, spectra, and g(2)({\tau}) with frequency resolution, for a single molecule in a controlled environment at both room temperature and cryogenic temperature. As a proof of principle, we have studied single molecules of IDTBT (indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole), a semiconducting donor-acceptor conjugated copolymer with a chain-like structure that shows a high carrier mobility and annihilation-limited long-range exciton transport. We have observed different g(2)({\tau}=0) values with different bands or bandwidths of the single molecule IDTBT fluorescence. The general features are consistent with theoretical predictions and suggest non-trivial excited state quantum dynamics, possibly showing quantum coherence, although further analysis and confirmation will require additional theoretical calculations that take into account the complexity and inhomogeneity of individual IDTBT single molecular chains. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of frequency- and time-resolved SMFg2-QLS to provide new insights into molecular quantum dynamics and to reveal signatures of intrinsic quantum coherence in photosynthetic light harvesting that are independent of the nature of the light excitation.</description>

      <title>qNEP: A highly efficient neuroevolution potential with dynamic charges for large-scale atomistic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although electrostatics can be incorporated into machine-learned interatomic potentials, existing approaches are computationally very demanding, limiting large-scale, long-time simulations of electrostatics-driven phenomena such as dielectric response, infrared activity, and field-matter coupling. Here, we extend the neuroevolution potential (NEP), a highly efficient machine-learned interatomic potential, to a charge-aware framework (qNEP) by introducing explicit, environment-dependent partial charges. Each ionic partial charge is represented by a neural network as a function of the local descriptor vector, analogous to the NEP site-energy model. This formulation enables the direct prediction of the Born effective charge tensor for each ion and, consequently, the polarization. As a result, dielectric properties, infrared spectra, and coupling to external electric fields can be evaluated within a unified framework. We derive consistent expressions for the forces and virials that explicitly account for the position dependence of the partial charges. The qNEP method has been implemented in the free-and-open-source GPUMD package, with support for both Ewald summation and particle-particle particle-mesh treatments of electrostatics. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the qNEP approach through representative applications to water, Li7La3Zr2O12, BaTiO3, and a magnesium-water interface. These results show that qNEP enables accurate atomistic simulations with explicit long-range electrostatics, scalable to million-atom systems on nanosecond time scales using consumer-grade GPUs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Photon Shot Noise: Chemical Limits in Spectrophotometric Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate precision limitations in spectrophotometry (i.e., spectroscopic concentration measurements) imposed by chemical processes of molecules. Using the recently developed Photon-resolved Floquet theory, which generalizes Maxwell-Bloch theory for higher-order measurement statistics, we analyze a molecular model system subject to chemical reactions whose electronic and optical properties depend on the chemical state. Analysis of sensitivity bounds reveals: (i) Phase measurements are more sensitive than intensity measurements; (ii) Sensitivity exhibits three regimes: photon-shot-noise limited, chemically limited, and intermediate; (iii) Sensitivity shows a turnover as a function of reaction rate due to the interplay between coherent electronic dynamics and incoherent chemical dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that chemical properties must be considered to estimate ultimate precision limits in optical spectrophotometry.</description>

      <title>On the Determination of Gel Points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A critical composition of cross-linked polysiloxanes observed by Scanlan and Winter is reinvestigated in comparison with the theory of gelation. We assume, based on the Scott findings, the geometric distribution for one of the monomers, divinyl-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane). Calculation results show that the two theories are in near-consistency, supporting the Scanlan-Winter estimation based on the linear viscoelastic theory. On the other hand, there is a disturbing result that calculation using the mean molecular weight, $M_{n}$, leads to exact agreement between the two theories, suggesting that the distribution is in effect monodisperse, contrary to the assumed geometric one and also the observed polydispersity, $M_w/M_n=2.1$. Further experimental studies employing monodisperse monomers would be highly valuable to consolidate the bridge between these two fundamental theories.</description>

      <title>Efficient Application of Tensor Network Operators to Tensor Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of tensor network methods has seen constant improvements over the last few years. We add to this effort by introducing a new algorithm that efficiently applies tree tensor network operators to tree tensor network states inspired by the density matrix method and the Cholesky decomposition. This application procedure is a common subroutine in tensor network methods. We explicitly include the special case of tensor train structures and demonstrate how to extend methods commonly used in this context to general tree structures. We compare our newly developed method with the existing ones in a benchmark scenario with random tensor network states and operators. We find our Cholesky-based compression (CBC) performs equivalently to the current state-of-the-art method, while outperforming most established methods by at least an order of magnitude in runtime. We then apply our knowledge to perform circuit simulation of tree-like circuits, in order to test our method in a more realistic scenario. Here, we find that more complex tree structures can outperform simple linear structures and achieve lower errors than those possible with the simple structures. Additionally, our CBC still performs among the most successful methods, showing less dependence on the different bond dimensions of the operator.</description>

      <title>Optimally Driven Dressed Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The applicability and performance of qubits dressed by classical fields are limited because their control protocols give rise to an undesired counter-rotating term (CRT). This in turn forces operation in a regime where a (dressed) rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is valid, thereby restricting key aspects of their operation. Here, using only a single coupling axis in the laboratory frame, we introduce a dressed-qubit control protocol that optimally removes the CRT, eliminating the need for the RWA and delivering substantial improvements in multiple performance metrics, including single-qubit gate speed, two-qubit gate fidelity, spectroscopic range, clock stability, and coherence preservation. In addition, we provide a general parameterization together with a Floquet-based coherence-time expression, which elucidates the protocol's working principles and lowers the barrier to adoption. Collectively, these advances position our scheme as the state-of-the-art strategy for qubit control, paving the way for a wider class of quantum technologies to be realized using dressed-qubit architectures.</description>

      <title>Reaching precise proton affinities in non-Born-Oppenheimer calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An attractive way to model nuclear quantum effects is to describe select nuclei quantum mechanically at the same level as the electrons. This non-Born-Oppenheimer (non-BO) method is known by many names including the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) and the multicomponent method. Two basis sets are typically used for such calculations: a nuclear basis set and an electronic basis set.
  In this work, we investigate the convergence of non-BO proton affinities (PAs) with respect to the protonic and electronic basis sets. PAs are a sensitive measure of the proton and electron densities. We demonstrate that most protonic basis sets are sufficient for non-BO density-functional calculations of PAs, resulting in convergence to within 0.1 kcal/mol of the complete protonic basis set limit. This indicates that the truncation error is dominated by the electronic basis, and that smaller protonic basis sets could be developed.
  We show that non-BO calculations should use uncontracted electronic basis sets on the quantum protons. The contraction coefficients in typical electronic basis sets have been derived for point nuclear charge distributions, and uncontracting the electronic basis set on the quantized proton leads to significantly faster convergence to the electronic basis set limit. Uncontraction leads to results of one $\zeta$-level higher quality with negligible additional computational cost in multiple diffuse basis set families: Jensen's polarization consistent aug-pc-X basis sets, Dunning's correlation-consistent aug-cc-pVXZ basis sets, as well as the Karlsruhe def2-XZPD basis sets. In specific, the aug-pc-3 electronic basis set already affords PAs converged beyond 0.1 kcal/mol when uncontracted on the quantum proton.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Modified Zeeman Effect via Spin-Polariton Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the electronic spin Zeeman effect for an effective spin-$1/2$-system subject to both strong coupling to a low-frequency optical cavity and an external static magnetic field. Specifically, we address the interplay between the cavity magnetic field component in a cavity Zeeman interaction and the canonical spin Zeeman interaction from the perspective of an effective spin-polariton Hamiltonian. The latter is derived from the minimal coupling Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian beyond the common dipole approximation via first-order quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. We find the spin Zeeman effect to be modified in the presence of the cavity field due to the formation of spin-polariton states, which result from an intricate interplay of cavity and external magnetic fields in our model. Spin-polariton signatures are discussed in the context of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy along with cavity-induced modifications of the electronic g-factor.</description>

      <title>Developing a Machine-Learning Interatomic Potential for Non-Covalent Interactions in Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable efficient modeling of molecular interactions with quantum mechanical (QM) accuracy. However, constructing robust and representative training datasets that capture subtle, system-specific interaction motifs remains challenging. We introduce PANIP (PAirwise Non-covalent Interaction Potential), an ensemble MLIP model built upon the NequIP framework and trained on non-covalent interactions (NCIs) between protein-derived fragments. PANIP is trained using an automated multi-fidelity active learning (MFAL) workflow, in which a representative training subset, termed PDB-FRAGID (PDB Fragment Interaction Dataset), was distilled from an otherwise prohibitively large pool of fragment dimers extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). PANIP retains $\omega$B97X-D3BJ/def2-TZVPP-level accuracy and achieves mean absolute errors below 0.2 kcal/mol on out-of-distribution systems, demonstrating excellent transferability across diverse NCI motifs. Compared to the widely used ANI-2x potential, PANIP delivers substantially lower errors, particularly for charged and strongly interacting dimers. Coupled with a fragmentation-based energy decomposition scheme, PANIP estimates protein-ligand binding energies at near force-field computational cost yet QM-level accuracy, enabling its use as a fragment-based scoring function that rivals specialized docking scoring functions.</description>

      <title>General Binding Affinity Guidance for Diffusion Models in Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structure-based drug design (SBDD) aims to generate ligands that bind strongly and specifically to target protein pockets. Recent diffusion models have advanced SBDD by capturing the distributions of atomic positions and types, yet they often underemphasize binding affinity control during generation. To address this limitation, we introduce \textbf{\textnormal{\textbf{BADGER}}}, a general \textbf{binding-affinity guidance framework for diffusion models in SBDD}. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} }incorporates binding affinity awareness through two complementary strategies: (1) \textit{classifier guidance}, which applies gradient-based affinity signals during sampling in a plug-and-play fashion, and (2) \textit{classifier-free guidance}, which integrates affinity conditioning directly into diffusion model training. Together, these approaches enable controllable ligand generation guided by binding affinity. \textnormal{\textbf{BADGER} } can be added to any diffusion model and achieves up to a \textbf{60\% improvement in ligand--protein binding affinity} of sampled molecules over prior methods. Furthermore, we extend the framework to \textbf{multi-constraint diffusion guidance}, jointly optimizing for binding affinity, drug-likeness (QED), and synthetic accessibility (SA) to design realistic and synthesizable drug candidates.</description>

Abstract: Quantum algorithms based on classical processing of individual samples have recently emerged as the most effective and robust methods to approximate ground-state wave functions of many-body quantum systems on pre-fault-tolerant and early-fault-tolerant quantum devices. In these algorithms, the quantum computer acts as a sampling engine that generates the subspace in which the Hamiltonian is classically diagonalized. The recently proposed Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD), uses quantum Krylov states as circuits from which samples are collected. Convergence guarantees can be derived for SKQD under similar assumptions to those of quantum phase estimation, provided that the ground-state wave function is well approximated by a polynomial subset of the full Hilbert space. However, implementations of SKQD for complex many-body Hamiltonians, such as quantum chemistry ones, are limited by the depths of time-evolution circuits needed to generate Krylov vectors. In this work, we introduce a method that combines SKQD with a qDRIFT randomized compilation of the Hamiltonian propagator. The resulting algorithm, termed SqDRIFT, enables quantum chemistry experiments on quantum processors, while preserving the convergence guarantees similar to the phase estimation algorithm. We demonstrate its viability by applying SqDRIFT to calculate the electronic ground-state energy of several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, up to system sizes beyond the reach of exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Spectral finite-element formulation of the optimized effective potential method for atomic structure in the random phase approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a spectral finite-element formulation of the optimized effective potential (OEP) method for atomic structure calculations in the random phase approximation (RPA). In particular, we develop a finite-element framework that employs a polynomial mesh with element nodes placed according to the Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto scheme, high-order $\mathcal{C}^0$-continuous Lagrange polynomial basis functions, and Gauss-Legendre quadrature for spatial integration. We employ distinct polynomial degrees for the orbitals, Hartree potential, and RPA-OEP exchange-correlation potential. Through representative examples, we verify the accuracy of the developed framework, assess the fidelity of one-parameter double-hybrid functionals constructed with RPA correlation, and develop a machine-learned model for the RPA-OEP exchange-correlation potential at the level of the generalized gradient approximation, based on the kernel method and linear regression.</description>

      <title>De novo emergence of metabolically active protocells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A continuous route from a disordered soup of simple chemical feedstocks to a functional protocell -- a compartment that metabolizes, grows, and propagates -- remains elusive. Here, we show that a homogeneous aqueous chemical mixture containing phosphorus, iron, molybdenum salts and formaldehyde spontaneously self-organizes into compartments that couple robust non-equilibrium chemical dynamics to their own growth. These structures mature to a sustained, dissipative steady state and support an organic synthetic engine, producing diverse molecular species including many core biomolecular classes. Internal spherules that are themselves growth-competent are produced within the protocells, establishing a rudimentary mode of self-perpetuation. The chemical dynamics we observe in controlled laboratory conditions also occur in reaction mixtures exposed to natural day-night cycles. Strikingly, the morphology and chemical composition of the protocells in our experiments closely resemble molybdenum-rich microspheres recently discovered in current oceanic environments. Our work establishes a robust, testable route to de novo protocell formation. The emergence of life-like spatiotemporal organization and chemical dynamics from minimal initial conditions is more facile than previously thought and could be a recurring natural phenomenon.</description>
