      <title>A Fast Iterative Robust Principal Component Analysis Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is widely used for dimensionality reduction and data analysis. However, PCA results are adversely affected by outliers often observed in real-world data. Existing robust PCA methods are often computationally expensive or exhibit limited robustness. In this work, we introduce a Fast Iterative Robust (FIR) PCA method by efficiently estimating the inliers center location and covariance. Our approach leverages Incremental PCA (IPCA) to iteratively construct a subset of data points that ensures improved location and covariance estimation that effectively mitigates the influence of outliers on PCA projection. We demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy and performance compared to existing robust location and covariance methods while offering improved robustness to outlier contamination. We utilize simulated and real-world datasets to evaluate and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in identifying and preserving underlying data structures in the presence of contamination.</description>

      <title>Fast Converging Single Trace Quasi-local PMCHWT Equation for the Modelling of Composite Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The PMCHWT integral equation enables the modelling of scattering of time-harmonic fields by penetrable, piecewise homogeneous, systems. They have been generalised to include the modelling of composite systems that may contain junctions, i.e. lines along which three or more materials meet. Linear systems resulting upon discretisation of the PMCHWT are, because of their large dimension, typically solved by Krylov iterative methods. The number of iterations required for this solution critically depends on the eigenvalue distribution of the system matrix. For systems that do not contain junction lines, Calder\'on preconditioning, which was first applied to the electric field integral equation, has been generalised to the PMCHWT equation. When junctions are present, this approach cannot be applied. Alternative approaches, such as the global multi-trace method, conceptually remove the junction lines and as a result are amenable to Calder\'on preconditioning. This approach entails a doubling of the degrees of freedom, and the solution that is produced only approximately fulfils the continuity conditions at interfaces separating domains. In this contribution, a single trace quasi-local PMCHWT equation is introduced that requires a number of iterations for its solution that only slowly increases as the mesh size tends to zero. The method is constructed as a generalisation of the classic PMCHWT, and its discretisation is thoroughly discussed. A comprehensive suite of numerical experiments demonstrates the correctness, convergence behaviour, and efficiency of the method. The integral equation is demonstrated to be free from interior resonances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence for Science (AI4S) is poised to transform industrial manufacturing by enabling the accelerated discovery and optimization of advanced (bio)materials, dramatically reducing development cycles, and unlocking novel high-performance solutions. We introduce Aethorix v1.0, a platform that integrates large language models for objective mining, diffusion-based generative models for zero-shot inorganic crystal design, and machine-learned interatomic potentials for rapid property prediction at ab initio accuracy. The platform is developed to enhance the full materials development cycle, ranging from design to deployment in use cases, while incorporating critical operational constraints to meet rigorous manufacturing standards. We validated its industrial value through a real use case, showcasing how the framework can be seamlessly embedded into scalable materials R&amp;D pipelines.</description>

      <title>Pre-training Time Series Models with Stock Data Customization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock selection, which aims to predict stock prices and identify the most profitable ones, is a crucial task in finance. While existing methods primarily focus on developing model structures and building graphs for improved selection, pre-training strategies remain underexplored in this domain. Current stock series pre-training follows methods from other areas without adapting to the unique characteristics of financial data, particularly overlooking stock-specific contextual information and the non-stationary nature of stock prices. Consequently, the latent statistical features inherent in stock data are underutilized. In this paper, we propose three novel pre-training tasks tailored to stock data characteristics: stock code classification, stock sector classification, and moving average prediction. We develop the Stock Specialized Pre-trained Transformer (SSPT) based on a two-layer transformer architecture. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our pre-training methods and provide detailed guidance on their application. Evaluations on five stock datasets, including four markets and two time periods, demonstrate that SSPT consistently outperforms the market and existing methods in terms of both cumulative investment return ratio and Sharpe ratio. Additionally, our experiments on simulated data investigate the underlying mechanisms of our methods, providing insights into understanding price series.

      <title>Integrating Traditional Technical Analysis with AI: A Multi-Agent LLM-Based Approach to Stock Market Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional technical analysis methods face limitations in accurately predicting trends in today's complex financial markets. This paper introduces ElliottAgents, an multi-agent system that integrates the Elliott Wave Principle with AI for stock market forecasting. The inherent complexity of financial markets, characterized by non-linear dynamics, noise, and susceptibility to unpredictable external factors, poses significant challenges for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, the system employs LLMs to enhance natural language understanding and decision-making capabilities within a multi-agent framework. By leveraging technologies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), ElliottAgents performs continuous, multi-faceted analysis of market data to identify wave patterns and predict future price movements. The research explores the system's ability to process historical stock data, recognize Elliott wave patterns, and generate actionable insights for traders. Experimental results, conducted on historical data from major U.S. companies, validate the system's effectiveness in pattern recognition and trend forecasting across various time frames. This paper contributes to the field of AI-driven financial analysis by demonstrating how traditional technical analysis methods can be effectively combined with modern AI approaches to create more reliable and interpretable market prediction systems.</description>

      <title>Estimating Deprivation Cost Functions for Power Outages During Disasters: A Discrete Choice Modeling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems for the generation and distribution of electrical power represents critical infrastructure and, when extreme weather events disrupt such systems, this imposes substantial costs on consumers. These costs can be conceptualized as deprivation costs, an increasing function of time without service, quantifiable through individuals' willingness to pay for power restoration. Despite widespread recognition of outage impacts, a gap in the research literature exists regarding the systematic measurement of deprivation costs. This study addresses this deficiency by developing and implementing a methodology to estimate deprivation cost functions for electricity outages, using stated preference survey data collected from Harris County, Texas. This study compares multiple discrete choice model architectures, including multinomial logit and mixed logit specifications, as well as models incorporating BoxCox and exponential utility transformations for the deprivation time attribute. The analysis examines heterogeneity in deprivation valuation through sociodemographic interactions, particularly across income groups. Results confirm that power outage deprivation cost functions are convex and strictly increasing with time. Additionally, the study reveals both systematic and random taste variation in how individuals value power loss, highlighting the need for flexible modeling approaches. By providing both methodological and empirical foundations for incorporating deprivation costs into infrastructure risk assessments and humanitarian logistics, this research enables policymakers to better quantify service disruption costs and develop more equitable resilience strategies.</description>

      <title>Finance Language Model Evaluation (FLaME)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities with core Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The effectiveness of LMs for highly specialized knowledge-intensive tasks in finance remains difficult to assess due to major gaps in the methodologies of existing evaluation frameworks, which have caused an erroneous belief in a far lower bound of LMs' performance on common Finance NLP (FinNLP) tasks. To demonstrate the potential of LMs for these FinNLP tasks, we present the first holistic benchmarking suite for Financial Language Model Evaluation (FLaME). We are the first research paper to comprehensively study LMs against 'reasoning-reinforced' LMs, with an empirical study of 23 foundation LMs over 20 core NLP tasks in finance. We open-source our framework software along with all data and results.</description>

      <title>A Neural Operator based Hybrid Microscale Model for Multiscale Simulation of Rate-Dependent Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of materials is influenced by a wide range of phenomena occurring across various time and length scales. To better understand the impact of microstructure on macroscopic response, multiscale modeling strategies are essential. Numerical methods, such as the $\text{FE}^2$ approach, account for micro-macro interactions to predict the global response in a concurrent manner. However, these methods are computationally intensive due to the repeated evaluations of the microscale. This challenge has led to the integration of deep learning techniques into computational homogenization frameworks to accelerate multiscale simulations. In this work, we employ neural operators to predict the microscale physics, resulting in a hybrid model that combines data-driven and physics-based approaches. This allows for physics-guided learning and provides flexibility for different materials and spatial discretizations. We apply this method to time-dependent solid mechanics problems involving viscoelastic material behavior, where the state is represented by internal variables only at the microscale. The constitutive relations of the microscale are incorporated into the model architecture and the internal variables are computed based on established physical principles. The results for homogenized stresses ($&lt;6\%$ error) show that the approach is computationally efficient ($\sim 100 \times$ faster).</description>

      <title>Discrete nonlinear elastodynamics in a port-Hamiltonian framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a fully nonlinear port-Hamiltonian formulation for discrete elastodynamical systems as well as a structure-preserving time discretization. The governing equations are obtained in a variational manner and represent index-1 differential algebraic equations. Performing an index reduction one obtains the port-Hamiltonian state space model, which features the nonlinear strains as an independent state next to position and velocity. Moreover, hyperelastic material behavior is captured in terms of a nonlinear stored energy function. The model exhibits passivity and losslessness and has an underlying symmetry yielding the conservation of angular momentum. We perform temporal discretization using the midpoint discrete gradient, such that the beneficial properties are inherited by the developed time stepping scheme in a discrete sense. The numerical results obtained in a representative example are demonstrated to validate the findings.</description>

      <title>Hybrid high-order methods for elasto-acoustic wave propagation in the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We devise a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) method for the coupling between the acoustic and elastic wave equations in the time domain. A first-order formulation in time is considered. The HHO method can use equal-order and mixed-order settings with polynomial degree k&gt;=0 for the face unknowns, together with O(1)- and O(1/h)-stabilizations. An energy-error estimate is established in the time-continuous case. A numerical spectral analysis is performed, showing that O(1)-stabilization is required to avoid excessive CFL limitations for explicit time discretizations. Moreover, the spectral radius of the stiffness matrix is fairly independent of the geometry of the mesh cells. For analytical solutions on general meshes, optimal convergence rates of order (k+1) are shown in both equal- and mixed-order settings using O(1)-stabilization, whereas order (k+2) is achieved in the mixed-order setting using O(1/h)-stabilization. Test cases with a Ricker wavelet as an initial condition showcase the relevance of the proposed method for the simulation of elasto-acoustic wave propagation across media with contrasted material properties.</description>
