      <title>Modeling the evolution of collective synchrony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group synchrony in the animal kingdom is usually associated with mating. Being in sync is likely advantageous, as it may help in luring the opposite sex. Yet there are also disadvantages -- such as the homogenization of the group -- which make it harder for individuals to stand-out. Here we address this tradeoff, bringing together the Kuramoto model with concepts from evolutionary game theory. We focus on the existence of self-interested ''cheaters,'' which have been extensively studied in a variety of species. In our scenario, cheating individuals take part in the synchronous group display but position themselves (in terms of phase) slightly ahead or behind the pack. This allows them to enjoy both the group benefit of advertisement and the individual benefit of being unique. But a group can only tolerate a limited number of such individuals while still achieving synchrony. We therefore incorporate a from of ''policing'' into our model: if an individual strays too far from the group's synchronous phase, they reveal themselves as dishonest and are punished. Our model offers testable predictions regarding natural population compositions, and will hopefully spur further investigation into not only how, but also why, natural systems synchronize.</description>

      <title>Breaking coexistence: Zealotry vs. nonlinear social impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how zealotry and nonlinear social impact affect consensus formation in the nonlinear voter model, evolutionary games, and the partisan voter model. In all three models, consensus is an absorbing state in finite populations, while coexistence is a possible outcome of the deterministic dynamics. We show that sufficiently strong zealotry, i.e. the presence of agents who never change state, can drive infinite populations to consensus in all three models. However, while evolutionary games and the partisan voter model permit zealotry-induced consensus for all values of their model parameters, the nonlinear voter model does not. Central to this difference is the shape of the social impact function, which quantifies how the influence of a group scales with size, and is therefore a measure of majority and minority effects. We derive general conditions relating the slope of this function at small group sizes to the local stability of consensus. Sublinear impact favours minorities and can override zealotry to prevent consensus, whereas superlinear impact promotes majorities and therefore facilitates consensus. We extend the analysis to finite populations, exploring the time-to-consensus, and the shape of quasi-stationary distributions.</description>
