      <title>An Energy-Aware RIoT System: Analysis, Modeling and Prediction in the SUPERIOT Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the energy consumption characteristics of a Silicon (Si)-based Reconfigurable IoT (RIoT) node developed in the initial phase of the SUPERIOT project, focusing on key operating states, including Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication, Narrow-Band Visible Light Communication (NBVLC), sensing, and E-ink display. Extensive measurements were conducted to establish a detailed energy profile, which serves as a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of subsequent optimizations and future node iterations. To minimize the energy consumption, multiple optimizations were implemented at both the software and hardware levels, achieving a reduction of over 60% in total energy usage through software modifications alone. Further improvements were realized by optimizing the E-ink display driving waveform and implementing a very low-power mode for non-communication activities. Based on the measured data, three measurement-based energy consumption models were developed to characterize the energy behavior of the node under: (i) normal, unoptimized operation, (ii) low-power, software-optimized operation, and (iii) very low-power, hardware-optimized operation. These models, validated with new measurement data, achieved an accuracy exceeding 97%, confirming their reliability for predicting energy consumption in diverse configurations.</description>

      <title>ODMA-Based Cell-Free Unsourced Random Access with Successive Interference Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the unsourced random access problem with multiple receivers and propose a cell-free type solution for that. In our proposed scheme, the active users transmit their signals to the access points (APs) distributed in a geographical area and connected to a central processing unit (CPU). The transmitted signals are composed of a pilot and polar codeword, where the polar codeword bits occupy a small fraction of the data part of the transmission frame. The receiver operations of pilot detection and channel and symbol estimation take place at the APs, while the actual message bits are detected at the CPU by combining the symbol estimates from the APs forwarded over the fronthaul. The effect of the successfully decoded messages is then subtracted at the APs. Numerical examples illustrate that the proposed scheme can support up to 1400 users with a high energy efficiency, and the distributed structure decreases the error probability by more than two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Electroluminescence in n-type GaAs unipolar nanoLEDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we report the observation of electroluminescence (EL) at around 866 nm from n-i-n unipolar (electron-transporting) III-V GaAs nanoLEDs. The devices consist of nanopillars with top diameter of 166 nm, arranged in a 10x10 pillar array. Hole generation through impact ionization and Zener tunnelling is achieved by incorporating an AlAs/GaAs/AlAs double-barrier quantum well within the epilayer structure of the n-i-n diode. Time-resolved EL measurements reveal decay lifetimes larger than 300 ps, allowing us to estimate an internal quantum efficiency (IQE) higher than 2 per cent at sub-mA current injection. These results demonstrate the potential for a new class of n-type nanoscale light-emitting devices.</description>

      <title>A scalable event-driven spatiotemporal feature extraction circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event-driven sensors, which produce data only when there is a change in the input signal, are increasingly used in applications that require low-latency and low-power real-time sensing, such as robotics and edge devices. To fully achieve the latency and power advantages on offer however, similarly event-driven data processing methods are required. A promising solution is the TDE: an event-based processing element which encodes the time difference between events on different channels into an output event stream. In this work we introduce a novel TDE implementation on CMOS. The circuit is robust to device mismatch and allows the linear integration of input events. This is crucial for enabling a high-density implementation of many TDEs on the same die, and for realising real-time parallel processing of the high-event-rate data produced by event-driven sensors.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Routing in Space-Ground Integrated Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks emerge as fundamental frameworks for addressing various large-scale problems. There are two primary architectures: space-based quantum networks, which deploy satellites with free space channels to interconnect users, and ground-based quantum networks, which utilize optical fibers to interconnect users. In this paper, we explore space-ground integrated quantum networks that incorporate both satellites and optical fibers into the infrastructure. This integrated network features three forms of communication: using only free space links, only ground links, or a hybrid usage of free space and ground links. We formulate the routing problem in space-ground integrated quantum networks as an integer programming and propose two solutions: using a linear relaxation and a greedy algorithm. The linear relaxation algorithm allows timely scheduling of additional entanglement purification, whereas the greedy algorithm enables quick scheduling. Simulation results demonstrate their effective balancing between network throughput and communication fidelity.</description>

      <title>The Spatial Complexity of Optical Computing and How to Reduce It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Similar to algorithms, which consume time and memory to run, hardware requires resources to function. For devices processing physical waves, implementing operations needs sufficient "space," as dictated by wave physics. How much space is needed to perform a certain function is a fundamental question in optics, with recent research addressing it for given mathematical operations, but not for more general computing tasks, e.g., classification. Inspired by computational complexity theory, we study the "spatial complexity" of optical computing systems in terms of scaling laws - specifically, how their physical dimensions must scale as the dimension of the mathematical operation increases - and propose a new paradigm for designing optical computing systems: space-efficient neuromorphic optics, based on structural sparsity constraints and neural pruning methods motivated by wave physics (notably, the concept of "overlapping nonlocality"). On two mainstream platforms, free-space optics and on-chip integrated photonics, our methods demonstrate substantial size reductions (to 1%-10% the size of conventional designs) with minimal compromise on performance. Our theoretical and computational results reveal a trend of diminishing returns on accuracy as structure dimensions increase, providing a new perspective for interpreting and approaching the ultimate limits of optical computing - a balanced trade-off between device size and accuracy.</description>
