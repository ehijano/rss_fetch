      <title>What is active wetting?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years the term \textit{active wetting} has gained some traction in works describing, analyzing and modeling a wide variety of wetting phenomena, for instance, in the contexts of biomolecular condensates, of cell layers or cell aggregates, and of active Brownian particles. The present perspective proposes a coarse classification of wetting phenomena including a tentative definition of active wetting. First, different categories of static and dynamic wetting of passive liquids are briefly discussed, in particular, distinguishing equilibrium wetting, relaxational wetting, driven wetting, and reactive wetting. Second, an overview is given of the various phenomena recently described as active wetting. We conclude by discussing a possible definition of active wetting together with a number of caveats one might want to keep in mind when using such classifications.</description>

      <title>Morphological instability of an invasive active-passive interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphological instabilities of growing tissues that impinge on passive materials are typical of invasive cancers. To explain these instabilities in experiments on breast epithelial spheroids in an extracellular matrix, we develop a continuum phase field model of a growing active liquid expanding into a passive viscoelastic matrix. Linear stability analysis of the sharp-interface limit of the governing equations predicts that the tissue interface can develops long-wavelength instabilities, but these instabilities are suppressed when the active carcinoid is embedded in an elastic matrix. We develop a theoretical morphological phase diagram, and complement these with two-dimensional finite element (FEM) phase-field simulations to track the nonlinear evolution of the interface with results consistent with theoretical predictions and experimental observations. Our study provides a basis for the emergence of interfacial instabilities in active-passive systems with the potential to control them.</description>

      <title>Defect structures and transitions in active nematic membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of active nematic liquid crystals on deformable membranes, focusing on the interplay between active stress and anisotropic curvature coupling. Using a minimal model, we simulate the coupled evolution of the nematic order parameter and membrane height. We demonstrate a continuous transition from a curvature-dominated regime, where topological defects are trapped by local deformation, to an activity-dominated regime exhibiting active turbulence. A scaling analysis reveals that the critical activity threshold $\zeta_c$ scales as $\alpha^2/\kappa$, where $\alpha$ and $\kappa$ are the coupling constant and bending stiffness, respectively; this relationship is confirmed by our numerical results. Furthermore, we find that significant correlations between the orientational pattern and membrane geometry persist even in the turbulent regime. Specifically, we identify that "walls" in the director field induce characteristic wave-like curvature profiles, providing a mechanism for dynamic coupling between order and shape. These results offer a physical framework for understanding defect-mediated deformation in nonequilibrium biological membranes.</description>

      <title>Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Primary Antioxidant-Containing Polymer Melts: Effects of Antioxidant Concentration and Molecular Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial polymeric materials often rely on antioxidants to achieve long-term reliability. Previous studies have frequently discussed the stabilization effect in the presence of macroscopic additive migration. However, the micro- to meso-scale coupling between polymer dynamics and antioxidant molecular dynamics remains insufficiently understood. In this study, we extend a polymer dynamics simulation framework that can account for oxidative aging. We also update the model so that it can explicitly incorporate antioxidant molecules into the simulation. As a result, the framework enables us to quantify how molecular architecture of antioxidants affects oxidation kinetics, which has previously been inferred only indirectly from apparent changes in reaction rates. It also allows us to evaluate the effects of antioxidant concentration and molecular architecture on the spatial heterogeneity of oxidative aging.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous phase separation and pattern formation in a lyotropic nematic mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyotropic liquid crystals can display rich phase behaviour and self-organisation, yet the physical principles underlying their self-assembly into large scale patterns remains understudied. Here, we combine theory, simulations and experiments on Sunset Yellow-water chromonic mixtures to show that such materials spontaneously phase separate, even without assuming any underlying microscopic attraction between the molecular species. In our minimal model, demixing depends solely on the Onsager-like coupling between local nematogen density and orientational order. If such a coupling is sufficiently strong, nematic defects trigger the nucleation of isotropic droplets, which then coalesce due to elastic or interfacial tensions. We further show that strong anchoring of the director field at the interface arrests this coarsening process, resulting in a stable microphase separated lamellar pattern. This self-assembled smectic phase has striking and unusual features, including spontaneous undulations, heterogeneous layer spacing, long-lived glassy defect patterns and lamellar onions. Our results identify orientational-density coupling and elastocapillarity as fundamental mechanisms to guide self-assembly in lyotropic and chromonic liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>Reentrance in a Hamiltonian flocking model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The clustering of self-motile and repulsive particles, so-called motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), is one of the clearest signatures of active physics. Typically, increasing the amplitude of self-motility increases the degree of clustering, however for high enough self-motility the homogeneous phase is reentered. Here, we report that such reentrance naturally emerges in a Hamiltonian (conservative) model known to recapitulate properties of (active) bird flocks, and exhibits clustering behaviour reminiscent of MIPS. We numerically demonstrate the reentrance of the homogeneous phase and identify the underlying mechanism as a competition between the amplitude of a spin-velocity coupled drive and mobility-limited kinetic frustration. Specifically, we reveal that strong spin-velocity coupling suppresses transverse diffusion, thereby leading the system into an arrest that closes the window for phase separation. Overall, our work offers a Hamiltonian, conservative, bridge between reentrant physics across equilibrium and non-equilibrium materials.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal many-body physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reciprocity is a fundamental symmetry present in many natural phenomena and engineered systems. Distinct situations where this symmetry is broken are typically grouped under the umbrella term "nonreciprocity", colloquially defined by: the action of A on B $\neq$ the action of B on A. In this review, we elucidate what nonreciprocity is by providing an introduction to its most salient classes: nonvariational dynamics, violations of Newton's third law, broken detailed balance, nonreciprocal responses and nonreciprocity of arbitrary linear operators. Next, we point out where to find these manifestations of non-reciprocity, from ensembles of particles with field mediated interactions to synthetic neural networks and open quantum systems. Given this breadth of contexts and the lack of an all-encompassing definition, it makes it all the more intriguing that some general conclusions can be gathered, when distinct definitions of nonreciprocity overlap. We explore what these universal consequences are with a special emphasis on collective phenomena that arise in nonreciprocal many-body systems. The topics covered include nonreciprocal phase transitions and non-normal amplification of noise and perturbations. We conclude with some open questions.</description>

      <title>A fast algorithm for 2D Rigidity Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rigidity Percolation is a crucial framework for describing rigidity transitions in amorphous systems. We present a new, efficient algorithm to study central-force Rigidity Percolation in two dimensions. This algorithm combines the Pebble Game algorithm, the Newman-Ziff approach to Connectivity Percolation, as well as novel rigorous results in rigidity theory, to exactly identify rigid clusters over the full bond concentration range, in a time that scales as $N^{1.02}$ for a system of $N$ nodes. We perform extensive numerical simulations with systems larger than $500$ million nodes, far beyond the previous limitations. We obtain new, precise estimates for the critical exponents, $\nu=1.1694(8)$ and $D_f=1.8423(7)$, and locate the critical threshold at $p_c = 0.6602741(4)$. Besides opening the way to further accurate numerical studies of Rigidity Percolation, our work provides new rigorous theoretical insights on specific cluster merging mechanisms that distinguish it from the standard Connectivity Percolation problem.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Diffusion in Driven Electrolytes due to Hydrodynamic Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of tracers arising from hydrodynamic fluctuations in a driven electrolyte is studied using a self-consistent field-theory framework in all dimensions. A plethora of scaling behaviour that includes two distinct regimes of anomalous diffusion is found, and the crossovers between them are characterized in terms of the different tuning parameters. A short-time ballistic regime is found to be accessible beyond two dimensions, whereas a long-time diffusive regime is found to be present only at four dimensions and above. The results showcase how long-ranged hydrodynamic interactions can dominate the dynamics of non-equilibrium steady states in ionic suspensions and produce strong fluctuations despite the presence of Debye screening.</description>

      <title>Soap Film Drainage Using a Centrifugal Thin Film Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface bubbles are an abundant source of aerosols, with important implications for climate processes. In this context, we investigate the stability and thinning dynamics of soap films under effective gravity fields. Experiments are performed using a centrifugal thin-film balance capable of generating accelerations from 0.2 up to 100 times standard gravity, combined with thin-film interferometry to obtain time-resolved thickness maps. Across all experimental conditions, the drainage dynamics are shown to be governed by capillary suction and marginal regeneration-a mechanism in which thick regions of the film are continuously replaced by thin film elements (TFEs) formed at the meniscus. We consistently recover a thickness ratio of 0.8-0.9 between the TFEs and the adjacent film, in agreement with previous observations under standard gravity. The measured thinning rates also follow the predicted scaling laws. We identified that effective gravity has three distinct effects: (i) it induces a strong stretching of the initial film, extending well beyond the linear-elastic regime; (ii) it controls the meniscus size, and thereby the amplitude of the capillary suction and the drainage rate; and (iii) it reveals an inertia-to-viscous transition in the motion of TFEs within the film. These results are supported by theoretical modeling and highlight the robustness of marginal regeneration and capillary-driven drainage under extreme gravity conditions.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic flows induced by localized torques (rotlets) in wedge-shaped geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wedge-shaped geometries in low-Reynolds-number flows are of increasing importance, for instance, in the design of microfluidic devices. The corresponding Green's functions describing the induced flow in response to a locally applied force were derived some time ago. To achieve a complete characterization of particle motion at low Reynolds numbers, we derive the flow response to locally applied torques. This is accomplished through a direct calculation based on the Fourier-Kontorovich-Lebedev transform using the Papkovich-Neuber representation of the hydrodynamic fields. We then illustrate the resulting flow fields, highlighting their structure, key features, and dependence on the geometry and orientation of the applied torque. Based on these solutions, we compute the corresponding hydrodynamic mobility tensor that couples torque and motion. Owing to the broken spatial symmetry imposed by the wedge-shaped confinement, a particle subjected to a torque will experience not only rotational motion but also translational motion. These results provide analytical tools relevant for predicting and controlling particle behavior in confined microfluidic environments.</description>
