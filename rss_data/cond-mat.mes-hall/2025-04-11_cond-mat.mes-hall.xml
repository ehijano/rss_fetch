      <title>Crystal fields, exchange, and dipolar interactions and noncollinear magnons of erbium oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the properties of magnons in erbium oxide, a noncollinear antiferromagnet, from an effective single-ion Hamiltonian, including exchange and long-range dipolar interactions. We parametrize the crystal field splitting of Er$_2$O$_3$ using Steven's operators and obtain the effective symmetry-dependent exchange constants between different erbium ions quenched by the crystal field at different symmetry sites. We apply the Holstein-Primakoff transformation to the noncollinear spin system and employ paraunitary diagonalization for the effective spin Hamiltonian. The addition of the dipolar interaction to the exchange magnon dispersion changes the magnon bands drastically. The long-range nature of the dipolar interaction provides challenges to convergence, however we find that the averaged and normalized difference in the magnon dispersion is less than an averaged factor of $10^{-6}$ if the dipolar interaction is included out to the fortieth nearest neighbor.</description>

      <title>Chirality-induced selectivity of angular momentum by orbital Edelstein effect in carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are promising materials exhibiting exceptional strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal properties, making them promising for various technologies. Besides achiral configurations with a zigzag or armchair edge, there exist chiral CNTs with a broken inversion symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that chiral CNTs exhibit chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS), which is caused by the orbital Edelstein effect and could be detected as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that the orbital Edelstein susceptibility is an odd function of the chirality angle of the nanotube and is proportional to its radius. For metallic CNTs close to the Fermi level, the orbital Edelstein susceptibility increases quadratically with energy. This makes the CISS and CIOS of metallic chiral nanotubes conveniently tunable by doping or applying a gate voltage, which allows for the generation of spin- and orbital-polarized currents. The possibility of generating large torques makes chiral CNTs interesting candidates for technological applications in spin-orbitronics and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Hallmarks of terahertz magnon currents in an antiferromagnetic insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient transport of spin angular momentum is expected to play a crucial role in future spintronic devices, which potentially operate at frequencies reaching the terahertz range. Antiferromagnetic insulators exhibit significant potential for facilitating ultrafast pure spin currents by terahertz magnons. Consequently, we here use femtosecond laser pulses to trigger ultrafast spin currents across antiferromagnetic NiO thin films in Py|NiO|Pt stacks, where permalloy (Py) and Pt serve as spin-current source and detector respectively. We find that the spin current pulses traversing NiO reach a velocity up to 40 nm/ps and experience increasing delay and broadening as the NiO thickness is increased. We can consistently explain our observations by ballistic transport of incoherent magnon. Our approach has high potential to characterize terahertz magnon transport in magnetic insulators with any kind of magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Effects of Berry Curvature and Orbital Magnetic Moment in the Magnetothermoelectric Transport of Bloch Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric transport coefficients up to linear order in the applied magnetic field are microscopically studied using Kubo-Luttinger linear response theory and thermal Green's functions. We derive exact formulas for the thermoelectric conductivity and thermal conductivity in the limit of small relaxation rates for Bloch electrons in terms of Bloch wave functions, which show that the Sommerfeld-Bethe relationship holds. Our final formula contains the Berry curvature contributions as well as the orbital magnetic moment contributions, that arise naturally from the microscopic theory. We show that generalized $f$-sum rules containing the Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment play essential roles in taking into account the interband effects of the magnetic field. As an application, we study a model of a gapped Dirac electron system with broken time-reversal symmetry and show the presence of a linear magnetothermopower in such systems.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Chiral Bobber Formation and Topological Proximity Effect in MnBi2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With topological materials being billed as the key to a new generation of nanoelectronics via either functional real-space topological structures (domain walls, skyrmions etc.) or via momentum-space topology (topological insulators), tailored and controllable topological properties are of paramount significance, since they lead to topologically protected states with negligible dissipation, enabling stable and non-volatile information processing. Here, we report on the evolution of topological magnetic textures in the proximity of other topological defects, i.e., antiferromagnetic domain walls in the topological insulator MnBi2Te4. The transition from the antiferromagnetic ground state to a canted antiferromagnetic state at finite magnetic fields is accompanied by the formation of chiral bobbers - bulk-terminated topological defects adjacent to the domain walls in this system, leading to a topological proximity effect.</description>

      <title>Monitored quantum transport: full counting statistics of a quantum Hall interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the Levitov-Lesovik formula for the probability distribution function of the electron charge transferred through a phase coherent conductor, to include projective measurements that monitor the chiral propagation in quantum Hall edge modes. When applied to an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the monitoring reduces the visibility of the Aharonov-Bohm conductance oscillations while preserving the binomial form of the counting statistics, thereby removing a fundamental shortcoming of the dephasing-probe model of decoherence.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Coulomb drag in odd electron liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of Coulomb drag resistance in bilayers of electron liquids with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. In the hydrodynamic regime, the viscosity tensor of such fluids has a nonvanishing odd component. In this scenario, fluctuating viscous stresses drive the propagation of plasmons, whose dispersion relations are modified by nondissipative odd viscous waves. Coulomb coupling of electron density fluctuations induces a drag force exerted by one layer on the other in the presence of a steady flow. This drag force can be expressed through the dynamic structure factor of the electron liquid, which is peaked at frequencies corresponding to plasmon resonances in the bilayer. As a result, the drag resistivity depends on the dissipationless odd viscosity of the fluid. We quantify this effect and present a general theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations applicable to odd electron liquids, both with and without Galilean invariance.</description>

      <title>Stacking-induced ferroelectricity in tetralayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have reported emergent ferroelectric behavior in twisted or moir\'e-engineered graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures, yet the microscopic origin of this effect remains under debate. Pristine mono- or few-layer graphene lacks a permanent dipole due to its centrosymmetric lattice, making the emergence of ferroelectricity unlikely. However, mixed-stacked graphene, such as the ABCB tetralayer configuration, breaks both inversion and mirror symmetry and has been theoretically predicted to support electrically switchable dipoles. ABCB graphene represents the simplest natural graphene polytype exhibiting intrinsic out-of-plane polarization, arising from asymmetric charge carrier distribution across its layers. Here, we report robust ferroelectric behavior in dual-gated, non-aligned ABCB tetralayer graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride. The device exhibits pronounced hysteresis in resistance under both top and bottom gate modulation, with the effect persisting up to room temperature. This hysteresis originates from reversible layer-polarized charge reordering, driven by gate-induced transitions between ABCB and BCBA stacking configurations -- without requiring moir\'e superlattices. Our findings establish stacking-order-induced symmetry breaking as a fundamental route to electronic ferroelectricity in graphene and open pathways for non-volatile memory applications based on naturally occurring mixed-stacked multilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry: Revisiting electronic scales in quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic properties of solids are often well understood via the low energy dispersion of Bloch bands, motivating single band approximations in many metals and semiconductors. However, a closer look reveals new length and time scales introduced by quantum dipole fluctuations due to interband mixing, which are reflected in the momentum space textures of the electronic wavefunctions. This structure is usually referred to as quantum geometry. The scales introduced by geometry not only qualitatively modify the linear and nonlinear responses of a material but can also have a vital role in determining the many-body ground state. This review explores how quantum geometry impacts properties of materials and outlines recent experimental advances that have begun to explore quantum geometric effects in various condensed matter platforms. We discuss the separation of scales that can allow us to estimate the significance of quantum geometry in various response functions.</description>

      <title>Noise-Aware Entanglement Generation Protocols for Superconducting Qubits with Impedance-Matched FBAR Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connecting superconducting quantum processors to telecommunications-wavelength quantum networks is critically necessary to enable distributed quantum computing, secure communications, and other applications. Optically-mediated entanglement heralding protocols offer a near-term solution that can succeed with imperfect components, including sub-unity efficiency microwave-optical quantum transducers. The viability and performance of these protocols relies heavily on the properties of the transducers used: the conversion efficiency, resonator lifetimes, and added noise in the transducer directly influence the achievable entanglement generation rate and fidelity of an entanglement generation protocol. Here, we use an extended Butterworth-van Dyke (BVD) model to optimize the conversion efficiency and added noise of a Thin Film Bulk Acoustic Resonator (FBAR) piezo-optomechanical transducer. We use the outputs from this model to calculate the fidelity of one-photon and two-photon entanglement heralding protocols in a variety of operating regimes. For transducers with matching circuits designed to either minimize the added noise or maximize conversion efficiency, we theoretically estimate that entanglement generation rates of greater than $160\;\mathrm{kHz}$ can be achieved at moderate pump powers with fidelities of $&gt;90\%$. This is the first time a BVD equivalent circuit model is used to both optimize the performance of an FBAR transducer and to directly inform the design and implementation of an entanglement generation protocol. These results can be applied in the near term to realize quantum networks of superconducting qubits with realistic experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Low-voltage Ferroelectric Field-Effect Transistors with Ultrathin Aluminum Scandium Nitride and 2D channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continued evolution of CMOS technology demands materials and architectures that emphasize low power consumption, particularly for computations involving large scale data processing and multivariable optimization. Ferroelectric materials offer promising solutions through enabling dual-purpose memory units capable of performing both storage and logic operations. In this study, we demonstrate ferroelectric field effect transistors (FeFETs) with MoS2 monolayer channels fabricated on ultrathin 5 nm and 10 nm ferroelectric Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) films. By decreasing the thickness of the ferroelectric film, we achieve significantly reduced gate voltages (&lt;3V) required to switch the conductance of the devices, enabling operation at low voltages compatible with advanced CMOS. We observe a characteristic crossover in hysteresis behavior that varies with film thickness, channel fabrication method, and environmental conditions. Through systematic investigation of multiple parameters including channel fabrication methods, dimensional scaling, and environmental effects, we provide pathways to improve device performance. While our devices demonstrate clear ferroelectric switching behavior, further optimization is required to enhance the ON/OFF ratio at zero gate voltage while continuing to reduce the coercive field of these ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic-temperature Grain-to-grain Epitaxial Growth of High-quality Ultrathin CoFe Layer on MgO Tunnel Barrier for High-performance Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One candidate for ultimate non-volatile memory with ultralow power consumption is magneto-resistive random-access memory (VC-MRAM). To develop VC-MRAM, it is important to fabricate high-performance magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs), which require the epitaxial growth of an ultrathin ferromagnetic electrode on a crystalline tunnel barrier using a mass-manufacturing-compatible process. In this study, the grain-to-grain epitaxial growth of perpendicularly magnetized CoFe ultrathin films on polycrystalline MgO (001) was demonstrated using cryogenic-temperature sputtering on 300 mm Si wafers. Cryogenic-temperature sputtering at 100 K suppressed the island-like initial growth of CoFe on MgO without hampering epitaxy. Sub-nanometer-thick CoFe layers exhibited remarkable perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). An even larger PMA was obtained using an Fe-doped MgO (MgFeO) tunnel barrier owing to improved uniformity of the CoFe layer. A 0.8-nm-thick CoFe layer grown on MgFeO exhibited a magnetic damping constant as low as 0.008. The ultralow magnetic damping enables voltage-driven magnetization switching with a low write-error rate (WER) below 10^-6 at a pulse duration of 0.3 ns, and WER on the order of 10^-3 even for a relatively long pulse duration of 1.5 ns. These properties achieved using a mass-manufacturing deposition process can promote the development of VC-MRAM and other advanced spintronic devices based on MTJs.</description>

      <title>Atomic structure analysis of PL5 in silicon carbide with single-spin spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Divacancy (VV) spin defects in 4H polytype of silicon carbide (4H-SiC) are emerging candidates for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Among these defects, PL5 and PL6 stand out due to their superior charge stability and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) properties at room temperature. However, their atomic structures remain unresolved, with ongoing controversy regarding their potential association with stacking faults. Previous measurements relying on spin ensemble detection are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In this study, we conduct correlative imaging of stacking faults and PL5-6 at single-defect level, conclusively demonstrating that PL5-6 are not associated with stacking faults. Further investigation of PL5 through single-spin ODMR spectroscopy allows us to determine its six spatial orientations, as well as to measure the orientation of its transverse anisotropy spin splitting (E) and the statistical distribution of hyperfine splitting. These results and ab initio calculations suggest that PL5 should be VsiVc(hk) divacancy coupled with a nearby antisite atom (VVA). The structure resolution of PL5 starts the first step toward its controllable fabrication, paving the way for various applications.</description>

      <title>Ground State Energy of Helium Using a Four-Qubit Photonic Processor with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand the properties and interactions of materials, and determining the ground state energies is one of the important challenges in quantum chemistry, materials science, and quantum mechanics, where quantum computing can play an important role for studying the properties of materials. In this study, we have explored the quantum processor application to compute the Helium (He) molecule ground state energy which utilizes the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm. In here, we have implemented VQE on a state-of-the-art quantum processor, optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit to minimize the energy expectation value of the He molecule's Hamiltonian on the four qubits processor. The obtained results of this work show a significant improvement in accuracy compared to classical computational methods, such as Hartree-Fock and density functional theory, which demonstrate the compute potential of quantum algorithms in quantum many-body problems. Thus, these results demonstrate the advantages of quantum computing in achieving high accuracy in simulations of molecular and material properties, and pave the way for future applications in more complex systems. This work highlights the potential of quantum processors in the fields of quantum chemistry, computational physics, and data science.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative quantum theory of multiplasmonic electron emission from surfaces: Gauge-specific cumulant expansions vs. Volkov ansatz over plasmonic coherent states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energetic electromagnetic fields produce a variety of elementary excitations in solids that can strongly modify their primary photoemission spectra. Such is the plasmon excitation or pumping mechanism which, although indirect, is very efficient and hence may give rise to formation of plasmonic coherent states. In turn, these states may act as a source or sink of energy and momentum for escaping electrons. Starting from the model Hamiltonian approach we show that prepumped plasmonic bath of coherent states gives rise to ponderomotive potentials and Floquet electronic band structure that support multiple plasmon-induced electron emission or plasmoemission from metals. Theoretical description of multiple plasmoemission requires a nonperturbative approch which is here formulated by applying cumulant expansion and Volkov ansatz to the calculations of electron wavefunctions and emission rates. The calculations are performed in the standard length gauge as well as in the Pauli-transformed velocity gauge for electron-plasmon interaction. The applicability of two nonperturbative approaches to calculation of excitation amplitudes are examined in each gauge. They smoothly interpolate between the fully quantal first order Born approximation and semiclassical multiplasmon-induced electron excitation limit. This is illustrated on the example of plasmoemission from Floquet surface bands on Ag(111) from which this channel of electron yield has been detected. Our calculations indicate that even subsingle mode occupations of plasmonic coherent states can support multiplasmon electron emission from surface bands. A way of calibration of plasmonic coherent states is proposed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using first-principles calculations, we examine the electronic structure of quasi-one-dimensional fullerene nanoribbons derived from two-dimensional fullerene networks. Depending on the edge geometry and width, these nanoribbons exhibit a rich variety of properties, including direct and indirect band gaps, positive and negative effective masses, as well as dispersive and flat bands. Our findings establish a comprehensive understanding of the electronic properties of fullerene nanoribbons, with potential implications for the design of future nanoscale devices.</description>

      <title>A Novel Graphyne-Like Carbon Allotrope: 2D Dewar-Anthracyne</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anthracyne (2DDA). 2DDA consists of chains of Dewar-anthracenes connected by acetylenic linkages. DFT-based simulations show that 2DDA is thermally stable and exhibits no imaginary phonon modes, confirming its dynamic stability. 2DDA is metallic with Dirac-like features near the Fermi level, dominated by C pz orbitals. It shows marked mechanical anisotropy, with Young's modulus of 176.24 N/m (x) and 31.51 N/m (y), shear modulus up to 69.14 N/m, and Poisson's ratio varying from 0.27 to 0.87. The material also exhibits strong anisotropic optical absorption in the visible and ultraviolet ranges. Raman and IR spectra reveal intense bands at 648 cm-1 (Raman) and 1292 cm-1 (Infrared). Nanoribbon structures derived from 2DDA exhibit diverse electronic behaviors, from metals up to bandgap values of up to 0.42 eV, depending on the edge-type terminations and width. These findings demonstrate the 2DDA potential for nanoelectronic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Localized quasiparticles in a fluxonium with quasi-two-dimensional amorphous kinetic inductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered superconducting materials with high kinetic inductance are an important resource to generate nonlinearity in quantum circuits and create high-impedance environments. In thin films fabricated from these materials, the combination of disorder and the low effective dimensionality leads to increased order parameter fluctuations and enhanced kinetic inductance values. Among the challenges of harnessing these compounds in coherent devices are their proximity to the superconductor-insulator phase transition, the presence of broken Cooper pairs, and the two-level systems located in the disordered structure. In this work, we fabricate tungsten silicide wires from quasi-two-dimensional films with one spatial dimension smaller than the superconducting coherence length and embed them into microwave resonators and fluxonium qubits, where the kinetic inductance provides the inductive part of the circuits. We study the dependence of loss on the frequency, disorder, and geometry of the device, and find that the loss increases with the level of disorder and is dominated by the localized quasiparticles trapped in the spatial variations of the superconducting gap.</description>

      <title>Self-correcting GKP qubit and gates in a driven-dissipative circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a self-correcting GKP qubit can be realized with a high-impedance LC circuit coupled to a resistor and a Josephson junction via a controllable switch. When activating the switch in a particular stepwise pattern, the resonator relaxes into a subspace of GKP states that encode a protected qubit. Under continued operation, the resistor dissipatively error-corrects the qubit against bit flips and decoherence by absorbing noise-induced entropy. We show that this leads to an exponential enhancement of coherence time (T1 and T2), even in the presence of extrinsic noise, imperfect control, and device parameter variations. We show the qubit supports exponentially robust single-qubit Clifford gates, implemented via appropriate control of the switch, and readout/initialization via supercurrent measurement. The qubit's self-correcting properties allows it to operate at ~1K temperatures and resonator Q factors down to ~1000 for realistic parameters, and make it amenable to parallel control through global control signals. We discuss how the effects of quasiparticle poisoning -- potentially, though not necessarily, a limiting factor -- might be mitigated. We finally demonstrate that a related device supports a self-correcting magic T gate.</description>

      <title>Superballistic conduction in hydrodynamic antidot graphene superlattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viscous electron flow exhibits exotic signatures such as superballistic conduction. In order to observe hydrodynamics effects, a 2D device where the current flow is as inhomogeneous as possible is desirable. To this end, we build three antidot graphene superlattices with different hole diameters. We measure their electrical properties at various temperatures and under the effect of a perpendicular magnetic field. We find an enhanced superballistic effect, suggesting the effectiveness of the geometry at bending the electron flow. In addition, superballistic conduction, which is related to a transition from a non-collective to a collective regime of transport, behaves non-monotonically with the magnetic field. We also analyze the device resistance as a function of the size of the antidot superlattice to find characteristic scaling laws describing the different transport regimes. We prove that the antidot superlattice is a convenient geometry for realizing hydrodynamic flow and provide valuable explanations for the technologically relevant effects of superballistic conduction and scaling laws.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a universal microscopic model for the shallow confinement regime of single-electron tunneling devices. We consider particle escape from a quantum well generically emerging as a bifurcation in a smooth electrostatic potential and develop a set of analytic and numerical approximations for the ground-state tunneling and thermally activated escape rates. These approximations are applied to the problem of electron capture by a closing tunnel barrier where the competition between the closing speed and the escape rate defines a scaling relation for the capture fidelity. Effective one-dimensional cubic potential approximation leads to a universal form of this scaling relation in terms of device-independent dimensionless depth and speed parameters. Using predictions for temperature and magnetic-field dependence we show how to infer the energy scales of cubic longitudinal and quadratic transverse confinement. Finally, we derive an intrinsic quantum speed bound for adiabatic protection of the ground state tunneling and show that the latter can potentially be exploited up to the break down of confinement with a practical speed limit set by reaching the quantum uncertainty of the barrier height before the onset of non-adiabatic excitation. These results contribute to mapping out the physical limits of single-electron quantum technologies for electrical metrology and sensing.</description>

      <title>Elastic Screening of Pseudogauge Fields in Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lattice deformations in graphene couple to the low-energy electronic degrees of freedom as effective scalar and gauge fields. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the optical component of the displacement field, i.e., the relative motion of different sublattices, contributes at equal order as the acoustic component and effectively screens the pseudogauge fields. In particular, we consider twisted bilayer graphene and corrugated monolayer graphene. In both cases, optical lattice displacements significantly reduce the overall magnitude of the pseudomagnetic fields. For corrugated graphene, optical contributions also reshape the pseudomagnetic field and significantly modify the electronic bands near charge neutrality. Previous studies based on continuum elasticity, which ignores this effect, have therefore systematically overestimated the strength of the strain-induced pseudomagnetic field. Our results have important consequences for the interpretation of experiments and design of straintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Crossed Andreev reflection in collinear $p$-wave magnet/triplet superconductor junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a fundamental quantum transport phenomenon that holds significant implications for spintronics and superconducting devices. However, its experimental detection and enhancement remain challenging. Recently, magnetic materials exhibiting $p$-wave magnetic ordering, distinct from conventional spin-orbit coupling, referred to as $p$-wave magnets, have attracted considerable interest. In this work, we propose a junction consisting of $p$-wave magnets and a triplet superconductor as a promising platform to enhance CAR. The setup features a triplet superconductor sandwiched between two collinear $p$-wave magnets rotated by $180^\circ$ relative to each other, allowing for precise control over transport processes. We demonstrate that CAR can dominate over electron tunneling (ET) within specific parameter regimes, such as the orientation angle of the $p$-wave magnets and their chemical potential. Enhanced CAR occurs when the constant energy contours of the two spins in the $p$-wave magnets are well-separated. Furthermore, the conductivities display Fabry-P\'erot-type oscillations due to interference effects, with CAR diminishing as the length of the superconductor exceeds the decay length of the wavefunctions. These findings underscore the potential of collinear $p$-wave magnet-superconductor junctions as a robust platform for the experimental investigation and enhancement of CAR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a disordered magnetic Weyl semimetal may be mapped onto a two-dimensional array of coupled replicated Hubbard chains, where the Hubbard $U$ is directly related to the variance of the disorder potential. This is a three-dimensional generalization of a similar mapping of the two-dimensional quantum Hall plateau transition to a one-dimensional Hubbard chain. We demonstrate that this mapping leads to the conclusion that the Weyl semimetal becomes a diffusive metal with a nonzero density of states at arbitrarily weak disorder, in agreement with recent work. We also discuss the absence of localization in strongly disordered Weyl semimetals from the viewpoint of this mapping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge-to-spin and spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms in high spin-orbit materials are the new frontier of memory devices. They operate via spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching of a magnetic electrode, driven by an applied charge current. In this work, we propose a novel memory device based on the semiconducting two-dimensional centrosymmetric transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) MoS2, that operates as a SOT device in the writing process and a spin valve in the reading process. We demonstrate that stable voltage states at room temperature can be deterministically controlled by a switching current density as low as 3.2x10^4 A/cm^2 even in zero field, owed to a tilted geometry and a differential voltage architecture. An applied field of 50-100 Oe can be used as a characterizing control parameter for the state switching. Ab initio calculations of spin Hall effect (SHE) and orbital Hall effect (OHE) point to the latter as the most likely responsible for the generation of the SOT in the magnetic electrode. The large value of OHC in bulk MoS2 makes our device competitive in terms of energetic efficiency and could be integrated in TMD heterostructures to design memory devices with multiple magnetization states for non-Boolean computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics is concerned with heat and work exchange between a quantum coherent system and heat reservoirs or work agents. In stochastic thermodynamics a key object of interest is the statistics of these quantities, but it is notoriously difficult to measure it in general systems. Here we discuss the prospect for measuring work statistics in electronic devices, via a study of a transmon-microcavity system. The microwave cavity acts as a work agent, exchanging work with the transmon. We formulate a protocol to measure the first moments of work $\langle W^n \rangle$ via photon number detection. We find conditions for capturing quantum coherence in the work statistics. Interestingly, by measuring higher moments one can verify the Jarzynski equality $\langle e^{-W/T} \rangle = 1$ including quantum interference. Our work opens a way for measuring work statistics in nontrivial quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Dynamics of a ferromagnetic macrospin (e.g., a free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)) can be described in terms of equivalent capacitor charge $Q$ and inductor flux $\Phi$, in a manner similar to a standard electric LC circuit, but with strongly nonlinear and coupled capacitance and inductance. This description allows for the inclusion of Gilbert damping and spin transfer torques and yields a relatively simple equivalent electric circuit, which can be easily modeled in LTspice or other electrical engineering software. It allows one to easily simulate advanced electrical circuits containing MTJs and conventional electronic components in standard simulation software.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents an equivalent circuit model for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) that accurately captures their magnetization dynamics and electrical behavior. Implemented in LTspice, the model is validated against direct numerical solutions of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. It effectively simulates essential spintronic phenomena, including ferromagnetic resonance, field- and spin-torque-induced switching, and spin-torque-induced oscillations. Simulation results demonstrate strong agreement between LTspice and LLGS solutions, confirming the model accuracy and utility for efficient circuit-level analysis of spintronic devices. The ability to incorporate time-dependent magnetic fields and voltage inputs makes the proposed model suitable for diverse applications such as neuromorphic computing, microwave signal processing, and spintronic memory technologies. By providing a computationally efficient yet physically accurate circuit representation, this work enables seamless integration of MTJs into larger electronic systems, potentially accelerating the development of advanced spintronic circuit architectures.</description>

Abstract: In our work, we study magnon transport induced by light through Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect, including magnon spin photocurrent (MSPC) and magnon energy photocurrent (MEPC). Firstly, we regard the effect of the electric field on the magnon through the AC effect as a perturbation. Then we derived the expressions of MSPC and MEPC in two-dimensional collinear ferromagnetic system. And we apply our theory to the two-dimension ferromagnetic Hexagonal and Kagome lattice. We find that the optical frequency and the relaxation time of the material can be used to control the photo-transport of magnons. In addition, under the condition of low light frequncy and infinite relaxation time, the longitudinal magnon photo-transport is related to the topological property of the magnon system.</description>

      <title>Magnon spectroscopy in the electron microscope</title>

Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06038v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or higher and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz despite a low temperature of 35 mK and a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes. These unexpected results are caused by axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. By comparing the axion effect with thermal effect on the width $\Delta B$, we have shown the dominance of the axion effect over thermal effect at low temperature less than $50$mK. The dominance of the axion effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional steep-slope spintronic transistors with spin-gapless-semiconductor or spin-gapped-metal electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) are a promising class of materials for spintronic applications, enabling functions beyond conventional electronics. This study introduces a novel design for multifunctional spintronic field-effect transistors (FETs) using SGSs and/or spin-gapped metals (SGMs) as source and drain electrodes. These devices operate similarly to metal-semiconductor Schottky barrier FETs, where a potential barrier forms between the SGS (or SGM) electrode and the semiconducting channel. Unlike traditional Schottky barrier FETs, these devices utilize the unique spin-dependent transport properties of SGS/SGM electrodes to achieve sub-60 mV/dec switching, overcoming the 60 mV/dec sub-threshold swing limit in MOSFETs for low-voltage operation. Additionally, SGMs contribute a negative differential resistance (NDR) effect with an ultra-high peak-to-valley current ratio. The proposed spintronic FETs combine sub-60 mV/dec switching, non-local giant magnetoresistance (GMR), and NDR, making them suitable for applications like logic-in-memory computing and multivalued logic. These properties support computing architectures beyond the von-Neumann model, enabling efficient data processing. Two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials provide a promising platform for these multifunctional FETs. We screen a computational 2D materials database to identify suitable SGS and SGM materials, selecting VS$2$ as the SGS for simulations. Using a non-equilibrium Green's function method with density functional theory, we simulate transfer ($I{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{G}}$) and output ($I_{\mathrm{D}}$-$V_{\mathrm{D}}$) characteristics of a VS$_2$/Ga$_2$O$_2$ FET based on 2D type-II SGS VS$_2$, predicting a sub-threshold swing of 20 mV/dec, a high on/off ratio of 10$^8$, and a notable non-local GMR effect, demonstrating potential for low-power, high-performance applications.</description>

      <title>Feedback controlled microengine powered by motor protein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a template for realization of a novel microengine which is able to harness and convert the activity driven movement of individual motor protein into work output of the system. This engine comprises of a micron size bead-motor protein complex that is subject to a time-varying, feedback controlled optical potential, and a driving force due to the action of the motor protein which stochastically binds, walks and unbinds to an underlying microtubule filament. Using a Stochastic thermodynamics framework and theoretical modeling of bead-motor transport in a harmonic optical trap potential, we obtain the engine characteristics, e.g., work output per cycle, power generated, efficiency and the probability distribution function of the work output as a function of motor parameters and optical trap stiffness. The proposed engine is a work-to-work converter. Remarkably, the performance of this engine can vastly supersede the performance of other microengines that have been realized so far for feasible biological parameter range for kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 motor proteins. In particular, the work output per cycle is ~ (10-15) k_b T while the power output is (5-8) k_b T s^{-1}. Furthermore, we find that even with time delay in feedback protocol, the performance of the engine remains robust as long as the delay time is much smaller than the Brownian relaxation time of the micron size bead. Indeed such low delay time in feedback in the optical trap setup can easily be achieved with current Infrared (IR) lasers and optical trap sensor. The average work output and power output of the engine, exhibits interesting non-monotonic dependence on motor velocity and optical trap stiffness. As such this motor protein driven microengine can be a promising potential prototype for fabricating an actual microdevice engine which can have practical utility.</description>

      <title>A first principles approach to electromechanics in liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromechanics in fluids describes the response of the number density to electric fields, and thus provides a powerful means by which to control the behavior of liquids. While continuum approaches have proven successful in describing electromechanical phenomena in macroscopic bodies, their use is questionable when relevant length scales become comparable to a system's natural correlation lengths, as commonly occurs in, e.g., biological systems, nanopores, and microfluidics. Here, we present a first principles theory for electromechanical phenomena in fluids. Our approach is based on the recently proposed hyperdensity functional theory [Samm\"uller et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 098201 (2024)] in which we treat the charge density as an observable of the system, with the intrinsic Helmholtz free energy functional dependent upon both density and electrostatic potential. Expressions for the coupling between number and charge densities emerge naturally in this formalism, avoiding the need to construct density-dependent and spatially-varying material parameters such as the dielectric constant. Furthermore, we make our theory practical by deriving a connection between hyperdensity functional theory and local molecular field theory, which facilitates machine learning explicit representations for the free energy functionals of systems with short-ranged electrostatic interactions, with long-ranged effects accounted for in a well-controlled mean field fashion.</description>

      <title>Direct-Write Printed Contacts to Layered and 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in fabrication methods have shaped new computing device technologies. Among these methods, depositing electrical contacts to the channel material is fundamental to device characterization. Novel layered and two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising for next-generation computing electronic channel materials. Direct-write printing of conductive inks is introduced as a surprisingly effective, significantly faster, and cleaner method to contact different classes of layered materials, including graphene (semi-metal), MoS2 (semiconductor), Bi-2212 (superconductor), and Fe5GeTe2 (metallic ferromagnet). Based on the electrical response, the quality of the printed contacts is comparable to what is achievable with resist-based lithography techniques. These devices are tested by sweeping gate voltage, temperature, and magnetic field to show that the materials remain pristine post-processing. This work demonstrates that direct-write printing is an agile method for prototyping and characterizing the electrical properties of novel layered materials.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and non-thermal states in cryogenic cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of photons in a cryogenic cavity, made by cryo-cooled mirrors surrounded by a room temperature environment. We model such a system as a multimode cavity coupled to two thermal reservoirs at different temperatures. Using a Lindblad master equation approach, we derive the photon distribution and the statistical properties of the cavity modes, finding an overall non-thermal state described by a mode-dependent effective temperature. We also calculate the dissipation rates arising from the interaction of the cavity field with the external environment and the mirrors, relating such rates to measurable macroscopic quantities. These results provide a simple theory to calculate the dissipative properties and the effective temperature of a cavity coupled to different thermal reservoirs, offering potential pathways for engineering dissipations and photon statistics in cavity settings.</description>
