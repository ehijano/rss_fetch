      <title>Molecule Mixture Detection and Design for MC Systems with Non-linear, Cross-reactive Receiver Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air-based molecular communication (MC) has the potential to be one of the first MC systems to be deployed in real-world applications, enabled by commercially available sensors. However, these sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive behavior, contrary to the idealizing assumption of linear and perfectly molecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature. To address this mismatch, we propose several detectors and transmission schemes for a molecule mixture communication system where the receiver (RX) employs non-linear, cross-reactive sensors. All proposed schemes are based on the first- and second-order moments of the symbol likelihoods that are fed through the non-linear RX using the Unscented Transform. In particular, we propose an approximate maximum likelihood (AML) symbol-by-symbol detector for inter-symbol-interference (ISI)-free transmission scenarios and a complementary mixture alphabet design algorithm which accounts for the RX characteristics. When significant ISI is present at high data rates, the AML detector can be adapted to exploit statistical ISI knowledge. Additionally, we propose a sequence detector which combines information from multiple symbol intervals. For settings where sequence detection is not possible due to extremely limited computational power at the RX, we propose an adaptive transmission scheme which can be combined with symbol-by-symbol detection. Using computer simulations, we validate all proposed detectors and algorithms based on the responses of commercially available sensors as well as artificially generated sensor data incorporating the characteristics of metal-oxide semiconductor sensors. By employing a general system model that accounts for transmitter noise, ISI, and general non-linear, cross-reactive RX arrays, this work enables reliable communication for a large class of MC systems.</description>

      <title>Parallelizable Search-Space Decomposition for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems Using Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are crucial in industry. However, many COPs are NP-hard, causing the search space to grow exponentially with problem size and rendering large-scale instances computationally intractable. Conventional solvers typically treat problems as monolithic entities, leading to significant efficiency degradation as structural complexity increases. To address this issue, we propose a novel search-space decomposition method that leverages the inherent structure of variables to systematically reduce the size of the master problem. We formulate interaction costs between variables and individual variable costs as a constrained maximum cut problem and convert it into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization formulation using penalty terms. An Ising-model solver is used to rapidly decompose the problem into independent small-scale subproblems, which are subsequently solved in parallel using mathematical optimization solvers. We validated this method on the capacitated vehicle routing problem. Results demonstrate three significant benefits: a substantial enhancement in feasible solution rates, accelerated convergence, achieving in 1 min the accuracy that the naive method required 30 min to reach, and a variable reduction of up to 95.32\%. These findings suggest that search-space decomposition is a promising strategy for efficiently solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>CCCL: Node-Spanning GPU Collectives with CXL Memory Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) training or inference across multiple nodes introduces significant pressure on GPU memory and interconnect bandwidth. The Compute Express Link (CXL) shared memory pool offers a scalable solution by enabling memory sharing across nodes, reducing over-provisioning and improving resource utilization. We propose \name, a collective communication library, leveraging the CXL shared memory pool to support cross-node GPU operations without relying on traditional RDMA-based networking. Our design addresses the challenges on synchronization, data interleaving, and communication parallelization faced by using the CXL shared memory pool for collective communications. Evaluating on multiple nodes with a TITAN-II CXL switch and six Micron CZ120 memory cards, we show that \name achieves highly efficient collective operations across hosts, demonstrating CXL's potential for scalable, memory-centric GPU communication. Our evaluation demonstrates that \name achieves average performance improvements of 1.34$\times$ for AllGather, 1.84$\times$ for Broadcast, 1.94$\times$ for Gather, and 1.04$\times$ for Scatter, compared to the original RDMA-based implementation over 200 Gbps InfiniBand. \textcolor{dong}{In addition, the evaluation with a case of LLM training shows 1.11$\times$ speedup compared with the InfiniBand while saving production cost by $2.75\times$ in hardware.}</description>

      <title>The Road to Useful Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building a useful quantum computer is a grand science and engineering challenge, currently pursued intensely by teams around the world. In the 1980s, Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin observed independently that computers based on quantum mechanics might enable better simulations of quantum phenomena. Their vision remained an intellectual curiosity until Peter Shor published his famous quantum algorithm for integer factoring, and shortly thereafter a proof that errors in quantum computations can be corrected. Since then, quantum computing R&amp;D has progressed rapidly, from small-scale experiments in university physics laboratories to well-funded industrial efforts and prototypes. Hype notwithstanding, quantum computers have yet to solve scientifically or practically important problems -- a target often called quantum utility. In this article, we describe the capabilities of contemporary quantum computers, compare them to the requirements of quantum utility, and illustrate how to track progress from today to utility. We highlight key science and engineering challenges on the road to quantum utility, touching on relevant aspects of our own research.</description>

      <title>Does the testing environment matter? Carsickness across on-road, test-track, and driving simulator conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carsickness has gained significant attention with the rise of automated vehicles, prompting extensive research across on-road, test-track, and driving simulator environments to understand its occurrence and develop mitigation strategies. However, the lack of carsickness standardization complicates comparisons across studies and environments. Previous works demonstrate measurement validity between two setups at most (e.g., on-road vs. driving simulator), leaving gaps in multi-environment comparisons. This study investigates the recreation of an on-road motion sickness exposure - previously replicated on a test track - using a motion-based driving simulator. Twenty-eight participants performed an eyes-off-road non-driving task while reporting motion sickness using the Misery Scale during the experiment and the Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire afterward. Psychological factors known to influence motion sickness were also assessed. The results present subjective and objective measurements for motion sickness across the considered environments. In this paper, acceleration measurements, objective metrics and subjective motion sickness ratings across environments are compared, highlighting key differences in sickness occurrence for simulator-based research validity. Significantly lower motion sickness scores are reported in the simulator compared to on-road and test-track conditions, due to its limited working envelope to reproduce low-frequency (&lt;0.5 Hz) motions, which are the most provocative for motion sickness.</description>

      <title>Continuous Blood Monitoring with Particle-based Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the circulatory system functions as a continuous source of physiological data, contemporary diagnostics remain bound to intermittent, time-delayed assessments. To resolve this, we present a framework for ubiquitous hematological profiling driven by Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC). We demonstrate how electromagnetic signals can be exploited to monitor blood in real-time, effectively converting them into diagnostic tools. We analyze the biological foundations of blood, review existing Complete Blood Count (CBC) and sensing technologies, and detail a novel pipeline for continuous blood monitoring. Furthermore, we discuss the potential applications of deploying these devices to enable real-time CBC and biomarker detection, ultimately revolutionizing how we predict, detect, and manage individual and public health.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy of Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Classical Recommendation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the differential privacy (DP) of the quantum recommendation algorithm of Kerenidis--Prakash and its quantum-inspired classical counterpart. Under standard low-rank and incoherence assumptions on the preference matrix, we show that the randomness already present in the algorithms' measurement/$\ell_2$-sampling steps can act as a privacy-curating mechanism, yielding $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-DP without injecting additional DP noise through the interface. Concretely, for a system with $m$ users and $n$ items and rank parameter $k$, we prove $\varepsilon=\mathcal O(\sqrt{k/n})$ and $\delta= \mathcal O\big(k^2/\min^2\{m,n\}\big)$; in the typical regime $k=\mathrm{polylog}(m,n)$ this simplifies to $\varepsilon=\tilde{\mathcal O}(1/\sqrt n)$ and $\delta=\tilde{\mathcal O}\big(1/\min^2\{m,n\}\big)$. Our analysis introduces a perturbation technique for truncated SVD under a single-entry update, which tracks the induced change in the low-rank reconstruction while avoiding unstable singular-vector comparisons. Finally, we validate the scaling on real-world rating datasets and compare against classical DP recommender baselines.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Monitor: Mixed Reality Visualization and Multimodal AI for Enhanced Digital Pathology Workflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pathologists diagnose cancer using gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs), but the current digital workflow is fragmented. These multiscale datasets often exceed 100,000 x 100,000 pixels, yet standard 2D monitors restrict the field of view. This disparity forces constant panning and zooming, which increases cognitive load and disrupts diagnostic momentum. We introduce PathVis, a mixed-reality platform for Apple Vision Pro that unifies this ecosystem into a single immersive environment. PathVis replaces indirect mouse navigation with embodied interaction, utilizing eye gaze, natural hand gestures, and voice commands to explore gigapixel data. The system integrates multimodal AI agents to support computer-aided diagnosis: a content-based image retrieval engine spatially displays similar patient cases for side-by-side prognostic comparison, while a conversational assistant provides real-time interpretation. By merging immersive visualization with integrated AI capabilities, PathVis shows promise in streamlining diagnostic workflows and mitigating the burden of context switching. This paper presents the system architecture and a preliminary qualitative evaluation demonstrating the platform's feasibility. The PathVis source code and a demo video are publicly available at: https://github.com/jaiprakash1824/Path_Vis.</description>

      <title>A Review on Quantum Circuit Optimization using ZX-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20663v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates, and circuit depth). Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization.
  We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization. For researchers in quantum computing, we classify and explain existing circuit optimization techniques.</description>
