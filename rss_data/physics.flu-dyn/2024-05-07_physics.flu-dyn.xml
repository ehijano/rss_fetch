      <title>Physics-informed Data-driven Cavitation Model for a Specific MG EOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel one-fluid cavitation model of a specific Mie-Gr\"uneisen equation of state(EOS), named polynomial EOS, based on an artificial neural network. Not only the physics-informed equation but also the experimental data are embedded into the proposed model by an optimization problem. The physics-informed data-driven model provides the concerned pressure within the cavitation region, where the density tends to zero when the pressure falls below the saturated pressure. The present model is then applied to computing the challenging compressible multi-phase flow simulation, such as nuclear and underwater explosions. Numerical simulations show that our model in application agrees well with the corresponding experimental data, ranging from one dimension to three dimensions with the $h-$adaptive mesh refinement algorithm and load balance techniques in the structured and unstructured grid.</description>

      <title>Generalized Solution for Double-Porosity Flow through a Graded Excavation Damaged Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction of flow to boreholes or excavations in fractured low-permeability rocks is important for resource extraction and disposal or sequestration activities. Analytical solutions for fluid pressure and flowrate, when available, are powerful, insightful, and efficient tools enabling parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. A flexible porous media flow solution for arbitrary physical dimension is derived and extended to double porosity for converging radial flow when permeability and porosity decrease radially as a power law away from a borehole or opening. This distribution can arise from damage accumulation due to stress relief associated with drilling or mining. The single-porosity graded conductivity solution was initially found for heat conduction, the arbitrary dimension flow solution comes from hydrology, and the solution with both arbitrary dimension and graded permeability distribution appeared in reservoir engineering. These existing solutions are here combined and extended to two implementations of the double-porosity conceptual model, for both a simpler thin-film mass transfer and more physically realistic diffusion between fracture and matrix. This work presents a new specified-flowrate solution with wellbore storage for the simpler double-porosity model, and a new more physically realistic solution for any wellbore boundary condition. A new closed-form expression is derived for the matrix diffusion solution (applicable to both homogeneous and graded problems), improving on previous infinite series expressions.</description>

      <title>Swimming efficiency in viscosity gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we study the effect of viscosity gradients on the energy dissipated by the motion of microswimmers and the associated efficiency of that motion. Using spheroidal squirmer model swimmers in weak linearly varying viscosity fields, we find that efficiency depends on whether they generate propulsion from the back (pushers) or the front (pullers). Pushers are faster and more efficient when moving down gradients but slower and less efficient moving up viscosity gradients, and the opposite is true for pullers. However, both pushers and pullers display negative viscotaxis, therefore pushers dynamically tend to the most efficient orientation while pullers the least. We also evaluate the effect of shape on power expenditure and efficiency when swimming in viscosity gradients and find that in general the change in both due to gradients monotonically decreases with increasing slenderness. This work shows how shape and gait play an important role in determining dynamics and efficiency in inhomogeneous environments, and demonstrating that both efficiency minimizing and maximizing stable dynamical states are possible.</description>

      <title>New Interpretation for error propagation of data-driven Reynolds stress closures via global stability analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the challenges surrounding convergence and error propagation encountered in Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with data-driven Reynolds stress closures, researchers commonly attribute these issues to ill-conditioning through conditional number analysis. This paper delves into an additional factor, numerical instability, contributing to these challenges. We conduct global stability analysis for the RANS equations, closed by the Reynolds stress of direct numerical simulation (DNS), with the time-averaged solution of DNS as the base flow. Our findings reveal that, for turbulent channel flow at high Reynolds numbers, significant ill-conditioning exists, yet the system remains stable. Conversely, for separated flow over periodic hills, notable ill-conditioning is absent, but unstable eigenvalues are present, indicating that error propagation arises from the mechanism of numerical instability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the decomposition method employing eddy viscosity is compared, results show that the spatial distribution and amplitude of eddy viscosity influences the numerical stability.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamic model of capillary flow in an axially symmetric tube with a non-slowly-varying cross section and a boundary slip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capillary flow of a Newtonian and incompressible fluid in an axially symmetric horizontal tube with a non-slowly-varying cross section and a boundary slip is considered theoretically under the assumption that the Reynolds number is small enough for the Stokes approximation to be valid. Combining the Stokes equation with the hydrodynamic model assuming the Hagen-Poiseulle flow, a general formula for the capillary flow in a non-slowly-varying tube is derived. Using the newly derived formula, the capillary imbibition and the time evolution of meniscus in tubes with non-uniform cross sections such as a conical tube, a power-law-shaped diverging tube, and a power-law-shaped converging tube are reconsidered. The perturbation parameters and the corrections due to the non-slowly-varying effects are elucidated and the new scaling formulas for the time evolution of the meniscus of these specific examples are derived. Our study could be useful for understanding various natural fluidic systems and for designing functional fluidic devices such as a diode and a switch.</description>

      <title>Weakening the effect of boundaries: `diffusion-free' boundary conditions as a `do least harm' alternative to Neumann</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we discuss a poorly known alternative boundary condition to the usual Neumann or `stress-free' boundary condition typically used to weaken boundary layers when diffusion is present but very small. These `diffusion-free' boundary conditions were first developed (as far as the authors know) in 1995 (Sureshkumar &amp; Beris, J. Non-Newtonian Fluid Mech., vol 60, 53-80, 1995) in viscoelastic flow modelling but are worthy of general consideration in other research areas. To illustrate their use, we solve two simple ODE problems and then treat a PDE problem - the inertial wave eigenvalue problem in a rotating cylinder, a sphere and spherical shell for small but non-zero Ekman number $E$. Where inviscid inertial waves exist (cylinder and sphere), the viscous flows in the Ekman boundary layer are $O(E^{1/2})$ weaker than for the corresponding stress-free layer and fully $O(E)$ weaker than in a non-slip layer. This reduction could allow precious numerical resources to focus on other areas of the flow and thereby make smaller, more realistic values of diffusion accessible to simulations.</description>

      <title>Trigger mechanism for a singing cavitating tip vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete tone radiated from tip vortex cavitation (TVC), known as 'vortex singing', was recognized in 1989, but its triggering remains unclear for over thirty years. In this study, the desinent cavitation number and viscous correction are applied to describe the dynamics of cavitation bubbles and the dispersion relation of cavity interfacial waves. The wavenumber-frequency spectrum of the cavity radius from the experiment in CSSRC indicates that singing waves predominantly consist of the stationary double helical modes (k{\theta} = 2- and -2+) and the breathing mode (k{\theta} = 0-), rather than standing waves as assumed in previous literatures. Moreover, two trigger mechanisms, expressed by two triggering lines, are proposed: the twisted TVC, initially at rest, is driven into motion through the corrected natural frequency (fn) due to the step change of the far-field pressure. Subsequently, the frequency associated with the zero-group-velocity point (fzgv) at k{\theta} = 0- is excited through fi, the frequency at the intersection of dispersion curves at k{\theta} = 0- and -2+, or fj, the frequency at the intersection of dispersion curves at k{\theta} = 0- and 2-, corresponding to two types of the vortex singing triggering. These solutions, without empirical parameters, are validated using singing conditions provided by CSSRC and G.T.H., respectively. Furthermore, the coherence and the cross-power spectral density spectrum indicates a large-scale breathing wave propagating along the singing cavity surface and travelling from downstream to hydrofoil tip, providing us a comprehensive understanding for the triggering of vortex singing.</description>

      <title>The best whistler: a cavitating tip vortex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discrete tone radiated from a cavitating tip vortex, known as "vortex singing", was first recognized in 1989, but its sound generation mechanism has remained a mystery for over thirty years. In this letter, by means of the correction for the cavitation bubble dynamics and the dispersion relation of cavity interfacial waves, we found that after the far-end disturbances propagate upstream, the whistling vortex should be triggered by near-end sound sources, the breathing mode waves. Further utilizing the theoretical solutions for singing lines and the potential singing cavitation number with frequency, we accurately identified all available tests for seeking the vortex singing over the past three decades, answering a long-standing perplexity: why such a best whistler is able to appear only within a narrow range of the cavitation number.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of vortex memory system driven by edge-current and boundary magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a magnetohydrodynamic model is developed to study the dynamics of vortices driven by edge-current. Two modeled equations for fluid and magnetic field variables are each transformed into diffusion equation for vorticity and poisson equation for stream function. A numerical solution method is designed using a simplified Lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The LBM-D2Q5 scheme is utilized to obtain the numerical solutions for the fluid and magnetic field variables. Understanding the hydrodynamic behavior of systems employed in vortex-based memory systems is crucial for reliability and performance optimization. Based on this motivation, the effect of applied edge-current on the hydrodynamic and magnetic vortex configurations are analyzed through numerical simulations. The impact of the boundary magnetization is also conducted, by varying the strength of the magnetic field at the bottom boundary. The obtained graphical results provide some insights into the design and operation of vortex-based memory systems for next-generation data storage applications.</description>

      <title>A second-generation URANS model (STRUCT$-\epsilon$) applied to a Generic Side Mirror and its Impact on Sound Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generic side mirror can be approximated to the combination of a half cylinder topped with a quarter of sphere. The flow structure in the wake of the side mirror is highly transient and the turbulence plays an important role affecting aeroacoustics through pressure fluctuation. Thus, this geometry is one of the test cases object of several numerical studies in recent years to assess the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic capabilities of the turbulence models. In this context, this study presents how the second-generation URANS close STRUCT$-\epsilon$ is able to properly predict the expected stagnation, flow separation and vortex shedding phenomena. Besides, the predictive accuracy for the noise generation mechanism is evaluated by comparing the spectra of the sound pressure level measured at several static pressure sensors with the numerical results obtained with the STRUCT$-\epsilon$. The response of this turbulence model has overachieved other hybrid methods and is in good agreement with the results from Large-Eddy Simulations or the experiments. To conclude the paper, the applicability of STRUCT$-\epsilon$ to construct a Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition method that helps identifying the most energetic modes to appropriately capture the dominant flow structures is also introduced.</description>

      <title>Reynolds-number dependence of streamwise velocity variance in wall-bounded turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model for the streamwise velocity variance in wall-bounded turbulent flows. It hypothesizes that the wall-parallel motions of the attached eddies induce internal turbulent boundary layers. A logarithmic variance profile is obtained. The peak value of the variance scaled using the friction velocity has a logarithmic dependence on the ratio the wall-normal length of the flow to the thickness of the internal boundary layer induced by the largest attached eddies ($\delta_o$), the latter having a dependence on the friction Reynolds number in the form of a Lambert W function. Both the peak and the length ratio are unbounded at asymptotically large Reynolds numbers. The model also predicts that the streamwise velocity fluctuations induced by the attached eddies near the viscous layer scale with the friction velocity; therefore the scaled velocity variance there remains finite at asymptotically large Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>Communities for the Lagrangian Dynamics of the Turbulent Velocity Gradient Tensor: A Network Participation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex network analysis methods have been widely applied to nonlinear systems, but applications within fluid mechanics are relatively few. In this paper, we use a network for the Lagrangian dynamics of the velocity gradient tensor (VGT), where each node is a flow state, and the probability of transitioning between states follows from a direct numerical simulation of statistically steady and isotropic turbulence. The network representation of the VGT dynamics is much more compact than the continuous, joint distribution of a set of invariants for the tensor. We focus on choosing optimal variables to discretize and classify the VGT states. To this end, we test several classifications based on topology and various properties of the background flow coherent structures. We do this using the notion of "community" or "module", namely clusters of nodes that are optimally distinct while also containing diverse nodal functions. The best classification based upon VGT invariants often adopted in the literature combines the sign of the principal invariants, $Q$ and $R$, and the sign of the discriminant function, $\Delta$, separating regions where the VGT eigenvalues are real and complex. We further improve this classification by including the relative magnitude of the non-normal contribution to the dynamics of the enstrophy and straining stemming from a Schur decomposition of the VGT. The traditional focus on the second VGT principal invariant, $Q$, implies consideration of the difference between the enstrophy and strain-rate magnitude without the non-normal parts. The fact that including the non-normality leads to a better VGT classification highlights the importance of unclosed and complex terms contributing to the VGT dynamics, namely the pressure Hessian and viscous terms, to which the VGT non-normality is intrinsically related.</description>

      <title>A hydrodynamic analog of critical phenomena: an uncountably infinite number of universality classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of universality class has emerged from our understanding of critical phenomena widely observed in nature and has guided the recent development of physics. Accordingly, identifying a rich variety of universality class is a major issue in modern physics. Here, we report that a daily phenomenon, similar to a drop falling from a faucet, possesses a strikingly close analogy with critical phenomena, but this version remarkably reveals the existence of an uncountably infinite number of universality classes. The key for our present findings is the confinement of a system into a thin cell, in which we observe the dynamics of air-liquid interface formed by entrained air into viscous liquid by a solid disk, to find critical exponents that define a universality class depend on continuous numbers characterizing the confinement.</description>

      <title>Hierarchic Flows to Estimate and Sample High-dimensional Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding low-dimensional interpretable models of complex physical fields such as turbulence remains an open question, 80 years after the pioneer work of Kolmogorov. Estimating high-dimensional probability distributions from data samples suffers from an optimization and an approximation curse of dimensionality. It may be avoided by following a hierarchic probability flow from coarse to fine scales. This inverse renormalization group is defined by conditional probabilities across scales, renormalized in a wavelet basis. For a $\varphi^4$ scalar potential, sampling these hierarchic models avoids the critical slowing down at the phase transition. An outstanding issue is to also approximate non-Gaussian fields having long-range interactions in space and across scales. We introduce low-dimensional models with robust multiscale approximations of high order polynomial energies. They are calculated with a second wavelet transform, which defines interactions over two hierarchies of scales. We estimate and sample these wavelet scattering models to generate 2D vorticity fields of turbulence, and images of dark matter densities.</description>

      <title>Space-dependent Aggregation of Stochastic Data-driven Turbulence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stochastic Machine-Learning approach is developed for data-driven Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) predictions of turbulent flows, with quantified model uncertainty. This is done by combining a Bayesian symbolic identification methodology for learning stochastic RANS model corrections for selected classes of flows (expert models), and a Mixture-of-Experts methodology that aggregates their predictions. The expert models are learned using the recently proposed SBL-SpaRTA algorithm, which generates sparse analytical expressions of the corrective terms with model parameters described by probability distributions. They outperform the baseline RANS model for flows similar to those used for training, but their generalization to different flows is not warranted. With the aim of quantifying the predictive uncertainty associated with the data-driven models while improving predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities, a space-dependent model aggregation technique (XMA) is then adopted. A gating function, which assigns each model a performance score (weight) based on a vector of local flow features, is trained alongside the expert models. The weights can be interpreted as the probability that a candidate model will outperform its competitors given the flow behavior at a given location. Predictions of unseen flows are formulated as a locally weighted average of the stochastic solutions of the expert models. A prediction uncertainty estimate is obtained by propagating the models' posterior parameter distributions and by evaluating the inter-model prediction variance. The expectancy of the XMA prediction is significantly more accurate than the baseline deterministic solution and the individual solutions of the experts for well-documented benchmark flows not included in the training set, while providing consistent estimates of the predictive variance.</description>

      <title>On the departure from Monin-Obukhov surface similarity and transition to the convective mixed layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-eddy simulations are used to evaluate mean profile similarity in the convective boundary layer (CBL). Particular care is taken regarding the grid sensitivity of the profiles and the mitigation of inertial oscillations in the simulation spin-up. The nondimensional gradients $\phi$ for wind speed and air temperature generally align with Monin-Obukhov similarity across cases but have a steeper slope than predicted within each profile. The same trend has been noted in several other recent studies. The Businger-Dyer relations are modified here with an exponential cutoff term to account for the decay in $\phi$ to first-order approximation, yielding improved similarity from approximately 0.05$z_i$ to above 0.3$z_i$, where $z_i$ is the CBL depth. The necessity for the exponential correction is attributed to an extended transition from surface scaling to zero gradient in the mixed layer, where the departure from Monin-Obukhov similarity may be negligible at the surface but becomes substantial well below the conventional surface layer height of 0.1$z_i$.</description>

      <title>The Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis for bubble dynamics, cavitation and underwater explosions</title>

Abstract: Pressure-driven bubble dynamics is a major topic of current research in fluid dynamics, driven by innovative medical therapies, sonochemistry, material treatments, and geophysical exploration. First proposed in 1942, the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis provides a simple means to close the equations that govern pressure-driven bubble dynamics as well as the resulting flow field and acoustic emissions in spherical symmetry. The models derived from the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis can be solved using standard numerical integration methods at a fraction of the computational cost required for fully resolved simulations. Here, the theoretical foundation of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis and contemporary models derived from it are gathered and reviewed, as well as generalized to account for spherically symmetric, cylindrically symmetric, and planar one-dimensional domains. In addition, the underpinning assumptions are clarified and new results that scrutinize the predictive capabilities of the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis with respect to the complex acoustic impedance experienced by curved acoustic waves and the formation of shock waves are presented. Although the Kirkwood-Bethe hypothesis is built upon simplifying assumptions and lacks some basic acoustic properties, models derived from it are able to provide accurate predictions under the specific conditions associated with pressure-driven bubble dynamics, cavitation and underwater explosions.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal spectral transfers in fluid dynamics</title>

Abstract: Motivated by previous work on kinetic energy cascades in the ocean and atmosphere, we develop a spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool that can be used to study scales of variability in generalized dynamical systems. In particular, we use generalized time-frequency methods from signal analysis to broaden the applicability of frequency transfers from theoretical to practical applications such as the study of ocean or atmosphere data or simulation output. We also show that triad interactions in wavenumber used to study kinetic energy and enstrophy cascades can be generalized to study triad interactions in frequency or wavenumber-frequency. We study the effects of sweeping on the locality of frequency transfers and frequency triad interactions to better understand the locality of spatio-temporal frequency transfers. As an illustrative example, we use the spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool to study the results of a simulation of two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. This simulated fluid is forced at a well-defined wavenumber and frequency with dissipation occurring at both large and small scales, making this one of the first studies of "modulated turbulence" in two dimensions. Our results show that the spatio-temporal transfers we develop in this paper are robust to potential practical problems such as low sampling rates or nonstationarity in time series of interest. We anticipate that this method will be a useful tool in studying scales of spatio-temporal variability in a wide range of fluids applications as higher resolution data and simulations become more widely available.</description>

      <title>Koopman neural operator as a mesh-free solver of non-linear partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lacking of analytic solutions of diverse partial differential equations (PDEs) gives birth to a series of computational techniques for numerical solutions. Although numerous latest advances are accomplished in developing neural operators, a kind of neural-network-based PDE solver, these solvers become less accurate and explainable while learning long-term behaviors of non-linear PDE families. In this paper, we propose the Koopman neural operator (KNO), a new neural operator, to overcome these challenges. With the same objective of learning an infinite-dimensional mapping between Banach spaces that serves as the solution operator of the target PDE family, our approach differs from existing models by formulating a non-linear dynamic system of equation solution. By approximating the Koopman operator, an infinite-dimensional operator governing all possible observations of the dynamic system, to act on the flow mapping of the dynamic system, we can equivalently learn the solution of a non-linear PDE family by solving simple linear prediction problems. We validate the KNO in mesh-independent, long-term, and5zero-shot predictions on five representative PDEs (e.g., the Navier-Stokes equation and the Rayleigh-B{\'e}nard convection) and three real dynamic systems (e.g., global water vapor patterns and western boundary currents). In these experiments, the KNO exhibits notable advantages compared with previous state-of-the-art models, suggesting the potential of the KNO in supporting diverse science and engineering applications (e.g., PDE solving, turbulence modelling, and precipitation forecasting).</description>

      <title>Beware of CaBER: Filament thinning rheometry doesn't give `the' relaxation time of polymer solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08440v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The viscoelastic relaxation time of a polymer solution is often measured using Capillary Breakup Extensional Rheometry (CaBER) where a droplet is placed between two plates which are pulled apart to form a thinning filament. For a slow plate retraction protocol, required to avoid inertio-capillary oscillations for low-viscosity liquids, we show experimentally that the CaBER relaxation time $\tau_e$ inferred from the exponential thinning regime is in fact an apparent relaxation time that increases significantly when increasing the plate diameter and the droplet volume. Similarly, we observe that $\tau_e$ increases with the plate diameter for the classical step-strain plate separation protocol of a commercial (Haake) CaBER device and increases with the nozzle diameter for a Dripping-onto-Substrate (DoS) method. This dependence on the flow history before the formation of the viscoelastic filament is in contradiction with polymer models such as Oldroyd-B that predict a filament thinning rate $1/3\tau$ ($\tau$ being the model's relaxation time) which is a material property independent of geometrical factors. We show that this is not due to artefacts such as solvent evaporation or polymer degradation and that it can only be rationalised by finite extensibility effects (FENE-P model) for a dilute polymer solution in a viscous solvent, but not for semi-dilute solutions in a low-viscosity solvent.</description>

      <title>Sol-gel transition by evaporation in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Historical monuments, outdoor stone sculptures and artworks made of porous materials are exposed to chemical and physical degradation over time. Presently, the most promising route for consolidation of weakened porous materials is the injection of viscoelastic solutions of polymerizing compounds. Those compounds, after injection, undergo a sol-gel transition inside the porous media through evaporation of the solvent. Finding a suitable gelifying solution as a consolidant calls for understanding the drying kinetics of viscoelastic fluids in porous media. Here, we present a multiscale study of the drying kinetics of solutions during the sol-gel transition. We investigate the drying dynamics and subsequent water uptake of a gel using NMR and X-ray microtomography techniques in porous materials. We find that during drying, a distinct front develops which separates the liquid region from the gelled region. This front advances from the free surface of evaporation towards the inner parts of the stone. We identify different drying periods which appear to be dependent on the intrinsic properties of the porous medium influencing strongly the homogeneity of the final gel distribution within a treated stone. Our findings not only are relevant for the consolidation of porous artworks but also for civil and soil engineering processes where the fluids considered are generally more complex than water.</description>
