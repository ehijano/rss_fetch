      <title>Probing the Nanoscale Excitonic Landscape and Quantum Confinement of Excitons in Gated Monolayer Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering and probing excitonic properties at the nanoscale remains a central challenge in quantum photonics and optoelectronics. While exciton confinement via electrical control and strain engineering has been demonstrated in 2D semiconductors, substantial nanoscale heterogeneity limits the scalability of 2D quantum photonic device architectures. In this work, we use cathodoluminescence spectroscopy to probe the excitonic landscape of monolayer $WS_2$ under electrostatic gating. Exploiting the high spatial resolution of the converged electron beam, we resolve a homojunction arising between gated and ungated regions. Moreover, we reveal an exciton confinement channel arising from an unconventional doping mechanism driven by the interplay between the electron beam and the applied gate fields. These findings offer new insights into the optoelectronic behavior of monolayer semiconductors under the combined influence of electron-beam excitation and electrostatic gating. Our approach provides a pathway for exciton manipulation at the nanoscale and opens opportunities for controlling quantum-confined exciton transport in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Shot noise as a probe for Andreev reflection in graphene-based heterojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shot noise emerges due to the discrete nature of charge transport and provides direct access to the underlying microscopic transport mechanisms governing current flow in mesoscopic conductors. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum shot noise offers a direct and robust fingerprint of Andreev reflection, distinguishing between retro and specular processes in graphene-superconductor, graphene-superconductor-graphene, and superconductor-graphene-superconductor junctions. At the graphene-superconductor interface, exact reflection amplitudes obtained from full wavefunction matching within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism capture retro and specular regimes. The associated Fano factor exhibits distinct Fermi-level-dependent signatures, with retro Andreev reflection suppressing and specular Andreev reflection enhancing the shot noise. Extensions to graphene-superconductor-graphene and superconductor-graphene-superconductor configurations reveal how the transmission spectrum and, consequently, the noise profile are modified in the presence of multiple interfaces, coherent quasiparticle interference, and superconducting phase variations. Our findings establish shot noise spectroscopy as a potent and experimentally viable probe for differentiating Andreev reflection types in graphene-based quantum devices, providing complementary insights beyond conventional conductance measurements.</description>

Abstract: Cu2OSeO3 is a skyrmion host material in which two distinct thermodynamically stable skyrmion phases were identified. We report magnetic force microscopy imaging of the low-temperature magnetic phases in bulk Cu2OSeO3(100) single crystal. Tuning the external magnetic field over the various phase transition at a temperature of 10 K, we observe the formation of helical, conical, tilted conical and skyrmion lattice domains in real space.</description>

      <title>Sub-GHz Breathing Dynamics of Magnetic Hopfions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional topological solitons whose static stability has recently been confirmed in experiments, yet their dynamical modes remain largely unexplored. Here we combine micromagnetic simulations and analytical modelling to characterise the fundamental breathing excitation of hopfions. We show that the breathing mode corresponds to a coherent oscillation of both the hopfion core diameter and the shell width, while preserving the topological charge. An analytical domain-wall interaction model explains the weak field dependence of the shell thickness and yields a closed-form expression for the restoring stiffness. From this curvature and the collective-coordinate inertia, we derive an estimated breathing frequency in excellent agreement with micromagnetic spectra. The ability to capture the hopfion dynamics quantitatively from material constants highlights a direct route to experimental detection by ferromagnetic resonance or Brillouin light scattering, and establishes a framework for frequency-encoded control in reconfigurable spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Topology of Fermi seas and geometry of their boundaries for free particles in one and two-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free gases of spinless fermions moving on a geometric background with lattice symmetries are considered. Their Fermi seas and corresponding boundaries may be classified according to their topological properties at zero temperature. This is accomplished by considering the flat orbifolds $R^{d}/\Gamma$, with $\Gamma$ being the crystallographic group of symmetry in $d$-dimensional momentum space. For $d=1$, there are 2 topological classes: a circumference, corresponding to an insulator and an interval, identified as a conductor. For $d=2$, the number of topological classes extends to 17: there are 8 with the topology of a disk identified as conductors and 4 corresponding to a 2-sphere matching insulators, both sets eventually including finite numbers of conical singularities and reflection corners at the boundaries. The rest of the listing includes single cases corresponding to insulators (2-torus, real projective plane, Klein bottle) and conductors (annulus, M\"obius strip). Physical interpretations of the singularities are provided, as well as examples that fit within this listing. Given the topological nature of this classification, its results are expected to be robust against small perturbative interactions.</description>

      <title>Topological switching in bilayer magnons via electrical control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological magnons, quantized spin waves featuring nontrivial boundary modes, present a promising route toward lossless information processing. Realizing practical devices typically requires magnons excited in a controlled manner to enable precise manipulation of their topological phases and transport behaviors. However, their inherent charge neutrality and a high frequency nature pose a significant challenge for nonvolatile control, especially via electric means. Herein, we propose a general strategy for electrical control of topological magnons in bilayer ferromagnetic insulators. With strong spin-layer coupling, an applied vertical electric field induces an interlayer potential imbalance that modifies intralayer Heisenberg exchanges between adjacent layers. This electric-field-driven modulation competes with the bilayer's intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, enabling the accurate tuning of the band topology and nonreciprocal dynamics of magnons. More importantly, such an electric control mechanism exhibits strong coupling with external magnetic fields, unveiling new perspectives on magnetoelectric coupling in charge-neutral quasiparticles</description>

      <title>Dissipation in passive non-reciprocal microwave devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal devices are key components in both classical and quantum electronics. One approach to realizing passive non-reciprocal microwave devices is through capacitive coupling between external electrodes and materials exhibiting non-reciprocal conductance. In this work, we develop an analytic framework that captures the response of such devices in the presence of dissipation while accounting for the full AC dynamics of the material. Our results yield an effective circuit model that accurately describes the device response in experimentally relevant regimes even at small dissipation levels. Furthermore, our analysis reveals counterpropagating features arising from the intrinsic AC response of the material that could be exploited to dynamically switch the non-reciprocity of the device, opening pathways for tunable non-reciprocal microwave technologies.</description>

      <title>Observation of moir\'e trapped biexciton through sub-diffraction-limit probing using hetero-bilayer on nanopillar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to tune the degree of interaction among particles at the nanoscale is highly intriguing. The spectroscopic signature of such interaction is often subtle and requires special probes to observe. To this end, inter-layer excitons trapped in the periodic potential wells of a moir\'e superlattice offer rich interaction physics, specifically due to the presence of both attractive and repulsive components in the interaction. Here we show that the Coulomb force between two inter-layer excitons switches from repulsive to attractive when the length scale reduces from inter-moir\'e-pocket to intra-moir\'e-pocket in a WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayer - thanks to the complex competition between direct and exchange interaction. The finding is a departure from the usual notion of repelling inter-layer excitons due to layer polarization. This manifests as the simultaneous observation of an anomalous superlinear power-law of moir\'e exciton and a stabilization of moir\'e trapped biexciton. The experimental observation is facilitated by placing the hetero-bilayer on a polymer-nanopillar/gold-film stack which significantly reduces the inhomogeneous spectral broadening by selectively probing a smaller ensemble of moir\'e pockets compared with a flat sample. This creates an interesting platform to explore interaction among moir\'e trapped excitons and higher order quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Transitioning from Silicon to Carbon Nanotube based transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon Nanotubes have shown to be an attractive option in the race to find a replacement to silicon-based transistors, due to its high electrical conductivity, extraordinary mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity. However, challenges with regards to controlling the purity and chirality of CNTs have raised doubts if the mass production of these transistors are even viable. This paper explores the challenges of scalability and proposes methods such as Liquid and Gas phase oxidative methods and microwave heating to tackle the problem of metal impurities found within CNTs and the methods of Catalyst Engineering and Chemical Vapor Deposition to control the chirality of CNTs. It also suggests techniques such as Lithography, Screen Printing and Stack Engineering to facilitate the large-scale production of CNT transistors. This paper also attempts to explore the methods of Laser Ablation and Arc Discharge that allows for the synthesis of CNTs of pure quality and high yield further facilitating the rise of mass production of CNT transistors. The feasibility and challenges relating to the integration of CNT transistors with already pre-existing circuitry was also investigated and the methods of annealing and potassium doping were studied and analyzed. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive guide to allow for the mass production and rapid integration of CNT transistors into the semi-conductor market.</description>

      <title>Calculations of current in the cotunneling regime using Lindblad equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport through zero-dimensional states in a tunneling barrier can occur via co-tunneling, wherein a carrier occupying a state outside the range of energies between the chemical potentials of the two leads hops to a lead, and within the brief time permitted by the energy-time uncertainty relationship the occupancy is replenished from the other lead. Here, we calculate the current in such junctions using a Lindblad formalism within the Markovian approximation. We consider transport in the Coulomb blockade regime with spin-polarized leads and a magnetic field smaller than the coercive field of either lead. Dependences on magnetic field and lead spin polarization of the spin blockade, decoherence, and spin lifetime of the subsystems of this model are calculated.</description>

      <title>Topological characterization of phase transitions and critical edge states in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical edge states appear at the bulk gap closing points of topological transitions. Their emergence signify the existence of topologically nontrivial critical points, whose descriptions fall outside the scope of gapped topological matter. In this work, we reveal and characterize topological critical points and critical edge states in non-Hermitian systems. By applying the Cauchy's argument principle to two characteristic functions of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we obtain a pair of winding numbers, whose combination yields a complete description of gapped and gapless topological phases in one-dimensional, two-band non-Hermitian systems with sublattice symmetry. Focusing on a broad class of non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains, we demonstrate the applicability of our theory for characterizing gapless symmetry-protected topological phases, topologically distinct critical points, phase transitions along non-Hermitian phase boundaries and their associated topological edge modes. Our findings not only generalize the concepts of topologically nontrivial critical points and critical edge modes to non-Hermitian setups, but also yield additional insights for analyzing topological transitions and bulk-edge correspondence in open systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Hall effect on planar Archimedean lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Archimedean lattices constitute a unique family of two-dimensional tilings formed from regular polygons arranged with uniform vertex configurations. While the kagome lattice has been extensively studied and the snub square lattice has served as a quasicrystal approximant, the broader family remains comparatively unexplored in the context of electronic and topological properties. In this work, we present a systematic tight-binding study of all eight pure Archimedean lattices, incorporating both $s$ and $p$ orbitals. We analyze their band structures, investigate topological edge states arising from unconventional nanoribbon geometries, and evaluate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants as well as intrinsic spin Hall conductivities using the Kubo formalism. Our results reveal that several Archimedean lattices, such as the truncated hexagonal and truncated trihexagonal lattices, host nearly dispersionless flat bands extending across the Brillouin zone, which remain robust even in the presence of next-nearest-neighbor hopping and strong spin-orbit coupling. In particular, the truncated trihexagonal lattice supports topologically protected, highly spin-polarized edge states across multiple ribbon geometries. These states are stable against defects and spin-flip scattering, and they give rise to sizable spin Hall currents.</description>

      <title>Quality of Helicity-Dependent Magnetization Switching by Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical control of magnetization has emerged as a promising approach to achieve ultrafast and energy-efficient magnetization reversal. Here, we investigate helicity-dependent switching of magne- tization driven by the resonant excitation of circularly-polarized transverse-optical phonons, using a polarization-modulated transient grating. Our results show that the polarized phonons within the sample substrate induce robust, helicity-defined magnetization reversal in the magnetic overlayer. Moreover, the quality of switching remains largely unaffected when the degree of ellipticity of the infrared excitation is varied at frequencies resonant with the targeted phonon modes. Conversely, as the excitation is moved slightly off-resonance, switching quality becomes highly sensitive to the ellipticity of the incident light.</description>

      <title>Realizing Blume-Capel Degrees of Freedom with Toroidal Moments in a Ruby Artificial Spin Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing exotic Hamiltonians beyond the Ising model is a key pursuit in experimental statistical physics. One such example is the Blume-Capel model, a three-state spin model, whose phase diagram features a tricritical point where second-order and first-order transition lines converge, leading to a coexistence of paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and disordered phases. Here, we realize an artificial crystal of single-domain nanomagnets, placed on the links of the Ruby lattice, enabling real-space observation of the Blume-Capel degrees of freedom. These Blume-Capel degrees of freedom are represented by the presence, sign and interactions of the toroidal moments that emerge naturally in plaquettes of nanomagnets in the Ruby artificial spin ice. By precisely tuning the lattice parameters of the Ruby artificial spin ice, we demonstrate control over the two-step ordering process of the toroidal moments, whereby there is a high-temperature crossover from a paramagnetic phase to an intermediate paratoroidic regime, followed by a second-order phase transition to a ferrotoroidic ground state. This sequence of toroidal phases and transitions is accurately captured by the Blume-Capel framework and provides a direct realization of a substantial portion of the phase diagram associated with the model. This establishes a new platform for exploring exotic Hamiltonians in terms of artificial spin ice superstructures, here with groups of nanomagnets forming toroidal moments. The success of this mapping paves the way for an entirely new frontier in artificial spin ice: intentionally engineering lattice designs whose effective Hamiltonians mediate unconventional forms of magnetic order, with new behaviors and functionalities.</description>

      <title>Electron transfer between surface-acoustic-wave-induced moving and static quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast long-range interactions between distant quantum dots in arrays remains an unsolved issue, which can be key to solve scalability issues in quantum simulation and computation processes, particularly related to the overhead associated with quantum error correction schemes. Furthermore, transport between static and moving quantum dots, relevant in surface acoustic wave induced experiments, has not been studied in detail. This article presents a paradigmatic model for picturing this process, where non-adiabatic terms driving a two-state transfer process are derived and discussed. Moreover, the main effects in the spin state of the electron and its effect on the transfer probability of the loading are analyzed including the most relevant interaction in semiconductor heterostructure induced 2 dimensional electron gases i.e. the Rashba-Dresselhaus terms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize a three-dimensional artificial spin ice of disconnected nanomagnets interacting solely via dipolar coupling, patterned on square pyramids. This Pyramid artificial spin ice, with both tilted and in-plane nanomagnets, supports tunable states. Monte Carlo simulations reveal a rich phase diagram and an emergent square ice of vertex-level effective spins. Tailored demagnetization protocols and magnetic force microscopy allow experimental access to low-energy states, establishing a platform for exploring three-dimensional artificial spin ices.</description>

      <title>Geometric phases on graphene from Atiyah-Singer index theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of geometric phases in graphene-based nanostructures through the lens of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. By modeling low-energy quasiparticles in curved graphene geometries as Dirac fermions, we demonstrate that topological defects arising from the insertion of pentagonal or heptagonal carbon rings generate effective gauge fields that induce quantized Berry phases. We derive a compact expression for the geometric phase in terms of the genus and number of open boundaries of the structure, providing a topological classification of zero-energy modes. This framework enables a deeper understanding of quantum holonomies in graphene and their potential application in holonomic quantum computation. Our approach bridges discrete lattice models with continuum index theory, yielding insights that are both physically intuitive and experimentally accessible.</description>

      <title>Embodying computation in nonlinear perturbative metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing metamaterials that carry out advanced computations poses a significant challenge. A powerful design strategy splits the problem into two steps: First, encoding the desired functionality in a discrete or tight-binding model, and second, identifying a metamaterial geometry that conforms to the model. Applying this approach to information-processing tasks requires accurately mapping nonlinearity -- an essential element for computation -- from discrete models to geometries. Here we formulate this mapping through a nonlinear coordinate transformation that accurately connects tight-binding degrees of freedom to metamaterial excitations in the nonlinear regime. This transformation allows us to design information-processing metamaterials across the broad range of computations that can be expressed as tight-binding models, a capability we showcase with three examples based on three different computing paradigms: a coherent Ising machine that approximates combinatorial optimization problems through energy minimization, a mechanical racetrack memory exemplifying in-memory computing, and a speech classification metamaterial based on analog neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>Racetrack computing with a topological boundary ratchet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multistable order parameters provide a natural means of encoding non-volatile information in spatial domains, a concept that forms the foundation of magnetic memory devices. However, this stability inherently conflicts with the need to move information around the device for processing and readout. While in magnetic systems, domains can be transported using currents or external fields, mechanisms to robustly shuttle information-bearing domains across neutral systems are scarce. Here, we experimentally realize a topological boundary ratchet in an elastic metamaterial, where digital information is encoded in buckling domains and transported in a quantized manner via cyclic loading. The transport is topological in origin: neighboring domains act as different topological pumps for their Bogoliubov excitations, so their interface hosts topological boundary modes. Cyclic loading renders these modes unstable through inter-domain pressure, which in turn drives the motion of the domain wall. We demonstrate that the direction of information propagation can be controlled through adjustable mechanical constraints on the buckling beams, and numerically investigate buckling-based domain-wall logic circuits in an elastic metamaterial network. The underlying tight-binding structure with low-order nonlinearities makes this approach a general pathway toward racetrack memories in neutral systems.</description>

      <title>Topological polar textures on CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar topological textures like the bubble domains, flux--closures, and labyrinth etc., unlock functional responses in ferroic systems but are difficult to stabilize and control in chemically simple, solution--grown materials. Here we show that ultra--thin, large--area CsPbBr$_3$ nanoplatelets host room--temperature ferroelectric bubble domains whose characteristic size is tunable by thickness. Using contact--resonance piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) across 125\~nm--2\~$\mu$m, we observe a systematic decrease in domain size with decreasing thickness, consistent with a depolarization--field controlled stability window. Repeated scanning transforms bubbles into labyrinthine patterns, indicating metastability under weak mechanical/electrical perturbations. Upon heating, bubbles evolve into labyrinths and vanish at $T_C\!\approx\!90^\circ$C, with domain nucleation recovered on cooling. These results establish a controllable platform for polar topology in a stable, stochiometric perovskite grown via a solvothermal route, and clarify how electrical boundary conditions (set by thickness and temperature) govern texture selection. The thickness--tunable polar textures identified here offer a route to engineer domain--wall--mediated functionalities in halide perovskites.</description>

      <title>AM-DefectNet: Additive Manufacturing Defect Classification Using Machine Learning - A comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes present challenges in monitoring and controlling material properties and process parameters, affecting production quality and defect detection. Machine Learning (ML) techniques offer a promising solution for addressing these challenges. In this study, we introduce a comprehensive framework, AM-DefectNet, for benchmarking ML models in melt pool characterization, a critical aspect of AM. We evaluate 15 ML models across 10 metrics using 1514 training and 505 test datasets. Our benchmarking reveals that non-linear tree-based algorithms, particularly CatBoost, LGBM, and XGBoost, outperform other models, achieving accuracies of 92.47%, 91.08%, and 90.89%, respectively. Notably, the Deep Neural Network (DNN) also demonstrates competitive performance with an accuracy of 88.55%. CatBoost emerges as the top-performing algorithm, exhibiting superior performance in precision, recall, F1-score, and overall accuracy for defect classification tasks. Learning curves provide insights into model performance and data requirements, indicating potential areas for improvement. Our study highlights the effectiveness of ML models in melt pool characterization and defect detection, laying the groundwork for process optimization in AM.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) in PMEDM - A Comparative Study in Pareto Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrical discharge machining (EDM) is a crucial process in precision manufacturing, leveraging electro-thermal energy to remove material without electrode contact. In this study, we delve into the realm of Machine Learning (ML) to enhance the efficiency and precision of EDM, particularly focusing on Powder-Mixed Electrical Discharge Machining (PMEDM) with the integration of a vibration system. We comprehensively evaluate four leading ML models - Deep Neural Network (DNN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Adaptive Gradient Boosting (AdaBoost), and ElasticNet, against a pool of ML models, employing various evaluation metrics including Accuracy, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Our evaluations, conducted on datasets enriched with features derived from powder addition and electrode vibration, reveal XGBoost superior accuracy, followed by AdaBoost, DNN, and ElasticNet. Furthermore, through the integration of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) such as NSGA-II, NSGA-III, UNSGA-III, and C-TAEA, we explore and optimize the Pareto front to attain optimal solutions. Our findings underscore the transformative potential of ML and optimization techniques in advancing EDM processes, offering cost-effective, time-efficient, and reliable solutions for precision manufacturing applications.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit torque control of topology in intrinsic antiferromagnetic insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological insulators host exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect and quantized magnetoelectric responses, but dynamic electrical control of their topological phases remains elusive. Here we demonstrate from first principles that spin-orbit torque enables direct switching of the topological state in the intrinsic antiferromagnetic bilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. A symmetry-enforced interband (time-reversal even) torque persists inside the bulk gap and deterministically reverses the N\'eel order and layer-resolved Chern number without free carriers. Upon doping, both interband and intraband torques are amplified, lowering the critical electric field for switching by two orders of magnitude. Together, these results establish two complementary regimes of control, dissipationless in-gap torques without Joule heating and enhanced current-induced torques, providing a robust route to manipulate local Chern numbers, quasi-helical edge states, and topological responses in antiferromagnetic topological insulators.</description>

      <title>A Practical Flake Segmentation and Indexing Pipeline for Automated 2D Material Stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cost-effective and robust image-processing pipeline is presented for the detection and characterization of exfoliated two-dimensional (2D) material flakes in optical microscope images, designed to facilitate automation in van der Waals heterostructure assembly. The system combines shallow machine learning (ML)-based material classification with a precision-first flake detection algorithm driven by edge morphology and color discontinuity. Step edges are resolved when supported by optical contrast, while spurious features such as dust and background texture are reliably rejected. Each identified flake is exported in a structured format that includes centroid coordinates, bounding geometries, average RGB color, and estimated optical thickness, enabling seamless integration into automated pick-up and stacking workflows. The pipeline is hardware-light and operates without the need for deep learning models or nanoscale ground-truth labels, making it practical for scalable front-end wafer processing at a hardware cost of under 30,000 USD. In contrast to prior approaches that focus solely on detection accuracy, the proposed system unifies flake segmentation with indexing, filtering, and blueprint-driven stacking, forming a closed-loop workflow from image acquisition to device planning. Its low annotation requirement and flexible implementation enable rapid deployment across diverse 2D material systems and imaging conditions.</description>

      <title>Magnonic radar for dynamic domain walls in synthetic antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin wave and magnetic domain wall are two of basic excitations in magnetic systems, and their spatiotemporal interplay encodes rich information of underlying magnetic interactions. In synthetic antiferromagnets, the domain wall acquires an inertia and the spin wave unlocks the full polarization degree of freedom, lays a salient platform for their interplay. Here we show that both the translational and angular velocities of domain wall in synthetic antiferromagnets can be detected via the scattered spin wave, through the synergy of translational and angular Doppler effects. Following the setup of an electromagnetic or acoustic radar, the time evolution of a domain wall state are accessible via a series of spin wave packets, in both non-invasive and invasive fashion. The inspections in frequency domain, offer new paradigms in exploration and exploitation of magnetic excitations.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic nonlinear valley Nernst effect in the strained bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the nonlinear valley Nernst effect (NVNE) as the second-order response of temperature gradient through the semiclassical framework of electron dynamics up to second order. Our study shows that an intrinsic nonlinear pure valley current can be generated vertically to the applied temperature in the materials with both inversion and time-reversal symmetries. This intrinsic NVNE has a quantum origin from the quantum metric and shows independence from the relaxation time. It's found that the local largest symmetry near the valleys for the nonvanishing intrinsic NVNE is a single mirror symmetry in two-dimensional systems. We theoretically investigate the intrinsic NVNE in the uniaxially strained gapless bilayer graphene and find the intrinsic NVNE can emerge when applying the temperature gradient vertically to the direction of strain. Interestingly, a transition from the compressive strain to the tensile one results in the sign reversal of the intrinsic NVNE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indium-Arsenide (InAs) nanowire field-effect transistors (NWFETs) are promising platforms for high-speed, low power nanoelectronics operating at cryogenic conditions, relevant for quantum information processing. We present selective area growth (SAG) of nanowires, which enable scalability and planar geometries that are compatible with standard semiconductor processing techniques. NWFETs are fabricated and their low temperature characteristics - including ION/IOFF ratios, threshold voltages, sub-threshold slope, interfacial trap density, hysteresis, and mobility - are characterized. The NWFETs operate successfully in integrated circuitry relying on saturation-mode operation. In sub-threshold applications such as amplifiers, we find bandwidths exceeding our cryostat wiring, but the gate hysteresis presents challenges for precise tuning of the amplifier operating point. We discuss the role of crystal imperfections and fabrication processes on the transistor characteristics and propose strategies for further improvements.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall Engineering in Graphene-Based Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress has enabled the controlled fabrication of domain walls (DWs) in graphene, which host topological kink states. Meanwhile, reliable techniques for constructing graphene-based Joseph- son junctions have been established. While the experimental prerequisites for combining DWs with Josephson junctions are now available, this direction remains largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate transport properties in graphene-based Josephson junctions mediated by topological kink states and propose three DW engineering strategies. (i) DW number engineering uncovers a continuous evolution of critical current interference pattern from Aharonov-Bohm oscil- lation to Fraunhofer diffraction with increasing DW number, reproducing experimental observations [Barrier et al., Nature 628, 741 (2024)] and suggesting enhanced sensitivity for magnetometry ap- plications. (ii) DW symmetry engineering demonstrates that an asymmetric configuration of DWs under magnetic field yields an ideal Josephson diode characterized by pronounced nonreciprocal transport. (iii) DW geometry engineering reveals that intersecting DWs enable controllable super- current splitting with ratios among leads tunable through the intersection angle, magnetic field, and superconducting phase difference. Our findings elucidate the rich physics of DW-based Josephson junctions and establish a versatile platform for next-generation quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Wide Electrical Tunability of the Valley Splitting in a Doubly gated Silicon-on-Insulator Quantum Well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The valley splitting of 2D electrons in doubly-gated silicon-on-insulator quantum wells is studied by low temperature transport measurements under magnetic fields. At the buried thermal-oxide SiO$_{2}$ interface, the valley splitting increases as a function of the electrostatic bias $\delta n = n_{B}-n_{F}$ (where $n_{B}$ and $n_{F}$ are electron densities contributed by back and front gates, respectively) and reaches values as high as $6.3$~meV, independent of the total carrier concentration of the channel. We show that $\delta n$ tunes the square of the wave function modulus at the interface and its penetration into the barrier, both of which are key quantities in a theory describing interface-induced valley splitting, and is therefore the natural experimental parameter to manipulate valleys in 2D silicon systems. At the front interface, made of a thin ``high-k'' dielectric, a smaller valley splitting is observed, adding further options to tune the valley splitting within a single device.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic responses of bilayer excitonic insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic responses of a bilayer excitonic insulators (EI) and identify two types of collective modes:
  (1) Two gapped plasmon modes couple to the layer symmetric gauge field. The transverse mode is nearly dispersionless in the long-wavelength limit, while the longitudinal mode, accounting for total charge fluctuations, has a linear dispersion with velocity proportional to two dimensional (2D) electrical polarizability.
  (2) A gapless phase (Goldstone) mode and a gapped amplitude mode, associated with the fluctuations of EI order parameter, couple to the layer antisymmetric gauge field.
  In the long-wavelength limit, the Goldstone mode exhibits linear dispersion with velocity inversely proportional to the square root of exciton compressibility, representing the first sound mode of the exciton condensate
  Significantly, its linear dispersion yields a cubic frequency dependence of the real admittance in microwave impedance microscopy (MIM), providing a method to detect the Goldstone mode directly.</description>

      <title>Classification of topological insulators and superconductors with multiple order-two point group symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for computing the classification groups of topological insulators and superconductors in the presence of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\times n}$ point group symmetries, for arbitrary natural numbers $n$. Each symmetry class is characterized by four possible additional symmetry types for each generator of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\times n}$, together with bit values encoding whether pairs of generators commute or anticommute. We show that the classification is fully determined by the number of momentum- and real-space variables flipped by each generator, as well as the number of variables simultaneously flipped by any pair of generators. As a concrete illustration, we provide the complete classification table for the case of $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\times 2}$ point group symmetry.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Dipolar Fields in Artificial Spin Ice Probed by Scanning NV Magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dipolar coupling fields in two square-lattice artificial spin ice (ASI) systems with different lattice constants using scanning probe microscopy based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond. This technique offers unprecedented spatial resolution, operates under ambient condition, and provides quantitative stray field measurements, making it uniquely suited for studying nanoscale magnetic textures. Our approach combines fluorescence quenching imaging and continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cODMR). A comparison of the two ASI samples, which differ in their lattice constants of 1000 nm and 910 nm respectively, reveals differences in the appearance of ice-rule violations - deviations from the lowest energy configuration in ASI vertices. We attribute these variations to varying coupling strengths dictated by the lattice constant. From the cODMR data, we extract both axial and transverse components of the local magnetic field relative to the NV axis. Micromagnetic modeling of these measurements allows for an iterative determination of the external magnetic field orientation, the detection of subtle magnetization tilts induced by weak external fields (well below the nanomagnets' switching threshold), and an estimation of the effective saturation magnetization, thereby accounting for deviations in nanomagnet dimensions. These findings provide crucial insights into the tunable magnetic interactions in ASI, paving the way for the design of advanced magnonic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Electromechanical Response in Ferrocene Assisted Gold Atomic Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin metallic chains serve as pivotal systems for studying quantum transport, with their conductance strongly linked to the orbital picture. Here, we report a non-monotonic electro-mechanical response in a gold-ferrocene junction, characterized by an unexpected conductance increase over a factor of ten upon stretching. This response is detected in the formation of ferrocene-assisted atomic gold chain in a mechanically controllable break junction at a cryogenic temperature. DFT based calculations show that tilting of molecules inside the chain modifies the orbital overlap and the transmission spectra, leading to such non-monotonic conductance evolution with stretching. This behavior, unlike typical flat conductance plateaus observed in metal atomic chains, pinpoints the unique role of conformational rearrangements during chain elongation. Our findings provide a deeper understanding of the role of orbital hybridization in transport properties and offer new opportunities for designing nanoscale devices with tailored electro-mechanical characteristics.</description>

      <title>All-optical band structure reconstruction and onset of Landau quantization of Dirac fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of relativistic electrons in solids depends on the precise shape of the underlying band structure. Prominently, symmetry-related mechanisms, such as the breaking of time reversal symmetry in topological insulators, can lead to the emergence of band gaps on small energy scales. It is, thus, important to quantify potential gaps of the Dirac cone with meV precision. Yet established band structure measurements are often challenged by their strict surface sensitivity or limited energy resolution. In this work, we use broadband, time-resolved THz magneto-spectroscopy to access the band structure of Dirac electrons in a buried HgTe quantum well by contact-free, all-optical measurements. Optical doping allows us to control the Fermi level without applying any electrical gate voltages. The background-free measurement of the cyclotron resonance of the Dirac system over 2.5 optical octaves, a broad range of magnetic field strengths, and different Fermi energies allows us to reconstruct the band structure near the Dirac point with sub-meV precision, and to observe a crossover of Landau quantization from a quasi-classical to the relativistic regime.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Worms: Oscillatory Bimeron Pairing And Collective Transport In Patterned Stripes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic bimerons in a domain wall provide a practical route for current driven transport in patterned magnetic stripes. However, coupling between bimerons and pinning by defects complicate reliable motion. Here we show that a periodic array of edge defects both stabilizes transport of multiple bimerons and gives rise to a distinctive collective state, the magnetic worm. A single bimeron travels at constant speed; defects lower this speed while preserving an approximately linear relation between velocity $v$ and current density $J$. With two bimerons, the center of mass advances nearly uniformly while their separation exhibits a bounded oscillation whose frequency increases and amplitude decreases with current. For larger trains, these oscillations lose synchrony, producing segmented, worm like motion. The center of mass speed grows with current but decreases as the number of bimerons increases. Notably, eight bimerons cannot be sustained in a smooth stripe but can be stabilized by the periodic defects</description>

      <title>Enhanced Terahertz Thermoelectricity via Engineered van Hove Singularities and Nernst Effect in Moir\'e Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02548v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials, long explored for energy harvesting and thermal sensing, convert heat directly into electrical signals. Extending their application to the terahertz (THz) frequency range opens opportunities for low-noise, bias-free THz detection, yet conventional thermoelectrics lack the sensitivity required for practical devices. Thermoelectric coefficients can be strongly enhanced near van Hove singularities (VHS), though these are usually difficult to access in conventional materials. Here we show that moir\'e band engineering unlocks these singularities for THz optoelectronics. Using 2D moir\'e structures as a model system, we observe strong enhancement of the THz photothermoelectric response in monolayer and bilayer graphene superlattices when the Fermi level is tuned to band singularities. Applying a relatively small magnetic field further boosts the response through the THz-driven Nernst effect, a transverse thermoelectric current driven by the THz-induced temperature gradient. Our results establish moir\'e superlattices as a versatile platform for THz thermoelectricity and highlight engineered band structures as a route to high-performance THz optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Interaction-limited conductivity of twisted bilayer graphene revealed by giant terahertz photoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the microscopic processes that limit conductivity is essential for understanding correlated and quantum-critical states in quantum materials. In twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and other twist-controlled materials, the temperature dependence of metallic resistivity follows power-law scaling, with the exponent spanning a broad range, rendering standard transport measurements insufficient to unambiguously identify the dominant scattering processes and giving rise to competing interpretations ranging from phonon-limited transport and umklapp scattering to strange metallicity and heavy fermion renormalization. Here, we use terahertz (THz) excitation to selectively raise the electron temperature in TBG while keeping the lattice cold, enabling a direct separation of electron-electron and electron-phonon contributions to resistivity. We observe a giant THz photoresistance, reaching up to 70% in magic-angle devices, demonstrating that electronic interactions dominate transport even in regimes previously attributed to phonons, including the linear-in-temperature resistivity near the magic angle. Away from the magic angle, we observe coexisting photoresistance and robust quadratic-in-temperature resistivity at extremely low carrier densities where standard electron-electron scattering mechanisms (umklapp and Baber inter-band scattering) are kinematically forbidden. Our analysis identifies the breakdown of Galilean invariance in the Dirac-type dispersion as a possible origin of the interaction-limited conductivity, arising from inter-valley electron-electron collisions. Beyond twisted bilayer graphene, our approach establishes THz-driven hot-electron transport as a general framework for disentangling scattering mechanisms in low-density quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Floquet multiple exceptional points with higher-order skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the rich non-equilibrium physics arising in periodically driven open quantum systems, specifically those realized within microcavity resonators, whose dynamics are governed by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian hosting Floquet Exceptional Points (FEPs). By introducing a periodically quenched driving protocol, we analytically derive the Floquet effective Hamiltonian and determine the locations of multiple FEPs harbored within the Floquet bulk bands. We demonstrate that the pair-production and annihilation of these FEPs can be precisely controlled by fine-tuning the system parameters, and zero and $\pi$ FEPs are topologically characterized by robust integer quantized winding numbers. To probe these singularities, we introduce a bi-orthogonal Floquet fidelity susceptibility, whose value exhibits large non-zero peaks at the momentum points hosting FEPs in the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, the momentum-summed susceptibility displays a sharp divergence when the number of FEPs change with respect to the time period of the drive. Our findings also reveal the emergence of Floquet edge states around zero energy and Dirac-like dispersion around $\pi$. Moreover, our model reveals a higher-order skin effect, where the periodically driven Hamiltonian hosts skin modes localized at both edges and corners. These insights offer novel avenues for the Floquet engineering of topological singularities in driven dissipative systems, with significant potential for manipulating light and matter at the microscale.</description>

      <title>Dimensional hierarchy of topological bound states in the continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs), with the ability of trapping and manipulating waves within the radiation continuum, have gained significant attention for their potential applications in optics and acoustics. However, challenges arise in reducing wave leakage and noise from fabrication imperfections. The emergence of robust wave manipulations based on topological BICs (TBICs) offers promising solutions. Traditionally, TBICs of different dimensions are observed separately in distinct systems. Here, we report the experimental discovery of the coexistence of two-dimensional surface TBICs and one-dimensional hinge TBICs in a single three-dimensional phononic crystal system. Such an unprecedented dimensional hierarchy of TBICs is triggered by the mechanism of separability and protected by the valley Chern numbers. Notably, these TBICs inherit dispersive propagation characteristics from valley topology and can propagate robustly against defects without leakage. Our findings offer an efficient approach to multidimensional TBICs and can be applied in designing highly efficient acoustic devices for wave trapping and manipulation in multidimensional environments.</description>

      <title>Sliding-induced ferrovalley polarization and possible antiferromagnetic half-metal in bilayer altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets, a newly discovered class of materials, exhibit zero net magnetization while hosting spin-split electronic bands. However, monolayer altermagnets maintain degenerate band gaps at the high-symmetry X and Y points in the Brillouin zone, manifesting a paravalley phase characterized by unpolarized valley states. In this work, we demonstrate that spontaneously broken valley degeneracy can be achieved through interlayer sliding in engineered M$_2$A$_2$B and M$_2$AA$'$B bilayer altermagnets by first-principles calculations and minimal microscopic model. We propose a promising route to achieve antiferromagnetic half-metal driven by sliding and emergent ferrovalley phase without applied electric field, which is realized in the V$_2$SSeO engineered bilayer. Our calculations also reveal that Mo$_2$O$_2$O exhibits the largest valley splitting gap of ~0.31 eV, making it a promising candidate for valley-spin valve devices. Furthermore, band structure calculations on Mo$_2$AA$'$O materials demonstrate that increasing the difference in atomic number ($\Delta$Z) between A and A$'$ site atoms effectively enhances valley polarization. This work establishes a novel platform for discovering and controlling ferrovalley states in altermagnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum States in Twisted Tubes with Linear Cross-Section Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a particle confined in a twisted tube with a linearly varying cross section. By relating a general linear transformation matrix to the system's Hamiltonian, we use an extended thin-layer method to derive an effective Hamiltonian for tangential motion under mild and general linear transformations. Explicit forms are provided for three fundamental transformations: rotation, scaling, and shearing. Rotation introduces a gauge field coupled to angular momentum, while scaling and shearing produce geometric potentials that lift degeneracies in non-circular cross sections. In square cross sections, these transformations cause energy splittings among formerly degenerate states, whereas circular cross sections retain degeneracy. Through an example combining rotation and squeezing, we analyze state evolution and compute the quantum geometric tensor to quantify geometric response. Our results demonstrate how geometric transformations can tailor quantum states and suggest that circular waveguides are more robust against mode mixing.</description>

      <title>rhodent: A Python package for analyzing real-time TDDFT response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time time-dependent density functional theory (rt-TDDFT) is a well-established method for studying the dynamic response of matter in the femtosecond or optical range. In this method, the Kohn-Sham (KS) wave functions are propagated forward in time, and in principle, one can extract any observable at any given time. Alternatively, by taking a Fourier transform, spectroscopic quantities can be extracted. There are many publicly available codes implementing rt-TDDFT, which differ in their numeric solution of the KS equations, their available exchange-correlation functionals, and in their analysis capabilities. For users of rt-TDDFT, this is an inconvenient situation because they may need to use a numerical method that is available in one code, but an analysis method available in another. Here, we introduce rhodent, a modular Python package for processing the output of rt-TDDFT calculations. Our package can be used to calculate hot-carrier distributions, energies, induced densities, and dipole moments, and various decompositions thereof. In its current version, rhodent handles calculation results from the gpaw code, but can readily be extended to support other rt-TDDFT codes. Additionally, under the assumption of linear response, rhodent can be used to calculate the response to a narrow-band laser, from the response to a broad-band perturbation, greatly speeding up the analysis of frequency-dependent excitations. We demonstrate the capabilities of rhodent via a set of examples, for systems consisting of Al and Ag clusters and organic molecules.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation by a spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, fundamentally limits the efficiency of photonic systems by enforcing reciprocal energy exchange between source and detector. Breaking this reciprocity is particularly important for advancing photonic devices for energy conversion, radiative cooling, and mid-infrared sensing and imaging. Driven by the growing need for photonic platforms to overcome reciprocity constraints, we present the first demonstration of spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurfaces operating at mid-infrared frequencies suitable for the violation of the Kirchhoff's law at room temperature. We fabricate a graphene-based integrated photonic structure and experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal reflection from a metasurface modulated at gigahertz frequencies. We develop a theoretical framework to relate nonreciprocal scattering under spatiotemporal modulation with unequal absorptivity and emissivity for violation of the spectral directional Kirchhoff's law. Our experiment and theory imply effective decoupling of absorption and emission channels by breaking time-reversal symmetry at thermal wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Entropy Flow at the Quantum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal management is a key challenge, both globally and microscopically in integrated circuits and quantum technologies. The associated heat flow $I_Q$ has been understood since the advent of thermodynamics by a process of elimination, $I_Q{=}I_E{-}\mu I_N$, subtracting from the energy flow $I_E$ its convective contribution. However, in the quantum limit, this formula implies the paradoxical result that the entropy entrained by heat flow is unbounded even though the entropy itself tends to zero. We resolve this conundrum by recognizing that the traditional formula for heat is missing a quantum term. The correct quantum formula predicts that the heat produced in quantum processes is vastly smaller than previously believed, with correspondingly beneficial consequences for the efficiency of quantum machines.</description>

      <title>Vacuum currents in elliptic pseudosphere tubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the effects of spatial topology, curvature, and magnetic flux on the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the current density for a charged scalar field in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime. The elliptic pseudosphere is considered as an exactly solvable background geometry. The topological contribution is separated in the Hadamard function for general phases in the periodicity condition along the compact dimension. Two equivalent expressions are provided for the component of the current density in that direction. The corresponding VEV is a periodic function of the magnetic flux with a period equal to the flux quantum. In the flat spacetime limit, we recover the result for a conical space with a general value of the planar angle deficit. Near the origin of the elliptic pseudosphere, the effect of the spatial curvature on the vacuum current density is weak. The same applies for small values of the length of the compact dimension. Using the conformal relations between the elliptic pseudosphere and the (2+1)-dimensional de Sitter spacetime with a planar angle deficit, we determine the current densities for a conformally coupled massless scalar field in the static and hyperbolic vacuum states of locally de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Self-Organising Memristive Networks as Physical Learning Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning with physical systems is an emerging paradigm that seeks to harness the intrinsic nonlinear dynamics of physical substrates for learning. The impetus for a paradigm shift in how hardware is used for computational intelligence stems largely from the unsustainability of artificial neural network software implemented on conventional transistor-based hardware. This Perspective highlights one promising approach using physical networks comprised of resistive memory nanoscale components with dynamically reconfigurable, self-organising electrical circuitry. Experimental advances have revealed the non-trivial interactions within these Self-Organising Memristive Networks (SOMNs), offering insights into their collective nonlinear and adaptive dynamics, and how these properties can be harnessed for learning using different hardware implementations. Theoretical approaches, including mean-field theory, graph theory, and concepts from disordered systems, reveal deeper insights into the dynamics of SOMNs, especially during transitions between different conductance states where criticality and other dynamical phase transitions emerge in both experiments and models. Furthermore, parallels between adaptive dynamics in SOMNs and plasticity in biological neuronal networks suggest the potential for realising energy-efficient, brain-like continual learning. SOMNs thus offer a promising route toward embedded edge intelligence, unlocking real-time decision-making for autonomous systems, dynamic sensing, and personalised healthcare, by enabling embedded learning in resource-constrained environments. The overarching aim of this Perspective is to show how the convergence of nanotechnology, statistical physics, complex systems, and self-organising principles offers a unique opportunity to advance a new generation of physical intelligence technologies.</description>

      <title>Band Geometry Induced Third-Harmonic Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Third-harmonic generation (THG) is a key nonlinear optical process for ultrafast imaging, terahertz (THz) signal generation, and symmetry-sensitive probes, often dominating in centrosymmetric materials where lower-order responses vanish. Yet, the role of band geometry, Fermi surface effects, and disorder in enabling large and tunable THG remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a finite-frequency quantum kinetic theory of THG based on the density matrix formalism, deriving the third-harmonic conductivity tensor. Our framework isolates five distinct band-geometric contributions to interband and intraband processes, separates Fermi sea from Fermi surface terms, and incorporates disorder effects phenomenologically. We further provide a complete symmetry classification of THG for all 122 magnetic point groups. Applying the theory to the spin-split altermagnet RuO$_2$, we trace its THG response to specific geometric terms. These results establish a predictive foundation for designing materials with enhanced and tunable THG in the finite-frequency regime.</description>

      <title>Topological Control of Polaritonic Flatbands in Anisotropic van der Waals Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic van der Waals (vdW) materials exhibit direction-dependent optical and electronic properties, making them valuable for tailoring directional light-matter interactions. Rhenium disulfide (ReS$_2$) stands out for its strong in-plane anisotropy and its thickness-independent direct-bandgap excitons, which can hybridize with light to form exciton-polaritons. In parallel, metasurfaces, engineered arrays of nanoscale subwavelength resonators, can support ultra-sharp photonic modes in the form of quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBICs). Topological transformations of photonic modes can give rise to flatbands, i.e., dispersionless states with quenched kinetic energy and vanishing group velocity. Intrinsic material anisotropy offers an unexplored route to robust far-field flatband formation and control. Here, we demonstrate how structuring an intrinsically anisotropic excitonic material into a resonant metasurface fundamentally transforms its photonic topological features and light-matter coupling behavior, allowing us to drive and topologically control extended far-field flatband formation. To this end, we fabricate C$_4$-symmetric metasurfaces directly from bulk ReS$_2$. The intrinsic anisotropy lifts the initial double degeneracy of the qBIC mode and yields two distinctly polarized resonances. It also reshapes the topological landscape: the integer topological charge of the qBIC mode splits into momentum-separated half-integer singularities, thereby flattening the far-field photonic dispersion. The resulting topologically-controlled photonic flatbands are then tuned in resonance with the linearly polarized excitonic transitions of ReS$_2$, resulting in two distinct, directionally hybridized exciton-polariton flatband regimes. These findings establish anisotropic vdW metasurfaces as a new platform for topologically engineered flatbands and flatband-driven light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Two-level system loss characterization of NbTi superconducting resonators on Si/SiO2 substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting coplanar waveguide (SCPW) resonators, key components for quantum computing and sensing applications, require a high internal quality factor (Qi) for effective qubit readout and quantum sensing applications. Minimizing two-level system (TLS) losses, particularly at material interfaces, is critical for gatemon and topological qubits operating at low temperatures and in high magnetic fields. NbTi, a superconducting alloy with a high upper critical field, enables SCPW resonators resilient to such conditions. We fabricated NbTi SCPW resonators on Si/SiO2 substrates and systematically characterized their TLS-limited quality factors as functions of temperature and microwave photon number. Our results demonstrate that NbTi-based SCPWs on Si/SiO2 substrates provide a promising platform for developing next-generation quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Ideal Optical Flux Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in cold atomic gases is a long-standing goal in quantum simulation. Established approaches, including rapidly rotating gases and tight-binding lattices, are often hampered by low interaction energies and small many-body energy gaps. While optical flux lattices (OFLs) can achieve higher effective magnetic flux densities, standard two-state configurations generate highly non-uniform fields, and extensions to multi-state systems introduce significant experimental complexity. Here, we present a new paradigm for engineering robust FQH phases in OFLs using only two internal atomic states. We show that the introduction of an additional scalar potential provides a generic mechanism for creating Chern bands that are simultaneously essentially flat and "ideal." Drawing on concepts from moir\'e materials, these desirable properties arise by tuning lattice parameters to certain $N$-flat manifolds $(N=1,2,\dots)$, where the $1$-flat manifold shares its origin with certain "magic-angle" conditions. We provide a variety of examples of how to design optical flux lattices, including dark-state OFLs, to achieve these goals. This method allows for precise tuning of band flatness and stabilizes both Abelian and non-Abelian FQH phases. Our scheme is compatible with existing experimental capabilities using vector polarizability, opening practical routes to exploring strongly correlated topological physics with cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Bogoliubov transformations as Lorentz boosts in $(c,{\overline c})=(1,1)$ conformal field theories with marginal $J{\overline J }$ deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider conformal field theories with central charges $(c,{\overline c})=(1,1)$ that are invariant under the exchange of the holomorphic and antiholomorphic sectors, in both bosonic and fermionic realizations that are meaningful for condensed matter systems. The effect of marginal current-current $(J,{\overline J})$ perturbations is to induce a deformation of the Hilbert space given by a Lorentz boost in the 2D space of currents, which is identified with a Bogoliubov transformation. The rapidity of the boost is determined by the coupling constant of the marginal perturbation. When the perturbation is diagonal in the original currents of the theory, there is a linear relation between the two, and non-linear otherwise. In the fermionic cases, both free and with Calogero-Sutherland interactions, the marginal perturbation corresponds to backward scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Superstrong Dynamics and Chiral Emission of a Giant Atom in a Structured Bath</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters coupled to waveguides with nonlinear dispersion show rich quantum dynamics with the promise of implementing non-trivial non-Markovian quantum models. Recent advances in engineered photonic environments now allow the realization of discrete-site waveguides with tailored dispersion, yet most implementations of waveguide QED remain limited to a local qubit-waveguide coupling. Here, we study a transmon qubit non-locally coupled to a high-impedance coupled cavity array (CCA), thus implementing a \emph{giant atom} in a structured photonic environment. The non-local coupling produces interference with the CCA eigenmodes, selectively enhancing interaction with long-wavelength (low-effective $k$), symmetric modes about the array center, while suppressing coupling to antisymmetric and short-wavelength modes. For a subset of symmetric, low-effective $k$ modes, we reach the superstrong coupling regime. In this regime, measurements of the atomic participation ratio reveal strongly hybridized eigenmodes on a par with a strongly reduced qubit participation at the frequency of maximum hybridization with the qubit, in agreement with theory. Time-domain measurements of the qubit dynamics show clear deviations from the single-mode Jaynes--Cummings model, marked by the emergence of mode--mode interactions. By breaking inversion symmetry, the qubit seeds dressed eigenmodes confined to either the right or left of the qubit, which we exploit to implement and characterize a chiral photon-emission protocol. These results demonstrate precise control over multimode light--matter interaction in a structured photonic environment.</description>

      <title>The Zeno-like effect in a spin-chain quantum battery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum batteries, which can be seen as energy- or state-storage devices exploiting coherence and other quantum effects, are sensitive to environmental noise. Here we show that, when suitably engineered, environmental noise can induce a "Zeno-like" stabilization of the charging process in a spin-chain quantum battery. To explore this interplay, we study a system size N=6, which provides large storage capacity with moderate computational cost, and more importantly, allows the stored energy to become almost fully extractable since the ergotropy nearly coincides with the total capacity. We analyze three local noise channels: bit flip, phase flip, and bit phase flip. We vary the strength of each channel to emulate frequent environmental monitoring, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect, and track its influence on the charging dynamics and stored energy. The phase-flip channel slows charging under strong noise but stabilizes stored energy and ergotropy. The bit-flip channel enables faster charging but saturates at low capacities, while the bit phase flip channel combines both features. In the discharging stage, different noise channels lead to distinct release dynamics, showing that noise can paradoxically enhance and stabilize quantum battery operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an all-mechanical protocol for coherent control and full quantum-state reconstruction of the fundamental flexural mode of a suspended carbon nanotube (CNT). Calibrated impulses from a nearby atomic force microscope (AFM) tip serve a dual role: they implement mechanical pi/2 rotations for Ramsey interferometry and realize phase-space displacements for Wigner function tomography via displaced-parity sampling. The same actuator thus unifies control and tomography while avoiding optical heating and eliminating on-chip microwave drive lines at the resonator. We derive explicit control pulse sequences and a master-equation description that map measured signals onto the energy-relaxation and phase-coherence times, as well as onto parity-based quantum signatures, including negative regions of the Wigner function. The approach is compatible with multiple readout modalities: direct AFM deflection, dispersive coupling to a Cooper-pair box, and dispersive microwave cavity probing. Together, these techniques provide complete access to populations, coherence, and parity within a single device architecture. This minimal scheme provides a practical route to all-mechanical quantum control and state-resolved characterization of decoherence in mesoscopic mechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Theory for the spectral splitting exponent of exceptional points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), singularities in non-Hermitian systems where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce, exhibit a dramatically enhanced response to perturbations compared to Hermitian degeneracies. This makes them exceptional candidates for sensing applications. The spectral splitting of an $N$th-order EP scales with perturbation strength $\epsilon$ over a wide range, from $\epsilon$ to $\epsilon^{1/N}$. Although the exact scaling exponent can be determined in principle by solving the characteristic equation, this approach becomes analytically intractable for large $N$ and often fails to yield useful physical insight. In this work, we develop a theory to directly predict the scaling exponent from the matrix positions of the perturbation. By using the Jordan block structure of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, we show that the splitting exponent can be analytically determined when the matrix positions of the perturbation satisfy some specific conditions. Our analytical framework provides a useful design principle for engineering perturbations to achieve a desired spectral response, facilitating the development of EP-based sensors.</description>

Abstract: Highly coherent quantum emitters operating in the telecommunication C-band (1530 - 1565nm), where ultra-low-loss fibers and photonic circuits are available, are crucial to the development of scalable quantum technologies. In this work, we report on a modified Stranski-Krastanov growth scheme using chemical beam epitaxy to enable the generation of high-quality InAs/InP quantum dots, characterized by near-transform-limited linewidths ($\Gamma_{\mathrm{TL}}$). We demonstrate the growth of highly-symmetric quantum dots with aspect ratios &gt;0.8 and densities ranging from 2 to 22$\,\mu$m$^{-2}$. Optical characterization of these sources reveal fine-structure splittings down to $25\pm4\,\mu$eV and a single-photon purity of $g^{(2)}(0) = 0.012\pm\mathrm{0.007}$, confirming the quality of these dots. Further, using an etalon to measure the linewidth, in combination with rigorous modelling, we find an upper-bound to the mean, low-power linewidths of only $12.1\pm 6.7\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$ and, in the best case, $2.8\pm 1.8\,\Gamma_\mathrm{TL}$. These results represent a significant step in the development of telecom-wavelength quantum light sources which are essential for complex quantum networks and devices.</description>

      <title>Signatures of three-state Potts nematicity in spin excitations of the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePSe$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-dimensional (2D) nearly square-lattice quantum materials, electron correlations can induce an electronic nematic phase with twofold rotational ($C_2$) symmetry that profoundly impacts their properties. For 2D materials with threefold rotational ($C_3$) symmetry, such as the honeycomb lattice, a vestigial three-state Potts nematic order has been observed in the van der Waals antiferromagnet (AFM) FePSe$_3$ via optical and thermodynamic methods under uniaxial strain. Here, we use neutron scattering to study the magnetic order and spin excitations of FePSe$_3$ under uniaxial strain. In the AFM ordered state, we find that $\sim$0.6% tensile strain significantly suppresses one zigzag domain and promotes the other two, lowering the AFM order and spin waves to $C_2$ symmetry. The broken $C_3$ symmetry in spin excitations persists slightly above $T_{\rm{N}}\approx 108.6$ K, where the zigzag AFM order is absent. Our results thus provide direct evidence of magnetoelastic coupling and suggest that the three-state Potts nematicity in paramagnetic spin excitations arises from the vestigial order associated with the low-temperature zigzag AFM order.</description>

Abstract: One of the most spectacular properties associated with Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is superfluidity in which the system exhibits zero viscosity and flows without dissipation. The superfluid phase has been observed in wide ranging Bosonic systems spanning naturally occurring quantum fluids, such as liquid helium, to engineered platforms such as bilayer excitons and cold atom systems. Theoretical works have proposed that interactions could drive the BEC ground state into another exotic phase that simultaneously exhibits properties of both a crystalline solid and a superfluid - termed a supersolid. Identifying a material system, however, that hosts the predicted BEC solid phase, driven purely by interactions and without imposing an external lattice potential, has remained elusive. Here we report observation of a superfluid to insulator transition in the layer-imbalanced regime of bilayer magneto-excitons. Mapping the transport behavior of the bilayer condensate as a function of density and temperature, suggests that the insulating phase is an ordered state of dilute excitons, stabilized by dipole interactions. The insulator melts into a recovered superfluid upon increasing the temperature, which could indicate that the low temperature solid is also a quantum coherent phase.</description>

Abstract: In metals with finite magnetization $\vec{M}$, experiment shows that transverse polarized dc spin currents $\vec{J}_{i}$ both decay and precess on crossing a finite sample thickness. The present work uses Onsager's irreversible thermodynamics, with $\vec{M}$ and $\vec{J}_{i}$ as fundamental variables, to develop a theory with aspects of the Landau-Lifshitz theory solely for the $\vec{M}$ of (charged) electronic ferromagnets, and of the Leggett theory for the $\vec{M}$ and $\vec{J}_{i}$ of (uncharged) nuclear paramagnets. As for the ferromagnet of Landau-Lifshitz, $\partial_{t}\vec{M}$ includes a characteristic decay time $\tau_{M}$. As for the nuclear paramagnet, $\partial_{t}\vec{J}_{i}$ includes a characteristic decay time $\tau_{J}$, is driven by the gradient of a (vector) spin pressure, and precesses about a mean-field proportional to $\vec{M}$. The spin pressure has a coefficient $G$ proportional to a velocity squared, and $D_{0}\equiv \frac{1}{2}G\tau_{J}$ serves as an effective diffusion coefficient. These equations apply when spin currents are generated. Using the derived dynamical equations for the magnetization and for the spin current, we obtain the steady state (dc limit) solution whose transverse wavevector squared is complex, with real part from diffusion and imaginary part from precession. The ac case is also considered.</description>

Abstract: Existing quantum Hall interferometers measure twice the braiding phase, $e^{i2\theta}$, of Abelian anyons, i.e. the phase accrued when one quasi-particle encircles another clockwise. We propose a modified Fabry-P\'{e}rot or Mach-Zehnder interferometer that can measure $e^{i\theta}$.</description>

      <title>Strong photon coupling to high-frequency antiferromagnetic magnons via topological surface states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show strong coupling between antiferromagnetic magnons and microwave cavity photons at both high and externally controllable magnon frequencies. Using the fully quantum mechanical path-integral method, we study an antiferromagnetic insulator (AFM) interfaced with a topological insulator (TI), taking Bi$_2$Se$_3$--MnSe as a representative example. We show that the mutual coupling of the spin-polarized surface states of the TI to both the squeezed magnons and the circularly polarized cavity photons results in a Chern-Simons term that activates the stronger electric, rather than magnetic, dipole coupling. Moreover, a squeezing-mediated enhancement of the coupling is achieved due to the unequal interfacial exchange coupling to the AFM sublattices, resulting in a coupling strength up to several orders stronger than for direct magnon-photon coupling. While direct cavity-AFM coupling has so far been limited in its applicability due to weak or low frequency coupling, this result may advance the utilization of high-frequency cavity magnonics and enable its incorporation into quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Impact of Josephson junction array modes on fluxonium readout</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds can be utilized as low-cost, highly versatile quantum sensors for studying surface properties in condensed matter physics through the application of relaxometry protocols. For such applications, a detailed knowledge of the intrinsic relaxation processes of NV centers in nanodiamonds is necessary. Here, we study the spin-lattice relaxation rates of NV ensembles in nanodiamonds with average diameters of 40 nm and 3 $\mu$m between room temperature and $\sim$ 6 K. The NV relaxation curves fit to a stretched-exponential form with a stretching exponent $\alpha \approx 0.7$, implying the large distribution of relaxation times of individual centers within nanodiamonds. We determine the Orbach-like scattering on phonons as the leading relaxation mechanism. Finally, we discuss the viability of nanodiamonds as surface sensors when deposited on a metallic substrate and emphasize the need for well-controlled surface preparation techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wurtzite nitride ferroelectric materials have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation memory applications due to their exceptional polarization properties and compatibility with conventional semiconductor processing techniques. Here, we demonstrate the first successful areal scaling of Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) ferroelectric diode (FeDiode) memory down to 40 nm device diameters while maintaining ON/OFF &gt; 60. Using a 20 nm thick Al0.64Sc0.36N ferroelectric layer, we evaluate both metal-insulator-ferroelectric-metal (MIFM) and metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) architectures for scaled resistive memory devices. Our scaled devices exhibit an enhanced breakdown-to-coercive field ratio exceeding 2.6 due to increased breakdown field. The MIFM devices demonstrate stable 3-bit non-volatile multistate behavior with clearly distinguishable resistance states and retention exceeding 4*10^4 seconds at 85 C. By achieving more than a million-fold areal scaling with enhanced performance metrics, this work establishes AlScN-based FeDiode memory as a highly promising platform for non-volatile storage with potential for direct integration into CMOS technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Friedel oscillations in a two-dimensional non-interacting electron gas and in a monolayer graphene in the presence of a single impurity. The potential generated by the impurity is modeled using a non-Coulomb interaction ($\sim r^{-\eta}$). The charge carrier density deviation as a function of distance from the impurity is calculated within the linear response theory. Our results show that, in both a two-dimensional non-interacting electron gas and graphene, the phase of charge carrier density oscillations remains unaffected by the parameter $\eta$, which characterizes the non-Coulomb nature of the interaction, at large distances from the impurity. The parameter $\eta$ influences only the amplitude of the oscillations in this regime. The results for an impurity modeled by Coulomb-like potential ($\eta = 1$) are recovered in both cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The band inversion transition in a cylindrical HgTe nanowire is inducible via varying the nanowire radius. Here we derive the low-energy effective Hamiltonian describing the band structure of the HgTe nanowire close to the fundamental band gap. Because both the $E_{1}$ and $H_{1}$ subbands have quadratic dependence on $k_{z}$ when the gap closes, we need to consider at least three subbands, i.e., the $E_{1}$, $H_{1}$, and $H_{2}$ subbands, in building the effective Hamiltonian. The resulting effective Hamiltonian is block diagonal and each block is a $3\times3$ matrix. End states are found in the inverted regime when we solve the effective Hamiltonian with open boundary condition.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the localized surface plasmon modes of a sub-wavelength spherical nanoparticle composed of a Weyl semimetal, taking into account the axion modification of electrodynamics. We derive analytical solutions for dipole and quadrupole normal modes by employing the quasistatic approximation. The axion term leads to modified Fr\"ohlich conditions, resulting in multiple non-degenerate plasmonic resonances with distinct polarization dependencies. In contrast to isotropic conventional metals, the magnetoelectric properties of Weyl semimetals enable an incident electromagnetic field, with the electric field transverse to the surface of the sphere, to excite a localized surface plasmon.</description>

      <title>Relaxation pathways and emergence of domains in square artificial spin ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-domain states of square artificial spin ice show a range of different morphologies ranging from simple stripe-like domains to more organically shaped coral domains. To model the relevant dynamics leading to the emergence of such diverse domain structures, simplified descriptions of the switching behavior of individual nanomagnets are necessary. In this work, we employ kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of the demagnetization of square artificial spin ice toward its ground state, and compare how the choice of transition barriers affect the emergence of mesoscale domains. We find that the commonly used mean-field barrier model (informed by equilibrium energetics only) results in propagation of ground-state string avalanches. In contrast, taking into account chiral barrier splitting enabled by state-dependent local torques supports the emergence of complex-shaped coral domains and their successful relaxation towards the ground state in later relaxation stages. Our results highlight that intrinsic contributions to switching barriers, in addition to the effect of extrinsic defects often attributed to nanofabrication irregularities, can subtly shift favored transition pathways and result in different emergent mesoscale features. Future kinetic Monte Carlo models that describe the evolution of artificial spin systems should thus account for these effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: M\"obius topological insulators have dispersive edge bands with M\"obius twists in momentum space, which are protected by the combination of chiral and $Z_2$-projective translational symmetries. In this work, we reveal a unique type of M\"obius topological insulator, whose edge bands could twist around the quasienergy $\pi$ of a periodically driven system and are thus of Floquet origin. By applying time-periodic quenches to an experimentally realized M\"obius insulator model, we obtain interconnected M\"obius edge bands around zero and $\pi$ quasienergies, which can coexist with a gapped or gapless bulk. These M\"obius bands are topologically characterized by a pair of generalized winding numbers, which are integer-quantized due to an emergent chiral symmetry at a high-symmetry point in momentum space. Numerical investigations of the quasienergy and entanglement spectra provide consistent evidence for the presence of such M\"obius topological phases. A protocol based on the adiabatic switching of edge-band populations is further introduced to dynamically characterize the topology of Floquet M\"obius edge bands. Our findings thus extend the scope of M\"obius topological phases to nonequilibrium settings and unveil a unique class of M\"obius-twisted topological edge states without static counterparts.</description>

      <title>Three-Majorana Cotunneling Interferometer for Non-Abelian Braiding and Topological Quantum Gate Implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03553v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for performing Majorana zero mode (MZM) braiding utilizing cotunneling processes in a three-MZM system incorporating reference arms. This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reversible control of spin-dependent thermoelectricity via mechanical strain provides a platform for next-generation energy harvesting and thermal logic circuits. Using first-principles and Boltzmann transport calculations, we demonstrate that monolayer NiI$_2$ undergoes a strain-driven semiconductor-to-half-metal transition, enabled by the selective closure of its spin-down band gap while preserving a robust ferromagnetic ground state. Remarkably, this transition is accompanied by a giant, non-monotonic violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, with the Lorenz number enhanced up to $7.17\,L_0$. This anomaly arises from a strain-sensitive hybridization between Ni-$d$ and I-$p$ orbitals, leading to spin-polarized transport channels and decoupling of heat and charge currents. These properties make NiI$_2$ a promising candidate for mechanically gated spin-caloritronic devices and thermal logic elements, where reversible control of heat and spin flow is essential. Our findings position NiI$_2$ as a model system for exploring non-Fermi-liquid transport and for realizing strain-tunable, energy-efficient functionalities in low-dimensional platforms.</description>

      <title>Photogalvanic effect in hydrodynamic flows of nonreciprocal electron liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study nonlinear hydrodynamic electron transport driven by an AC electric field. In noncentrosymmetric conductors with broken time-reversal (TR) symmetry the nonlinear flow of such liquids is nonreciprocal, giving rise to a DC current $I^{DC}$ that is quadratic in the amplitude of the AC electric field. This is the hydrodynamic analogue of the linear photogalvanic effect (PGE), which arises in bulk noncentrosymmetric materials with broken TR symmetry. The magnitude of $I^{DC}$ depends on both the properties of the electron fluid and the geometry of the flow, and may be characterized by two dimensionless parameters: the nonreciprocity number $\mathcal{N}$, and the frequency-dependent vibrational number $\mathcal{R}$. Due to nonlocality of hydrodynamic transport, at low frequencies of the AC drive, $I^{DC}$ is super-extensive. The AC component of the electric current is likewise strongly affected by nonreciprocity: the hysteretic current-voltage dependence becomes skewed, which can be interpreted in terms of nonreciprocity of the memory retention time.</description>

Abstract: We present an effective medium theory based on density functional theory that is implemented in VASP using the PAW method with a plane wave basis set. The transmission coefficient is derived through three complementary approaches: the current density relation J=nqv, the field operator method, and the nonquilibrium Green's function formalism. We compare transmission coefficients calculated using EMT-PW with results from NEGF-DFT, based on the NanoDCAL package utilizing a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) basis set, for both periodic and nonperiodic boundary conditions. The minor discrepancies observed are attributed to differences in basis sets, pseudopotentials, and the treatment of lead regions. Notably, the EMT-PW framework avoids the common issue of overcompleteness encountered in non-equilibrium transport theories and allows for the decomposition of the total transmission coefficient into contributions from individual eigenstates. Furthermore, when combined with an effective gate model, EMT-PW is shown to be a powerful tool for analyzing current characteristics in nanodevices under applied gate voltages. By leveraging one-electron wavefunctions in eigenstates, this method provides a robust foundation for exploring the quantum statistics of electrons and current quantum correlations within the second quantization framework.</description>

      <title>The birefringent spin-laser as a system of coupled harmonic oscillators</title>

Abstract: Adding spin-polarized carriers to semiconductor lasers strongly changes their properties and, through the transfer of angular momentum, leads to the emission of circularly polarized light. In such spin-lasers, the polarization of the emitted light can be modulated an order of magnitude faster than its intensity in the best conventional lasers. This ultrafast operation in spin-lasers relies on large linear birefringence, usually viewed as detrimental in spin and conventional lasers, which couples the two linearly polarized emission modes. We show that the dynamical properties of birefringent spin-lasers under intensity and polarization modulation are accurately described as coupled harmonic oscillators. Our model agrees with the intensity-equation description which, unlike the common complex field components describing the role of birefringence in laser dynamics, uses simpler real quantities and allows analytical solutions. We further predict unexplored operation regimes and elucidate the difference between the weak and strong coupling in spin-lasers.</description>

      <title>Classical-to-Quantum Crossover in 2D TMD Field-Effect Transistors: A First-Principles Study via Sub-10 nm Channel Scaling Beyond the Boltzmann Tyranny</title>

Abstract: Scaling field-effect transistors (FETs) into the sub-10 nm regime fundamentally alters electronic transport mechanisms, challenging the conventional design rules that have underpinned semiconductor technology for decades. The impact of competing classical and quantum transport on sub-10-nm 2D FET scaling remains poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of 2D TMD nanojunctions with channel lengths from 12 down to 3 nm, using first-principles calculations that integrate the nonequilibrium Green function formalism implemented in density functional theory (NEGF-DFT) and an effective gate model. Our simulations reveal a pronounced crossover from semiclassical thermionic emission to quantum tunnelling, governed by two characteristic temperatures:(1) $T_{c}$, denotes the temperature at which the OFF current reaches its minimum, marking the optimal condition for turning off the transistor; (2) $T_{t}$, above which the subthreshold swing saturates at the Boltzmann tyranny scaled by the gate-control efficiency factor. Longer channels enter the classical regime at much lower temperatures, where thermionic emission dominates, and perfect contact with S.S. approaches the Boltzmann Tyranny scaled by the gate controlling efficiency. The shortest 3 nm junction exhibits pronounced quantum tunneling up to 500 K and achieves a subthreshold swing superior to the physical limit of transistors, known as the Boltzmann Tyranny, enabled by the steep energy dependence of the transmission coefficient. This study provides a theoretical prediction of the transition from classical to quantum transport in sub-10 nm 2D TMD transistors, identifying critical temperatures that define the boundary between these regimes and offering key design insights for harnessing quantum and classical hybrid transistor technology.</description>

Abstract: Light-induced coherent phonons provide a powerful platform for ultrafast control of material properties. However, the microscopic theory and quantum geometric nature of this phenomenon remain underexplored. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical framework based on Feynman diagrams to systematically describe the generation of coherent phonons by light. We identify a dominant second-order, double-resonant process in noncentrosymmetric semiconductors that efficiently couples light to both electronic and phononic excitations. Crucially, we uncover the quantum geometric origin, encoded in the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) shift vector and the EPC quantum geometric tensor. Applying our theory to ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$ and SnSe, we demonstrate the potential for light-induced modulation of ferroelectric polarization driven by coherent phonons. This work provides fundamental insights for designing efficient optical control strategies for both coherent phonons and ferroelectric polarization.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced Ettingshausen effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastic deformations couple with electronic degrees of freedom in materials to generate gauge fields that lead to interesting transport properties. Recently, it has been well studied that strain-induced chiral magnetic fields in Weyl semimetals lead to interesting magnetotransport induced by the chiral anomaly (CA). Recent studies have revealed that CA is not necessarily only a Weyl-node property, but is rather a Fermi surface property, and is also present in a more general class of materials, for example, in spin orbit-coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs). The interplay of strain, CA, and charge and thermomagnetic transport in SOC-NCMs, however, remains unexplored. Here we resolve this gap. Using a tight-binding model for SOC-NCMs, we first demonstrate that strain in SOC-NCMs induces anisotropy in the spin-orbit coupling and generates an axial electric field. Then, using the quasi-classical Boltzmann transport formalism with momentum-dependent intraband and interband scattering processes, we show that strain in the presence of external magnetic field can generate temperature gradients via the Nernst-Ettingshausen effect, whose direction and behavior depends the on interplay of multiple factors: the angle between the applied strain and magnetic field, the presence of the chiral anomaly, the Lorentz force, and the strength of interband scattering. We further reveal that time-reversal symmetry breaking in the presence of an external magnetic field generates the Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Ettingshausen effect, which is qualitatively distinct from the conventional Lorentz-force-driven counterpart. In light of recent and forthcoming theoretical and experimental advances in the field of SOC-NCMs, we find our study to be particularly timely and relevant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13571v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an electrical all-bands-flat (ABF) lattice and experimentally generate compact localized states (CLSs) therein. The lattice is a diamond (rhombic) chain and implemented as a network of capacitors and inductors, as well as voltage inverters (using operational amplifiers) in order to introduce a \(\pi\)-phase flux within each diamond. The network's normal modes split into three flat bands, and the corresponding CLSs can be excited in isolation via a two-node driving at the flat band frequencies. We also examine the role of the lattice edges and their interaction with the CLSs. Finally, we compare the experimental results to tight-binding predictions and obtain very good agreement. This analysis paves the way for further experimental implementations of ABF systems in electric networks, especially with an eye towards exploring their interplay with nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Measuring high field gradients of cobalt nanomagnets in a spin-mechanical setup</title>

Abstract: Hybrid systems composed of a single nitrogen-vacancy center spin magnetically coupled to a macroscopic mechanical resonator constitute promising platforms for the realization of quantum information protocols and for quantum sensing applications. The magnetic structure that mediates the interaction must ensure high field gradients while preserving the spin and mechanical properties. We present a spin-mechanical setup built around a cobalt nanomagnet grown with focused electron beam-induced deposition. The magnetic structure is fully characterized, and a maximum gradient of $170\,\mathrm{kT/m}$ is directly measured at a spin-oscillator distance of a few hundred nanometers. Spin coherence was preserved at the value of $20\,\mathrm{ \mu s}$ up to a gradient of $25\,\mathrm{kT/m}$. The effect of the mechanical motion onto the spin dynamics was observed, thus signifying the presence of spin-mechanics coupling. Given the noninvasive nature of the nanomagnet deposition process, we foresee the adoption of such structures in hybrid platforms with high-quality factor resonators, in the "magnet on oscillator" configuration.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos and Universal Trotterisation Behaviours in Digital Quantum Simulations</title>

Abstract: Digital quantum simulation (DQS) is one of the most promising paths for achieving first useful real-world applications for quantum processors. Yet even assuming rapid progress in device engineering and development of fault-tolerant quantum processors, algorithmic resource optimisation will long remain crucial to exploit their full power. Currently, Trotterisation provides state-of-the-art resource scaling. And recent theoretical studies of Trotterised Ising models suggest that even better performance than expected may be possible up to a distinct breakdown threshold in empirical performance. Here, we study multiple paradigmatic DQS models with experimentally realisable Trotterisations, and evidence the universality of a range of Trotterisation performance behaviours, including not only the threshold, but also new features in the pre-threshold regime that is most important for practical applications. In each model, we observe a distinct Trotterisation threshold shared across widely varying performance signatures; we further show that an onset of quantum chaotic dynamics causes the performance breakdown and is directly induced by digitisation errors. In the important pre-threshold regime, we are able to identify new distinct regimes displaying qualitatively different quasiperiodic performance behaviours, and show analytic behaviour for properly defined operational Trotter errors. Our results rely crucially on diverse new analytical tools, and provide a previously missing unified picture of Trotterisation behaviour across local observables, the global quantum state, and the full Trotterised unitary. This work provides new insights and tools for addressing important questions about the algorithm performance and underlying theoretical principles of sufficiently complex Trotterisation-based DQS, that will help in extracting maximum simulation power from future quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: Time-division multiplexing of cryogenic signals is a promising approach to reduce space requirements, shorten cooldown times, and increase the number of quantum devices measured per cooldown. We demonstrate time-division multiplexing of non-dissipative supercurrents using voltage-controlled hybrid superconducting demultiplexers. These chips integrate superconducting Josephson Field Effect Transistors including Al superconducting electrodes, proximitized semiconducting InAs channels, and hafnium oxide gate insulators. Each transistor fully suppresses the switching current and increases the resistance 20 times under a gate voltage of -4.5 V. A demultiplexer with one input and eight outputs showed a non-dissipative input range of +-2 uA, operating up to 100 MHz in signal frequency and 100 kHz in switching frequency at 50 mK. It achieved near-zero insertion loss in the superconducting state and an ON/OFF ratio of 17.5 dB. By optimizing the signal layout, the operation was extended up to 4 GHz using a demultiplexer with two outputs.</description>

      <title>Versatile Control of Nonlinear Topological States in Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10398v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and nonlinearity can both delocalize topological modes (TMs) from the interface. However, the NHSE requires precise parameter tuning, while nonlinearity in Hermitian systems results in partial delocalization with limited mode capacity. To overcome these limitations, we propose a non-Hermitian nonlinear topological interface model that integrates Hermitian and non-Hermitian lattices with nonreciprocal hopping and nonlinearity. This system enables the complete delocalization of TMs across the entire lattice without fine-tuning, while allowing precise control over the wavefunction profile and spatial distribution through the intrinsic configuration and intensity of the nonlinearity. Using the spectral localizer, we demonstrate the topological protection and robustness of these extended non-Hermitian TMs against disorder. Furthermore, we show that under external pumping, localized excitations evolve into predefined profiles and generate long-range patterns, an effect unattainable in Hermitian systems. These findings reveal how the interplay of nonlinearity and NHSE shapes topological states, paving the way for compact topological devices.</description>

Abstract: Graphene-based multilayer systems serve as versatile platforms for exploring the interplay between electron correlation and topology, thanks to distinctive low-energy bands marked by significant quantum metric and Berry curvature from graphene's Dirac bands. Here, we investigate Mott physics and local spin moments in Dirac bands hybridized with a flat band of localized orbitals in functionalized graphene. Via hybridization control, a topological transition is realized between two symmetry-distinct site-selective Mott states featuring local moments in different Wyckoff positions, with a geometrically enforced metallic state emerging in between. We find that this geometrically controlled local moment ``swapover'' and associated metal-insulator physics may be realized through proximity coupling of epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) with group IV intercalants, where the Mott state faces geometrical obstruction in the large-hybridization limit. Our work shows that chemically functionalized graphene provides a correlated electron platform, very similar to the topological heavy fermions in graphene moir\'e systems but at significantly enhanced characteristic energy scales.</description>

Abstract: In non-interacting systems, disorder can drive a trivial phase into a topological one. However little is known how to construct a fractional quantum Hall ground-state, a paradigmatic topologically ordered state, that exists both in crystalline and disordered lattices and is qualitatively different to known topological phases. Here, we propose a general method for building such a phase. This is done by coupling quantum wires placed aperiodically in real-space, where the spatial positioning allows us to tune the inter-wire couplings. We call the emergent phase the Fractonic Fractional Quantum Hall Effect as it displays a rich interplay of fractional quantum Hall physics with fractonic constraints, formed by coupling differently-fractionalised wires into a globally gapped phase. The ground state has an exponential degeneracy in system size, a signature of the emergence of fractons. It displays a rich phenomenology of excitations, which can either behave like anyons confined to move in one dimension (lineons), multiples of which can then hop between two wires (s-lineons) or be free to travel across the system (C-anyons), depending on the multiplicity. Both the ground state degeneracy and mutual statistics are directly determined by the real-space positions of the wires, which can be disordered. Our method provides an analytically solvable pathway to non-crystalline fractional quantum Hall effects and fractonic theories in two-dimensions, examples of which were lacking.</description>

      <title>Generic (fractional) quantum anomalous Hall crystals from interaction-driven band folding</title>

Abstract: Among the extensive studies of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, there recently appears a growing interest in the topological states with coexisting charge density wave (CDW) orders. Such states are referred to as Hall crystals. However, compared to those with integer Hall conductivities, the FQAH crystal (FQAHC) is still elusive even at the level of microscopic model. In this work, we numerically study a topological flat-band model on triangular lattice with spinless fermions. At fractional filling of the Chern band, the nearest-neighbor interaction leads to a commensurate and topologically trivial CDW state. Interestingly, the folded mini-band above the CDW gap is non-trivial, and we focus on the doping of it without any projection. A series of (F)QAHC states at (fractional) integer fillings of this mini-band are discovered and some FQAHC state might even exist in less "ideal" conditions. The ground-state degeneracies of such (F)QAHC states are enlarged by the CDW degeneracy and the Hall conductivities -- determined by the fillings of the mini-band -- are different from the fillings of the original Chern band. We also study the thermodynamics of an FQAHC state and find a compressible CDW phase at intermediate temperatures, which might serve as a precursor of lower temperature FQAHC phase. Moreover, we numerically demonstrate that such a generic scheme of doping CDW-folded topological mini-band could be applied to bosonic systems, broadening the platforms of Hall-crystal physics and motivating its exploration in quantum moire and cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Current Conservation in the Self-Consistent Josephson Junction</title>

Abstract: Conventional treatments of Josephson junctions (JJs) are typically not current-conserving. In the mean-field BCS theory, current conservation is only guaranteed if the superconducting order parameter is treated self-consistently. We show that this requirement has significant consequences for the current-phase relation (CPR) in certain regimes, where the current density in the superconducting leads is non-negligible. To this end, we introduce a numerical method for the self-consistent treatment of the BdG equations with current conservation for quasi-1D superconductor-normal (metal)-superconductor (SNS) JJs. Our model incorporates a phase gradient of the order parameter in the leads, which is set to match the Josephson current through the weak link. We compare our method to standard, non-current-conserving approaches by calculating the CPR for SNS JJs while varying lengths and gate voltages controlling the normal metal. We show that current conservation has significant implications for the Josephson harmonics and can weaken or even reverse forward skewness of the CPR.</description>

      <title>Missing link between the 2D Quantum Hall problem and 1D quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses a connection between two important classes of materials, namely quasicrystals and topological insulators as exemplified by the Quantum Hall problem. It has been remarked that the quasicrystal ``inherits" topological properties from the 2D Quantum Hall model. We show this explicitly by introducing the Fibonacci-Hall model as a link between a 1D quasicrystal and the magnetic problems. We show here how Chern numbers for bands in periodic approximants of quasicrystals can be computed, along with gap labels. The Chern numbers are thus seen as a consequence of a flux parameter $\phi^S$ induced by the geometry of winding in 2D space of the quasicrystal. We show the existence of lines of Lifshitz transitions in the phase space of the model. These are marked by change of Chern number and disappearance of edge states. The proposed extrapolation method can be generalized to higher dimensional 2D and 3D quasicrystals, where higher order Chern numbers could be computed, and related to experimentally measurable transport quantities.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <title>Double excitations in molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double excitations in organic molecules have garnered significant interest as a result of their importance in singlet fission and photophysics. These excitations play a crucial role in understanding the photoexcitation processes in polyenes. To describe photoexcited states with both single and double excitation character, we use a first-principles many-body theory that combines the GW / Bethe-Salpeter equation and the configuration interaction (CI) methods. Specifically, we develop and employ two CI-based methods: screened configuration interaction singles and doubles (scrCISD) and screened configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (scrCIS(D)), applied to an effective many-body Hamiltonian that incorporates screening. We apply these methods to Thiel's set of molecules, which exhibit excited states predominantly characterized by single excitations with a partial double excitation character. Our results indicate that the scrCISD method systematically underestimates the excitation energies compared to the best theoretical estimates, while the scrCIS(D) method shows good agreement with these estimates. Furthermore, we used the scrCISD method to calculate the binding energies of the dominantly doubly excited correlated triplet pair states, $\mathrm{TT^1}$, in pentacene dimers, finding that the $\mathrm{TT^1}$ binding energies agree well with empirical calculations.</description>

      <title>FDTRImageEnhancer: Combining Physics-Informed Deconvolution and Microstructure-Aware Deep Learning to Enhance Thermal Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.</description>

      <title>Dichography: Two-frame Ultrafast Imaging from a Single Diffraction Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: X-ray free-electron lasers can nowadays deliver pairs of ultrabright, ultrashort light pulses with controllable delays at different photon energies. When combined with diffraction experiments, the interaction of these pulses with a sample at different times can produce two snapshots of an evolving system, enabling spatial and temporal resolution of ultrafast dynamics in nanomatter at and beyond the terahertz time scale. However, light detectors are orders of magnitude slower. The diffraction signals from the two pulses overlap in the recorded data and cannot be separated using currently available analysis methods. Here, we address this challenge by introducing Dichography, a diffraction imaging technique that restores the two unique views of the sample from superimposed scattering signals. We apply Dichography to experimental diffraction patterns of isolated xenon-doped superfluid helium nanodroplets, imaged using time-delayed, two-color X-ray pulses at intensities near the detection limit. The reconstructed images provide evidence of the survival of the xenon structures up to 750 fs after the interaction with the first shot. The capabilities of Dichography are further explored by applying the method to data from a second experiment, in which we retrieve the images of two distinct silver nanoparticles intercepted by the same light pulse. Dichography enables a new class of experiments for spatially and temporally resolving ultrafast phenomena, making a significant step toward the original promise of X-ray free-electron lasers to capture ultrafast movies of nanomatter.</description>
