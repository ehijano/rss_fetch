      <title>Outer actions of finite groups on prime C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An action of a compact, in particular finite group on a C*-algebra is called properly outer if no automorphism of the group that is distinct from identity is implemented by a unitary element of the algebra of local multipliers of the C*-algebra and strictly outer if the commutant of the algebra in the algebra of local mutipliers of the cross product consists of scalars [11]. In [11, Theorem 11] I proved that for finite groups and prime C*-algebras (not necessarily separable), the two notions are equivalent. I also proved that for finite abelian groups this is equivalent to other relevant properties of the action [11 Theorem 14]. In this paper I add other properties to the list in [11, Theorem 14].</description>

      <title>On tensors of factorizable quantum channels with the completely depolarizing channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10446</link>
      <description>arXiv:1803.10446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain results for factorizability of quantum channels. Firstly, we prove that if a tensor $T\otimes S_k$ of a quantum channel $T$ on $M_n(\mathbb{C})$ with the completely depolarizing channel $S_k$ is written as a convex combination of automorphisms on the matrix algebra $M_n(\mathbb{C})\otimes M_k(\mathbb{C})$ with rational coefficients, then the quantum channel $T$ has an exact factorization through some matrix algebra with the normalized trace. Next, we prove that if a quantum channel has an exact factorization through a finite dimensional von Neumann algebra with a convex combination of normal faithful tracial states with rational coefficients, then it also has an exact factorization through some matrix algebra with the normalized trace.</description>

      <title>Module tensorizing maps on $ C^*$-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.08520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $ C^*$-algebras $ \mathfrak{A}, A$ and $ B $ where $ A $ and $ B $ are $ \mathfrak{A} $-bimodules with compatible actions, we consider amalgamated $ \mathfrak{A} $-module tensor product of $ A $ and $ B $ and study its relation with the C*-tensor product of $A$ and $B$ for the min and max norms. We introduce and study the notions of module tensorizing maps, module exactness, and module nuclear pairs of $ C^*$-algebras in this setting. We give concrete examples of $C^*$-algebras on inverse semigroups.</description>

      <title>Cartesian closed varieties II: links to algebra and self-similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04403v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series investigating cartesian closed varieties. In first of these, we showed that every non-degenerate finitary cartesian variety is a variety of sets equipped with an action by a Boolean algebra B and a monoid M which interact to form what we call a matched pair [B|M]. In this paper, we show that such pairs [B|M] are equivalent to Boolean restriction monoids and also to ample source-\'etale topological categories; these are generalisations of the Boolean inverse monoids and ample \'etale topological groupoids used to encode self-similar structures such as Cuntz and Cuntz--Krieger $C^\ast$-algebras, Leavitt path algebras and the $C^\ast$-algebras associated to self-similar group actions. We explain and illustrate these links, and begin the programme of understanding how topological and algebraic properties of such groupoids can be understood from the logical perspective of the associated varieties.</description>

      <title>Fock structure of complete Boolean algebras of type I factors and of unital factorizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11804v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The factorizable vectors of a complete Boolean algebra of type I factors, acting on a separable Hilbert space, are shown to be total, resolving a conjecture of Araki and Woods. En route, the spectral theory of noise-type Boolean algebras of Tsirelson is cast in the noncommutative language of "factorizations with unit" for which a muti-layered characterization of being "of Fock type" is provided.</description>

      <title>Irreducible Pythagorean representations of R. Thompson's groups and of the Cuntz algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Pythagorean dimension: a natural number (or infinity) for all representations of the Cuntz algebra and certain unitary representations of the Richard Thompson groups called Pythagorean. For each natural number d we completely classify (in a functorial manner) all such representations using finite dimensional linear algebra. Their irreducible classes form a real manifold of dimension $2d^2+1$ playing the role of a moduli space. Apart from a finite disjoint union of circles, each point of the manifold corresponds to an irreducible unitary representation of Thompson's group F (which extends to the other Thompson groups and the Cuntz algebra) that is not monomial. The remaining circles provide monomial representations which we previously fully described and classified. We translate in our language a large number of previous results in the literature. We explain how our techniques extend them.</description>

      <title>Crossing symmetry and the crossing map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study the crossing map, a closed linear map acting on operators on the tensor square of a given Hilbert space that is inspired by the crossing property of quantum field theory. This map turns out to be closely connected to Tomita--Takesaki modular theory. In particular, crossing symmetric operators, namely those operators that are mapped to their adjoints by the crossing map, define endomorphisms of standard subspaces. Conversely, such endomorphisms can be integrated to crossing symmetric operators. We also investigate the relation between crossing symmetry and natural compatibility conditions with respect to unitary representations of certain symmetry groups, and furthermore introduce a generalized crossing map defined by a real object in an abstract $C^*$-tensor category, not necessarily consisting of Hilbert spaces and linear maps. This latter crossing map turns out to be closely related to the (unshaded, finite-index) subfactor theoretical Fourier transform. Lastly, we provide families of solutions of the crossing symmetry equation, solving in addition the categorical Yang--Baxter equation, associated with an arbitrary Q-system.</description>
