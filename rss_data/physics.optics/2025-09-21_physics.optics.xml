      <title>OSI-flex: Optimization-Based Shearing Interferometry for Joint Phase and Shear Estimation Using a Flexible Open-Source Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shearing interferometry is a common-path quantitative phase imaging technique in which an object beam interferes with a laterally shifted replica of itself, providing high temporal stability, reduced sensitivity to environmental noise, compact design, and compatibility with partially coherent illumination that suppresses coherence-related artifacts. Its principal limitation, however, is that it yields only sheared phase-difference measurements rather than the absolute phase, thereby requiring additional reconstruction step. In this work, we introduce OSI-flex, a flexible, open-source computational framework for quantitative phase reconstruction from sheared phase-difference measurements. The method leverages modern machine learning tools, namely automatic differentiation and the advanced ADAM (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer. The method simultaneously estimates the phase and shear values, enabling it to adapt to experimental conditions where the shear cannot be precisely determined. Because defining shear value is inherently difficult in most systems, yet crucial for effective phase reconstruction, this joint optimization leads to robust and reliable phase retrieval. OSI-flex is highly versatile, supporting arbitrary numbers, magnitudes, and orientations of shear vectors. While optimal reconstruction is achieved with two orthogonal shears, the inclusion of regularization - specifically total variation minimization and sign constraint - enables OSI-flex to remain effective with nonorthogonal or even single-shear measurements. Moreover, OSI-flex accommodates a wide range of shear magnitudes, from subpixel (differential configuration) to several dozen pixels (semi-total shear configuration). Validation with simulations and experimental data confirms quantitative accuracy on calibrated phase objects and demonstrates robustness with 3D-printed cell phantom and follicular thyroid cells.</description>

      <title>Electrically controlled topological interface modes in graphene-based photonic superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the electrical control of topological interface modes at the interface between a graphene-based photonic superlattice and a uniform dielectric medium. Specifically, by integrating graphene sheets into the unit cell of metallodielectric superlattices, the presence or absence of topological interface modes can be dynamically controlled by tuning the permittivity of graphene via electrical gating. These topological modes emerge when the spatial average of the permittivity of the superlattices is negative and vanish as the chemical potential of graphene is adjusted to render the averaged permittivity positive. The dependence of the existence of topological interface modes on the sign of the spatial average of the permittivity is fundamentally related to the emergence of a Dirac point, which arises when the averaged permittivity of the superlattices reaches zero and is accompanied by the Zak phase transition, thus resulting in the appearance and disappearance of topological interface modes. Furthermore, we find that the propagation constant of topological interface modes decreases when increasing the chemical potential of graphene. The robustness of such topological interface modes is also demonstrated. Our work provides clear physical insights and offers a promising approach to the dynamic control of topological interface modes.</description>

      <title>Noise-tolerant correlated coincidence imaging based on super-correlated light at 1550 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon-level imaging at 1550 nm is a key driver for significant advancements in the next-generation laser detection technology. This cutting-edge approach plays a vital role in space ranging, target recognition, and three-dimensional remote sensing. However, it has faced severe challenges such as insufficient noise-tolerant performance. Here, we introduced noise-tolerant correlated coincidence imaging (CCI) based on super-correlated light. The light source, generated through nonlinear interaction between a pulsed laser and a photonic crystal fiber, exhibits a broader power-law photon number probability distribution and extremely strong photon correlation (with second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$ up to 18,166). Our noise-tolerant CCI can resist random environmental noise up to 100,000 times stronger than the echo signal photons. Super-correlated light offers an exceptionally strong noise tolerance for single-photon-level imaging in extreme environments with intense noise, paving the way for the future development of extremely sensitive light detection.</description>

      <title>Zak Phase Dislocations in Trimer Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave propagation in periodic media is governed by energy-momentum relation and geometric phases characterizing band topology, such as Zak phase in one-dimensional lattices. We demonstrate that in the off-diagonal trimer lattices Zak phase carries quantized screw-type dislocations winding around degeneracies in parameter space. If the lattice evolves in time periodically, as in adiabatic Thouless pump, corresponding closed trajectory in parameter space is characterized by a Chern number equal the negative total winding number of Zak phase dislocations enclosed by the trajectory. We discuss correspondence between bulk Chern numbers and the edge-states in a finite system evolving along various pumping cycles.</description>

      <title>Phase-matched Deep Ultraviolet Chiral Bound States in the Continuum Metalens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent light sources in deep ultra-violet (DUV) is essential for various applications such as biomedical imaging and biosensing. Nonlinear crystals (NLCs) generate DUV light, but limited by its bulky thickness, low transparency, and strict narrowband phase-matching conditions. Demonstrating compact, broadband, chiral, and focused DUV light integrated device is elusive. In this work, we present the first demonstration of chiral DUV third harmonic generation (THG) in a dielectric metasurface made from crystalline silicon (c-Si) of compact thickness 400 nm. Metasurface supports chiral bound states in the continuum resonance at fundamental wavelength 800 nm with experimental high Q-factor of 130 and modal phase-matched plasmonic resonance at the third harmonic wavelength for efficient THG. Generating DUV-THG power is up to 12 nW using peak power of 15 GW/cm2. Furthermore, we developed a nonlocal metalens operating in DUV for focusing the chiral DUV-THG using the same chiral BIC cavity and phase-gradient approach. Our platform creates efficient, ultracompact, and multifunctional integrated devices for future integrated DUV nanophotonics devices in MedTech, imaging, and advanced manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Electrically Reconfigurable Arbitrary Splitting-Ratio Optical Splitter Based on Low-Loss Sb2Se3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable beam splitters capable of being arbitrarily programmed for the power splitting ratios are vital for the adaptive optical networks and photonic computing. Conventional mechanisms such as thermo-optic, free-carrier, or mechanical tuning are usually volatile and require continuous power, limiting their suitability for low-frequency and low power-consumption programmable operations. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an electrically reconfigurable beam splitter based on the low-loss phase-change material Sb2Se3, enabling multi-level and arbitrary splitting-ratio (SR) control. By locally triggering phase transitions in the coupling region with integrated micro-electrodes, we exploit the high refractive-index contrast between different phases and negligible absorption in the near-infrared wavelength of Sb2Se3 to precisely tune the coupling strength with non-volatile retention. 8-level of power splitting states is achieved within a compact footprint of ~14.5-{\mu}m in the experiments, with insertion loss is ~1 dB across 1515-1550 nm and near-zero static power. Combining the advantages of compactness, broad bandwidth, low loss, non-volatility, and multi-level control experimentally, this device provides a universal building block for scalable, energy-efficient reconfigurable photonic circuits, with great prospects in optical computing and intelligent communication systems.</description>

      <title>The critical role of substrates in mitigating the power-efficiency trade-off in near-field thermophotovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field thermophotovoltaic systems can achieve ultra-high power densities, however, this often comes at the cost of reduced efficiency. We show that this power-efficiency trade-off can be mitigated through substrate engineering. We exploit gradient-based optimization and show that thin lossless metallic films with plasma frequencies resonantly matched to the plasmonic emitter can yield high power and spectral efficiency by spectrally enhancing and confining radiative heat transfer to a narrow spectral range just above the photovoltaic bandgap. Compared to noble metals and air-bridged structures, designs deriving from such optimization yield more than an order-of-magnitude increase in radiative power density while maintaining high efficiency. Our results highlight the critical role of the substrate and the potential of substrate optimization for overcoming fundamental limitations of near-field thermophotovoltaic systems.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Gain and Far-Field Control via a Plasmonic Time Crystal Slab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light matter interactions can be substantially altered in the presence of time varying media. We study the interaction between a harmonic electric dipole and a plasmonic time crystal slab. Temporal modulation of the plasma frequency enables near field gain, allowing the dipole to absorb rather than emit energy, suppressing nonradiative losses. At the parametric resonance condition, the slab radiates strongly to the far field, producing hundred per cent oscillations in the radiated power at distances up to a thousand times the epsilon near zero wavelength. These findings reveal a new mechanism for controlling light matter interaction in time varying plasmonic systems</description>

      <title>Digit classification using photonic reservoir computing based on a silicon microring resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate first experimental investigation on the performance of a single-node reservoir computer based on a silicon microring resonator (MRR) operating on the digit recognition task. The input layer of the reservoir is composed of a single laser, a Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulator, which encodes intensity of the light applied to the MRR input. The input signal is transformed into a virtual high-dimensional space through thermal nonlinearity in the MRR. The MRR response is recorded with readout network consisting of a photodetector and an oscilloscope. To study the principle of operation we measure nonlinear frequency response as well as dynamic response of the MRR. The resonator demonstrates a negative shift of the resonance frequency with an increase in input power due to the dominating thermo-optic effect. In addition to the frequency shift, the MRR transmission coefficient grows at the red side of the resonance. This effect underlies the nonlinear transient dynamics at the MRR output and provides an intrinsic fading memory that are the basis for the implementation of a reservoir computer. Here a silicon MRR serves as a single nonlinear physical node. We give proof of concept demonstrations of the developed reservoir architecture by solving the classification task. The performance characteristics is evaluated with the short-term memory and the parity-check tests. Obtained results pave the way to chip-scale optical reservoirs computing.</description>

      <title>Uniform 2D Target Generation via Inverse-designed Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an inverse design framework for metasurfaces that achieves highly uniform two-dimensional intensity profiles across an on-demand shape. The optimization objective is formulated to enhance overall projection efficiency via the adjoint method, while a regularization term penalizes local deviations in field amplitude to suppress intensity non-uniformity. The regularization weight is adaptively tuned based on the current non-uniformity, enabling stable and efficient optimization. Compared with the widely used mean squared error (MSE) objective, our method yields superior performance in both intensity fidelity and uniformity. We also extend our framework to handle realistic Gaussian beam illumination by biasing the library. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of our approach for generating high-quality, uniform field patterns.</description>

      <title>Photon Blockade Mediated by Two-Photon Absorption in an Optical Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon blockade (PB) is a quantum effect in strongly nonlinear systems where a single photon prevents the system from being excited to a higher level, generating anti-bunched light fields. It enables the generation of single-photon sources for quantum information processing. Conventional photon blockade (CPB) leverages strong nonlinear interactions to generate an anharmonic energy spectrum. Unconventional photon blockade (UPB) utilizes destructive quantum interference between excitation pathways. Recently, environmentally induced photon blockade (EPB) has emerged as a novel approach, exploiting two-photon absorption (TPA) to realize photon blockade. In this work, we combine UPB and EPB together, considering the TPA effect in the optical parametric amplifier (OPA), thereby achieving a more stable PB with stronger suppression of multi-photon states.</description>

      <title>Formation of Cavity-Polaritons via High-Order Van Hove Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider polaritons formed by hybridizing particle-hole excitations of an insulating phase with a cavity photon at sub-gap frequencies, where absorption is suppressed. The strength of the hybridization is driven by the Van Hove singularity in the JDOS at the band gap: the stronger the singularity, the more a photon is hybridized with the interband transitions. In order to increase the singularity and thus the polariton hybridization without absorption, we propose to engineer a non-parabolic momentum dispersion of the bands around the gap in order to implement a high-order Van Hove singularity (HOVHS) in the JDOS. Ultracold atoms in tunable optical lattices are an ideal platform to engineer two-dimensional gapped phases with non-trivial band dispersions at the gap. Moreover, the intrinsic non-interacting nature of polarized fermionic atoms prevents the emergence of sub-gap excitations, which are common in solid-state systems and could otherwise spoil the absence of absorption below the gap. Our findings identify band-engineering at the gap edge as a promising route for polariton control with applications in quantum-nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous real-time multispectral fluorescence and reflectance imaging for enhanced intraoperative guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intraoperative optical imaging is essential for surgical precision and patient safety, but current systems present anatomical and fluorescence information separately, causing delays and increasing cognitive load. A unified system for simultaneous visualization is critically needed to enhance guidance and efficiency. To develop and validate a multispectral imaging system that overcomes fragmented intraoperative imaging by simultaneously capturing and integrating white light reflectance and multiple fluorescence signals in real-time, enhancing surgical precision and safety. The system integrates two synchronized color cameras with optimized optical components, including custom filters and a beam splitter, tailored for clinically relevant fluorophores protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), fluorescein sodium, and indocyanine green (ICG). Advanced image processing techniques enhance visualization accuracy. Performance was evaluated using phantoms simulating clinical conditions. The system provided real time, simultaneous visualization of white light and multiple fluorescence signals without mode switching. Fluorescence emissions from PpIX, fluorescein sodium, and ICG were accurately separated using linear unmixing algorithms. Reflectance images showed high color fidelity, with Delta E values indicating imperceptible to barely perceptible differences compared to a conventional camera. Latency was minimal, ensuring immediate visual feedback suitable for intraoperative use. This multispectral imaging system addresses the limitations of fragmented intraoperative imaging by enabling continuous, real time, integrated visualization of anatomical and fluorescence information. It streamlines workflow, reduces cognitive load, and supports more precise interventions. By leveraging components similar to conventional surgical microscopes, it offers a practical, cost effective solution aligned with clinical needs.</description>

      <title>Effects of time dependence in the second order coherence of pulsed light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For light in a single temporal mode, the time dependence is associated entirely with the deterministic pulse shape rather than the quantum state. This means the second order coherence of light can no longer be understood as the temporal distribution of photons. We calculate the distribution of photon arrival time differences for pulsed light and find that it is inherently strongly bunched in terms of photocount arrival time differences. We further show how to account for the pulse shape when determining the second order coherence that characterizes quantum states.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal plasmons in one-dimensional carbon nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The directional control of light in miniaturized plasmonic waveguides holds appealing possibilities for emerging nanophotonic technologies, but is hindered by the intrinsic reciprocal optical response of conventional plasmonic materials. While the ability of graphene to sustain large electrical currents shows promise for nonreciprocal plasmonics, studies have been limited to extended samples characterized by linear electrical dispersion. Here, we theoretically explore quantum finite-size and nonlocal effects in the nonreciprocal response of mesoscale plasmonic waveguides comprised of drift-biased graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs). Using atomistic simulation methods based on tight-binding electronic states and self-consistent mean-field optical response, we reveal that a moderate electrical bias can significantly break reciprocity for propagation of guided plasmon modes in GNRs and CNTs exhibiting electronic band gaps. The excitation by a nearby point dipole emitter and subsequent propagation of guided plasmon modes can thus be actively controlled by the applied current, which can further be leveraged to mediate nonlocal interactions of multiple emitters. Our results establish graphene nanostructures as a promising atomically thin platform for nonreciprocal nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Exceptional-point-controlled mode interaction in three-dimensional microcavities represented by generalized Husimi functions</title>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian photonics has attracted significant interest and influences several key areas such as optical metamaterials, laser physics, and nonlinear optics. While non-Hermitian effects have been widely addressed in two-dimensional systems, we focus on realistic three-dimensional devices. To this end we generalize established phase space methods from mesoscopic optics and introduce Husimi functions for three-dimensional systems that deepen the insight and access to the mode morphology and their dynamics. We illustrate that four-dimensional Husimi functions can be represented using a specific projection in two dimensions and illustrate it for (conical) cylindrical cavities. The non-Hermitian character of the intrinsically open photonic systems is in particular revealed when examining the TE and TM polarization character of the resonance modes. Unlike the 2D case, polarization is not conserved in three-dimensional cavities, and we use generalized Husimi function to represent the interaction of polarization modes. We find their dynamics to be ruled by a network of exceptional points in the parameter space spanned by the refractive index and the cavity geometry tilt angle. This approach not only enhances our understanding of cavity modes but also aids in the design of more efficient photonic devices and systems.</description>

      <title>All-dielectric metasurface polarization scrambler for imaging applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization scramblers are essential for many imaging applications involving polarization sensitive instruments and partially polarized fluxes. In such cases, the light must be depolarized to allow properly calibrated measurements. Several types of depolarizers are already in use, but none is optimal due to the inevitable image degradation associated with the scrambling process. Here, we present a device based on an all-dielectric metasurface using anisotropic scatterers capable of generating multiple polarization states by varying their orientation angle. Our new scrambling solution allows a massive reduction in the integrated degree of polarization and thus the spatial depolarization of any incident linear polarization, while allowing easier integration into the instrument design and reducing the impact on its image quality.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Holographic Reconstruction via Amplitude-Only Diffusion Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes, imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups. Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures, highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent imaging applications beyond holography.</description>

      <title>Wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03527v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a consistent description of the quantum measurement process, whether the wave or particle-like aspect of a system is revealed depends on the details of the measurement chain, and cannot be interpreted as an objective fact about the system independent of the measurement. We show precisely how this comes to be in the measurement of gravitational radiation. Whether a wave or particle-like aspect is revealed is a property of the detector employed at the end of the quantum measurement chain, rather than of the meter, such as a gravitational-wave (GW) antenna or resonant bar, used to couple the radiation to the detector. A linear detector yields no signal for radiation in a Fock state and a signal proportional to the amplitude in a coherent state -- supporting a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton. Thus, conceptually simple modifications of contemporary GW antennae can reveal wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation.</description>

      <title>Hopf Bifurcation of Nonlinear Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, nonreciprocity-induced anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates, represents a hallmark of non-Hermitian topological systems with no analogs in Hermitian systems. Despite its significance across various open classical and quantum systems, the influence of nonlinearity has remained largely unclear. Here, we reveal the Hopf bifurcation of the nonlinear skin effect as a critical phenomenon unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that nonlinearity destabilizes skin states and instead gives rise to the emergence of delocalized states associated with limit cycles in phase space. We also uncover the algebraically localized critical skin effect precisely at the Hopf bifurcation point. We illustrate these behavior in a nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model in both continuum and lattice. Our work shows a significant role of nonlinearity in the skin effect and uncovers rich phenomena arising from the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity.</description>
