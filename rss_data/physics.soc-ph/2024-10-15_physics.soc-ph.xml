      <title>The impact of different degrees of leadership on collective navigation in follower-leader systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In both animal and cell populations, the presence of leaders often underlies the success of collective migration processes, which we characterise by a group maintaining a cohesive configuration that consistently moves toward a target. We extend a recent non-local hyperbolic model for follower-leader systems to investigate different degrees of leadership. Specifically, we consider three levels of leadership: indifferent leaders, who do not alter their movement according to followers; observant leaders, who attempt to remain connected with the followers, but do not allow followers to affect their desired alignment; and persuadable leaders, who integrate their attempt to reach some target with the alignment of all neighbours, both followers and leaders. A combination of analysis and numerical simulations is used to investigate under which conditions each degree of leadership allows successful collective movement to a destination. We find that the indifferent leaders' strategy can result in a cohesive and target-directed migration only for short times. Observant and persuadable leaders instead provide robust guidance, showing that the optimal leader behavior depends on the connection between the migrating individuals: if alignment is low, greater follower influence on leaders is beneficial for successful guidance; otherwise, it can be detrimental and may generate various unsuccessful swarming dynamics.</description>

      <title>Making public reputation out of private assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reputation is not just a simple opinion that an individual has about another but a social construct that emerges through communication. Despite the huge importance in coordinating human behavior, such a communicative aspect has remained relatively unexplored in the field of indirect reciprocity. In this work, we bridge the gap between private assessment and public reputation: We begin by clarifying what we mean by reputation and argue that the formation of reputation can be modeled by a bi-stochastic matrix, provided that both assessment and behavior are regarded as continuous variables. By choosing bi-stochastic matrices that represent averaging processes, we show that only four norms among the leading eight, which judge a good person's cooperation toward a bad one as good, will keep cooperation asymptotically or neutrally stable against assessment error in a homogeneous society where every member has adopted the same norm. However, when one of those four norms is used by the resident population, the opinion averaging process allows neutral invasion of mutant norms with small differences in the assessment rule. Our approach provides a theoretical framework for describing the formation of reputation in mathematical terms.</description>

      <title>Data informed epidemiological-behavioural modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmenting classical epidemiological models with information from the social sciences helps unveil the interplay between contagion dynamics and social responses. However, multidisciplinary integration of social analysis and epidemiological modelling is often challenging, due to scarcity of vast and reliable data sources and because ad hoc modelling assumptions may not reproduce empirically observed patters. Here, we test the hypothesis that awareness and information spreading straightforwardly translates into behavioural responses, analysing empirical data to generate insights about their dynamics and relationships. We employ such results to build a data-informed behavioural-epidemiological model that elucidates the impact of compliant behaviours and the role of centralised regulations in mitigating epidemics. We investigate model properties and its benefits in integrating theoretical modelling and data.</description>

      <title>CosForce: A Force-Based General Model for Simulating Pedestrian Anticipation and Reaction Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a force-based general model, named the CosForce model, has been developed. To the best of our knowledge, this may represent the most simplified version of the social force model. Considering the anisotropic influence of the environment on pedestrian interaction, the model solely focuses on interactions between pedestrians and their nearest neighbors, rather than all surrounding pedestrians. Specifically, cosine functions are employed to describe the interactions between nearest neighbors, allowing the model to simulate the anticipation and reaction mechanisms. Notably, due to the simplification of binary interactions between pedestrians, the simulation efficiency of this model is significantly improved compared to the classical social force model. By applying this model to simulations across various scenarios, a wide range of pedestrian dynamics can be simulated, including pedestrian fundamental diagrams and self-organized phenomena such as lane formation, stripe formation, and cross-channel formation, among others. The open-source codes of the model can be found at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NYVnRp0z8VPuskfezMr51gB-sraOf6Iq?usp=drive_link, and a short video summary is available at: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV17B1oYVEQm/.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Cooling Center Coverage Using Persistent Homology of a Filtered Witness Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In light of the increase in frequency of extreme heat events, there is a critical need to develop tools to identify geographic locations that are at risk of heat-related mortality. This paper aims to identify locations by assessing holes in cooling-center coverage using persistent homology, a method from topological data analysis. Methods involving persistent homology have shown promising results in identifying holes in coverage of specific resources. We adapt these methods using a witness complex construction to study the coverage of cooling centers. One standard technique for studying the risk of heat-related mortality for a geographic area is a heat vulnerability index (HVIs) based on demographic information. We test our topological approach and an HVI on four locations (central Boston, MA; central Austin, TX; Portland, OR; and Miami, FL) and use death times of connected components and cycles to identify most at risk regions. PH and HVI identify different locations as vulnerable, thus showing measures of coverage need to extend beyond a simple statistic. Using persistent homology along side the HVI score identifies a complementary set of regions at risk, thus the combination of the two provide a more holistic understanding of coverage.</description>

      <title>Level of Scientific Readiness with Ternary Data Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In addition to the technology readiness level (TRL the scientific readiness level (SRL) has been introduced as a more authentic and adequate tool for determining the status quo of scientific and scientific-technical projects of fundamental or applied nature. The SRL includes 10 levels of scientific readiness, namely, the FRL (Fundamental Readiness Level), the ARL (Applied Readiness Level), and the IRL (Innovation Readiness Level). For quantitative and visual assessment of the level of scientific readiness, a system of positional ternary (three-valued, trinary) codes with integer trits (ternary digit) is introduced. The ternary code interprets the degree of project elaboration according to the fundamental, applied, and innovation vectors/trits FRL/ARL/IRL. Examples of scientific project assessments are provided. The main characteristics of the new scale and assessment of the level of readiness and the application areas of the scientific readiness level are noted. Tasks for further development of the system of scientific readiness levels are formulated.</description>

      <title>Balance Correlations, Agentic Zeros, and Networks: The Structure of 192 Years of War and Peace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social network extensions of Heider's balance theory have not always been consistent. Structural balance theory primarily focuses on graph partitioning, thereby assuming, homogeneity in balance-driven behavior of nodes. We present a general model and formal notation that permit testing such behavioral assumptions. Specifically, we formulate statements as a comparison of two conditional probabilities of a tie, $Ego\stackrel{q}{\text{-}}Alter$, first conditional on 2-paths $Ego\, \stackrel{r}{\text{-}}\,X\,\stackrel{s}{\text{-}}\,Alter$, and second conditional on all others, $\neg (Ego\,\stackrel{r}{\text{-}}\,X\,\stackrel{s}{\text{-}}\,Alter)$. The key here is that $q$, $r$ and $s$ represent indices of relations in a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive relations (their sum produces a complete graph). This relaxes the assumption of a signed graph dichotomy. Here we identify neutral as distinct from negative and positive ties. Descriptive statistics measuring the difference in conditional probabilities, or the prevalence for any stipulated balance configuration, are given by the point bi-serial correlations of relation $q$ with the count of $2$-paths (through relations $r$ and $s$). Two major advantages are: direct comparison, even if network sizes and densities differ, and evaluation of specific (un)balance behaviors. We apply this approach on a data set with friendly vs hostile relations between countries from 1816 to 2007. We find strong evidence for one of the four classic Heiderian balance theory predictions, and virtually no evidence in support of the unbalanced predictions. However, we do find stable and surprising evidence that the neutral ties are important in balancing the relations among nations. Results further suggest that prevalence of balance driven behavior varies over time, and that other triadic motivated behaviors prevail among countries in certain eras.</description>

      <title>Network mutual information measures for graph similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A wide range of tasks in network analysis, such as clustering network populations or identifying anomalies in temporal graph streams, require a measure of the similarity between two graphs. To provide a meaningful data summary for downstream scientific analyses, the graph similarity measures used for these tasks must be principled, interpretable, and capable of distinguishing meaningful overlapping network structure from statistical noise at different scales of interest. Here we derive a family of graph mutual information measures that satisfy these criteria and are constructed using only fundamental information theoretic principles. Our measures capture the information shared among networks according to different encodings of their structural information, with our mesoscale mutual information measure allowing for network comparison under any specified network coarse-graining. We test our measures in a range of applications on real and synthetic network data, finding that they effectively highlight intuitive aspects of network similarity across scales in a variety of systems.</description>

      <title>Who should fight the spread of fake news?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates who should bear the responsibility of combating the spread of misinformation in social networks. Should that be the online platforms or their users? Should that be done by debunking the "fake news" already in circulation or by investing in preemptive efforts to prevent their diffusion altogether? We seek to answer such questions in a stylized opinion dynamics framework, where agents in a network aggregate the information they receive from peers and/or from influential external sources, with the aim of learning a ground truth among a set of competing hypotheses. In most cases, we find centralized sources to be more effective at combating misinformation than distributed ones, suggesting that online platforms should play an active role in the fight against fake news. In line with literature on the "backfire effect", we find that debunking in certain circumstances can be a counterproductive strategy, whereas some targeted strategies (akin to "deplatforming") and/or preemptive campaigns turn out to be quite effective. Despite its simplicity, our model provides useful guidelines that could inform the ongoing debate on online disinformation and the best ways to limit its damaging effects.</description>
