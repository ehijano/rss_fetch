      <title>Probabilistically Checkable Reconfiguration Proofs and Inapproximability of Reconfiguration Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the inapproximability of reconfiguration problems, we present a new PCP-type characterization of PSPACE, which we call a probabilistically checkable reconfiguration proof (PCRP): Any PSPACE computation can be encoded into an exponentially long sequence of polynomially long proofs such that every adjacent pair of the proofs differs in at most one bit, and every proof can be probabilistically checked by reading a constant number of bits.
  Using the new characterization, we prove PSPACE-completeness of approximate versions of many reconfiguration problems, such as the Maxmin $3$-SAT Reconfiguration problem. This resolves the open problem posed by Ito, Demaine, Harvey, Papadimitriou, Sideri, Uehara, and Uno (ISAAC 2008; Theor. Comput. Sci. 2011) as well as the Reconfiguration Inapproximability Hypothesis by Ohsaka (STACS 2023) affirmatively. We also present PSPACE-completeness of approximating the Maxmin Clique Reconfiguration problem to within a factor of $n^\epsilon$ for some constant $\epsilon &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>The hard-core model in graph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An independent set may not contain both a vertex and one of its neighbours. This basic fact makes the uniform distribution over independent sets rather special. We consider the hard-core model, an essential generalization of the uniform distribution over independent sets. We show how its local analysis yields remarkable insights into the global structure of independent sets in the host graph, in connection with, for instance, Ramsey numbers, graph colourings, and sphere packings.</description>

      <title>Optimal List Recoloring of Subcubic Graphs and Complete Multipiartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a list-assignement $L$, the reconfiguration graph $C_L(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the graph whose vertices are proper $L$-colorings of $G$ and whose edges link two colorings that differ on only one vertex. If $|L(v)| \ge d(v) + 2$ for every vertex of $G$, it is known that $C_L(G)$ is connected. In this case, Cambie et al. investigated the diameter of $C_L(G)$. They conjectured that $diam(C_L(G)) \le n(G) + \mu(G)$ with $\mu(G)$ the size of a maximum matching of $G$ and proved several results towards this conjecture. We answer to two of their open problems by proving the conjecture for two classes of graphs, namely subcubic graphs and complete mulitpartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Young domination on Hamming rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the neighborhood growth dynamics on a Hamming rectangle $[0,m-1]\times[0,n-1]\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_+^2$, the decision to add a point is made by counting the currently occupied points on the horizontal and the vertical line through it, and checking whether the pair of counts lies outside a fixed Young diagram. After the initially occupied set is chosen, the synchronous rule is iterated. The Young domination number with a fixed latency $L$ is the smallest cardinality of an initial set that covers the rectangle by $L$ steps, for $L=0,1,\ldots$ We compute this number for some special cases, including $k$-domination for any $k$ when $m=n$, and devise approximation algorithms in the general case. These results have implications in extremal graph theory, via an equivalence between the case $L = 1$ and bipartite Tur\'an numbers for families of double stars. Our approach is based on a variety of techniques including duality, algebraic formulations, explicit constructions, and dynamic programming.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of Segment Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segment Routing is a recent network technology that helps optimizing network throughput by providing finer control over the routing paths. Instead of routing directly from a source to a target, packets are routed via intermediate waypoints. Between consecutive waypoints, the packets are routed according to traditional shortest path routing protocols. Bottlenecks in the network can be avoided by such rerouting, preventing overloading parts of the network. The associated NP-hard computational problem is Segment Routing: Given a network on $n$ vertices, $d$ traffic demands (vertex pairs), and a (small) number $k$, the task is to find for each demand pair at most $k$ waypoints such that with shortest path routing along these waypoints, all demands are fulfilled without exceeding the capacities of the network. We investigate if special structures of real-world communication networks could be exploited algorithmically. Our results comprise NP-hardness on graphs with constant treewidth even if only one waypoint per demand is allowed. We further exclude (under standard complexity assumptions) algorithms with running time $f(d) n^{g(k)}$ for any functions $f$ and $g$. We complement these lower bounds with polynomial-time solvable special cases.</description>

      <title>Sidorenko-Type Inequalities for Pairs of Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two non-empty graphs $H$ and $T$, write $H\succcurlyeq T$ to mean that $t(H,G)^{|E(T)|}\geq t(T,G)^{|E(H)|}$ for every graph $G$, where $t(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the homomorphism density function. We obtain various necessary and sufficient conditions for two trees $H$ and $T$ to satisfy $H\succcurlyeq T$ and determine all such pairs on at most 8 vertices. This extends results of Leontovich and Sidorenko from the 1980s and 90s. Our approach applies an information-theoretic technique to reduce the problem of showing that $H\succcurlyeq T$ for two forests $H$ and $T$ to solving a linear program of Kopparty and Rossman. We also characterize trees $H$ which satisfy $H\succcurlyeq S_k$ or $H\succcurlyeq P_4$, where $S_k$ is the $k$-vertex star and $P_4$ is the $4$-vertex path and resolve a problem of Csikv\'ari and Lin.</description>

      <title>CMSO-transducing tree-like graph decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that given a graph G we can CMSO-transduce its modular decomposition, its split decomposition and its bi-join decomposition. This improves results by Courcelle [Logical Methods in Computer Science, 2006] who gave such transductions using order-invariant MSO, a strictly more expressive logic than CMSO. Our methods more generally yield C2MSO-transductions of the canonical decomposition of weakly-partitive set systems and weakly-bipartitive systems of bipartitions.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for polynomial-time detection of induced minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $H$-Induced Minor Containment problem ($H$-IMC) consists in deciding if a fixed graph $H$ is an induced minor of a graph $G$ given as input, that is, whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by deleting vertices and contracting edges. Several graphs $H$ are known for which $H$-IMC is NP-complete, even when $H$ is a tree. In this paper, we investigate which conditions on $H$ and $G$ are sufficient so that the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable. Our results identify three infinite classes of graphs such that, if $H$ belongs to one of these classes, then $H$-IMC can be solved in polynomial time. Moreover, we show that if the input graph $G$ excludes long induced paths, then $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed graph $H$. As a byproduct of our results, this implies that $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for all graphs $H$ with at most $5$ vertices, except for three open cases.</description>
