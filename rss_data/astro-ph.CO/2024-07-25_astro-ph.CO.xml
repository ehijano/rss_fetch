      <title>LiteBIRD Science Goals and Forecasts. Mapping the Hot Gas in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the capabilities of the LiteBIRD mission to map the hot gas distribution in the Universe through the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect. Our analysis relies on comprehensive simulations incorporating various sources of Galactic and extragalactic foreground emission, while accounting for specific instrumental characteristics of LiteBIRD, such as detector sensitivities, frequency-dependent beam convolution, inhomogeneous sky scanning, and $1/f$ noise. We implement a tailored component-separation pipeline to map the thermal SZ Compton $y$-parameter over 98% of the sky. Despite lower angular resolution for galaxy cluster science, LiteBIRD provides full-sky coverage and, compared to the Planck satellite, enhanced sensitivity, as well as more frequency bands to enable the construction of an all-sky $y$-map, with reduced foreground contamination at large and intermediate angular scales. By combining LiteBIRD and Planck channels in the component-separation pipeline, we obtain an optimal $y$-map that leverages the advantages of both experiments, with the higher angular resolution of the Planck channels enabling the recovery of compact clusters beyond the LiteBIRD beam limitations, and the numerous sensitive LiteBIRD channels further mitigating foregrounds. The added value of LiteBIRD is highlighted through the examination of maps, power spectra, and one-point statistics of the various sky components. After component separation, the $1/f$ noise from LiteBIRD is effectively mitigated below the thermal SZ signal at all multipoles. Cosmological constraints on $S_8=\sigma_8\left(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3\right)^{0.5}$ obtained from the LiteBIRD-Planck combined $y$-map power spectrum exhibits a 15% reduction in uncertainty compared to constraints from Planck alone. This improvement can be attributed to the increased portion of uncontaminated sky available in the LiteBIRD-Planck combined $y$-map.</description>

      <title>Ionospheric effect on the synthetic Epoch of Reionization observations with the SKA1-Low</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The redshifted $21$\,cm signal of neutral hydrogen can be used as a direct probe of the intergalactic medium during Cosmic Dawn\,(CD) and Epoch of Reionization\,(EoR). However, detecting this inherently weak signal has numerous challenges. The major ones include accurate foreground removal from low-frequency radio observations and systematics arising from instrumental effects. The Earth's ionosphere poses a major obstacle at these low radio frequencies. Thus, a systematic study of ionospheric effects on these sensitive low-frequency observations is critical, given that the construction of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA1-Low) is in full progress. We use the end-to-end pipeline, called {\sc 21cme2e}, to study the effect of time-varying ionospheric corruption on the $21$\,cm power spectrum recovery. We use two models: a) a catalogue-based model focused on source position shift due to the refractive effect of the ionosphere and b) a realistic ionospheric condition generated using Kolmogorov's turbulence model. We assess the effect of the imperfections thus generated on the extraction of \HI\ $21$\,cm signal power spectrum. Our study shows that beyond ``median ionospheric offset" ($\theta_{\text{MIO}} \lesssim 0.1''$), the $21$\,cm signal from the EoR is unaffected by residual ionospheric effects. Our study emphasizes the need for the development of efficient ionospheric calibration algorithms for the upcoming SKA1-Low observations to extract the \HI\ $21$\,cm power spectra from the CD/EoR.</description>

      <title>Unexplained correlation between the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and the local matter density distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have indicated a Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature decrement in the direction of local galaxies within the 2MASS Redshift Survey. We investigate this detection by analyzing its frequency dependence and sensitivity to component separation methods, suggesting that Galactic foregrounds are unlikely to be the cause. Contrary to previous studies, we find that the decrement is independent of galaxy type, indicating a possible correlation between the CMB and the overall matter density field. To test this hypothesis, we employ three analytical approaches: cross-correlation analysis, template fitting, and Bayes Factor calculation. Our cross-correlation analysis shows a significant correlation (p &lt; 0.7%) between the CMB and the 2MASS Redshift Survey projected matter density at distances below 50 Mpc/h. Template fitting and Bayes Factor analyses support this finding, albeit with lower significance levels (1% - 5%). Importantly, we do not detect this signal beyond 50 Mpc/h, which constrains potential physical interpretations. We discuss that the physical origin of this correlation could potentially be linked to the dark matter distribution in the halos of galaxies. Further investigation is required to confirm and understand this intriguing connection between the CMB and local matter distribution.</description>

      <title>Dissipative Quintessential Cosmic Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a dissipative quintessential cosmic inflation. For this purpose, we add a multiplicative dissipative term in the standard quintessence field Lagrangian. We consider the specific form of dissipation as the time integral including the Hubble parameter and an arbitrary function that describes the dissipative properties of the quintessential scalar field. Inflation parameters and observables are calculated under slow-roll approximations and a detailed calculation of the cosmological perturbations is performed in this setup. We consider different forms of potentials and calculate the scalar spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio for a constant as well as variable dissipation function. To check the reliability of this model, a numerical analysis on the model parameters space is done in confrontation with recent observational data. By comparing the results with observational joint datasets at 68% and 95% confidence levels, we obtain some constraints on the model parameters space, specially the dissipation factor with e-folds numbers N = 55 and N = 60. As some specific results, we show that the power-law potential with a constant dissipation factor and N = 60 is mildly consistent with observational data in some restricted domains of the model parameter space with very small and negative dissipation factor and a negligible tensor-toscalar ratio. But this case with N = 55 is consistent with observation considerably. For power-law potential and variable dissipation factor as $Q = {\alpha}\phi^n$, the consistency with observation is also considerable with a reliable tensor-to-scalar ratio. The quadratic and quartic potentials with variable dissipation function as $Q = {\alpha}\phi^n$ are consistent with Planck2018 TT, TE, EE+lowE+lensing data at the 68% and 95% levels of confidence for some intervals of the parameter n.</description>

      <title>Toward a test of Gaussianity of a gravitational wave background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree of Gaussianity of a field offers insights into its cosmological nature, and its statistical properties serve as indicators of its Gaussianity. In this work, we examine the signatures of Gaussianity in a gravitational wave background (GWB) by analyzing the cumulants of the one- and two-point functions of the relevant observable, using pulsar timing array (PTA) simulations as a proof-of-principle. This appeals to the ongoing debate about the source of the spatially-correlated common-spectrum process observed in PTAs, which is likely associated with a nanohertz stochastic GWB. We investigate the distribution of the sample statistics of the one-point function in the presence of a Gaussian GWB. Our results indicate that, within PTAs, one-point statistics are impractical for constraining the Gaussianity of the nanohertz GWB due to dominant pulsar noises. However, our analysis of two-point statistics shows promise, suggesting that it may be possible to constrain the Gaussianity of the nanohertz GWB using PTA data. We also emphasize that the Gaussian signatures identified in the one- and two-point functions in this work are expected to be applicable to any gravitational wave background.</description>

      <title>The model of the local Universe in the framework of the second-order perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we constructed the specific solution to the second-order cosmological perturbation theory, around any Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background filled with dust matter and a positive cosmological constant. In this paper, we use the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) sample of galaxies from the Extragalactic Distance Database to constrain this metric tensor. We obtain an approximation to the local matter distribution and geometry. We numerically solve for null geodesics for randomly distributed mock sources and compare this model with the Lemaitre-Hubble constant inferred from the observations under the assumption of perfect isotropy and homogeneity. We conclude on effects of realistic inhomogeneities on the luminosity distance in the context of the Hubble tension and discuss limitations of our approach.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the equation of state of viscous fluid in $f(R, T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a cosmological model based on viscous $f(R,T)$ gravity as a potential alternative to dark energy. This model incorporates bulk viscosity and is analyzed using an effective equation of state. We consider the simplest specific model, $f(R,T)=R+\lambda T$, where $\lambda$ is a constant. The exact solution of our viscous $f(R,T)$ cosmological model is derived, and then we use the combined datasets consisting of 31 $H(z)$ data points and 1701 Pantheon+ SNe data points to determine the best-fit values of the model parameters. We find good agreement with observations, particularly at higher redshifts. Our model's behavior, including energy density, pressure with viscosity, effective equation of state, and deceleration parameter, is analyzed. It indicates a shift from decelerated to accelerated phases of the universe's expansion, suggesting that bulk viscosity in the cosmic fluid could effectively generate the negative pressure necessary for cosmic expansion. Finally, we explore statefinder diagnostics to differentiate between various dark energy models, revealing that our model resides in the quintessence region.</description>

      <title>Neutrino cosmology after DESI: tightest mass upper limits, preference for the normal ordering, and tension with terrestrial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurements have led to tight upper limits on the neutrino mass sum, potentially in tension with oscillation constraints requiring $\sum m_{\nu} \gtrsim 0.06\,{\text{eV}}$. Under the physically motivated assumption of positive $\sum m_{\nu}$, we study the extent to which these limits are tightened by adding other available cosmological probes, and robustly quantify the preference for the normal mass ordering over the inverted one, as well as the tension between cosmological and terrestrial data. Combining DESI data with Cosmic Microwave Background measurements and several late-time background probes, the tightest $2\sigma$ limit we find without including a local $H_0$ prior is $\sum m_{\nu}&lt;0.05\,{\text{eV}}$. This leads to a strong preference for the normal ordering, with Bayes factor relative to the inverted one of $46.5$. Depending on the dataset combination and tension metric adopted, we quantify the tension between cosmological and terrestrial observations as ranging between $2.5\sigma$ and $5\sigma$. These results are strenghtened when allowing for a time-varying dark energy component with equation of state lying in the physically motivated non-phantom regime, $w(z) \geq -1$, highlighting an interesting synergy between the nature of dark energy and laboratory probes of the mass ordering. If these tensions persist and cannot be attributed to systematics, either or both standard neutrino (particle) physics or the underlying cosmological model will have to be questioned.</description>

      <title>A bound on thermal y-distortion of the cosmic neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the possibility that the cosmic neutrino background might have a nonthermal spectrum, and investigate its effect on cosmological parameters relative to standard $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology. As a specific model, we consider a thermal $y$-distortion, which alters the distribution function of the neutrino background by depleting the population of low-energy neutrinos and enhancing the high-energy tail. We constrain the thermal $y$-parameter of the cosmic neutrino background using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and place a $95\%$-confidence upper bound of $y \leq 0.043$. The $y$-parameter increases the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom, reducing the sound horizon radius and increasing the best-fit value for the Hubble constant $H_0$. We obtain an upper bound on the Hubble constant of $H_0 = 71.12\ \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ at $95\%$ confidence, substantially reducing the tension between CMB/BAO constraints and direct measurement of the expansion rate from Type-Ia supernovae. Including a spectral distortion also allows for a higher value of the spectral index of scalar fluctuations, with a best-fit of $n_{\mathrm{S}} = 0.9720 \pm 0.0063$, and a $95\%$-confidence upper bound of $n_{\mathrm{S}} \leq 0.9842$.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Observing High-redshift Radio-loud Quasars in the SKA Era: Paving the Way for 21-cm Forest Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest is a sensitive probe for the early heating process and small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization (EoR), to be realized with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Its detection relies on the availability of radio-bright background sources, among which the radio-loud quasars are very promising, but their abundance during the EoR is still poorly constrained due to limited observations. Here, we use a physics-driven model to forecast future radio-loud quasar observations. We fit the parameters of the model using observational data of high-redshift quasars. Assuming Eddington accretion, the model yields an average lifetime of $t_{\rm q} \sim 10^{5.3}$yr for quasars at $z\sim6$, consistent with recent results obtained from quasar proximity zone pre-study. We show that if the radio-loud fraction of quasars evolves with redshift, it will significantly reduce the abundance of observable radio-loud quasars in the SKA era, making 21-cm forest studies challenging. With a constant radio-loud fraction, our model suggests that a one-year sky survey conducted with SKA-LOW has the capability to detect approximately 20 radio-loud quasars at $z\sim 9$, with sufficient sensitivity to resolve individual 21-cm forest lines.</description>

      <title>Predicting spatial curvature $\Omega_K$ in globally $CPT$-symmetric universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boyle and Turok's $CPT$-symmetric universe model posits that the universe was symmetric at the Big Bang, addressing numerous problems in both cosmology and the Standard Model of particle physics. We extend this model by considering the symmetric conditions at the end of the Universe, following Lasenby et al. by imposing constraints on the allowed perturbation modes. These constrained modes conflict with the integer wave vectors required by the global spatial geometry in a closed universe. To resolve this conflict, only specific values of curvature are permissible, and in particular the curvature density is constrained to be $\Omega_K \in \{-0.014, -0.009, -0.003, \ldots\}$, consistent with Planck observations.</description>

      <title>One-point Statistics in various cosmic environments in the presence of massive neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the structures (halos and galaxies) within the cosmic environments (void, sheet, filament, and node) where they reside is an ongoing attempt in cosmological studies. The link between the properties of structures and the cosmic environments may help to unravel the nature of the dark sector of the Universe. In this paper, we study the cosmic web environments from the spatial pattern perspective in the context of $ \Lambda $CDM and $ \nu \Lambda $CDM as an example of an extension to the vanilla model. To do this, we use the T-web classification method and classify the cosmic environments for the catalogues from the gevolution N-body simulations for $ \Lambda $CDM and $ \nu \Lambda $CDM cosmology. Then, we compute the first nearest neighbour cumulative distribution function, spherical contact cumulative distribution function, and $ J$-function for every cosmic environment. In the context of the standard model, the results indicate that these functions can differentiate the various cosmic environments. In association with distinguishing between extensions of the standard model of cosmologies, these functions within the cosmic environment seem beneficial as a complementary probe.</description>

      <title>Review of Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor Theories in Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Degenerate Higher Order Scalar Tensor (DHOST) theories are the most general scalar-tensor theories whose Lagrangian depends on the metric tensor and a single scalar field and which propagate only one scalar degree of freedom, without being plagued by Ostrogradsky instabilities. This is achieved through certain degeneracies of the functions forming their Lagrangian. They generalise the Horndeski and beyond-Horndeski theories. Originally build to describe the late-time acceleration of the expansion of the universe, generalising the cosmological constant, they can be used to build models for early universe, to describe inflation or alternatives to standard inflation. In the late universe, they modify the standard Vainstein screening mechanism from Horndeski theories which can have observable consequences and are suited to build black hole models, featuring non-stealth Kerr black hole solutions. In this work we review their effects on cosmology, looking at their basic properties, their parameterisations and classifications, and then focusing on solutions in the early and the late universe.</description>

      <title>Probing the early universe with future GW observatories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental characteristics of slow roll inflation is its generation of tensor perturbations, which manifest as stochastic gravitational waves (GWs). Slow roll inflation results in a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum that maintains its scale invariance as it transitions into the radiation-dominated era. However, introducing an intermediate reheating phase can modify the spectral tilt, depending on the equation of state governing that particular epoch. These GWs, especially on smaller scales, are anticipated to be observable by forthcoming GW detectors. In this study, we initially delineate the parameter space encompassing the inflationary energy scale, reheating temperature, and equation of state in a model-independent manner, focusing on the spectra detectable by GW detectors such as LISA, ET, DECIGO, and BBO. We also examine the implications for the $\alpha$-attractor model of inflation and explore the observational constraints on $n_s-r$ prediction in the light of GW detection. Then, we point out the probable ranges for various non-gravitational and gravitational coupling between the inflaton and Standard Model particles considering the perturbative reheating. If one assumes PBHs were formed during the early reheating era, such detection of GW signal also sheds light on the probing PBH parameters. Note that for the case of PBH domination, we also consider the contribution of the induced GW due to the density function in PBH distribution, which helps to decode the phase of early PBH domination. Finally, to test the production of other cosmological relics through future GW missions, we consider dark matter produced via gravitational interaction in the early universe.</description>

      <title>From 100 kpc to 10 Gpc: Dark Matter self-interactions before and after DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Dark Matter self-interactions mediated by ultralight scalars. We show that effectively massless mediators lead to an enhancement of the matter power spectrum, while heavier mediators lead to a suppression, together with a feature around their Jeans scale. We derive the strongest present constraints by combining Planck and BOSS data. The recent DESI measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations exhibit a mild preference for long-range self-interactions, as strong as 4 per mille of the gravitational coupling. Forthcoming data from DESI itself and Euclid will confirm or disprove such a hint.</description>

      <title>Crescendo Beyond the Horizon: More Gravitational Waves from Domain Walls Bounded by Inflated Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) signals offer a unique window into the dynamics of the early universe. GWs may be generated by the topological defects produced in the early universe, which contain information on the symmetry of UV physics. We consider the case in which a two-step phase transition produces a network of domain walls bounded by cosmic strings. Specifically, we focus on the case in which there is a hierarchy in the symmetry-breaking scales, and a period of inflation pushes the cosmic string generated in the first phase transition outside the horizon before the second phase transition. We show that the GW signal from the evolution and collapse of this string-wall network has a unique spectrum, and the resulting signal strength can be sizeable. In particular, depending on the model parameters, the resulting signal can show up in a broad range of frequencies and can be discovered by a multitude of future probes, including the pulsar timing arrays and space- and ground-based GW observatories. As an example that naturally gives rise to this scenario, we present a model with the first phase transition followed by a brief period of thermal inflation driven by the field responsible for the second stage of symmetry breaking. The model can be embedded into a supersymmetric setup, which provides a natural realization of this scenario. In this case, the successful detection of the peak of the GW spectrum probes the soft supersymmetry breaking scale and the wall tension.</description>

      <title>Observational Signatures of Highly Magnified Gravitational Waves from Compact Binary Coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing has empowered telescopes to discover astronomical objects that are otherwise out of reach without being highly magnified by foreground structures. While we expect gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binary coalescences to also experience lensing, the phenomenology of highly magnified GWs has not been fully exploited. In this letter, we fill this gap and explore the observational signatures of these highly magnified GWs. We find that these signatures are robust against modeling details and can be used as smoking-gun evidence to confirm the detection of lensing of GWs without any electromagnetic observation. Additionally, diffraction becomes important in some cases, which limits the maximum possible magnification and gives waveform signatures of lensing that can only be observed by GW detectors. Even with current-generation observatories, we are already sensitive to these highly magnified GWs and can use them to probe the high-redshift Universe beyond the usual horizon.</description>

      <title>Baryogenesis and first-order QCD transition with gravitational waves from a large lepton asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large primordial lepton asymmetry can lead to successful baryogenesis by preventing the restoration of electroweak symmetry at high temperatures, thereby suppressing the sphaleron rate. This asymmetry can also lead to a first-order cosmic QCD transition, accompanied by detectable gravitational wave (GW) signals. By employing next-to-leading order dimensional reduction we determine that the necessary lepton asymmetry is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than previously estimated. Incorporating an updated QCD equation of state that harmonizes lattice and functional QCD outcomes, we pinpoint the range of lepton flavor asymmetries capable of inducing a first-order cosmic QCD transition. To maintain consistency with observational constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, achieving the correct baryon asymmetry requires entropy dilution by approximately a factor of ten. However, the first-order QCD transition itself can occur independently of entropy dilution. We propose that the sphaleron freeze-in mechanism can be investigated through forthcoming GW experiments such as $\mu$Ares.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Evidence for Lensing-Induced Alignments of High-Redshift Galaxies in JWST-CEERS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The majority of low-mass ($\log_{10} M_*/M_{\odot}=9-10$) galaxies at high redshift ($z&gt;1$) appear elongated in projection. We use JWST-CEERS observations to explore the role of gravitational lensing in this puzzle. The typical galaxy-galaxy lensing shear $\gamma\sim1\%$ is too low to explain the predominance of elongated early galaxies with ellipticity $e\approx0.6$. However, non-parametric quantile regression with Bayesian Additive Regression Trees reveals hints of an excess of tangentially-aligned source-lens pairs with $\gamma&gt;10\%$. On larger scales, we also find evidence for weak lensing shear. We rule out the null hypothesis of randomly oriented galaxies at $\gtrsim99\%$ significance in multiple NIRCam chips, modules and pointings. The number of such regions is small and attributable to chance, but coherent alignment patterns suggest otherwise. On the chip scale, the average complex ellipticity $\langle e\rangle\sim10\%$ is non-negligible and beyond the level of our PSF uncertainties. The shear variance $\langle\overline{\gamma}^2\rangle\sim10^{-3}$ is an order of magnitude above the conventional weak lensing regime but is more sensitive to PSF systematics, intrinsic alignments, cosmic variance and other biases. Taking it as an upper limit, the maximum implied ``cosmic shear'' is only a few percent and cannot explain the elongated shapes of early galaxies. The alignments themselves may arise from lensing by a protocluster or filament at $z\sim0.75$ where we find an overabundance of massive lens galaxies. We recommend a weak lensing search for overdensities in ``blank'' deep fields with JWST and the Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>A SPectroscopic survey of biased halos In the Reionization Era (ASPIRE): Broad-line AGN at $z=4-5$ revealed by JWST/NIRCam WFSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-luminosity AGNs with low-mass black holes (BHs) in the early universe are fundamental to understanding the BH growth and their co-evolution with the host galaxies. Utilizing JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS), we perform a systematic search for broad-line ${\rm H\alpha}$ emitters (BHAEs) at $z\approx 4-5$ in 25 fields of the ASPIRE (A SPectroscopic survey of biased halos In the Reionization Era) project, covering a total area of 275 arcmin$^2$. We identify 16 BHAEs with FWHM of the broad components spanning from $\sim$ 1000 km s$^{-1}$ to 3000 km s$^{-1}$. Assuming the broad linewidths arise due to Doppler broadening around BHs, the implied BH masses range from $10^7$ to $10^{8}~M_\odot$, with broad ${\rm H\alpha}$-converted bolometric luminosity of $10^{44.5}-10^{45.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and Eddington ratios of $0.07-0.47$. The spatially extended structure of the F200W stacked image may trace the stellar light from the host galaxies. The ${\rm H\alpha}$ luminosity function indicates an increasing AGN fraction towards the higher ${\rm H\alpha}$ luminosities. We find possible evidence for clustering of BHAEs: two sources are at the same redshift with a projected separation of 519 kpc; one BHAE appears as a composite system residing in an overdense region with three close companion ${\rm H\alpha}$ emitters. Three BHAEs exhibit blueshifted absorption troughs indicative of the presence of high-column-density gas. We find the broad-line and photometrically selected BHAE samples exhibit different distributions in the optical continuum slopes, which can be attributed to their different selection methods. The ASPIRE broad-line ${\rm H\alpha}$ sample provides a good database for future studies of faint AGN populations at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Tackling the Problem of Distributional Shifts: Correcting Misspecified, High-Dimensional Data-Driven Priors for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference for inverse problems hinges critically on the choice of priors. In the absence of specific prior information, population-level distributions can serve as effective priors for parameters of interest. With the advent of machine learning, the use of data-driven population-level distributions (encoded, e.g., in a trained deep neural network) as priors is emerging as an appealing alternative to simple parametric priors in a variety of inverse problems. However, in many astrophysical applications, it is often difficult or even impossible to acquire independent and identically distributed samples from the underlying data-generating process of interest to train these models. In these cases, corrupted data or a surrogate, e.g. a simulator, is often used to produce training samples, meaning that there is a risk of obtaining misspecified priors. This, in turn, can bias the inferred posteriors in ways that are difficult to quantify, which limits the potential applicability of these models in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose addressing this issue by iteratively updating the population-level distributions by retraining the model with posterior samples from different sets of observations and showcase the potential of this method on the problem of background image reconstruction in strong gravitational lensing when score-based models are used as data-driven priors. We show that starting from a misspecified prior distribution, the updated distribution becomes progressively closer to the underlying population-level distribution, and the resulting posterior samples exhibit reduced bias after several updates.</description>

      <title>Differential equations and recursive solutions for cosmological amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently considerable efforts have been devoted to computing cosmological correlators and the corresponding wavefunction coefficients, as well as understanding their analytical structures. In this note, we revisit the computation of these ``cosmological amplitudes" associated with any tree or loop graph for conformal scalars with time-dependent interactions in the power-law FRW universe, directly in terms of iterated time integrals. We start by decomposing any such cosmological amplitude (for loop graph, the ``integrand" prior to loop integrations) as a linear combination of {\it basic time integrals}, one for each {\it directed graph}. We derive remarkably simple first-order differential equations involving such time integrals with edges ``contracted" one at a time, which can be solved recursively and the solution takes the form of Euler-Mellin integrals/generalized hypergeometric functions. By combining such equations, we then derive a complete system of differential equations for all time integrals needed for a given graph. Our method works for any graph: for a tree graph with $n$ nodes, this system can be transformed into the {\it canonical differential equations} of size $4^{n{-}1}$ quivalent to the graphic rules derived recently%so-called ``kinematic flow", and we also derive the system of differential equations for loop integrands {\it e.g.} of all-loop two-site graphs and one-loop $n$-gon graphs. Finally, we show how the differential equations truncate for the de Sitter (dS) case (in a way similar to differential equations for Feynman integrals truncate for integer dimensions), which immediately yields the complete symbol for the dS amplitude with interesting structures {\it e.g.} for $n$-site chains and $n$-gon cases.</description>

Abstract: The DArk Matter In CCDs at Modane (DAMIC-M) experiment is designed to search for light dark matter (m$_{\chi}$&lt;10\,GeV/c$^2$) at the Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane (LSM) in France. DAMIC-M will use skipper charge-coupled devices (CCDs) as a kg-scale active detector target. Its single-electron resolution will enable eV-scale energy thresholds and thus world-leading sensitivity to a range of hidden sector dark matter candidates. A DAMIC-M prototype, the Low Background Chamber (LBC), has been taking data at LSM since 2022. The LBC provides a low-background environment, which has been used to characterize skipper CCDs, study dark current, and measure radiopurity of materials planned for DAMIC-M. It also allows testing of various subsystems like readout electronics, data acquisition software, and slow control. This paper describes the technical design and performance of the LBC.</description>

Abstract: Chemical evolution models predict a gradual build-up of $^{13}$C in the universe, based on empirical nuclear reaction rates and assumptions on the properties of stellar populations. However, old metal-poor stars within the Galaxy contain more $^{13}$C than is predicted, suggesting that further refinements to the models are necessary. Gas at high redshift provides important supplementary information at metallicities $-2\lesssim$ [Fe/H] $\lesssim-1$, for which there are only a few measurements in the Galaxy. We obtained new, high-quality, VLT/ESPRESSO observations of the QSO B1331+170 and used them to measure $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C in the damped Lyman-$\alpha$ system (DLA) at $z_{abs}=1.776$, with [Fe/H]=-1.27. AI-VPFIT, an Artificial Intelligence tool based on genetic algorithms and guided by a spectroscopic information criterion, was used to explore different possible kinematic structures of the carbon gas. Three hundred independent AI-VPFIT models of the absorption system were produced using pre-set $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values, ranging from 4 to 500. Our results show that $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C$=28.5^{+51.5}_{-10.4}$, suggesting a possibility of $^{13}$C production at low metallicity.</description>

      <title>Relativistic gravity in the inhomogeneous Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmology is built on a relativistic understanding of gravity, where the geometry of the Universe is dynamically determined by matter and energy. In the cosmological concordance model, gravity is described by General Relativity, and it is assumed that on large scales the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic. These fundamental principles should be tested. In this thesis, we explore the implications of breaking them.
  In order to understand possible modifications to gravity on cosmological scales, we extend the formalism of parameterised post-Newtonian cosmology, an approach for building cosmological tests of gravity that are consistent with tests on astrophysical scales. We demonstrate how this approach can be used to construct theory-independent equations for the cosmic expansion and its first-order perturbations. Then, we apply the framework to observations of the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background. We use these to place novel cosmological constraints on the evolution of the post-Newtonian parameters.
  We investigate the consequences of inhomogeneity and isotropy by developing a new approach to studying anisotropy in the Universe, wherein we consider how an anisotropic cosmology might emerge on large scales as a result of averaging over inhomogeneous structures, and demonstrate how the emergent model is affected by backreaction. We perform a detailed study of light propagation in a wide class of inhomogeneous and anisotropic spacetimes, exploring the conditions under which the Hubble diagram can be accurately predicted by an anisotropic model constructed using explicit averaging, even in the presence of large inhomogeneities. We show that observables calculated in a suitable averaged description closely reproduce the true Hubble diagram on large scales, as long as the spacetime possesses a well-defined homogeneity scale.</description>

      <title>Testing non-local gravity through Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies kinematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of the Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies in recent years has posed a severe challenge to the galaxy formation models as well as the Extended Theories of Gravity. The existence of both dark matter lacking and dark matter dominated systems within the same family of astrophysical objects indeed requires the gravity models to be versatile enough to describe very different gravitational regimes. In this work, we study a non-local extension of the theory of General Relativity that has drawn increasing attention in recent years due to its capability to account for the late time cosmic acceleration without introducing any dark energy fluid. We leverage the kinematic data of three Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies: NGC 1052-DF2 and NGC 1052-DF4, which are dark matter lacking, and Dragonfly 44, which exhibits a highly dominant dark matter component. Our analysis shows that the non-local corrections to the Newtonian potential do not affect the kinematic predictions, hence no spoiling effects emerge when the Non-local Gravity model serves as a dark energy model. We additionally provide the minimum value that the characteristic non-local radii can reach at these mass scales.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Discovery Potential for Decaying Dark Matter and Faint X-ray Sources with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical emission lines arising from particle decays can offer unique insights into the nature of dark matter (DM). Using dedicated simulations with background and foreground modeling, we comprehensively demonstrate that the recently launched XRISM space telescope with powerful X-ray spectroscopy capabilities is particularly well-suited to probe decaying DM, such as sterile neutrinos and axion-like particles, in the mass range of few to tens of keV. We analyze and map XRISM's DM discovery potential parameter space by considering Milky Way Galactic DM halo, including establishing an optimal line-of-sight search, as well as dwarf galaxies where we identify Segue 1 as a remarkably promising target. We demonstrate that with only 100 ks exposure XRISM/Resolve instrument is capable of probing the underexplored DM parameter window around few keV and testing DM couplings with sensitivity that exceeds by two orders existing Segue 1 limits. Further, we demonstrate that XRISM/Xtend instrument sensitivity enables discovery of the nature of faint astrophysical X-ray sources, especially in Segue 1, which could shed light on star-formation history. We discuss implications for decaying DM searches with improved detector energy resolution in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermal pressure on ultrarelativistic bubbles from a semiclassical formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a planar bubble wall that is traveling at an ultrarelativistic speed through a thermal plasma. This situation may arise during a first order electroweak phase transition in the early universe. As particles cross the wall, it is assumed that their mass grows from $m_a$ to $m_b$, and they are decelerated causing them to emit massless radiation. We are interested in the momentum transfer to the wall, the thermal pressure felt by the wall, and the resultant terminal velocity of the wall. We employ the semiclassical current radiation (SCR) formalism to perform these calculations. An incident charged particle is treated as a point-like classical electromagnetic current, and the spectrum of quantum electromagnetic radiation (photons) is derived by calculating appropriate matrix elements. To understand how the spectrum depends on the thickness of the wall, we explore simplified models for the current corresponding to an abrupt and a gradual deceleration. For the model of abrupt deceleration, we find that the SCR formalism can reproduce the $P_\mathrm{therm} \propto \gamma_w^0$ scaling found in earlier work by assuming that the emission is soft, but if the emission is not soft the SCR formalism can be used to obtain $P_\mathrm{therm} \propto \gamma_w^2$ instead. For the model of gradual deceleration, we find that the wall thickness $L_w$ enters to cutoff the otherwise log-flat radiation spectrum above a momentum of $\sim \gamma_w^2 / L_w$, and we discuss the connections with classical electromagnetic bremsstrahlung.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Background Dynamics with a Cosmological-model-independent Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble constant $H_0$ tension has emerged as the most serious crisis in modern cosmology, potentially indicating that the $\Lambda$CDM model may not describe our universe accurately. In this paper, we establish a new, cosmological-model-independent method to study the cosmic background dynamics. Using the latest Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample and the model-independent SN Ia sample (P+1690), we derive values for the luminosity distance, the Hubble parameter, and the deceleration parameter at five different redshift points ranging from 0.12 to 0.52. Our analysis shows that results obtained from the Pantheon+ sample align with the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model within 2$\sigma$ confidence level (CL), while those obtained from the P+1690 sample exhibit deviations of about $2\sim3\sigma$ CL. Furthermore, we explore the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy and find that while the EoS values from the Pantheon+ sample remain consistent with $-1$ within 2$\sigma$ CL, the P+1690 sample does not conform to this standard. These findings remain unchanged after the inclusion of the Hubble parameter measurements in our analysis. Our results indicate that the $\Lambda$CDM model remains compatible with the Pantheon+ SN Ia and the Hubble parameter measurements at 2$\sigma$ CL.</description>

      <title>Can acoustic and axion-like early dark energy still resolve the Hubble tension?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we reassess the ability of the acoustic early dark energy (ADE) and axion-like early dark energy (EDE) models to resolve the Hubble tension in light of the new Pantheon+ and S$H_0$ES data on the one hand, and the BOSS LRG and eBOSS QSO data, analyzed under the effective field theory of large-scale structures (ETFofLSS) on the other hand. We find that the Pantheon+ data, which favor a larger $\Omega_m$ value than the Pantheon data, have a strong constraining power on the ADE model, while the EFTofLSS analysis of the BOSS and eBOSS data only slightly increases the constraints. We establish that the ADE model is now strongly disfavored as a solution to the Hubble tension, with a remaining tension of $3.6\sigma$ (according to the $Q_{\rm DMAP}$ metric). In addition, we find that the axion-like EDE model performs better when confronted to the same datasets, with a residual tension of $2.5\sigma$. This work shows that the Pantheon+ data can have a decisive impact on models which aim to resolve the Hubble tension.</description>

Abstract: The large-scale structure of the Universe is distributed in a cosmic web. Studying the distribution and clustering of dark matter particles and halos may open up a new horizon for studying the physics of the dark Universe. In this work, we investigate the nearest neighbour statistics and spherical contact function in cosmological models with massive neutrinos. For this task, we use the relativistic N-body code, gevolution and study particle snapshots at three different redshifts. In each snapshot, we find the halos and evaluate the letter functions for them. We show that a generic behaviour can be found in the nearest neighbour, $G(r)$, and spherical contact functions, $F(r)$, which makes these statistics promising tools to constrain the total neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey: Cosmology constraints from cluster abundances in the western Galactic hemisphere</title>

Abstract: The cluster mass function traces the growth of linear density perturbations and provides valuable insights into the growth of structures, the nature of dark matter, and the cosmological parameters governing the Universe. The primary science goal of eROSITA, on board the {\it Spectrum Roentgen Gamma (SRG)} mission, launched in 2019, is to constrain cosmology through the evolution of cluster mass function. In this paper, we present the cosmological constraints obtained from 5259 clusters of galaxies detected over an area of 12791~deg$^2$ in the Western Galactic Hemisphere of the eROSITA's first All-Sky Survey (eRASS1). The common footprint region between the eROSITA Survey and DES, KiDS, and HSC surveys is used for calibration of the scaling between X-ray count rate and their total mass through measurements of their weak gravitational lensing signal. eRASS1 cluster abundances constrain the $\Lambda$CDM parameters, which are the energy density of the total matter to $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}=0.29^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$, and the normalization of the density fluctuations to $\sigma_8=0.88\pm0.02$ and their combination yields $S_8=\sigma_8 (\Omega_\mathrm{m} / 0.3)^{0.5}=0.86\pm0.01$, consistent and at a similar precision with the state-of-the-art CMB measurements. eRASS1 cosmological experiment places a most stringent upper limit on the summed masses of left-handed light neutrinos to $\sum m_\nu&lt; 0.22\mathrm{~eV}$ (95\% confidence interval). Combining eRASS1 cluster abundance measurements with CMB and ground-based neutrino oscillation experiments, we measure the summed neutrino masses to be $\sum m_\nu=0.08_{-0.02}^{+0.03}\mathrm{~eV}$ or $\sum m_\nu=0.12_{-0.01}^{+0.03}\mathrm{~eV}$ depending on the mass hierarchy scenario for neutrino eigenstates. eRASS1 cluster abundances significantly improve the constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter to $w=-1.12\pm0.12$.

      <title>Alleviating the Hubble-constant tension and the growth tension via a transition of absolute magnitude favored by the Pantheon+ sample</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a cosmological-model-independent method to extract the apparent magnitude and its derivative at different redshifts from the Pantheon+ type Ia supernova sample, and find that the obtained values deviate clearly from the prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model at the lowest redshift. This deviation can be explained as a result of a transition of the absolute magnitude $M$ in the low redshift region. The observations seem to favor this transition since the minimum values of $\chi^2$ for two ansatzes of a varying $M$ are less than that of a constant $M$. The Hubble constant tension is alleviated from larger than $5\sigma$ to be about $1$ to $2\sigma$ for a varying $M$, and the growth tension can be resolved after attributing the variation of $M$ to a modification of the effective Newton's constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit a class of simple single-field inflation models and demonstrate that they can readily produce a negligible tensor/scalar ratio $r$. Motivated by recent work suggesting the need to introduce higher order operators to stabilise unregulated potentials, as well as by work indicating that such terms can have significant effects on observable predictions, we explicitly construct corrected versions of the quadratic hilltop potential that are motivated by an effective field theory expansion. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and optimization techniques to sample viable models and minimize $r$. We find that such potentials can readily lower $r$ values below projected CMB-S4 sensitivity, while still remaining within observable constraints on $n_s$. Furthermore, we find that the minimum $r$ reached for each order of the expansion considered is well-described by a power law $r_{min}(q) \propto q^{-B}$ before asymptoting to a value of $r_{min} \sim 10^{-11}$, where $q$ is the order to which the expansion of $V(\phi)$ is carried out.</description>

      <title>The infall region as a complementary probe to cluster abundance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster abundance measurements provide a classic test of cosmology. They are most sensitive to the evolved amplitude of fluctuations, usually expressed as $S_8 = \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$. Thus, abundance constraints exhibit a strong degeneracy between $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$, as do other similar low-redshift tests such as cosmic shear. The mass distribution in the infall region around galaxy clusters, where material is being accreted from the surrounding field, also exhibits a cosmological dependence, but in this case it is nearly orthogonal to the $S_8$ direction in the $\Omega_m$--$\sigma_8$ plane, making it highly complementary to halo abundance or cosmic shear studies. We explore how weak lensing measurements of the infall region might be used to complement abundance studies, considering three different tests. The splashback radius is a prominent feature of the infall region; we show that detection of this feature in lensing data from the Euclid survey could independently constrain $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ to $\pm 0.05$. Another feature, the depletion radius where the bias reaches a minimum, also shows cosmological dependence, though it is challenging to observe in practice. The strongest constraints come from direct measurements of the shear profile in the infall region at $2$--$4\,r_{200{\rm c}}$. Combining the latter with abundance constraints such as those reported from SRG$/$eROSITA should reduce the area of the error contours by an estimated factor of $1.2$ using a sample of clusters observed by the UNIONS survey, or a factor of $3$ using clusters observed by the Euclid Wide survey over a broader range of redshift.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Sneutrino Hybrid Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15082v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition in a supersymmetric scenario where sneutrino is the inflaton in a hybrid inflationary framework. We obtain a spectral index ($n_s \simeq 0.966$), and a tensor-to-scalar ratio ($r\simeq 0.0056-10^{-11}$), consistent with the current Planck data satisfying PBH as dark matter (DM) and detectable Gravitational Wave (GW) signal. Our findings show that the mass of PBH and the peak in the GW spectrum is correlated with the right-handed (s)neutrino mass. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire DM candidate of the universe (with mass $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$) or a fraction of it. This can be tested in future observatories, for example, with amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ and peak frequency $f\sim 0.1$ Hz in LISA and $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2 \sim 10^{-11}$ and peak frequency of $\sim 10$ Hz in ET via second-order GW signals. We study two models of sneutrino inflation: Model$-1$ involves canonical sneutrino kinetic term which predicts the sub-Planckian mass parameter $M$, while the coupling between a gauge singlet and the waterfall field, $\beta$, needs to be quite large whereas, for the model$-2$ involving $\alpha-$attractor canonical sneutrino kinetic term, $\beta$ can take a natural value. Estimating explicitly, we show that both models have mild fine-tuning. We also derive an analytical expression for the power spectrum in terms of the microphysics parameters of the model like (s)neutrino mass, etc. that fits well with the numerical results. The typical reheat temperature for both the models is around $10^{7}-10^{8}$~GeV suitable for non-thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the characteristic polarization formation and evolution of vector dark matter (VDM) in the outer halo of galaxies. By employing numerical simulations, we analyze the behavior of VDM under different initial conditions -- homogeneous, isotropic, and partially polarized. The simulations solve the Schr\"odinger-Poisson equations, examining the spin density distribution and its evolution during gravitational collapse and halo formation. Our results reveal that VDM forms halos and central Proca stars from homogeneous and isotropic conditions, with the polarization density fluctuation amplitude mirroring VDM matter density. In scenarios with no initial polarization, spin density remains stable in the halo core but fluctuates in outer regions. Partially polarized initial conditions lead to a conservation of total polarization, with increased core polarization resulting in opposite polarization in the periphery. We examine the novel consequences of the partially polarized state for direct detection of dark photons, i.e., VDM kinetically mixed with ordinary photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hypothesis that sexaquarks, hypothetical stable six-quark states, could be a significant component of the dark matter. We expand on previous studies of sexaquark cosmology, accounting for the possibility that some relevant interaction cross sections might be strongly suppressed below expectations based on dimensional analysis. We update direct-detection constraints on stable sexaquarks comprising a subdominant fraction of the dark matter, as well as limits on the annihilation of an antisexaquark component from Super-Kamiokande. We argue that the scenario where sexaquarks comprise a $O(1)$ fraction of the dark matter would require either a suppression of $O(10^{-19})$ in sexaquark interactions with baryons, combined with a very high yield of net sexaquark number from the quark-hadron transition, or else a very strong suppression of the cross section for antisexaquark annihilation on nucleons (24+ orders of magnitude below the QCD scale). Independently, we find that a sexaquark component comprising more than $O(10^{-3})$ of the dark matter can be excluded from direct-detection bounds, unless its scattering cross section is severely suppressed compared to the expected scale of strong and even electromagnetic interactions.</description>

Abstract: We show that observations of primordial gravitational waves of inflationary origin can shed light into the scale of flavor violation in a flavon model which also explains the mass hierarchy of fermions. The energy density stored in oscillations of the flavon field around the minimum of its potential redshifts as matter and is expected to dominate over radiation in the early universe. At the same time, the evolution of primordial gravitational waves acts as bookkeeping to understand the expansion history of the universe. Importantly, the gravitational wave spectrum is different if there is an early flavon dominated era compared to radiation domination expected from a standard cosmological model and this spectrum gets damped by the entropy released in flavon decays, determined by the mass of the flavon field $m_S$ and new scale of flavor violation $\Lambda_{\rm FV}$. We derive analytical expressions of the frequency above which the spectrum is damped, as-well-as the amount of damping, in terms of $m_S$ and $\Lambda_{\rm FV}$. We show that the damping of the gravitational wave spectrum would be detectable at BBO, DECIGO, U-DECIGO, $\mu-$ARES, LISA, CE and ET detectors for $\Lambda_{\rm FV}=10^{5-10}$ GeV and $m_S=\mathcal{O({\rm TeV})}$. Furthermore, the flavon decays can source the baryon asymmetry of the universe. We identify the $m_S-\Lambda_{\rm FV}$ parameter space where the observed baryon asymmetry $\eta \sim 10^{-10}$ is produced and can be tested by gravitational wave detectors like LISA and ET. We also discuss our results in the context of the recently measured stochastic gravitational background signals by NANOGrav.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum from inflation/bouncing Universe in VCDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the non-linear interactions within the VCDM model, a type II minimally modified gravity model with the same number of degrees of freedom as in General Relativity but not connected to the latter by field redefinitions. During an inflationary phase in the early universe, if the VCDM potential does not modify the slow-roll behavior of the inflaton field, we recover, up to the leading order, the standard results for the bispectrum in slow-roll inflation. On the other hand, if the VCDM potential becomes dominant, the interactions can strongly deviate and even violate the Maldacena's consistency relation for the local non-Gaussianities. Furthermore, we apply the formalism to the recently introduced bouncing model in VCDM, and show that the bispectrum still respects current observational constraints. Future measurements on non-Gaussianities of the local type should provide the test ground for the model's validity.</description>
