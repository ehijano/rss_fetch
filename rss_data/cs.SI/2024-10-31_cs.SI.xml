      <title>Mobile Phone Application Data for Activity Plan Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Activity-based models in transport are crucial for providing a comprehensive and realistic understanding of individuals' activity-travel patterns. Traditionally, travel surveys have been used to develop these models, but they are often costly and have small sample sizes. Mobile phone application data, one example of emerging data sources, offers an alternative with wider population coverage over extended periods for developing activity-based models. However, the challenges of using these data include sampling biases in the population coverage and individual-level data sparsity due to intermittent and irregular data collection. To synthesise activity-travel plans, we propose a novel model that combines mobile phone application data with travel survey data, addressing their limitations. Our generative model simulates multiple average weekday activity schedules for over 263,000 individuals living in Sweden, approximately 2.6% of Sweden's population. We also introduce a temporal-score approach to improve home and work location identification approaches. We assess the model's performance against an existing large-scale agent-based model of Sweden (SySMo) and a dummy model using only mobile application data. The generated activity-travel plans are comparable to the SySMo model's output and significantly surpass the dummy model's results, suggesting the proposed model's capability to generate reasonable activity-travel schedules. The proposed model is adaptable to other regions with similar travel surveys and emerging data sources, like call detail records, advancing the use of these data for activity-based models in a cost-effective, easily updated manner.</description>

      <title>Do Stubborn Users Always Cause More Polarization and Disagreement? A Mathematical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the stubbornness of social network users influences opinion polarization and disagreement. Our work is in the context of the popular Friedkin-Johnson opinion formation model, where users update their opinion as a function of the opinion of their connections and their own innate opinion. Stubbornness then is formulated in terms of the stress a user puts on its innate opinion.
  We examine two scenarios: one where all nodes have uniform stubbornness levels (homogeneous) and another where stubbornness varies among nodes (inhomogeneous). In the homogeneous scenario, we prove that as the network's stubbornness factor increases, the polarization and disagreement index grows. In the more general inhomogeneous scenario, our findings surprisingly demonstrate that increasing the stubbornness of some users (particularly, neutral/unbiased users) can reduce the polarization and disagreement. We characterize specific conditions under which this phenomenon occurs. Finally, we conduct an extensive set of experiments on real-world network data to corroborate and complement our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Exposing Cross-Platform Coordinated Inauthentic Activity in the Run-Up to the 2024 U.S. Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinated information operations remain a persistent challenge on social media, despite platform efforts to curb them. While previous research has primarily focused on identifying these operations within individual platforms, this study shows that coordination frequently transcends platform boundaries. Leveraging newly collected data of online conversations related to the 2024 U.S. Election across $\mathbb{X}$ (formerly, Twitter), Facebook, and Telegram, we construct similarity networks to detect coordinated communities exhibiting suspicious sharing behaviors within and across platforms. Proposing an advanced coordination detection model, we reveal evidence of potential foreign interference, with Russian-affiliated media being systematically promoted across Telegram and $\mathbb{X}$. Our analysis also uncovers substantial intra- and cross-platform coordinated inauthentic activity, driving the spread of highly partisan, low-credibility, and conspiratorial content. These findings highlight the urgent need for regulatory measures that extend beyond individual platforms to effectively address the growing challenge of cross-platform coordinated influence campaigns.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Based Model for Vehicle-Centric Data Sharing Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of technologies has prompted a paradigm shift in the automotive industry, with an increasing focus on connected services and autonomous driving capabilities. This transformation allows vehicles to collect and share vast amounts of vehicle-specific and personal data. While these technological advancements offer enhanced user experiences, they also raise privacy concerns. To understand the ecosystem of data collection and sharing in modern vehicles, we adopted the ontology 101 methodology to incorporate information extracted from different sources, including analysis of privacy policies using GPT-4, a small-scale systematic literature review, and an existing ontology, to develop a high-level conceptual graph-based model, aiming to get insights into how modern vehicles handle data exchange among different parties. This serves as a foundational model with the flexibility and scalability to further expand for modelling and analysing data sharing practices across diverse contexts. Two realistic examples were developed to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of discovering insights into privacy regarding vehicle-related data sharing. We also recommend several future research directions, such as exploring advanced ontology languages for reasoning tasks, supporting topological analysis for discovering data privacy risks/concerns, and developing useful tools for comparative analysis, to strengthen the understanding of the vehicle-centric data sharing ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Far-right party influence on polarization dynamics in electoral campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Political polarization has attracted increasing attention in recent years, driven by the rise of social media and the global emergence of far-right populist movements. This study investigates the dynamics of structural polarization during electoral campaigns in multi-party systems, with a particular focus on the presence of far-right actors and their influence on polarization patterns and hate speech. Using retweet networks as a measure of structural polarization, we analyze two case studies in Spain: the 2022 Andalusia regional elections, where the far-right party Vox was a significant contender, and the 2019 Barcelona city council elections, where the party had no representation. Our results reveal that the presence of a far-right party intensifies polarization, leading to the formation of two distinct ideological blocks aligned along left-right ideological axes, as observed in Andalusia. In contrast, the Catalan independence movement in Barcelona diluted the alignment of voters, resulting in a more complex, multi-axis polarization landscape. We also explore the relationship between polarization and hate speech, finding an anti-correlation between them in both cases. Our findings underscore the significant role of far-right movements in driving political polarization and the nuanced effects of different political contexts on polarization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Structure and inference in hypergraphs with node attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many networked datasets with units interacting in groups of two or more, encoded with hypergraphs, are accompanied by extra information about nodes, such as the role of an individual in a workplace. Here we show how these node attributes can be used to improve our understanding of the structure resulting from higher-order interactions. We consider the problem of community detection in hypergraphs and develop a principled model that combines higher-order interactions and node attributes to better represent the observed interactions and to detect communities more accurately than using either of these types of information alone. The method learns automatically from the input data the extent to which structure and attributes contribute to explain the data, down weighing or discarding attributes if not informative. Our algorithmic implementation is efficient and scales to large hypergraphs and interactions of large numbers of units. We apply our method to a variety of systems, showing strong performance in hyperedge prediction tasks and in selecting community divisions that correlate with attributes when these are informative, but discarding them otherwise. Our approach illustrates the advantage of using informative node attributes when available with higher-order data.</description>

      <title>Are Fact-Checking Tools Helpful? An Exploration of the Usability of Google Fact Check</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13244v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fact-checking-specific search tools such as Google Fact Check are a promising way to combat misinformation on social media, especially during events bringing significant social influence, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the U.S. presidential elections. However, the usability of such an approach has not been thoroughly studied. We evaluated the performance of Google Fact Check by analyzing the retrieved fact-checking results regarding 1,000 COVID-19-related false claims and found it able to retrieve the fact-checking results for 15.8% of the input claims, and the rendered results are relatively reliable. We also found that the false claims receiving different fact-checking verdicts (i.e., "False," "Partly False," "True," and "Unratable") tend to reflect diverse emotional tones, and fact-checking sources tend to check the claims in different lengths and using dictionary words to various extents. Claim variations addressing the same issue yet described differently are likely to retrieve distinct fact-checking results. We suggest that the quantities of the retrieved fact-checking results could be optimized and that slightly adjusting input wording may be the best practice for users to retrieve more useful information. This study aims to contribute to the understanding of state-of-the-art fact-checking tools and information integrity.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Mitigating Bias in Algorithms Used to Disseminate Information in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social connections are conduits through which individuals communicate, information propagates, and diseases spread. Identifying individuals who are more likely to adopt ideas and spread them is essential in order to develop effective information campaigns, maximize the reach of resources, and fight epidemics. Influence maximization algorithms are used to identify sets of influencers. Based on extensive computer simulations on synthetic and ten diverse real-world social networks we show that seeding information using these methods creates information gaps. Our results show that these algorithms select influencers who do not disseminate information equitably, threatening to create an increasingly unequal society. To overcome this issue we devise a multi-objective algorithm which maximizes influence and information equity. Our results demonstrate it is possible to reduce vulnerability at a relatively low trade-off with respect to spread. This highlights that in our search for maximizing information we do not need to compromise on information equality.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Coordinated Cross-Platform Information Operations Threatening the Integrity of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election Online Discussion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information Operations (IOs) pose a significant threat to the integrity of democratic processes, with the potential to influence election-related online discourse. In anticipation of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we present a study aimed at uncovering the digital traces of coordinated IOs on $\mathbb{X}$ (formerly Twitter). Using our machine learning framework for detecting online coordination, we analyze a dataset comprising election-related conversations on $\mathbb{X}$ from May 2024. This reveals a network of coordinated inauthentic actors, displaying notable similarities in their link-sharing behaviors. Our analysis shows concerted efforts by these accounts to disseminate misleading, redundant, and biased information across the Web through a coordinated cross-platform information operation: The links shared by this network frequently direct users to other social media platforms or suspicious websites featuring low-quality political content and, in turn, promoting the same $\mathbb{X}$ and YouTube accounts. Members of this network also shared deceptive images generated by AI, accompanied by language attacking political figures and symbolic imagery intended to convey power and dominance. While $\mathbb{X}$ has suspended a subset of these accounts, more than 75% of the coordinated network remains active. Our findings underscore the critical role of developing computational models to scale up the detection of threats on large social media platforms, and emphasize the broader implications of these techniques to detect IOs across the wider Web.</description>

      <title>Disruption Risk Evaluation on Large-scale Production Network with Establishments and Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We constructed an establishment-level production network where each establishment inputs and outputs multiple products, using data that includes the firm-level production network and establishments covering nearly all Japanese entities. The network represents the manufacturing sector with 183,951 establishments across 157,537 firms and 919,982 inter-establishment linkages. A probabilistic model of supply chain disruptions was applied to this network. The key findings are as follows: (1) The establishment-level network exhibits greater shock propagation compared to the firm-level network. (2) Incorporating actual product information leads to a larger impact on propagation compared to using industry-level information. (3) Regional shock simulations reveal that while the firm-level network shows greater shock propagation when the shock originates in Tokyo, no such difference is observed in the establishment-level network.</description>

      <title>Information diffusion assumptions can distort our understanding of social network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To analyze the flow of information online, experts often rely on platform-provided data from social media companies, which typically attribute all resharing actions to an original poster. This obscures the true dynamics of how information spreads online, as users can be exposed to content in various ways. While most researchers analyze data as it is provided by the platform and overlook this issue, some attempt to infer the structure of these information cascades. However, the absence of ground truth about actual diffusion cascades makes verifying the efficacy of these efforts impossible. This study investigates the implications of the common practice of ignoring reconstruction all together. Two case studies involving data from Twitter and Bluesky reveal that reconstructing cascades significantly alters the identification of influential users, therefore affecting downstream analyses in general. We also propose a novel reconstruction approach that allows us to evaluate the effects of different assumptions made during the cascade inference procedure. Analysis of the diffusion of over 40,000 true and false news stories on Twitter reveals that the assumptions made during the reconstruction procedure drastically distort both microscopic and macroscopic properties of cascade networks. This work highlights the challenges of studying information spreading processes on complex networks and has significant implications for the broader study of digital platforms.</description>
