      <title>Simulating hashtag dynamics with networked groups of generative agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networked environments shape how information embedded in narratives influences individual and group beliefs and behavior. This raises key questions about how group communication around narrative media impacts belief formation and how such mechanisms contribute to the emergence of consensus or polarization. Language data from generative agents offer insight into how naturalistic forms of narrative interactions (such as hashtag generation) evolve in response to social rewards within networked communication settings. To investigate this, we developed an agent-based modeling and simulation framework composed of networks of interacting Large Language Model (LLM) agents. We benchmarked the simulations of four state-of-the-art LLMs against human group behaviors observed in a prior network experiment (Study 1) and against naturally occurring hashtags from Twitter (Study 2). Quantitative metrics of network coherence (e.g., entropy of a group's responses) reveal that while LLMs can approximate human-like coherence in sanitized domains (Study 1's experimental data), effective integration of background knowledge and social context in more complex or politically sensitive narratives likely requires careful and structured prompting.</description>

      <title>Are Online Sports Fan Communities Becoming More Offensive? A Quantitative Review of Topics, Trends, and Toxicity of r/PremierLeague</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online communities for sports fans have surged in popularity, with Reddit's r/PremierLeague emerging as a focal point for fans of one of the globe's most celebrated sports leagues. This boom has helped the Premier League make significant inroads into the US market, increasing viewership and sparking greater interest in its matches. Despite the league's broad appeal, there's still a notable gap in understanding its online fan community. Therefore, we analyzed a substantial dataset of over 1.1 million comments posted from 2013-2022 on r/PremierLeague. Our study delves into the sentiment, topics, and toxicity of these discussions, tracking trends over time, aiming to map out the conversation landscape. The rapid expansion has brought more diverse discussions, but also a worrying rise in negative sentiment and toxicity. Additionally, the subreddit has become a venue for users to voice frustrations about broader societal issues like racism, the COVID-19 pandemic, and political tensions.</description>

      <title>Disrupting Networks: Amplifying Social Dissensus via Opinion Perturbation and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how targeted content injection can strategically disrupt social networks. Using the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model, we utilize a measure of social dissensus and show that (i) simple FJ variants cannot significantly perturb the network, (ii) extending the model enables valid graph structures where disruption at equilibrium exceeds the initial state, and (iii) altering an individual's inherent opinion can maximize disruption. Building on these insights, we design a reinforcement learning framework to fine-tune a Large Language Model (LLM) for generating disruption-oriented text. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data confirm that tuned LLMs can approach theoretical disruption limits. Our findings raise important considerations for content moderation, adversarial information campaigns, and generative model regulation.</description>

      <title>Structure-Aware Optimal Intervention for Rumor Dynamics on Networks: Node-Level, Time-Varying, and Resource-Constrained</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rumor propagation in social networks undermines social stability and public trust, calling for interventions that are both effective and resource-efficient. We develop a node-level, time-varying optimal intervention framework that allocates limited resources according to the evolving diffusion state. Unlike static, centrality-based heuristics, our approach derives control weights by solving a resource-constrained optimal control problem tightly coupled to the network structure. Across synthetic and real-world networks, the method consistently lowers both the infection peak and the cumulative infection area relative to uniform and centrality-based static allocations. Moreover, it reveals a stage-aware law: early resources prioritize influential hubs to curb rapid spread, whereas later resources shift to peripheral nodes to eliminate residual transmission. By integrating global efficiency with fine-grained adaptability, the framework offers a scalable and interpretable paradigm for misinformation management and crisis response.</description>

      <title>Meritocracy versus Matthew-effect: Two underlying network formation mechanisms of online social platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of the internet industry, online social networks have come to play an increasingly significant role in everyday life. In recent years, content-based emerging platforms such as TikTok, Instagram, and Bilibili have diverged fundamentally in their underlying logic from traditional connection-based social platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn. Empirical data on follower counts and follower-count-based rankings reveal that the distribution of social power varies significantly across different types of platforms, with content-based platforms exhibiting notably greater inequality. Here we propose two fundamental network formation mechanisms: a meritocracy-based model and a Matthew-effect-based model, designed to capture the formation logic underlying traditional and emerging social networks, respectively. Through theoretical and numerical analysis, we demonstrate that both models replicate salient statistical features of social networks including scale-free and small-world property, while also closely match empirical patterns on the relationship between in-degrees and in-degree rankings, thereby capturing the distinctive distributions of social power in respective platforms. Moreover, networks such as academic collaboration networks, where the distribution of social power usually lies between that of traditional and emerging platorms, can be interpreted through a hybrid of the two proposed mechanisms. Deconstructing the formation mechanisms of online social networks offers valuable insights into the evolution of the content ecosystems and the behavioral patterns of content creators on online social platforms.</description>

      <title>Back to the Communities: A Mixed-Methods and Community-Driven Evaluation of Cultural Sensitivity in Text-to-Image Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence shows that text-to-image (T2I) models disproportionately reflect Western cultural norms, amplifying misrepresentation and harms to minority groups. However, evaluating cultural sensitivity is inherently complex due to its fluid and multifaceted nature. This paper draws on a state-of-the-art review and co-creation workshops involving 59 individuals from 19 different countries. We developed and validated a mixed-methods community-based evaluation methodology to assess cultural sensitivity in T2I models, which embraces first-person methods. Quantitative scores and qualitative inquiries expose convergence and disagreement within and across communities, illuminate the downstream consequences of misrepresentation, and trace how training data shaped by unequal power relations distort depictions. Extensive assessments are constrained by high resource requirements and the dynamic nature of culture, a tension we alleviate through a context-based and iterative methodology. The paper provides actionable recommendations for stakeholders, highlighting pathways to investigate the sources, mechanisms, and impacts of cultural (mis)representation in T2I models.</description>

      <title>Beyond Demographics: Behavioural Segmentation and Spatial Analytics to Enhance Visitor Experience at The British Museum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores visitor behaviour at The British Museum using data science methods applied to novel sources, including audio guide usage logs and TripAdvisor reviews. Analysing 42,000 visitor journeys and over 50,000 reviews, we identify key drivers of satisfaction, segment visitors by behavioural patterns, examine tour engagement, model spatial navigation, and investigate room popularity. Behavioural clustering uncovered four distinct visitor types: Committed Trekkers, Leisurely Explorers, Targeted Visitors, and Speedy Samplers, each characterised by different levels of engagement and movement. Tour usage analysis revealed high drop-off rates and variation in completion rates across different language groups. Spatial flow modelling revealed that accessibility and proximity, particularly aversion to stairs, shaped visitor paths more than thematic organisation. Room popularity was more strongly predicted by physical accessibility than curatorial content. We propose practical strategies for improving engagement and flow, offering a scalable framework for visitor-centred, data-informed museum planning.</description>

      <title>Community Detection on Model Explanation Graphs for Explainable AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feature-attribution methods (e.g., SHAP, LIME) explain individual predictions but often miss higher-order structure: sets of features that act in concert. We propose Modules of Influence (MoI), a framework that (i) constructs a model explanation graph from per-instance attributions, (ii) applies community detection to find feature modules that jointly affect predictions, and (iii) quantifies how these modules relate to bias, redundancy, and causality patterns. Across synthetic and real datasets, MoI uncovers correlated feature groups, improves model debugging via module-level ablations, and localizes bias exposure to specific modules. We release stability and synergy metrics, a reference implementation, and evaluation protocols to benchmark module discovery in XAI.</description>

      <title>How Similar Are Grokipedia and Wikipedia? A Multi-Dimensional Textual and Structural Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The launch of Grokipedia, an AI-generated encyclopedia developed by Elon Musk's xAI, was presented as a response to perceived ideological and structural biases in Wikipedia, aiming to produce "truthful" entries via the large language model Grok. Yet whether an AI-driven alternative can escape the biases and limitations of human-edited platforms remains unclear. This study undertakes a large-scale computational comparison of 382 matched article pairs between Grokipedia and Wikipedia. Using metrics across lexical richness, readability, structural organization, reference density, and semantic similarity, we assess how closely the two platforms align in form and substance. The results show that while Grokipedia exhibits strong semantic and stylistic alignment with Wikipedia, it typically produces longer but less lexically diverse articles, with fewer references per word and more variable structural depth. These findings suggest that AI-generated encyclopedic content currently mirrors Wikipedia's informational scope but diverges in editorial norms, favoring narrative expansion over citation-based verification. The implications highlight new tensions around transparency, provenance, and the governance of knowledge in an era of automated text generation.</description>

      <title>Can MLLMs Read the Room? A Multimodal Benchmark for Verifying Truthfulness in Multi-Party Social Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding, makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Food waste represents a major challenge to global climate resilience, accounting for almost 10\% of annual greenhouse gas emissions. The retail sector is a critical player, mediating product flows between producers and consumers, where supply chain inefficiencies can shape which items are put on sale. Yet how these dynamics vary across geographic contexts remains largely unexplored. Here, we analyze data from Denmark's largest retail group on near-expiry products put on sale. We uncover the geospatial variations using a dual-clustering approach. We identify multi-scale spatial relationships in retail organization by correlating store clustering -- measured using shortest-path distances along the street network -- with product clustering based on promotion co-occurrence patterns. Using a bipartite network approach, we identify three regional store clusters, and use percolation thresholds to corroborate the scale of their spatial separation. We find that stores in rural communities put meat and dairy products on sale up to 2.2 times more frequently than metropolitan areas. In contrast, we find that metropolitan and capital regions lean toward convenience products, which have more balanced nutritional profiles but less favorable environmental impacts. By linking geographic context to retail inventory, we provide evidence that reducing food waste requires interventions tailored to local retail dynamics, highlighting the importance of region-specific sustainability strategies.</description>

      <title>Representing Classical Compositions through Implication-Realization Temporal-Gestalt Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structural and cognitive underpinnings of musical compositions remains a key challenge in music theory and computational musicology. While traditional methods focus on harmony and rhythm, cognitive models such as the Implication-Realization (I-R) model and Temporal Gestalt theory offer insight into how listeners perceive and anticipate musical structure. This study presents a graph-based computational approach that operationalizes these models by segmenting melodies into perceptual units and annotating them with I-R patterns. These segments are compared using Dynamic Time Warping and organized into k-nearest neighbors graphs to model intra- and inter-segment relationships.
  Each segment is represented as a node in the graph, and nodes are further labeled with melodic expectancy values derived from Schellenberg's two-factor I-R model-quantifying pitch proximity and pitch reversal at the segment level. This labeling enables the graphs to encode both structural and cognitive information, reflecting how listeners experience musical tension and resolution.
  To evaluate the expressiveness of these graphs, we apply the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph kernel to measure similarity between and within compositions. Results reveal statistically significant distinctions between intra- and inter-graph structures. Segment-level analysis via multidimensional scaling confirms that structural similarity at the graph level reflects perceptual similarity at the segment level. Graph2vec embeddings and clustering demonstrate that these representations capture stylistic and structural features that extend beyond composer identity.
  These findings highlight the potential of graph-based methods as a structured, cognitively informed framework for computational music analysis, enabling a more nuanced understanding of musical structure and style through the lens of listener perception.</description>

      <title>Sybil-Resistant Service Discovery for Agent Economies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: x402 enables Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) services like application programming interfaces (APIs), data feeds, and inference providers to accept cryptocurrency payments for access. As agents increasingly consume these services, discovery becomes critical: which swap interface should an agent trust? Which data provider is the most reliable? We introduce TraceRank, a reputation-weighted ranking algorithm where payment transactions serve as endorsements. TraceRank seeds addresses with precomputed reputation metrics and propagates reputation through payment flows weighted by transaction value and temporal recency. Applied to x402's payment graph, this surfaces services preferred by high-reputation users rather than those with high transaction volume. Our system combines TraceRank with semantic search to respond to natural language queries with high quality results. We argue that reputation propagation resists Sybil attacks by making spam services with many low-reputation payers rank below legitimate services with few high-reputation payers. Ultimately, we aim to construct a search method for x402 enabled services that avoids infrastructure bias and has better performance than purely volume based or semantic methods.</description>

      <title>Social learning moderates the tradeoffs between efficiency, stability, and equity in group foraging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social learning shapes collective search by influencing how individuals use peer information. Empirical and computational studies show that optimal information sharing that is neither too localized nor too diffuse, can enhance resource detection and coordination. Building on these insights, we develop a randomized search model that integrates social learning with area-restricted search (ARS) to investigate how communication distance affects collective foraging. The model includes three behavioral modes: exploration, exploitation, and targeted walk, which are governed by a single parameter, $\rho$, that balances exploration and exploitation at the group level. We quantify how $\rho$ influences group efficiency ($\eta$), temporal variability/burstiness ($B$), and agent variability/equity in resource distribution ($\sigma$), revealing a clear trade-off among these outcomes. When $\rho \to 0$, agents explore independently, maximizing collective exploration. As $\rho$ increases, individuals preferentially exploit patches discovered by others: $\eta$ first rises and then declines, while $B$ shows the opposite trend. Group efficiency is optimized at interior $\rho$ values that balance exploration and exploitation. At the largest $\rho$, equality among agents is highest, but efficiency declines and burstiness is maximized too. Finally, by introducing negative rewards, we examine how social learning mitigates risk.</description>

Abstract: Modeling information spread through a network is one of the key problems of network analysis, with applications in a wide array of areas such as marketing and public health. Most approaches assume that the spread is governed by some probabilistic diffusion model, often parameterized by the strength of connections between network members (edge weights), highlighting the need for methods that can accurately estimate them. Multiple prior works suggest such estimators for particular diffusion models; however, most of them lack a rigorous statistical analysis that would establish the asymptotic properties of the estimator and allow for uncertainty quantification. In this paper, we develop a likelihood-based approach to estimate edge weights from the observed information diffusion paths under the proposed General Linear Threshold (GLT) model, a broad class of discrete-time information diffusion models that includes both the well-known linear threshold (LT) and independent cascade (IC) models. We first derive necessary and sufficient conditions that make the edge weights identifiable under this model. Then, we derive a finite sample error bound for the estimator and demonstrate that it is asymptotically normal under mild conditions. We conclude by studying the GLT model in the context of the Influence Maximization (IM) problem, that is, the task of selecting a subset of $k$ nodes to start the diffusion, so that the average information spread is maximized. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that the flexibility of the proposed class of GLT models, coupled with the proposed estimation and inference framework for its parameters, can significantly improve estimation of spread from a given subset of nodes, prediction of node activation, and the quality of the IM problem solutions.</description>

      <title>Media Coverage of War Victims: Journalistic Biases in Reporting on Israel and Gaza</title>

Abstract: October 7th 2023 marked the start of a war against Gaza, which is considered one of the most devastating wars in modern history and has led to a stark attitudinal divide within and between countries. To investigate the role of media bias in reporting on this asymmetrical warfare, we analyzed over 14,000 news articles published during the first year of war in three Western (The New York Times, BBC, CNN) and one non-Western English-language outlets (Al Jazeera English). Exploring the media narratives concerning Israeli and Palestinian victims experiencing hardship, we found three systematic biases in Western media. 1) Compared to Palestinian victims, represented mainly as undifferentiated collectives, Israeli victims were more likely to be portrayed as identifiable individual human beings. 2) Despite the striking difference in all forms of hardship (casualties, displacement, etc.), Western journalists created a false balance, equating Israeli and Palestinian suffering, by persistently referring back to the 7th of October massacre, even in the absence of new events involving Israeli victims. 3) When reporting on numbers of Palestinian (vs. Israeli) victims, journalists used language that casts doubt about the credibility of the information and the reputation of the source providing it, thereby selectively undermining the reader's trust in the information regarding Palestinian suffering. Together, our analysis reveals a series of systematic journalistic biases in high-profile Western media that are absent or greatly reduced in Al Jazeera.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Stage Framework with Taxonomy-Guided Reasoning for Occupation Classification Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12989</link>

Abstract: Automatically annotating job data with standardized occupations from taxonomies, known as occupation classification, is crucial for labor market analysis. However, this task is often hindered by data scarcity and the challenges of manual annotations. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise due to their extensive world knowledge and in-context learning capabilities, their effectiveness depends on their knowledge of occupational taxonomies, which remains unclear. In this study, we assess the ability of LLMs to generate precise taxonomic entities from taxonomy, highlighting their limitations, especially for smaller models. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-stage framework consisting of inference, retrieval, and reranking stages, which integrates taxonomy-guided reasoning examples to enhance performance by aligning outputs with taxonomic knowledge. Evaluations on a large-scale dataset show that our framework not only enhances occupation and skill classification tasks, but also provides a cost-effective alternative to frontier models like GPT-4o, significantly reducing computational costs while maintaining strong performance. This makes it a practical and scalable solution for occupation classification and related tasks across LLMs.</description>
