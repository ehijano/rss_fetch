      <title>The Type Ia Supernova 2021hem: A 2003fg-like Event in an Apparently Hostless Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report observations of Type Ia SN 2021hem, discovered &lt;48 hours of last non-detection, and located in an apparently hostless environment. With a peak absolute B-band magnitude of -19.96 mag, and a lack of secondary maximum in near-infrared and i-band light curves make it resemble 2003fg-like events. The slowly evolving light curves, and the earliest spectrum showing CII absorption lines, further support this classification. Fireball model fit to early light curves yields a time of first light of -16.43 days relative to B-band maximum. The first detection occurs 1.51 days before the onset of the fireball-like flux rise. This early emission, and $(g - r)_0$ color, is inconsistent with circumstellar or companion interaction. Instead, shallow $^{56}$Ni mixing or an asymmetric $^{56}$Ni distribution offers a plausible explanation. SN2021hem is the fifth known 2003fg-like SN with early-time excess flux emission. The estimated mass of radioactive $^{56}$Ni in SN2021hem is $1.00\pm0.09 M_\odot$. Deep GTC imaging obtained 2.5 yr after the explosion (with $m_{lim,r}=24.4$ mag and $\mu_{lim,r} = 26.3\rm~mag~arsec^{-2}$), reveals no coincident host, thereby ruling out most faint dwarf and UDGs. Alternatively, assuming the nearest plausible host galaxy, at a distance of 102 kpc, implies a hyper-velocity progenitor ejected at $\sim$2200 km/s. A faint diffuse feature ~6 kpc from the SN site has also been detected in the image, with its surface brightness of a UDGs. However, it is unclear whether it is a galaxy and is associated with SN2021hem. Considering its large normalized directional light distance ($d_{DLR}\sim3-4$) from SN, and its unusual elongation, it is a candidate of low probability to be the host galaxy of SN2021hem. These results identify SN2021hem as one of the strongest candidates for a hostless SN Ia, underscoring the diversity of luminous, slowly evolving, 2003fg-like explosions.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger flare in the quasar PKS 0446+11</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical mechanisms driving neutrino and electromagnetic flares in blazars remain poorly understood. We investigate a prominent multi-messenger flare in the quasar PKS 0446+11 to identify the processes responsible for its high-energy emission. We analyze the IceCube-240105A high-energy neutrino event together with contemporaneous observations in the gamma-ray, X-ray, optical, and radio bands. The on- and off-flare spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are modeled within a single-zone leptohadronic framework. Multi-epoch VLBA observations from the MOJAVE program provide parsec-scale polarization data that complement the multi-wavelength light curves. No significant time delay is detected between the neutrino arrival and the flares in different energy bands. This is consistent with an extremely small jet viewing angle below 1 deg, inferred from the parsec-scale polarization structure. The flare can be reproduced by the injection of a proton population and an increase of the Doppler factor from 18 to 24. We also detect an approximately 90 deg rotation of the EVPA in the parsec-scale core during the initial phase of the flare, indicating the emergence of a shock formed by the change in the bulk plasma speed. Our comprehensive multi-messenger analysis demonstrates that the extreme beaming and sub-degree viewing angle of this distant blazar can account for the observed neutrino and electromagnetic activity. These findings strengthen the case for blazars as efficient accelerators of hadrons and as significant contributors to the observed high-energy neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>\texttt{ExTraSS}: a Domain Decomposed 3D NLTE Radiative Transfer spectral synthesis code for nebular phase transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the nebular phase, supernovae are powered by radioactive decay and continuously fade, while their densities have decreased enough such that the expanding nebula becomes (largely) optically thin and the entire structure can be studied. Models for the nebular phase need to take Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) effects into account, while at the same time radiative transfer effects often cannot be ignored. To account for the asymmetric morphologies of SNe, 3D input ejecta models must be used. In this work, we present the \texttt{ExTraSS} (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator) code, which has been upgraded to be fully capable of 3D NLTE radiative transfer calculations in order to generate synthetic spectra for explosive transients in the nebular phase, with a focus on supernovae. We solve the long-standing difficulty of 3D NLTE radiative transfer -- to manage generation and storage of millions of photoexcitation rates over $\sim10^{5}$ of cells -- by developing a new Domain Decomposition algorithm. We describe this new methodology and general code operations in detail, and verify convergence and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Emission line models for the lowest mass core-collapse supernovae -- II. Full 3D NLTE radiative transfer modelling of a $9.0\,M_\odot$ neutrino-driven explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nebular phase of a supernova (SN) occurs several months to years after the explosion, when the ejecta become mostly optically thin yet there still is sufficient radioactive material to keep the supernova bright. The asymmetries created by the explosion are encoded into the line profiles of the emission lines which appear in the nebular phase. In order to make accurate predictions for these line profiles, Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer calculations need to be carried out. In this work, we use \texttt{ExTraSS} (EXplosive TRAnsient Spectral Simulator) -- which was recently upgraded into a full 3D NLTE radiative transfer code (including photoionization and line-by-line transfer effects) -- to carry out such calculations. \texttt{ExTraSS} is applied to a 3D explosion model of a $9.0\,M_\odot$ H-rich progenitor which is evolved into the homologous phase. Synthetic spectra are computed and the lines from different elements are studied for varying viewing angles. The model spectra are also compared against observations of SN 1997D and SN 2016bkv. The model is capable of creating good line profile matches for both SNe, and reasonable luminosity matches for He, C, O, and Mg lines for SN 1997D -- however H$\alpha$ and Fe I lines are too strong.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Heating in Evolving Proto-Neutron Stars: A Two-Fluid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) provide a unique laboratory to probe dark matter (DM) through its gravitational imprint on stellar evolution. We use a two-fluid framework with non-annihilating, asymmetric DM, both fermionic and bosonic, that interacts with ordinary matter (OM) solely through gravity. Within this framework, we track proto-neutron stars (PNSs) across their thermal and compositional evolution via quasi-static modeling over the Kelvin--Helmholtz cooling timescale. We uncover a distinct thermal signature: DM cores deepen the gravitational potential, compressing and heating the baryonic matter, while extended DM halos provide external support, leading to cooling of the stellar matter. In contrast, hyperons and other exotic baryons soften the equation of state similarly to DM cores but reduce, rather than increase, the temperature. DM thus alters both temperature and particle distribution profiles in ways that provide a clear diagnostic of its presence. DM cores also enhance compactness and shift hyperon onset, with the strongest effects during deleptonization and neutrino-transparent phases due to reduced neutrino pressure contributions. Consequently, this early thermal evolution, observable through supernova neutrino light curves and young pulsar cooling curves, offers a direct, testable probe of DM in NSs.</description>

      <title>Blazar PKS 0446+11 - Neutrino connection study using a lepto-hadronic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength study of a blazar PKS 0446+11, motivated by its spatial association with the neutrino event IC240105A detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory on 2024 January 5. The source is located 0.4 degrees from the best-fit neutrino direction and satisfies selection criteria for VLBI-selected, radio-bright AGN that have been identified as highly probable neutrino associations. PKS 0446+11 exhibited a major gamma-ray flare in November 2023, reaching approximately 18x its 4FGL-DR4 catalog average. Around the neutrino epoch, PKS 0446+11 remained in an elevated state, with the gamma-ray flux more than six times above its catalog level, the X-ray flux an order of magnitude above the archival measurements, and the optical-UV emission also enhanced. We used Fermi-LAT, Swift-XRT/UVOT, and archival multi-wavelength data to construct multi-wavelength light curves and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). SED modeling shows that the emission is best described by a leptonic scenario, with synchrotron emission at low energies and external Compton scattering of broad-line region and dusty torus photons dominating the X-ray - gamma-ray output. A lepto-hadronic model fails to adequately reproduce the observed SED, although hadronic cascades can broadly account for the X-ray and gamma-ray spectral coverage at lower flux levels. We compute the expected neutrino flux for the hadronic scenario and compare it to the IceCube 90% upper limit. Our results highlight the importance of continued multi-wavelength and neutrino monitoring to better understand the physical conditions under which this blazar may serve as neutrino source.</description>

      <title>First results from the PanRadio GRB Collaboration: the 400-day afterglow of GRB~230815A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the PanRadio Gamma-ray Burst (GRB) program carried out on the Australia Telescope Compact Array: a systematic, multi-year, radio survey of all southern \textit{Swift} GRB events, comprehensively following the multi-frequency evolution of their afterglows from within an hour to years post-burst. We present the results of the 400-day observing campaign following the afterglow of long-duration (collapsar) GRB~230815A, the first one detected through this program. Typically, GRB~230815A would not otherwise receive traditional radio follow-up, given it has no known redshift and lacks comprehensive multi-wavelength follow-up due to its high line-of-sight extinction with $A_V = 2.3$. We found its early X-ray jet break at ${\sim}0.1$ days post-burst to be at odds with the evolution of the multi-frequency radio light curves that were traced over an unusually long duration of $400$ days. The radio light curves approximately evolved (with minor deviations) according to the standard self-similar expansion for a relativistic blast wave in a homogeneous environment prior to jet break, showing no evidence for evolution in the microphysical parameters describing the electron acceleration processes. We reconcile these features by proposing a two-component jet: the early X-ray break originates from a narrow component with a half-opening angle ${\sim}2.1^{\circ}$, while the evolution of the radio afterglow stems from a wider component with a half-opening angle $\gtrapprox 35^{\circ}$. The PanRadio GRB program will establish a sample of comprehensively followed GRBs, where a rigorous inspection of their microphysical and dynamical parameters can be performed, thereby revealing the diversity of features in their outflows and environments.</description>

      <title>Cross Calibration of Galaxy Cluster Temperatures Measured with NuSTAR, XMM-Newton, and Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of galaxy clusters to constrain cosmology is limited in part due to uncertainties in derived cluster masses, which often depend on the gas temperature. Unfortunately, there exists a longstanding discrepancy in temperature measurements of the same galaxy clusters made by the two most sensitive X-ray observatories, Chandra and XMM-Newton. The NuSTAR X-ray Observatory's greater sensitivity to the exponential turnover in the bremsstrahlung continuum allows for more precise and potentially more accurate galaxy cluster temperature estimates, especially given its unique ability to independently calibrate its optics in orbit. We present new NuSTAR spectra of 10 relaxed clusters ($5~\mathrm{keV} &lt; kT &lt; 10~\mathrm{keV}$), extracted from identical regions as previous spectra from Chandra and XMM-Newton. The 3--20~keV spectra are well fit by single temperature models, and fits done in narrower bandpasses provide no clear evidence in support of the existence of multi temperature gas. We find NuSTAR temperatures are typically $\sim 15\%$ higher than XMM-Newton temperatures. In contrast, good agreement is found between NuSTAR and Chandra temperatures for clusters with $kT \lesssim 7~\mathrm{keV}$, with Chandra measurements exceeding NuSTAR's in hotter systems. When more clusters are included, the trend is reinforced and can be extended to higher temperatures. A generic increase to Chandra's $E &gt; 2~\mathrm{keV}$ effective area ($\sim 5\%$ at 5~keV) is found to explain the trend reasonably well. These results demonstrate the potential for NuSTAR data to address the two-decade-old temperature discrepancy between Chandra and XMM-Newton.</description>

      <title>Kerr Polarization Transport: Accuracy and Performance in General Relativistic Light Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact and reproducible method for general relativistic polarization transport in the Kerr metric that achieves median electric vector position angle (EVPA) residuals of $\langle \Delta \mathrm{PA} \rangle \approx 0.09^\circ$, a 95th percentile of $0.31^\circ$, and a worst case $\Delta \mathrm{PA} \lesssim 0.32^\circ$ for spins up to $|a/M|=0.9$, while maintaining a fivefold or greater speedup relative to a strict reference integrator. Across the benchmark grid, typical residuals remain at the sub-tenth-degree level, with only modest degradation ($\Delta \mathrm{PA} \lesssim 2^\circ$) near the Thorne spin limit. Photon four-momenta $k^\mu$ and polarization four-vectors $f^\mu$ are advanced using a fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme with cached Christoffel symbols, maintaining the constraints $u\cdot f=0$ and $n\cdot f=0$, where $u^\mu$ is the ZAMO four-velocity and $n^\mu$ is the disk normal, while keeping $k\cdot f \simeq 0$. A physically motivated gauge is enforced by projecting the polarization into the local zero-angular-momentum observer (ZAMO) screen at every substep, ensuring numerical stability of the orthogonality constraints. Accuracy and performance are benchmarked over a representative grid in spin, inclination, image-plane azimuth, and radius. The method comfortably meets IXPE and NICER polarization tolerances and approaches EHT requirements. The approach provides a practical foundation for future general relativistic polarimetry and simulation pipelines.</description>

      <title>Could the stochastic gravitational wave background from newborn magnetars be detected by the advanced LIGO and Einstein Telescope?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newborn magnetars are important gravitational wave sources due to their ultra-strong magnetic fields and fast spins, and the entire population in the Universe may significantly contribute to the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we investigate the SGWB from newborn magnetars and assess its detectability by the advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Einstein Telescope (ET) based on three typical formation mechanisms of magnetars, i.e., the $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo, convective dynamo, and magnetic flux conservation. For the two dynamo scenarios, when calculating the SGWB, we creatively incorporate the anti-correlations between the magnetic fields and initial spin periods $P_{\rm i}$ with the initial dipole-field distribution of newborn magnetars. For the flux-conservation scenario, a bimodal lognormal form is adopted to describe the distribution of initial dipole fields, and all magnetars are assumed to have the same $P_{\rm i}$. Our results show that the SGWB from newborn magnetars may be undetectable by the aLIGO and ET if the magnetars are formed due to these mechanisms since the signal-to-noise ratio of the SGWB with respect to the ET for an observation time of one year is only 0.37 for the $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo, $3\times10^{-4}$ for the convective dynamo, and at most 0.21 for the flux conservation.</description>

      <title>Probing Supernovae through gravitational wave entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an entropy-based framework to analyze gravitational-wave signals from core-collapse supernovae. We use waveforms generated by numerical simulations and analyze them in both the time domain and the time-frequency domain using short-time Fourier and continuous wavelet transforms. From each representation, we compute four entropy measures -- Shannon, exponential, R\'enyi, and Tsallis -- and apply three feature selection methods to identify the most informative features. We then train machine-learning classifiers on these features to compare the performance of different methodological combinations. We find that the combination of R\'enyi entropy from the wavelet domain and the Relief-F selection method yields the most effective discrimination among different gravitational-wave signals.</description>

      <title>Study of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars and BL Lacertae Objects as Sources of Diffusive Ultra High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine whether Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs) can act as plausible astrophysical sources of diffuse ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Using realistic luminosity-dependent density evolution (LDDE) functions derived from observed gamma-ray luminosity functions for FSRQs and BL Lacs, we calculate the redshift evolution of the cosmic ray source population through integrated luminosity functions. The diffuse UHECRs flux from these sources is modelled by propagating nuclei through extragalactic space, including energy losses from interactions with cosmic photon backgrounds. The resulting UHECRs spectra are compared with observational data from the Pierre Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array, with fluxes normalised at reference energies. In addition to spectral comparisons, we generate HEALPix-based sky maps and identify potential hotspots. Near these hotspots, several galaxies and extragalactic sources are found, suggesting possible associations with the enhanced flux regions. Our results indicate that LDDE-modelled AGNs could contribute significantly to the observed diffuse UHECRs flux and provide constraints on their role as dominant sources.</description>

      <title>Fill the gaps: continuous in time interpolation of fluid dynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexible and accurate interpolation schemes using machine learning could be of great benefit for many use-cases in numerical simulations and post-processing, such as temporal upsampling or storage reduction. In this work, we adapt the physics-informed token transformer (PITT) network for multi-channel data and couple it with Fourier neural operator (FNO). The resulting PITT FNO network is trained for interpolation tasks on a dataset governed by the Euler equations. We compare the performance of our machine learning model with a linear interpolation baseline and show that it requires $\sim6-10$ times less data to achieve the same mean square error of the interpolated quantities. Additionally, PITT FNO has excellent mass and energy conservation as a result of its physics-informed nature. We further discuss the ability of the network to recover fine detail using a spectral analysis. Our results suggest that loss of fine details is related to the decreasing correlation time of the data with increasing Fourier mode which cannot be resolved by simply increasing Fourier mode truncation in FNO.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Possibility of a Sharp Phase Transition in Cold Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in cold neutron stars (NSs) have been extensively studied and have provided valuable insights into the behavior of the densest matter visible in our Universe, although a strong consensus has yet to emerge. Revisiting the possibility of a hadron-quark FOPT from a new perspective, we examine the interplay between the coupled nature of gravity and microscopic interactions in Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations and the fundamental requirements of thermodynamic consistency in NSs. We demonstrate that a sharp FOPT manifested as a plateau in the equation of state (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$, i.e., pressure $P$ versus energy density $\varepsilon$, is intrinsically incompatible with the regularity conditions of the TOV solutions. Although numerical integrations of the TOV equations with EOSs incorporating FOPTs may yield seemingly reasonable mass-radius relations consistent with current observations, such results can mask underlying inconsistencies. Our analysis thus establishes a structural consistency criterion for constraining dense-matter EOSs using NS observables, complementing existing studies of possible phase transitions in NS interiors.</description>

      <title>A Novel Parameterization for Rapid Cooling in Supernova Remnants, with applications to the Pa 30 nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically study how cooling creates structural changes in supernova remnants as they evolve. Inspired by the peculiar morphology of the Pa 30 nebula, we adopt a framework in which to characterize supernova remnants under different degrees of cooling. Our cooling framework characterizes remnants with a singular parameter called $\beta$ that sets how rapidly the system's thermal energy is radiated or emitted away. A continuum of morphologies is created by the implementation of different cooling timescales. For $\beta \gtrsim 400$, or when the cooling timescale is shorter than $\approx \frac{1}{400}$ of the Sedov time, the ejecta is shaped into a filamentary structure similar to Pa 30. We explain the filament creation by the formation of Rayleigh-Taylor Instability fingers where cooling has prevented the Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability from overturning and mixing out the tips. The ejecta in these filaments have not decelerated and are moving almost completely ballistically at $\approx 95-100\%$ their free expansion speed. In this rapid cooling regime, an explosion energy $\approx 3.5 \times 10^{47}$ erg is inferred. We also propose the cooling mechanism required to create these structures necessitates removing energy at a rate of $2\%$ of $E_{\rm ej}/t$, which implies a cooling luminosity of $\approx 10^{36}$ erg/s.</description>

      <title>The future ability to test theories of gravity with black-hole shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The horizon-scale images of supermassive black holes (BHs) by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHT) have provided new opportunities to test general relativity and other theories of gravity. In view of future projects, such as the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and the Black-Hole Explorer (BHEX), having the potential of enhancing our ability to probe extreme gravity, it is natural to ask: \textit{how much can two black-hole images differ?} To address this question and assess the ability of these projects to test theories of gravity with black-hole shadows, we use general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic and radiative-transfer simulations to investigate the images of a wide class of accreting BHs deviating from the Kerr solution. By measuring the mismatch between images of different BHs we show that future missions will be able to distinguish a large class of BHs solutions from the Kerr solution when the mismatch in the images exceeds values between $2\%$ and $5\%$ depending on the image-comparison metric considered. These results indicate future horizon-scale imaging with percent-level image fidelity can place meaningful observational constraints on deviations from the Kerr metric and thereby test strong-field predictions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Tests of General Relativity with Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences offer a powerful and reliable probe of General Relativity. To date, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has provided stringent consistency tests of General Relativity predictions. In this work, we present forecasts for the accuracy with which General Relativity can be tested using third-generation ground-based interferometers, focusing on Einstein Telescope (ET) and binary black hole mergers. Given the expected high detection rate, performing full Bayesian analyses for each event becomes computationally challenging. To overcome this, we adopt a Fisher matrix approach, simulating parameter estimation in an idealized observation scenario, which allows us to study large populations of compact binary coalescences with feasible computational efforts. Within this framework, we investigate the constraints that ET, in its different configurations, can impose on inspiral post-Newtonian coefficients, by jointly analyzing events using a Bayesian hierarchical methodology. Our results indicate that ET could in principle achieve an accuracy of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ on the dipole radiation term and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ on higher-order post-Newtonian coefficients, for both the triangular and the two L-shaped designs, with $10^4$ catalog events. We also assess the number of detections required to confidently identify deviations from General Relativity at various post-Newtonian orders and for different detector configurations.</description>

      <title>The impact of precession and higher-order multipoles on cosmological inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave astronomy presents an exciting opportunity to provide an independent measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe. By combining inferences for the binary component masses and luminosity distances from individual observations, it is possible to infer $H_0$ without direct electromagnetic counterparts or galaxy catalogs. However, this relies on theoretical gravitational-wave models, which are known to be incomplete descriptions of the full predictions of general relativity. Although the accuracy of our models are improving, they are also becoming increasingly expensive as additional phenomena are incorporated. In this work, we demonstrate that there is no significant advantage in including spin-precession and higher-order multipole moments when inferring $H_0$ via the mass spectrum method for current and near-future gravitational-wave event numbers. Even when simulating a population of highly precessing and preferentially asymmetric-mass-ratio binaries, we show that the inferred $H_0$ posterior changes minimally. Using a simpler, less accurate model, achieves comparable $H_0$ estimates with six times less computational cost (on average). Using computationally cheaper models for single event inference may become crucial as thousands of gravitational-wave observations are expected to be detected in the near future.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the Relationship Between Stellar X-ray Luminosity and Age with eROSITA Data Release 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate stellar dating provides crucial information about the formation and development of planetary systems. Existing age-dating techniques are limited in terms of both the spectral type and age range they can accurately probe, and many are unreliable for stars older than 1 Gyr. Recent studies have suggested that a star's X-ray luminosity correlates strongly with stellar age and shows a steep fall-off at ages older than 1 Gyr. In this work, we present X-ray luminosity relationship values from eROSITA for four previously unassessed stars. Additionally, we reassess the X-ray luminosity/age relationship present in 24 main-sequence stars older than a gigayear. We confirm that a correlation does appear to exist between stellar age and X-ray luminosity at ages older than 1 Gyr. However, we measure a shallower slope with age than previous research for older stars, similar to what was found for younger stars. We also find evidence for significant astrophysical variability in a star's X-ray luminosity, which will likely limit the precision with which X-ray measurements can yield age estimates. We also find weak evidence for mass dependence in the X-ray luminosity/age relationship. These results suggest that although X-ray luminosity correlates with stellar age, it may not serve as a reliable standalone age indicator and is better used as part of a broader suite of age-dating methods.</description>

      <title>In-Orbit GRB Identification Using LLM-based model for the CXPD CubeSat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07957v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To validate key technologies for wide field-of-view (FOV) X-ray polarization measurements, the Cosmic X-ray Polarization Detector (CXPD) CubeSat series has been developed as a prototype platform for the Low-Energy Xray Polarization Detector (LPD) onboard the POLAR-2 mission. The wide-FOV design significantly increases the complexity of the background environment, posing notable challenges for real-time gamma-ray burst (GRB) identification. In this work, we propose an in-orbit GRB identification method based on machine learning, using simulated spectral data as input. A training dataset was constructed using a Geant4-based simulator, incorporating in-orbit background and GRB events modeled within the 2-10 keV energy range. To meet the computational constraints of onboard processing, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM), which is fine-tuned using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based on miniCPM-V2.6 and quantized to 4-bit precision. The model achieves perfect classification accuracy on validation data and demonstrates strong regression performance in estimating GRB spectral indices, with an RMSE of 0.118. Furthermore, we validate the feasibility of onboard deployment through a simulated satellite data processing pipeline, highlighting the potential of our approach to enable future real-time GRB detection and spectral analysis in orbit.</description>

      <title>Towards direct imaging and orbital parameter estimation of supermassive black hole binaries with spaceborne VLBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07996v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct electromagnetic observation of the orbital motion of a sub-parsec, supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) would provide the first conclusive proof of such systems existing. Widely considered to be the sources of gravitational waves, binaries are expected to form as a natural consequence of galactic mergers and determining the processes that drive their evolution is essential for understanding cosmological evolution. In this work, we evaluate the prospects of using ground and spaceborne Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to observe supermassive black hole binaries and estimate their orbital parameters. The Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) is considered as the primary case study. Achieving unprecedented resolution, BHEX will provide access to a new volume of binary parameter space, potentially enabling the first, confident detection of an SMBHB. A binary toy model using a post-Newtonian orbit propagation is developed and simulated observations by BHEX and a ground array of telescopes are performed. An orbit fitting approach using Bayesian dynamic nested sampling is presented and its efficacy is demonstrated on the simulated observational data for a set of example binary systems. It is found that for BHEX, binary detection requires a total flux density of 0.04 Jy with a minimum separation of ~2 $\mu$as and an observable mass ratio dependent on the total flux. With three annual observations, BHEX could constrain semi-major axis and eccentricity of binaries with orbital periods $\leq$10 years to within 13% of the true values. A curved trajectory could confidently be detected in binaries with period $\leq$23 years. Proposals for how candidate sources could be identified in time for the BHEX mission are also provided. Finally, we constrain the requirements of a future spaceborne VLBI system, capable of performing a statistically significant survey of supermassive black hole binaries.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave dispersion over inhomogeneous space-times: General relativity, screened theories of gravity and non-minimal dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are direct probes of cosmological gravity, sensitive to space-time inhomogeneities along their propagation. The presence of massive objects breaks homogeneity and isotropy, allowing for new interactions between different GW polarizations, and opening up the intriguing opportunity to test modified gravity theories. This setup generalizes the notion of gravitational deflection and lensing, revealing novel phenomena in modified theories. Any non-minimal theory introduces effective mass terms for GWs, causing \textit{lens-induced dispersion} (LID), a frequency-dependent phase shift on the waveform. We compute GW dispersion in Einstein's general relativity (GR) for a spherical matter distribution, finding a small but non-zero phasing that is potentially accessible to next-generation detectors. We then extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories, focusing on symmetron gravity as an example of screened theory, combining cosmological deviations and consistency with local gravity tests. We find enhanced GW dispersion in a large region of the symmetron parameter space, compared to both GR and Brans-Dicke theory. We argue that dispersion, associated to an effective mass for the metric fluctuations, can in some cases prevent the propagation of GWs through some astrophysical bodies, turning them into reflectors. Our analysis shows that the Earth becomes an efficient GW shield for a hitherto unconstrained region of the symmetron parameter space, leading to a $\sim 50\%$ fraction of events becoming unobservable or at least displaying a dramatic modification of the detector antenna response. The richness and universality of dispersive phenomena in non-minimal theories open a new avenue to test theories of dynamical dark-energy, relevant in light of recent observational results challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals into black holes surrounded by matter: Resonance crossings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The forthcoming space-based gravitational-wave observatory Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should enable the detection of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass compact object gradually inspirals into a supermassive black hole while emitting gravitational waves. Modeling the waveforms of such systems is a challenging task, requiring precise computation of energy and angular momentum fluxes as well as proper treatment of orbital resonances, during which two fundamental orbital frequencies become commensurate. In this work, we perform a systematic comparison of fluxes derived from three approaches: the quadrupole formula, post-Newtonian approximations, and time-domain solutions of the Teukolsky equation. We show that quadrupole-based fluxes remain in good agreement with Teukolsky results across a broad range of orbital configurations, including perturbed orbits. Building on these insights, we explore the dynamical impact of resonance crossings within the adiabatic approximation. By introducing novel numerical methods, we reduce computational costs and uncover diverse resonance-crossing behaviors. These results contribute to the effort to understand theoretically and model adequately resonance crossings during an EMRI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A universal contribution exists in the infrared (low frequency) regime of all gravitational waves, which results from nonlinear memory. Nonlinear memory is sourced by linear order gravitational waves and exists for any gravitational-wave background. We calculate the stochastic nonlinear memory signal of various stochastic backgrounds of cosmological (scalar induced, reheating, phase transition, topological defect, turbulence) and astrophysical (binary mergers of stellar-mass, intermediate mass, supermassive, and primordial black holes) origins. These results allow us to derive the complete frequency spectrum of cosmological and astrophysical SGWB. We calculate how to probe the thermal state of the universe, i.e. the equation of the state, via the memory spectrum's slope and also discuss the detection prospects at various frequency bands with future experiments.</description>

      <title>Effect of spin in binary neutron star mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of spin on equal and unequal mass binary neutron star mergers using finite-temperature, composition-dependent Steiner-Fischer-Hempel equation of state with parameter set ``o'' (SFHo), via 3+1 general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations which take into account neutrino emission and absorption. Equal mass, irrotational cases that have a mass of $M_{1,2}$ =$1.27M_{\odot}$, result in a long-lived neutron star, while $1.52$ and $2.05M_{\odot}$ cases lead to a prompt collapse to a black hole. For all cases, we analyse the effect of initial spin on dynamics, on the structure of the final remnant, its spin evolution, the amount and composition of the ejected matter, gravitational waves, neutrino energies {and luminosities}, and disc masses. We show that in equal mass binary neutron star mergers, the ejected mass could reach $\sim0.06M_{\odot}$ for highly aligned-spins ($\chi=0.67$). The black hole which results from such a highly spinning, high-mass binary neutron star merger reaches a dimensionless spin of $0.92$; this is the highest spin reached in binary neutron star mergers, to date.</description>

      <title>Mirage Sources and Large TeV Halo-Pulsar Offsets: Exploring the Parameter Space</title>

Abstract: We investigate the asymmetric propagation of 100 TeV electrons (whose radiation mainly concentrates on 20--30 TeV) in turbulent magnetic fields around pulsars, using GPU-accelerated simulations to explore their trajectories and interactions within pulsar wind nebulae and the interstellar medium. Key results include the identification of ``mirage'' sources indicating significant offsets in high-energy emissions from their originating pulsars, challenging the results of traditional symmetric diffusion models. By varying parameters like source distance, magnetic field strength, and electron injection spectral index, the study delineates their effects on observable phenomena such as the probability that a source has at least one mirage around it, as well as the source separation. Our results offer insights into some puzzling sources observed recently by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO), and shed light on the cosmic-ray transport mechanism in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Late-Time Evolution of Magnetized Disks in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classic time-dependent 1D accretion disk models, the inner radiation pressure dominated regime is viscously unstable. However, late-time observations of accretion disks formed in tidal disruption events (TDEs) do not exhibit evidence of such instabilities. The common theoretical response is to modify the viscosity parametrization, but typically used viscosity parametrization are generally ad hoc. In this study, we take a different approach, and investigate a time-dependent 1D $\alpha$-disk model in which the pressure is dominated by magnetic fields rather than photons. We compare the time evolution of thermally stable, strongly magnetized TDE disks to the simpler linear viscosity model. We find that the light curves of magnetized disks evolve as $L_{\rm UV}\propto t^{-5/6}$ for decades to centuries, and that this same evolution can be reproduced by the linear viscosity model for specific parameter choices. Additionally, we show that TDEs remain UV-bright for many years, suggesting we could possibly find fossil TDEs decades after their bursts. We estimate that ULTRASAT could detect hundreds of such events, providing an opportunity to study late-stage TDE physics and supermassive black hole (SMBH) properties. Finally, we explore the connection between TDE disks and quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) suggested by recent observations. One theoretical explanation involves TDE disks expanding to interact with extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), which produce X-ray flares as the EMRI passes through the disk. Our estimates indicate that magnetized TDE disks should exhibit QPEs earlier than those observed in AT2019qiz, suggesting that the QPEs may have begun before their first detection.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tides in neutron stars with first-order phase transitions: the role of the discontinuity mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the late stages of a binary neutron star inspiral, dynamical tides induced in each star by its companion become significant and should be included in complete gravitational-wave (GW) modeling. We investigate the coupling between the tidal field and quasi-normal modes in hybrid stars and show that the discontinuity mode ($g$-mode) - intrinsically associated with first-order phase transitions and buoyancy - contributes non-negligibly compared with the fundamental $f$-mode. We find that the $g$-mode overlap integral can reach up to $\sim 10\%$ of the $f$-mode value for hybrid star masses in the range 1.4-2.0$M_{\odot}$, with the largest values generally associated with larger density jumps. This leads to a GW phase shift due to the $g$-mode of $\Delta \phi_g \lesssim 0.1$-$1$ rad (i.e., up to $\sim5\%-10\%$ of $\Delta \phi_f$), with the largest shifts occurring for masses near the phase transition. At higher masses, the shifts remain smaller and nearly constant, with $\Delta \phi_g \lesssim 0.1$ rad (roughly $\sim 1\%$ of $\Delta \phi_f$). These GW shifts may be relevant even at the design sensitivity of current second-generation GW detectors in the most optimistic cases. Moreover, if a $g$-mode is present and lies near the $f$-mode frequency, neglecting it in the GW modeling can lead to systematic biases in neutron star parameter estimation, resulting in radius errors of up to $1\%-2\%$. These results show the importance of dynamical tides to probe neutron stars' equation of state, and to test the existence of dense-matter phase transitions.</description>

      <title>SN 2024aecx: A double-peaked rapidly evolving Type IIb supernova at 11 Mpc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of low-resolution spectroscopic and densely sampled multi-band photometric follow-up of supernova (SN) 2024aecx. The SN was discovered in the spiral galaxy NGC 3521 (distance $\sim$11 Mpc) within a day after the explosion. The early spectra of SN 2024aecx show a weak signature of hydrogen lines, which disappeared in $\sim$30 days after the explosion. Light curves in all bands show a distinct feature of two peaks, and the first peak is likely due to the shock cooling emission. The early phase light curve evolution of SN 2024aecx has similarity with the typical Type IIb events, but the decay rate in different bands (e.g., $\rm \Delta m_{15}$ = 1.60 $\pm$ 0.05 mag, $g$-band) is significantly faster in the post-peak phase. It attained the secondary maximum in $\sim$19 days ($g$-band) with a peak absolute magnitude of M$_{g}$ = -17.94 $\pm$ 0.10 mag. SN 2024aecx colors trend redder in early epochs ($&lt;$8 days), followed by a duration in which it grows bluer, then later gets redder again $&gt;$20 days after explosion. The analytical model fitting to the light curves reveals an envelope mass and progenitor radii in the range of $\sim$0.03 - 0.24 $M_\odot$ and $\sim$169 - 200 $R_\odot$, respectively. Modeling of the pseudo-bolometric light curve suggests that synthesized $^{56}$Ni in the explosion was $\sim$0.15 M$_{\odot}$ with ejecta mass and kinetic energy of $\sim$0.7 M$_{\odot}$ and $\sim$0.16 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg, respectively. The observational properties and modeling indicate that the SN~2024aecx progenitor belongs to the extended progenitor category.</description>

      <title>Attributing the point symmetric structure of core-collapse supernova remnant N132D to the jittering jets explosion mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I identified a point-symmetric morphology in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) N132D, composed of two symmetry axes: the short symmetry axis extending from the northwest ear and through the center of the iron-rich emission on the other side, and the second along the long dimension of N132D and coincides with the extension of the central oxygen-rich gas to the northeast. Namely, the point-symmetry of the outer zones of CCSNR N132D correlates with that of the oxygen-rich gas near the center. The surrounding gas cannot shape the inner oxygen-rich material, implying that the point-symmetric morphology is a property of the explosion mechanism, as predicted by the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The oxygen-rich material is known to be in a torus. According to the JJEM, an energetic pair of opposite jets, more or less perpendicular to the plane of the torus, has shaped the torus; this pair is along the short symmetry axis. Another energetic pair, perpendicular to the first one, shaped the elongated, large-scale structure of CCSNR N132D. I discuss how the JJEM accounts for two perpendicular pairs of jets and the unequal jets in each pair. CCSNR N132D is the fifteenth CCSNR with an identified point-symmetric morphology attributed to the JJEM. Because the neutrino-driven mechanism cannot explain such morphologies, this study further strengthens the claim that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bayesian analysis of kilonovae and gamma ray burst afterglows with fiesta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows and kilonovae (KNe) are electromagnetic transients that can accompany binary neutron star (BNS) mergers. Therefore, studying their emission processes is of general interest for constraining cosmological parameters or the behavior of ultra-dense matter. One common method to analyze electromagnetic data from BNS mergers is to sample a Bayesian posterior over the parameters of a physical model for the transient. However, sampling the posterior is computationally costly and because of the many likelihood evaluations required in this process, detailed models are too expensive to be used directly in Bayesian inference. In this paper, we address the problem by introducing fiesta, a python package to train machine learning (ML) surrogates for GRB afterglow and kilonova models that have the capacity to accelerate likelihood evaluations. Specifically, we introduce extensive ML surrogates for the state-of-the-art GRB afterglow models afterglowpy and pyblastafterglow, along with a new surrogate for KN emission based on the possis code. Our surrogates enable evaluation of the light-curve posterior within minutes. We also provide built-in posterior sampling capabilities in fiesta that rely on the flowMC package, which efficiently scale to higher dimensions when adding up to tens of nuisance sampling parameters. Because of its use of the JAX framework, fiesta also allows for GPU acceleration during both surrogate training and posterior sampling. We applied our framework to reanalyze AT2017gfo/GRB170817A and GRB211211A with our surrogates, thus employing the new pyblastafterglow model for the first time in Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>Propagation of Precessing Jet in Envelope of Tidal Disruption Events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is likely that the disk of a tidal disruption event (TDE) is misaligned with respect to the equatorial plane of the spinning supermassive black hole (SMBH), since the initial stellar orbit before disruption is most likely has an inclined orbital plane. Such misaligned disk undergoes Lense-Thirring precession around the SMBH spin axis, leading to a precessing jet if launched in the vicinity of the SMBH and aligned with the disk angular momentum. The bound debris can also build a thick envelope which powers optical emission. In this work, we study the propagation of the precessing jet in the TDE envelope. We adopt a ''zero-Bernoulli accretion'' (ZEBRA) envelope model. A episodic jet will be observed if the line of sight is just at the envelope pole direction and $\theta_{\rm LT}=\theta_{\rm env}$, since the jet can freely escape from this low density rotation funnel, where $\theta_{\rm LT}$ and $\theta_{\rm env}$ are the jet precessing angle and the angle between the envelope polar axis and the SMBH spin axis, respectively. The jet will be choked at other directions. For $\theta_{\rm LT} &lt; \theta_{\rm env}$, the jets can also break out of the envelope for very small precession angle $\theta_{\rm LT}$ or if the jet is aligned with SMBH spin. If the jet is choked within the envelope, the radiation produced during cocoon shock breakout will imprint characteristic signatures on the X-ray emission, such as low-amplitude fluctuation in the light curve.</description>

      <title>Beyond Hierarchical Mergers: Accretion-Driven Origins of Massive, Highly Spinning Black Holes in Dense Star Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GW231123, the most massive binary black hole (BBH) merger detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, highlights the need to understand the origins of massive, high-spin stellar black holes (BHs). Dense star clusters provide natural environments for forming such systems, beyond the limits of standard massive star evolution to core collapse. While repeated BBH mergers can grow BHs through dynamical interactions (the so-called "hierarchical merger" channel), most star clusters with masses $\lesssim 10^6\,M_\odot$ have escape speeds too low to retain higher-generation BHs, limiting growth into or beyond the mass gap. In contrast, BH--star collisions with subsequent accretion of the collision debris can grow and retain BHs irrespective of the cluster escape speed. Using $N$-body (Cluster Monte Carlo) simulations, we study BH growth and spin evolution through this process and we find that accretion can drive BH masses up to at least $\sim200\,M_\odot$, with spins set by the details of the growth history. BHs up to about $150\,M_\odot$ can reach dimensionless spins $\chi \gtrsim 0.7$ via single coherent episodes, while more massive BHs form through multiple stochastic accretion events and eventually spin down to $\chi \lesssim 0.4$. These BHs later form binaries through dynamical encounters, producing BBH mergers that contribute up to $\sim10\%$ of all detectable events, comparable to predictions for the hierarchical channel. However, the two pathways predict distinct signatures: hierarchical mergers yield more unequal mass ratios, whereas accretion-grown BHs preferentially form near-equal-mass binaries. The accretion-driven channel allows dense clusters with low escape speeds, such as globular clusters, to produce highly spinning BBHs with both components in or above the mass gap, providing a natural formation pathway to GW231123-like systems.</description>

      <title>Detection of Compton scattering in the jet of 3C 84</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3C 84 is the brightest cluster galaxy in the Perseus Cluster. It is among the closest radio-loud active galaxies and among the very few that can be detected from low frequency radio up to TeV $\gamma$-rays. Here we report on the first X-ray polarization observation of 3C~84 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, for a total of 2.2 Msec that coincides with a flare in $\gamma$-rays. This is the longest observation for a radio-loud active galaxy that allowed us to reach unprecedented sensitivity, leading to the detection of an X-ray polarization degree of $\rm\Pi_X=4.2\pm1.3\%$ ($\sim3.2\sigma$ confidence) at an X-ray electric vector polarization angle of $\rm \psi_X=163^{\circ}\pm9^{\circ}$, that is aligned with the radio jet direction on the sky. Optical polarization observations show fast variability about the jet axis as well. Our results strongly favor models in which X-rays are produced by Compton scattering from relativistic electrons -- specifically Synchrotron Self-Compton -- that takes places downstream, away from the supermassive black hole.</description>

      <title>Origin and Evolution of the $\Omega$ Structure in the Head-Tail Radio Galaxy of Abell 3322</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A head-tail galaxy is thought to be a radio galaxy with bent active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets interacting with the intracluster medium (ICM). Study of head-tail galaxies provides us with fruitful insights into the mechanisms of shock waves and turbulence, as well as magnetic-field amplification and cosmic-ray acceleration. A recent MeerKAT observation revealed that a head-tail galaxy in the galaxy cluster, Abell 3322, exhibits a peculiar ``Omega" structure in its shape. In this paper, we investigated this Omega-tail galaxy using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We found that the southern jet tends to be brighter than the northern jet, with a brightness ratio of about 2. This can be attributed to Doppler boost and the inclination of the jets. Our broadband data suggest that the radio spectrum becomes steeper along the jet propagation direction, and the cosmic-ray aging model with a weak reacceleration of cosmic rays is preferable to explain the index profile. We further found a gradient of the spectral index perpendicular to the jet propagation. We discussed the origin of the gradient and suggested that a shock wave along one side of the jets is present. The resultant ram pressure as well as the backflow made at the early stage of the jet may produce the tail component of this Omega-tail galaxy, while the observed Omega-shape structure is more likely due to a twin vortex seen in the low Reynolds number flow.</description>

      <title>Recoil-Enabled Energy Transfer from Coherent Neutrino Scattering in Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit neutrino-matter coupling in the post-shock region of core-collapse supernovae by restoring nuclear recoil in coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS). The resulting local energy transfer (a few keV per ~10 MeV neutrino) accumulates across the ~100 km stalled-shock layer, yielding a total heating of 10^49-10^50 erg, comparable within an order of magnitude to the increment required to trigger shock revival in current multidimensional simulations. This indicates that the long-standing failure of isoenergetic transport schemes to revive the shock originates from their neglect of recoil kinematics. Because the momentum exchange in each scattering is tiny, the emergent neutrino spectra and lepton-number balance remain essentially unchanged. The result highlights nuclear recoil as a minimal yet physically grounded correction to standard neutrino transport, providing a self-consistent route toward reliable explosion modeling.</description>

Abstract: Dark matter (DM) annihilation can be significantly enhanced through narrow resonances or the Sommerfeld enhancement effect, with both mechanisms potentially combining in a super-resonant annihilation process. In such scenarios, the conventional assumption that kinetic equilibrium persists until chemical decoupling may not hold, leading to substantial impacts on the final DM relic density. However, a strongly enhanced annihilation cross section into Standard Model particles, except neutrinos, is constrained by cosmic microwave background observations. We thus investigate DM annihilation into neutrino pair final states, focusing on the role of kinetic decoupling. We solve the coupled Boltzmann equations to determine the relic density and constrain the parameter space using current experimental data, while also forecasting the sensitivity of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Detecting Gravitational Waves from Exoplanets Orbiting Binary Neutron Stars with B-DECIGO and DECIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17385</link>

Abstract: The first detection of a gravitational-wave (GW) signal in 2015 has opened a new observational window to probe the universe. This probe can not only reveal previously inaccessible binaries, black holes, and other compact objects, but also can detect exoplanets through their imprint on GW signals, thereby significantly extend current exoplanet surveys. To date, nearly 6000 exoplanets have been confirmed, yet most of them reside either in the solar neighbourhood or along the sightline toward the Galactic bulge, reflecting the range limits of traditional electromagnetic techniques. In this work, we follow the method proposed in N.Tamanini&amp;C.Danielski(2019) to investigate frequency modulations in GW signals from early-stage binary neutron stars (BNSs) induced by circumbinary planets (CBPs) and obtain that CBPs can be detected by the future space-borne detector DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO). For BNS system with the masses of two components both being 1.4 $M_{\odot}$, DECIGO could detect CBPs with mass being dozens of times that of Jupiter out to distances of $\sim 1$ Gpc, well beyond the Local Supercluster, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study planetary formation and evolution for the post main-sequence stage.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of the Neutron Star Equation of State and Model Comparison: Insights from PSR J0437+4715, PSR J0614+3329, and Other Multi-Physics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07109</link>

Abstract: We perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) using a wide range of terrestrial and astrophysical data. The terrestrial inputs include quantities related to symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) and symmetry energy up to two times saturation density ($\rho_0\sim$0.16 fm$^{-3}$), derived from finite nuclei and heavy-ion collisions (HICs). The astrophysical constraints incorporate NS radii and tidal deformabilities from recent NICER observations and GW170817, respectively. We consider five different EoS models: Taylor, $n/3$, Skyrme, RMF, and sound speed(CS), are analyzed by sequentially updating the priors with (i) $\chi$EFT based pure neutron matter, (ii) terrestrial, empirical and earlier astrophysical data, (iii) case (ii) including NICER radii of PSR J0437+4715 and J0614+3329, (iv) all data combined, and (v) excluding empirical nuclear inputs. We also perform Bayesian model comparison which favors the Skyrme model under all combined data (scenario (iv)), yielding tight constraints on symmetry energy parameters: $L_0 = 56 \pm 3$~MeV, $K_{\mathrm{sym}0} = -132 \pm 15$~MeV and also on SNM parameters: $K_0 = 265 \pm 12$~MeV, $Q_0 = -366 \pm 43$~MeV. The mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability posterior distributions are also well constrained. The radius and tidal deformability of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star are found to be $R_{1.4} = 11.85 \pm 0.11$~km and $\Lambda_{1.4} = 354 \pm 25$, respectively.</description>
