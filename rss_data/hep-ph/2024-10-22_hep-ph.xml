      <title>Advancing Physics Data Analysis through Machine Learning and Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era increasingly focused on green computing and explainable AI, revisiting traditional approaches in theoretical and phenomenological particle physics is paramount. This project evaluates various machine learning (ML) algorithms-including Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), and XGBoost-alongside standard neural networks and a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for physics data analysis. We apply these techniques to a binary classification task that distinguishes the experimental viability of simulated scenarios based on Higgs observables and essential parameters. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to showcase the capabilities and computational efficiency of each model in binary classification tasks, thereby contributing to the ongoing discourse on integrating ML and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) into physics research. In this study, XGBoost emerged as the preferred choice among the evaluated machine learning algorithms for its speed and effectiveness, especially in the initial stages of computation with limited datasets. However, while standard Neural Networks and Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) demonstrated superior performance in terms of accuracy and adherence to physical laws, they require more computational time. These findings underscore the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model sophistication.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Precision of Signal Correction in PVES Experiments: The Impact of Bayesian Analysis on the Results of the QWeak and MOLLER Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise measurement of parity-violating asymmetries in parity-violating electron scattering experiments is a powerful tool for probing new physics beyond the Standard Model. Achieving the expected precision requires both experimental and post-processing signal corrections. This includes using auxiliary detectors to distinguish the main signal from background signals and implementing post-measurement corrections, such as the Bayesian statistics method, to address uncontrolled factors during the experiments. Asymmetry values in the scattering of electrons off proton targets in QWeak and P2 and off electron targets in MOLLER are influenced by detector array configurations, beam polarization angles, and beam spin variations. The Bayesian framework refines full probabilistic models to account for all necessary factors, thereby extracting asymmetry values and the underlying physics under specified conditions. For the QWeak experiment, a reanalysis of the inelastic asymmetry measurement using the Bayesian method has yielded a closer fit to measured asymmetries, with uncertainties reduced by 40\% compared to the Monte Carlo minimization method. This approach was successfully applied to simulated data for the MOLLER experiment and is predicted to be similarly effective in P2.</description>

      <title>Photon conversion to axions and dark photons in magnetized plasmas: a finite-temperature field theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some of the most stringent constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM) arise from considerations of particle emission from astrophysical plasmas. However, many studies assume that particle production occurs in an isotropic plasma environment. This condition is rarely (if ever) met in astrophysical settings, for instance due to the ubiquitous presence of magnetic fields. In anisotropic plasmas, the equations of motion are not diagonal in the usual polarization basis of transverse and longitudinal modes, causing a mixing of these modes and breaking the degeneracy in the dispersion relation of the two transverse modes. This behavior is captured by a $3\times3$ mixing matrix $\pi^{IJ}$, determined by projecting the response tensor of the plasma $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$ into mode space, whose eigenvectors and eigenvalues are related to the normal modes and their dispersion relations. In this work, we provide a general formalism for determining the normal modes of propagation that are coupled to axions and dark photons in an anisotropic plasma. As a key part of this formalism, we present detailed derivations of $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$ for magnetized plasmas in the long-wavelength limit using the real-time formalism of finite-temperature field theory. We provide analytic approximations for the normal modes and their dispersion relations assuming various plasma conditions that are relevant to astrophysical environments. These approximations will allow for a systematic exploration of the effects of plasma anisotropy on BSM particle production.</description>

      <title>Experimental targets for dark photon dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight dark photon dark matter features distinctive cosmological and astrophysical signatures and is also supported by a burgeoning direct-detection program searching for its kinetic mixing with the ordinary photon over a wide mass range. Dark photons, however, cannot necessarily constitute the dark matter in all of this parameter space. In minimal models where the dark photon mass arises from a dark Higgs mechanism, early Universe dynamics can easily breach the regime of validity of the low-energy effective theory for a massive vector field. In the process, the dark sector can collapse into a cosmic string network, precluding dark photons as viable dark matter. We establish the general conditions under which dark photon production avoids significant backreaction on the dark Higgs and identify regions of parameter space that naturally circumvent these constraints. After surveying implications for known dark photon production mechanisms, we propose novel models that set well-motivated experimental targets across much of the accessible parameter space. We also discuss complementary cosmological and astrophysical signatures that can probe the dark sector physics responsible for dark photon production.</description>

      <title>Axion effects on gamma-ray spectral irregularities. II: EBL absorption models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore how the extragalactic background light (EBL) absorption effect influences the photon to axionlike particle (ALP) conversions from the very-high-energy gamma-ray spectral irregularities. For our analysis, we select two well-known BL Lac blazars: Markarian 421 and Markarian 501 with their low and well-defined redshifts $z_0=0.031$ and 0.034, respectively. Their gamma-ray data are recently measured by Fermi-LAT and HAWC with the 1038 days of exposure from 2015 June to 2018 July. We first discuss the EBL absorption effect on the gamma-ray spectral energy distributions by using three common EBL spectral models: Franceschini-08, Finke-10, and Gilmore-12. Then we consider the photon-ALP conversions in the astrophysical magnetic fields. Under the ALP assumption with the parameter space of $\{m_a, g_{a\gamma}\}$, we calculate the best-fit chi-square distribution of the EBL models and define a new delta chi-square $\chi_d^2$ to quantify the chi-square difference. Our results show that the impact from these different EBL spectral models are non-dominated at the low-redshift gamma-ray axionscope.</description>

      <title>Type-II Seesaw Higgs triplet productions and decays at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Type-II Seesaw Model provides an attractive scenario to account for Majorana-neutrino masses. Its extended Higgs sector, if sufficiently light, can have a rich and distinctive phenomenology at the LHC while yielding automatically an essentially Standard-Model-Higgs-like state. Several phenomenological studies have been devoted to the scalar sector of this model, as well as experimental searches focusing mostly on the (doubly-)charged states. In this paper we present an exhaustive study of the main production and decay channels of all the non-standard scalar states originating from the $SU(2)_L$ doublet and a complex triplet of the model. We stick to scenarios where lepton-number-violating decays are suppressed, for which present experimental limits are still weak, highlighting theoretical parameter sensitivities that were not previously emphasized in the literature and the uncertainties they can induce for the experimental searches at the LHC. A comprehensive classification of the various cascade decays and corresponding Standard Model particle multiplicities is provided. As an illustration, a detailed prospective search study at the LHC with an ATLAS-like detector is carried out on some benchmark points, for charged, doubly-charged, and, for the first time, neutral state productions</description>

      <title>A systematical study of the nucleon form factors with the pion cloud effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic and gravitational form factors of the nucleon are studied simultaneously using a covariant quark-diquark approach, and the pion cloud effect on the form factors is explicitly discussed. In this study, the electromagnetic form factors are first calculated to determine the parameters of our approach. Then, the gravitational form factors of the nucleon are evaluated with the same parameters and the cloud effect is addressed. The mechanical properties, including mass radii, energy densities, and spin distributions, are shown and discussed.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Heavy Quark Expansion for $b\to cl\bar{\nu}$ to Higher Order in $1/m_b$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) is the major tool to perform calculations for inclusive semileptonic $B\to X_cl\bar{\nu}$ and, consequently, for precision determinations of the CKM matrix element $V_{cb}$. To further improve precision, we pushed the expansion to $1/m_b^5$ to include even higher order terms in the HQE. Notably, at $1/m_b^5$, ``intrinsic charm'' (IC) contributions proportional to $1/(m_b^3m_c^2)$ occur, which are numerically expected to be sizeable. We will therefore firstly discuss the determination of a reduced set of HQE parameters at $1/m_b^5$, employing Reparametrisation Invariance (RPI) to this end. Consequently, we will show how the IC and ``genuine" $1/m_b^5$ contribute to the different kinematical moments of $B\to X_cl\bar{\nu}$, focusing in this work on the lepton energy $E_l$ moments. Using the ``lowest-lying state saturation ansatz'' (LLSA), we estimate the size of these contributions and observe a partial cancellation between the IC and ``genuine'' $1/m_b^5$ contributions, leading to an overall small contribution.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Properties of Double-Strangeness Molecular Tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in the study of $K^{(*)} \bar K^{(*)}$ molecular tetraquarks and the $H$-dibaryon, we focus on the mass spectra and electromagnetic properties of $\bar K^{(*)} \bar K^{(*)}$ systems, which exhibit exotic flavor quantum number of $ss\bar q \bar q$. A dynamical analysis is performed using the one-boson-exchange model to describe the effective interactions for these systems, accounting for both $S$-$D$ wave mixing and coupled-channel effects. By solving the coupled-channel Schr$\ddot{\rm o}$dinger equation, we identify the $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $\bar K \bar K^*$ and $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $\bar K^* \bar K^*$ states as the most likely candidates for double-strangeness molecular tetraquarks. In addition, we investigate their magnetic moments and M1 radiative decay width, shedding light on their inner structures within the constituent quark model framework. Finally, we encourage experimentalists to focus on these predicted double-strangeness molecular tetraquark candidates, particularly in $B$ meson decays, by analyzing the $\bar K \bar K \pi$ invariant mass spectrum. Such efforts could pave the way for establishing the molecular tetraquark states in the light-quark sector.</description>

      <title>Chromopolarizability of charm-beauty quarkonium from $B_c(2S) \rightarrow B_c\pi\pi$ transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chromopolarizability of a charm-beauty quarkonium describes its interaction with soft gluonic fields and can be measured in the heavy quarkonium decays. Using the dispersion theory which consider the $\pi\pi$ final state interaction model-independently, we analyze the transition $B_c(2S) \rightarrow B_c\pi^+\pi^-$ and obtain the chromopolarizability $\alpha_{B_c(2S) B_c}=0.66\pm 0.25$ and the parameter $\kappa =-0.02\pm 0.13$. It is found that the transitional chromopolarizability of the $c\bar{b}$ state is intermediate between the transitional chromopolarizabilities of the $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ states. Our results could be useful in studying the interactions of charm-beauty quarkonium with light hadrons.</description>

Abstract: We present an analytic calculation of three-loop four-point Feynman integrals with two off-shell legs of equal mass. We provide solutions to the canonical differential equations of two integral families in both Euclidean and physical regions. They are validated numerically against independent computations. A total of 170 master integrals are expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms up to weight six. Most of them are computed for the first time. Our results are essential ingredients of the scattering amplitudes for equal-mass diboson production at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD at the LHC.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a family-nonuniversal Abelian extension of hypercharge, which significantly alters the phenomenological features of the standard model. Anomaly cancellation requires that the third quark family transforms differently from the first two quark families. Additionally, it acquires that three right-handed neutrinos are presented. This model generates naturally small neutrino masses and a $W$-boson mass deviation appropriate to recent measurements. Additionally, the model introduces flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) of quarks coupled to the new gauge boson $Z'$ and new Higgs fields. These FCNCs significantly modify the neutral-meson mixing amplitudes and rare meson decays, which are studied in detail. We also address flavor changing processes in the charged lepton sector.</description>

      <title>Probing the onset of hydrodynamization in peripheral p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV LHC energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we attempt to estimate the minimum size of the de-confined matter of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in a small system that could be satisfactorily modeled with low-order hydrodynamics. The elliptic flow coefficient has been studied for the variation of the second-order transport coefficient, called the shear relaxation time, which acts as a regulator of the non-hydrodynamic mode of theory. For this, we chose the small system of p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV and simulated it on the JETSCAPE framework. We modeled the soft sector dynamics using an initial condition, a pre-equilibrium stage, hydrodynamics, and a hadron afterburner. We generated results of transverse momentum spectra and rapidity spectra of light particles to match the simulated system with the experimental data. We looked at elliptic flow fluctuations for extreme values of shear relaxation time for peripheral collision centralities, whose increase indicates breakdown of fluid behavior at around $dN/dy \approx 8$ for p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV LHC energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using low redshift data on astrophysical reionization, we report new Lyman-$\alpha$ limit on axion-like particle (ALP) as cold dark matter in ALP mass range of $m_{a}\sim 30-1000$ eV. Compared to the Leo T and soft-X ray bound, this limit is so far the most stringent in the ALP mass range of $m_{a}\sim 375-425$ eV and complementary in the ALP mass range otherwise. Combing these limits, we show new exclusion limits on $m_a$ for the ALP DM from either misalignment or freeze-in mechanism.</description>

      <title>Kaons and antikaons in isospin asymmetric dense resonance matter at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the in-medium properties of kaons and antikaons in isospin asymmetric hot and dense resonance matter within the chiral SU(3) hadronic mean field model. Along with nucleons and hyperons, the interactions of $K$ and $\bar K$ mesons with all decuplet baryons ($\Delta^{++,+,0,-}, \Sigma^{*\pm,0},\Xi^{*0,-}, \Omega^{-}$) are explicitly considered in the dispersion relations. The properties of mesons in the chiral SU(3) model are modified at finite density and temperature of asymmetric resonance matter through the exchange of scalar fields $\sigma, \zeta$ and $\delta$ and the vector fields $\omega, \rho$ and $\phi$. The presence of resonance baryons in the medium at finite temperature is observed to modify significantly the effective masses of $K$ and $\bar{K}$ mesons. We also calculated the optical potentials of kaons and antikaons as a function of momentum in resonance matter. The present study of in-medium masses and optical potentials of kaons and antikaons will be important for understanding the experimental observables from the heavy-ion collision experiments where hot and dense matter may be produced. Our results indicate that when resonance baryons are present within the medium at finite baryonic density, the mass reduction of kaons and antikaons becomes more pronounced as the temperature of the medium increases from zero to 100 and 150 MeV. The study of the optical potentials of kaons and antikaons reveals a stronger correlation with strangeness fraction compared to isospin asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Non-thermal production of Higgsino dark matter by late-decaying scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-thermal production of the Higgsino dark matter (DM). Assuming that the lightest neutral Higgsino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in minimal supersymmetric standard model, we calculate the relic abundance of the Higgsino LSP produced by the decay of late-decaying scalar field. In the calculation of the relic abundance, we have properly included the effects of coannihilation as well as the non-perturbative effect (known as the Sommerfeld effect). Contrary to the case of the thermal-relic scenario, in which the observed DM abundance is realized with the Higgsino mass of ~ 1.2 TeV, Higgsino DM is possible with lighter Higgsino mass as the reheating temperature becomes lower than the Higgsino mass. The reheating temperature relevant for realizing the correct DM density is presented as a funciton of the Higgsino mass.</description>

      <title>Analysis of beyond the Standard Model resonances with effective approaches and oblique parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments have confirmed the presence of a mass gap between the Standard Model and potential New Physics. Consequently, the exploration of effective field theories to detect signals indicative of Physics Beyond the Standard Model is of great interest. In this study, we examine a non-linear realization of the electroweak symmetry breaking, wherein the Higgs is a singlet with independent couplings, and Standard Model fields are additionally coupled to heavy bosonic resonances. We present a next-to-leading-order determination of the oblique $S$ and $T$ parameters. Comparing our predictions with experimental values allows us to impose constraints on resonance masses, requiring them to exceed the TeV scale ($M_R &gt; 2\,$TeV). This finding aligns with our earlier analysis, employing a less generalized approach and the experimental bounds of that time, where we computed these observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New physics and SM parameters can be studied and constrained by looking at the modifications to top-pair differential kinematical distributions due to off-shell effects. I present here three case studies: the determination of the Higgs couplings to the top-quark, a search for generic BSM scalar and pseudoscalar states, and a search for Axion Like Particles (ALP). The corresponding models have been implemented in the $\texttt{UFO}$ format to allow automatic computations within MadGraph5_aMC@NLO.</description>

      <title>Verifying the Resonance Schemes of Unstable Particles at Lepton Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose practical ways of differentiating the various (Breit-Wigner, theoretical, and energy-dependent) resonance schemes of unstable particles at lepton colliders. First, the energy-dependent scheme can be distinguished from the other two by fitting the $Z$ lineshape scan and forward-backward asymmetries at LEP and future lepton colliders with the $Z$ mass $m_Z$, decay width $\Gamma_Z$, and coupling strength as fitting parameters. Although the Breit-Wigner and theoretical schemes work equally well, the scheme conversion requires the decay width $\Gamma_Z$ to scale inversely with $m_Z$ rather than the usual linear dependence from theoretical calculation. These contradicting behaviors can be used to distinguish the Breit-Wigner and theoretical schemes by the precision $Z$ measurements with single parameter ($m_Z$) fit at future lepton colliders. For the $WW$ threshold scan, its combination with the precise Fermi constant provides another way of distinguishing the Breit-Wigner and theoretical schemes.</description>

      <title>Exploring multi-step electroweak phase transitions in the 2HDM+$\boldsymbol{a}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple electroweak phase transitions occurring sequentially in the early universe can give rise to intriguing phenomenology, compared to the typical single-step electroweak phase transition. In this work, we investigate this scenario within the framework of the two-Higgs-doublet model with a pseudoscalar, utilizing the complete one-loop finite-temperature effective potential. After considering relevant experimental and theoretical constraints, we identify four distinct types of phase transitions. In the first case, only the configuration of the CP-even Higgs acquires a non-zero value via a first-order or a cross-over electroweak phase transition, leading to electroweak symmetry breaking. In the remaining three cases, the pseudoscalar fields can obtain vacuum expectation values at different phases of the multi-step phase transition process, leading to spontaneous breaking of the CP symmetry. As the temperature decreases, the phase shifts to the vacuum observed today via first-order electroweak phase transition, at this point, the vacuum expectation value of the pseudoscalar field returns to zero, restoring the CP symmetry. Finally, we compare the transition strength and the stochastic gravitational wave background generated in the four situations along with the projected detection limits.</description>

      <title>Constraints on new physics couplings from ${\bar B} \to D^*\,(D\,\pi)\,\ell\,{\bar \nu}_{\ell}$ angular analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Belle Collaboration has measured the complete set of angular coefficient functions for the decays ${\bar B} \to D^*\,(D\,\pi)\,\ell\,{\bar \nu}_{\ell}$, where $\ell = e,\,\mu$, in four bins of the variable $w={m_B^2+m_{D^*}^2-q^2 \over 2\, m_B\, m_{D^*}}$, with $q$ the momentum of the lepton pair. In SM this measurement is instrumental in determining the hadronic form factors in the $B \to D^*$ matrix elements of the SM weak current, thereby refining the measurement of $\lvert V_{cb} \lvert$. On the other hand, it can be used to assess the impact of possible new physics contributions. I consider an extension of the SM effective Hamiltonian that governs this mode, incorporating the complete set of Lorentz invariant $d = 6$ operators compatible with the gauge symmetry of the theory. The measured angular coefficient functions play a pivotal role in constraining the couplings in the generalized effective Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>The $\Lambda_c^+\to\eta\pi^+\Lambda$ reaction and the $\Lambda a_0^+(980)$ and $\pi^+\Lambda(1670)$ contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16078v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study from the theoretical point of view the $\Lambda_c^+\to \pi^+ \eta \Lambda$ reaction, recently measured by the Belle and BESIII Collaborations, where clear signals are observed for $a_0(980)$, $\Lambda(1670)$, and $\Sigma(1385)$ excitation. By considering the $a_0(980)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$ as dynamically generated resonances from the meson meson and meson baryon interaction, respectively, we are able to determine their relative production strength in the reaction, which is also tied to the strength of the $\pi^+ \eta \Lambda$ tree level contribution. We observe that this latter strength is very big and there are large destructive interferences between the tree level and the rescattering terms where the $a_0(980)$ and $\Lambda(1670)$ are generated. The $\Sigma(1385)$ contribution is included by means of a free parameter, the only one of the theory, up to a global normalization, when one considers only external emission, and we observe that the spin flip part of this term, usually ignored in theoretical and experimental works, plays an important role determining the shape of the mass distributions. Internal emission is also considered and it is found to play a minor role.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual quarks and gluons at small-$x$ inside an unpolarized hadron can be regarded as Bell states in which qubits in the spin and orbital angular momentum spaces are maximally entangled. Using the machinery of quantum information science, we generalize this observation to all values $0&lt;x&lt;1$ and describe gluons (but not quarks) as maximally entangled states between a qubit and a qudit. We introduce the conditional probability distribution $P(l^z|s^z)$ of a gluon's orbital angular momentum $l^z$ given its helicity $s^z$. Restricting to the three states $l^z=0,\pm 1$, which constitute a qutrit, we explicitly compute $P$ as a function of $x$</description>

      <title>Reconciling the kinematical constraint with the JIMWLK evolution equation: correlation functions non-local in rapidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the high-energy limit of DIS experiments the effective degrees of freedom of QCD are Wilson line operators. Their evolution in the rapidity variable is predicted by the set of Balitsky-JIMWLK evolution equations. We analyze a new class of two-point correlation functions of Wilson line operators where the Wilson lines are taken at different values of the rapidity variable. Such correlation functions can appear in the discussion of the kinematical constraint. We find that in the Langevin formulation of the JIMWLK equation, such correlation functions are affected by an infrared divergence. We discuss a possible regularization of this divergence and its consequences for the implementation of the kinematical constraint for the JIMWLK equation.</description>

Abstract: Some highlights of the physics case for running an $e^+e^-$ collider at 500 GeV and above are discussed with a particular emphasis on the experimental access to the Higgs potential via di-Higgs and (at sufficiently high energy) triple Higgs production. The information obtainable from Higgs pair production at about 500 GeV is compared with the prospects for the HL-LHC and with the indirect information that can be obtained from a Higgs factory running at lower energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagrammatic approaches to perturbation theory transformed the practicability of calculations in particle physics. In the case of extended theories of gravity, however, obtaining the relevant diagrammatic rules is non-trivial: we must expand in metric perturbations and around (local) minima of the scalar field potentials, make multiple field redefinitions, and diagonalize kinetic and mass mixings. In this note, we will motivate these theories, introduce the package FeynMG -- a Mathematica extension of FeynRules that automates the process described above -- and highlight an application to a model with unique collider phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Locating the QCD critical point from first principles through contours of constant entropy density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method to investigate the existence and location of the conjectured high-temperature critical point of strongly interacting matter via contours of constant entropy density. By approximating these lines as a power series in the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, one can extrapolate them from first-principle results at zero net-baryon density, and use them to locate the QCD critical point, including the associated first-order and spinodal lines. As a proof of principle, we employ currently available continuum-extrapolated first-principle results from the Wuppertal--Budapest collaboration to find a critical point at a temperature and a baryon chemical potential of $T_c = 114.3 \pm 6.9$ MeV and $\mu_{B,c} = 602.1 \pm 62.1$ MeV, respectively. We advocate for a more precise determination of the required expansion coefficients via lattice QCD simulations as a means of pinpointing the location of the critical endpoint in the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter.</description>

      <title>Hyperparameter Optimisation in Deep Learning from Ensemble Methods: Applications to Proton Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models are defined in terms of a large number of hyperparameters, such as network architectures and optimiser settings. These hyperparameters must be determined separately from the model parameters such as network weights, and are often fixed by ad-hoc methods or by manual inspection of the results. An algorithmic, objective determination of hyperparameters demands the introduction of dedicated target metrics, different from those adopted for the model training. Here we present a new approach to the automated determination of hyperparameters in deep learning models based on statistical estimators constructed from an ensemble of models sampling the underlying probability distribution in model space. This strategy requires the simultaneous parallel training of up to several hundreds of models and can be effectively implemented by deploying hardware accelerators such as GPUs. As a proof-of-concept, we apply this method to the determination of the partonic substructure of the proton within the NNPDF framework and demonstrate the robustness of the resultant model uncertainty estimates. The new GPU-optimised NNPDF code results in a speed-up of up to two orders of magnitude, a stabilisation of the memory requirements, and a reduction in energy consumption of up to 90% as compared to sequential CPU-based model training. While focusing on proton structure, our method is fully general and is applicable to any deep learning problem relying on hyperparameter optimisation for an ensemble of models.</description>

      <title>Multiparticle scalar dark matter with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than one dark sector particle transforming under the same symmetry provides one stable dark matter (DM) component which undergoes co-annihilation with the heavier particle(s) decaying to DM. Specific assumptions on the kinematics and on the coupling parameters may render the heavier component(s) stable and contribute as DM. The choices of the charges of the dark sector fields under transformation play a crucial role in the resultant phenomenology. In this paper, we systematically address the possibility of obtaining two scalar DM components under $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry. We consider both the possibilities of DM being weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) or pseudofeebly interacting massive particle (pFIMP). We elaborate upon $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetric model, confronting the relic density allowed parameter space with recent most direct and indirect search bounds and prospects. We also highlight the possible distinction of the allowed parameter space in single component and two component cases, as well as between WIMP-WIMP and WIMP-pFIMP scenarios.</description>

      <title>An upper limit to the lifetime of stellar remnants from gravitational pair production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes are assumed to decay via Hawking radiation. Recently we found evidence that spacetime curvature alone without the need for an event horizon leads to black hole evaporation. Here we investigate the evaporation rate and decay time of a non-rotating star of constant density due to spacetime curvature-induced pair production and apply this to compact stellar remnants such as neutron stars and white dwarfs. We calculate the creation of virtual pairs of massless scalar particles in spherically symmetric asymptotically flat curved spacetimes. This calculation is based on covariant perturbation theory with the quantum field representing, e.g.,\ gravitons or photons. We find that in this picture the evaporation timescale, $\tau$, of massive objects scales with the average mass density, $\rho$, as $\tau\propto\rho^{-3/2}$. The maximum age of neutron stars, $\tau\sim 10^{68}\,\text{yr}$, is comparable to that of low-mass stellar black holes. White dwarfs, supermassive black holes, and dark matter supercluster halos evaporate on longer, but also finite timescales. Neutron stars and white dwarfs decay similarly to black holes, ending in an explosive event when they become unstable. This sets a general upper limit for the lifetime of matter in the universe, which is much longer than the Hubble--Lema\^itre time. Primordial objects with densities above $\rho_\text{max} \approx 3\times 10^{53}\,\text{g/}\text{cm}^3$, however, should have dissolved by now. As a consequence, fossil remnants from a previous universe could be present in our current universe only if the recurrence time of star forming universes is smaller than about $\sim 10^{68}\,\text{years}$.</description>

      <title>Regulator-independent equations of state for neutron stars generated from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the equation of state (EoS) of a neutron star (NS) accounting for new advances. In the low energy density, $n\leq 0.1 n_s$, with $n_s$ the saturation density, we use a new pure neutron matter EoS that is regulator independent and expressed directly in terms of experimental nucleon-nucleon scattering data. In the highest-density domain our EoS's are matched with pQCD to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$. First principles of causality, thermodynamic consistency and stability are invoked to transit between these two extreme density regimes. The EoS's are further constrained by the new measurements from PREX-II and CREX on the symmetry energy ($S_0$) and its slope ($L$). In addition, we also take into consideration the recent experimental measurements of masses and radii of different NSs and tidal deformabilities. A band of allowed EoS's is then obtained. Interestingly, the resulting values within the band for $S_0$ and $L$ are restricted with remarkably narrower intervals than the input values, with $32.9\leq S_0 \leq 39.5~\text{MeV}$ and $ 37.3 \leq L\leq 69.0~\text{MeV}$ at the 68\% CL. The band of EoS's constructed also allows possible phase transitions (PTs) for NS masses above 2.1~$M_\odot$ at 68\% CL for $n&gt;2.5n_s$. We find both long and short coexistence regions during the PT, corresponding to first and second order PTs, respectively. We also generate the band of EoS's when excluding the astrophysical observables. This is of interest to test General Relativity and modified theories of gravity. Our band of EoS's for NSs can be also used to study other NS properties and dark matter capture in NS.</description>

      <title>Dark matter searches at BESIII</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) is a new type of invisible matter introduced to explain various features of recent astrophysical observations, including galaxy rotation curves and other fundamental characteristics of our universe. DM may couple to ordinary matter via portals, which open up possibilities for new particles, such as axion-like particle, light Higgs boson, dark photon, and spin-1/2 fermions. If the masses of these particles lie in the MeV to GeV range, they can be explored by high-intensity electron-positron collider experiments, such as the BESIII experiment. BESIII has accumulated a huge amount of datasets at several energy points, including the $J/\psi$, $\psi(3686)$, and $\psi(3770)$ resonances. BESIII has recently explored the possibility for axion-like particle and light Higgs boson through radiative $J/\psi$ decays, dark photon via the initial-state radiation process, and a massless dark photon in $\Lambda_c$ decays. This report highlights the latest results from the BESIII experiment on these topics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15122v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-production and single-production of $W$ bosons provide many opportunities to look for new physics via precision measurements, for instance via scrutinising the involved triple-gauge vertices or by measuring CKM matrix elements in an environment very complementary to $B$ hadron decays. This contribution presents the ongoing work based on full simulation of the ILD concept, exploiting the O($10^8$) $W$ bosons produced during the $250$\,GeV stage of the ILC, as well as the CLD concept proposed for the FCC-ee. The projections, which also contribute to two focus topics of the current ECFA study on future Higgs/Top/Electroweak factories, promise improvements of the measurement precision of TGCs and the CKM matrix, respectively, of one to two orders of magnitude with respects to LEP.</description>

      <title>Pair momentum dependence of tilted source in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In non-central heavy-ion collisions, the particle-emitting source can be tilted away from the beam direction, an effect that becomes particularly significant at collision energies of a few GeV and lower. This phenomenon, manifest itself in many observables such as directed flow, polarization, and vorticity, is therefore important to investigate. In this paper, we study the consistency between the tilt extracted directly from the freeze-out distribution of pions and the tilt parameter obtained using the azimuthally sensitive femtoscopy (asHBT) method. Using the UrQMD model, we demonstrate a strong dependence of the tilt parameter extracted with asHBT on the momentum of the particle pair. Considering the experimental challenges in accessing low particle momenta - where the tilt parameter extracted with asHBT closely matches the tilt of the freeze-out distribution of pions - we propose an exponential extrapolation method to obtain the tilt of the entire freeze-out distribution. This approach aims to enhance the accuracy of experimental measurements of tilt in non-central heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Electron-hole pair production in graphene for two arbitrarily polarized electric fields with a time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The momentum distributions of electron-hole (EH) pair production in graphene for two arbitrarily polarized electric fields with a time delay are investigated employing a massless quantum kinetic equation and compared with the results obtained in electron-positron (EP) pair production from vacuum. For a single elliptically polarized electric field, the momentum distributions of created EH and EP pairs are similar in multiphoton absorption region. However, for two co-directional linearly polarized electric fields with a time delay and no field frequency, the momentum distribution of created EH pairs exhibits ring patterns, which is not present in EP pair production. For two circularly polarized fields with identical or opposite handedness, the momentum distributions of created EH pairs also show Ramsey interference and spiral structures, respectively. Different from EP pair production, the spiral structures are insensitive to the number of oscillation cycles in electric field pulses. For two elliptically polarized fields with same-sign or opposite-sign ellipticity, the momentum distributions of EH pairs are much more insensitive to ellipticity than those in EP pair production. These results provide further theoretical reference for simulating the EP pair production from vacuum in solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Towards an update of the ILD ZHH analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double Higgs-strahlungs process $e^+e^- \rightarrow ZHH$ allows to access the Higgs self-coupling at center-of-mass energies above $450$ GeV. Its cross-section exhibits a very different behavior as a function of the value of the self-coupling than fusion-type processes like gluon-gluon fusion at LHC (and future hadron colliders) and $WW$ / $ZZ$ fusion at higher energy lepton colliders. Therefore it adds unique information to the picture, in particular should the value of the Higgs self-coupling differ from its Standard Model prediction. The last full evaluation of the potential of the ILC to measure this process is more than ten years old, and since then many of the reconstruction tools have received very significant improvements. This contribution presents the ongoing work in the ILD collaboration to update the ZHH projections for the next European Particle Physics Strategy Update.</description>

      <title>Test of $T$-invariance in scattering of polarized protons on tensor-polarized deuterons at energies of the NICA SPD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of violation of $T$-invariance, provided that $P$-parity is preserved, is given by the total cross section of the interaction of a vector-polarized particle with a tensor-polarized target. A formalism for calculating this effect developed previously and based on the spin-dependent Glauber theory of elastic $pd$ scattering is used here to calculate the effect under discussion in the range of collision energies corresponding to the invariant mass of the $pN$ system $\sqrt{s_{pN}}=5$--$30$ GeV. The spin-dependent amplitudes of elastic $pN$ scattering required for this calculation are taken from existing phenomenological models for $pN$ scattering in the energy region considered.</description>

      <title>The Maximal Gravitational Wave Signal from Asteroid-Mass Primordial Black Hole Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes can be the entirety of the dark matter in a broad, approximately five-orders-of-magnitude-wide mass range, the ``asteroid mass range'', between $10^{-16}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- where constraints originate from evaporation -- and $10^{-11}\ M_{\rm Sun}$ -- from microlensing. A direct detection in this mass range is very challenging with any known observational or experimental methods. Here we point out that, unlike previously asserted in the literature, a transient gravitational wave signal from the inspiral phase of light black hole mergers is in principle detectable with current and future high-frequency gravitational wave detectors, including but not limited to ADMX. The largest detection rates are associated with binaries from non-monochromatic mass functions in early-formed three-body systems.</description>

      <title>Quark mass effects in octet baryon magnetic polarisabilities via lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quark mass dependence of octet baryon magnetic polarisabilities is examined at the level of individual quark-sector contributions in the uniform background-field approach of lattice QCD. The aim is to understand the direct impact of increasing the mass of a quark flavour on the magnetic polarisability and indirect or environmental effects associated with changing the mass of spectator quarks, insensitive to the background magnetic field. Noting the need to set the electric charge of some quark flavours to zero, a fractionally charged baryon formalism is introduced. We find that increasing the mass of the charged quark flavour directly causes its contribution to the magnetic polarisability to decrease. However, increasing the mass of the spectator quark flavour indirectly acts to increase the magnetic polarisability. To gain a deeper understanding of these effects, we evaluate the predictions of the constituent quark model in this context. While the model provides a compelling explanation for the environmental effect of varying the spectator quark mass, an explanation of the direct mass dependence is more complicated as competing factors combine in the final result. The lattice results indicate the key factor is a reduction in the constituent quark magnetic moment with increasing quark mass, as it governs the strength of the magnetic transition to the nearby decuplet baryon.</description>

      <title>Heavy Quarkonium-nuclear bound states within a generalized linear sigma model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate the binding energies of charmonium ($J/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$, $\psi(1D)$, $\chi_{c0}$, $\chi_{c1}$, $\chi_{c2}$) and bottomonium ($\Upsilon(1S)$, $\Upsilon(2S)$, $\Upsilon_2(1D)$, $\chi_{b0}$, $\chi_{b1}$, $\chi_{b2}$) states bound in various nuclei (${\rm{^{4}He}}$, ${\rm{^{12}C}}$, ${\rm{^{16}O}}$, ${\rm{^{40}Ca}}$, ${\rm{^{90}Zr}}$, and ${\rm{^{208}Pb}}$) using the quarkonia-nuclei potentials obtained from their mass shifts in nuclear matter within the generalized linear sigma model. In the absence of light partons in heavy quarkonia, at the tree level, the medium modifications are driven by the gluon condensate, which is simulated within this model through a scalar dilaton field, $\chi$, by introducing broken scale invariance of QCD. Our study shows that charmonium states bind more deeply with the atomic nuclei as compared to bottomonium states, providing a better probe for nuclear medium effects. Such bound states' investigations are particularly interesting for the upcoming J-PARC-E29, $\rm{\bar{P}ANDA}$@FAIR, and CEBAF@JLab experiments. The mass shifts of the heavy quarkonium states in hot isospin asymmetric nuclear matter are investigated and are observed to receive an appreciable medium modification. These medium effects are anticipated at FAIR@GSI, where such neutron-rich hot nuclear matter is expected to be produced.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the construction of the renormalized trace $\Theta$ of the Energy-Momentum tensor in the four-dimensional $\lambda\phi^4$ theory,using dimensional regularization in $d=4-\ve$ dimensions. We first construct several basic correlators such as $\braket{\phi^2 \phi\phi}$, $\braket{\phi^4 \phi \phi}$ to order $\lambda^2$ and from these the correlators $\braket{K_I \phi \phi}$ and $\braket{K_I K_J}$ with $K_I$ the basis of dimension $d$ operators. We then match the limit of their expressions on the Wilson-Fisher fixed point to the corresponding expressions obtained in Conformal Field Theory. Then, using the 3-point function $\braket{\Theta\phi\phi}$, we construct the operator $\Theta$ as a certain linear combination of the basis operators, using the requirements that $\Theta$ should vanish on the fixed point and that it should have zero anomalous dimension. Finally, we compute the 2-point function $\braket{\Theta\Theta}$ and we show that it obeys an eigenvalue equation that gives additional information about the internal structure of the Energy-Momentum tensor operator to what is already contained in its Callan-Symanzik equation.</description>

      <title>The $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338)$ pentaquark and its partners in the molecular picture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.11144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LHCb collaboration has detected a new hidden-charm pentaquark with the quantum numbers of a $\Lambda$ baryon: the $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338)$. This pentaquark will be interpreted as a $\bar{D}_s \Lambda_c$-$\bar{D} \Xi_c$ resonance within a contact-range theory. Here we briefly comment on the relation of the new $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338)$ with the $P^{\Lambda}_{\psi s}(4459)$. We find that the $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4338)$ and $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}(4459)$ both accept a common description in terms of the same parameters, which predicts the existence of a few additional $P_{\psi}^N$, $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}$, $P_{\psi s}^{\Sigma}$ and $P_{\psi s s}^{\Xi}$ molecular pentaquarks composed of a charmed antimeson and an antitriplet charmed baryon. The most robust of these predicted pentaquarks is a $P_{\psi s}^{\Lambda}$ with a mass in the $(4235-4255)\,{\rm MeV}$ range, while other two interesting ones are a $P_{\psi}^{N}(4150)$ and a $P_{\psi}^{\Sigma}(4335)$, the latter basically at the same mass as the $P_{\psi}^{\Lambda}(4338)$, with which it might mix owing to isospin symmetry breaking effects.</description>

Abstract: We argue that dual singlets accommodate the thermal leptogenesis in the context of metastable supersymmetry breaking. This framework suggests that the reheating temperature is as low as O(10^4) GeV, and besides the neutrino masses, solely induced from the dual fermions, are present at O(0.1) eV. We also expect that the unstable gravitino, though long-lived, may cause a clear signal of the neutrino flux at O(10) MeV.</description>

Abstract: The nature of the $P_{c}(4312)$, $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$ pentaquarks is a fascinating theoretical question. Within the molecular picture their more usual interpretation is that of $I=\tfrac{1}{2}$ $\bar{D} \Sigma_c$ and $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ bound states. Here we argue in favor of interpreting the $P_c(4457)$ pentaquark as a $I=\tfrac{3}{2}$ $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c$ bound state (with spin $J=\tfrac{1}{2}$) instead. Owing to isospin symmetry breaking effects, with this identification the partial decay width of the $P_c(4457)^+$ into $J/\psi p$ will be of the same order of magnitude as the $P_{c}(4312)^+$ and $P_c(4440)^+$, in contrast with the considerably larger partial decay width in the $I=\tfrac{1}{2}$ scenario. In turn, this leads to a different hidden-charm molecular pentaquark spectrum, in which there are only four or five $P_{\psi}^N$ bound states instead of the usual seven, which might explain why the predicted $J=\tfrac{1}{2}$ and $\tfrac{3}{2}$ ($I=\tfrac{1}{2}$) $\bar{D}^* \Sigma_c^*$ molecular partners of the $P_c(4312)$ and $P_c(4440)$ have not been observed.</description>

      <title>Large lepton number violation at colliders: predictions from the minimal linear seesaw mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small neutrino masses can be sourced by a tiny vacuum expectation value of a leptophilic Higgs doublet, and mediated by Quasi-Dirac heavy neutrinos. In such simplest linear seesaw picture the neutrino mass mediators can be accessible to colliders. We describe novel charged Higgs and heavy neutrino production mechanisms that can be sizeable at $e^+ e^-$, $e^- \gamma$, $pp$, or muon colliders and discuss some of the associated signatures. The oscillation length of the heavy neutrino mediators is directly related to the light neutrino mass ordering. Moreover, lepton number violation can be large despite the smallness of neutrino masses, and may shed light on the Majorana nature of neutrinos and the significance of basic symmetries in weak interaction.</description>

      <title>Heavy- and light-flavor symmetry partners of the $T_{cc}^+(3875)$, the $X(3872)$ and the $X(3960)$ from light-meson exchange saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectrum of the charmed meson-(anti)meson system is a fundamental tool for disentangling the nature of a few exotic hadrons, including the recently discovered $T_{cc}^+(3875)$ tetraquark, the $X(3960)$, or the $X(3872)$, the nature of which is still not clear after almost two decades of its discovery. Here we consider that the charmed meson-(anti)meson short-range interaction is described by the exchange of light-mesons ($\sigma$, $\rho$, $\omega$). The effects of light-meson exchanges are recast into a simple contact-range theory by means of a saturation procedure, resulting in a compact description of the two-hadron interaction. From this, if the $T_{cc}^+$ were to be an isoscalar $D^* D$ molecule, then there should exist an isoscalar $J=1$ $D^* D^*$ partner, as constrained by heavy-quark spin symmetry. Yet, within our model, the most attractive two charmed meson configurations are the isovector $J=0$ $D^* D^*$ molecule and its sextet $D_s^* D^*$ and $D_s^* D_s^*$ flavor partners. Finally, we find a tension between the molecular descriptions of the $T_{cc}^+$ and that of the $X(3872)$ and $X(3960)$, where most parameter choices suggest that if the $T_{cc}^+$ is purely molecular then the $X(3872)$ overbinds (or conversely, if the $X(3872)$ is a molecule the $T_{cc}^+$ does not bind). This might be consequential for determining the nature of these states.</description>

      <title>Molecular charmed baryons and pentaquarks from light-meson exchange saturation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectrum of the $c qq$ baryons contains a few states whose nature is not clearly a three-quark composite and which might have a sizable baryon-meson component. Examples include the $\Sigma_c(2800)$ or the $\Lambda_c(2940)$. Here we explore the spectrum of two-body systems composed of a light, octet baryon and a charmed meson (or antimeson) within a simple contact-range theory in which the couplings are saturated by light-meson exchanges. This results in the prediction of a series of composite anticharmed pentaquarks ($\bar{c} q qqq $) and singly-charmed baryons ($c \bar{q} qqq $). Among the later we find $J=\tfrac{1}{2}$ $\Xi D$ and $J=\tfrac{3}{2}$ $\Xi D^*$ bound states with masses matching those of the recently observed $\Omega_c(3185)$ and $\Omega_c(3327)$ baryons.</description>

      <title>HNL see-saw: lower mixing limit and pseudodegenerate state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy Neutral Leptons are popular hypothetical particles, first introduced as a way to explain neutrino oscillations, and since then extensively studied in relation to many other aspects of physics beyond the Standard Model. They also serve as viable targets for direct experimental searches, being effectively described only by HNL mass and mixing with each neutrino flavor. Motivated by this, we study the lower theoretical boundary for mixing with a specified flavor in two and three HNLs cases. We find the connection of this limit with the effective neutrino mass appearing in neutrinoless double beta decay (and similar expressions for mixing with muon and tau neutrino). In two HNLs case, there is a rather strict relation between mixing of different HNLs with the same neutrino flavor. We find that existing exclusion regions and their expected expansions in the near future are all described by a certain limit. We call that limit pseudodegenerate and find its relation to the symmetrical limit, already studied in the literature. We also study pseudodegenerate limit and conditions under which it is achieved in three HNLs case.</description>

      <title>Modular binary octahedral symmetry for flavor structure of Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the modular binary octahedral group $2O$ as a flavor symmetry to explain the structure of Standard Model. The vector-valued modular forms in all irreducible representations of this group are constructed. We have classified all possible fermion masses models based on the modular binary octahedral group $2O$. A comprehensive numerical analysis is performed, and we present some benchmark quark/lepton masses models in well agreement with the experimental data. Notably we find a minimal modular invariant model for leptons and quarks, which is able to explain simultaneously the masses and mixing parameters of both quarks and leptons in terms of 14 real free parameters including the modulus $\tau$. The fermion mass hierarchies around the vicinity of the modular fixed points are explored.</description>

      <title>QCD Running in Lepton Number Violating Meson and Tau Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Below the electroweak scale, new physics that violates lepton number in two units ($\Delta L = 2$) and is mediated by heavy particle exchange can be parameterized by a dimension-9 low-energy effective Lagrangian. Operators in this Lagrangian involving first-generation quarks and leptons contribute to the short-range mechanism of neutrinoless double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) and therefore they are strongly constrained. On the other hand, operators with other quark and lepton families are bounded by the non-observation of different lepton number violating (LNV) meson and tau decays, such as $M_1^- \to M_2^+\ell_1^-\ell_2^-$ and $\tau^- \to \ell^+ M_1^- M_2^-$. In this work, we calculate RGE-improved bounds on the Wilson coefficients involved in these decays. We calculate QCD corrections to the dimension-9 operator basis and find RG evolution matrices that describe the evolution of the Wilson coefficients across different energy scales. Unlike the running of operators involved in $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay, the general flavor structure leads to the mixing of not only different Lorentz structures but also of different quark-flavor configurations. Additionally, operators that vanish for the identical lepton case need to be added to the operator basis. We find new constraints on previously unbounded operators and the enhancement of bounds for specific Wilson coefficients. We also find new bounds coming from the mixing between operators with different quark-flavor configurations.</description>

Abstract: In a class of modular-invariant models with multiple moduli fields, the viable lepton flavour mixing pattern can be realised if the values of moduli are selected to be at the fixed points. In this paper, we investigate a modulus stabilisation mechanism in the multiple-modulus framework which is capable of providing de Sitter (dS) minima precisely at the fixed points $\tau = {\rm i}$ and $\omega$, by taking into consideration non-perturbative effects on the superpotential and the dilaton K\"ahler potential. Due to the existence of additional K\"ahler moduli, more possible vacua can occur, and the dS vacua could be the deepest under certain conditions. We classify different choices of vacua, and discuss their phenomenological implications for lepton masses and flavour mixing.</description>

      <title>A model independent description of $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new parameterization of $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ form factors using a partial-wave expansion and derive bounds on the series coefficients using analyticity and unitarity. This is the first generalization of the model-independent formalism developed by Boyd, Grinstein, and Lebed for $B \to D \ell \nu$ to semileptonic decays with multi-hadron final states, and enables data-driven form factor determinations with robust, systematically-improvable uncertainties. Using this formalism, we extract the form-factor parameters for $B \to D_2^\ast(\to D\pi) \ell \nu$ decays in a model-independent way from fits of data from the Belle Experiment, and, for the first time, study the two-pole structure in the $D\pi$ S-wave in semileptonic decays employing lineshapes from unitarized chiral perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting dark matter to freeze-in via vector portal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10360v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is challenging to resolve the small-scale problem for dark matter being a weakly-interacting massive particle. We attempt to address this issue by proposing a self-interacting freeze-in dark matter via dark photon. In this model, the dark matter obtains the observed relic abundance via Standard Model $\gamma$ and $Z$ boson induced freeze-in processes, whereas the dark matter force mediator has a negligible relic abundance and a lifetime larger than the age of Universe. We place constraints in classical and resonant regime resolving the small-scale problem from CMB, $X/\gamma$-ray, Supernova 1987A and out-of-equilibrium condition. It turns out that the CMB constraint on dark matter annihilations is satisfied despite large Sommerfeld effect taking place, while the other constraints are trivially accommodated due to various millicharge induced suppressions. Finally we briefly discuss future cosmological tests on such freeze-in dark matter model.</description>

      <title>The SM expected branching ratio for $h \to \gamma \gamma$ and an excess for $h \to Z \gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent measurements of $h \to Z \gamma$ from ATLAS and CMS show an excess of the signal strength $\mu_Z = (\sigma\cdot{\cal B})_{\mathrm{obs}}/(\sigma\cdot{\cal B})_{\mathrm{SM}}=2.2\pm 0.7$, normalized as 1 in the standard model~(SM). If confirmed, it would be a signal of new physics (NP) beyond the SM. We study NP explanation for this excess. In general, for a given model, it also affects the process $h \to \gamma \gamma$. Since the measured branching ratio for this process agrees well with the SM prediction, the model is severely constrained. We find that a minimally fermion singlets and doublet extended NP model can explain simultaneously the current data for $h \to Z \gamma$ and $h\to \gamma\gamma$. There are two solutions. Although both solutions enhance the amplitude of $h \to Z \gamma$ to the observed one, in one of the solutions the amplitude of $h \to \gamma \gamma$ flips sign to give the observ ed branching ratio. This seems to be a contrived solution although cannot be ruled out simply using branching ratio measurements alone. However, we find another solution that naturally enhances $h \to Z \gamma$ to the measured value, but keeps the amplitude of $h \to \gamma\gamma$ close to its SM prediction. We also comment on the phenomenology associated with these new fermions.</description>

Abstract: We study the discrimination power of future multi-TeV muon colliders for a large set of models with extended gauge symmetries and additional neutral gauge bosons ("$Z'$-models"). Our study is carried out using a $\chi^2$-analysis of leptonic observables of s-channel scattering in effective $Z'$-models. We make use of angular and chiral asymmetries induced in such models to find the discovery reach of a given muon collider setup in terms of the $Z'$ mass and to discriminate between the different scenarios. In this context, we discuss how polarized beams - should they become available at muon colliders - or polarization measurements can help in the discrimination. Our results show that typical muon collider setups which are currently under consideration can give a significantly higher reach compared to existing bounds and projections for high-luminosity LHC.</description>

Abstract: We forecast high-frequency gravitational wave (GW) from preheating hosting gravitational dark matter (GDM) as the indirect probe of such GDM. We use proper lattice simulations to handle resonance, and to solve GW equation of motion with the resonance induced scalar field excitations as source term. Our numerical results show that Higgs scalar excitations in Higgs preheating model give rise to magnitudes of GW energy density spectra of order $10^{-10}$ at frequencies $10-10^{3}$ MHz depending on the GDM mass, whereas inflaton fluctuation excitations in inflaton self-resonant preheating model yield magnitudes of GW energy density spectrum up to $10^{-9}~(10^{-11})$ at frequencies near $30~(2)$ MHz for the index $n=4~(6)$ with respect to the GDM mass of $1.04~(2.66)\times 10^{14}$ GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the development and growth of machine learning in high energy physics. There will be more effort to continue exploring its full potential. To make it easier for researchers to apply existing algorithms and neural networks and to advance the reproducibility of the analysis, we develop the HEP ML Lab (hml), a Python-based, end-to-end framework for phenomenology studies. It covers the complete workflow from event generation to performance evaluation, and provides a consistent style of use for different approaches. We propose an observable naming convention to streamline the data extraction and conversion processes. In the Keras style, we provide the traditional cut-and-count and boosted decision trees together with neural networks. We take the $W^+$ tagging as an example and evaluate all built-in approaches with the metrics of significance and background rejection. With its modular design, HEP ML Lab is easy to extend and customize, and can be used as a tool for both beginners and experienced researchers.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave spectrum from expanding string loops on domain walls: Implication for nanohertz pulsar timing array signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09599v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically calculate the spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by expanding string loops on domain walls in the scenario where domain walls decay by nucleation of string loops. By introducing macroscopic parameters characterizing the nucleation of the loops, the stochastic GW spectrum is derived in a way that is independent of the details of particle physics models. In contrast to GWs emitted from bubble collisions of the false vacuum decay, the string loops do radiate GWs even when they are perfectly circular before their collisions, resulting in that more and more contribution to the spectrum comes from the smaller and smaller loops compared to the typical size of the collided loops. Consequently, the spectrum is linearly proportional to the frequency at the high-frequency region, which is peculiar to this GW source. Furthermore, the results are compared with the recent nano-Hertz pulsar timing array signal, as well as the projected sensitivity curves of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Causal fermion states in magnetic field in a relativistic rotating frame and electromagnetic radiation by a rapidly rotating charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Dirac field uniformly rotating with angular velocity $\Omega$ and also subject to the constant magnetic field $B$ directed along the rotation axis. The causal states are constrained to the interior of the light cylinder of radius $c/\Omega$. When this radius is smaller than the system size, as in the quark-gluon plasma, the effect of the boundary on the fermion spectrum is critical. We derive the fermion spectrum and study its properties. We compute the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted due to transitions between the fermion states. We study its dependence on energy and angular momentum for different values of the angular velocity and the magnetic field. Rotation has enormous impact on the electromagnetic radiation by the quark-gluon plasma with or without the magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of $N(1535)$ and $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ in the Cabibbo-favored process $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \bar{K}^0\eta$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental measurements, we have investigated the Cabibbo-favored process $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \bar{K}^0\eta$, where the $N(1535)$ resonance is dynamically generated from the $S$-wave pseudoscalar meson-octet baryon interactions within the chiral unitary approach. The contributions from the intermediate $N(1650)$ and the predicted low-lying baryon $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ are also considered. In addition, a Breit-Wigner amplitude for the $N(1535)$ resonance is checked. By comparing with the measured $\eta p$, $\bar{K}^0 \eta$, and $p \bar{K}^0$ invariant mass squared distributions, our results support the interpretation of $N(1535)$ as a dynamically generated state. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, with the contribution from $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ taken into account, the calculated invariant mass spectrum agrees with the Belle measurements. Future precise measurements of the $\Lambda_c^+\to p \bar{K}^0\eta$ process can further elucidate the existence of the low-lying baryon $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong empirical and phenomenological indications exist for large sea-quark admixtures in the low-lying excited baryons. Investigating the low-lying excited baryon $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ is important to determine the nature of the low-lying excited baryons. We review the experimental and theoretical progress on the studies of the $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$. Although several candidates have received intensive discussions, such as $\Sigma(1620)$ and $\Sigma(1480)$, their existence needs further confirmation. Following the prediction of the unquenched quark models for the $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$, many theoretical works suggested the existence of these states in various processes. Future experimental measurements could shed light on the existence of the low-lying excited $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ state.</description>

      <title>Determination of Strong Coupling Constant from Inclusive Semileptonic Decays of Charmed Mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16119v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the heavy quark expansion model with the kinetic scheme, we evaluate $\alpha_S(m_c^2)$, the strong coupling constant at the charm quark mass $m_c$ with data on inclusive semileptonic decays of charmed mesons. Using the experimental values of semileptonic decay widths of the $D^0$ and the $D^+$, the value of $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ is determined to be $0.445\pm0.009\pm0.114$, where the first uncertainty is experimental and the second systematic. This reported $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ is in good agreement with the value of $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ calculated by running $\alpha_S(m_Z^2)$ at the $Z^0$ boson mass $m_Z$ with the renormalization group evolution equation. In addition, values of $\alpha_{s}(m_c^{2})$ obtained individually from each of the $D^0$, $D^+$, and $D_s^+$ mesons are found to be consistent being of the same origin.</description>

      <title>Flavour in $SU(5)$ Finite Grand Unified Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Four $SU(5)$ $N=1$ supersymmetric models which exhibit $S_3$ and/or $Z_N$ symmetries are studied, that are finite to two or all loops, and their corresponding mass matrices. The first is an all-loop finite model based on an $S_3\times Z_3\times Z_2$ flavour symmetry, which leads to phenomenologically nonviable mass matrices. The remaining models, based on cyclic symmetries, show various mass textures, some of which are phenomenologically promising. For the two-loop finite models, the parametric solutions to the finiteness conditions determine completely some of the Yukawa couplings, and lead to a restricted range of values for other ones at the GUT scale, with a considerable reduction in the number of free parameters. One particular solution of the two-loop models shows an enhanced symmetry, leading to an all-loop finite model, which has a significant parameter reduction and could in principle reproduce the observed quark masses and mixing pattern. In this case the finiteness conditions determine the absolute value of all the Yukawa couplings at the unification scale. Finally, the minimum number of phases in the mass matrices and their position are determined, a task not previously done in Finite Unified Theories, which contributes towards the reduction of parameters and a better understanding of the Yukawa couplings. the Yukawa couplings.</description>

      <title>Relativistic theory of the viscosity of fluids across the entire energy spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement mechanism of viscosity. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory provides a new analytical formula which reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with various estimates for hot dense matter and the QGP-type fluid.</description>

      <title>Two-gluon one-photon vertex in a magnetic field and its explicit one-loop approximation in the intermediate field strength regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find the general structure for the two-gluon one-photon vertex in the presence of a constant magnetic field. We show that, when accounting for the symmetries satisfied by the strong and electromagnetic interactions under parity, charge conjugation and gluon interchange, and for gluons and photons on mass-shell, there exist only three possible tensor structures that span the vertex. These correspond to external products of the polarization vectors for each of the particles in the vertex. We also explicitly compute the one-loop approximation to this vertex in the intermediate field strength regime, which is the most appropriate one to describe possible effects of the presence of a magnetic field to enhance photon emission during pre-equilibrium in peripheral relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We show that the most favored direction for the photon to propagate is in the plane transverse to the field, which is consistent with a positive contribution to $\nu_2$ and may help to understand the larger than expected elliptic flow coefficient measured in this kind of reactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the production of a Standard-Model (SM) Higgs boson in gluon fusion in hadronic collisions and compute the QCD corrections up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and match them to parton showers (NNLO+PS). The complete dependence on the top-quark mass is taken into account without making any approximations to the top quark loops mediating the coupling between the gluons and the Higgs boson. To this end, we have included the $gg\to H$ amplitudes up to three loops and the $pp\to H$+jet amplitudes up to two loops in the full SM theory. This is the first fully differential calculation of the top-quark mass effects up to NNLO in QCD, and we study their impact on relevant observables for the LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a unified solution with $Z_4$ discrete symmetry for small neutrino masses and stability of dark matter. The Standard Model is extended with an inert doublet scalar, a dark singlet scalar, a spurion scalar and right-handed neutrinos, which all transform nontrivially under $Z_4$. After the $Z_4$ symmetry is broken to $Z_2$ by the VEV of the spurion, much below the mass scale of the dark singlet scalar, a small lepton number violating coupling for the inert doublet is generated at tree level, so small neutrino masses are obtained at one-loops. We discuss the important roles of the $Z_4$ symmetry for neutrino masses, dark matter physics and thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Dark Matter and Low-Frequency Gravitational Wave Detection with Gaia-like Astrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Astrometric surveys offer us a method to search for elusive cosmic signatures, such as ultralight dark photon dark matter and gravitational waves, by observing the deflection to the apparent positions of the stars. The detection capabilities of such surveys rapidly decrease at low frequencies, because the signals become hardly distinguishable from the background motion of stars. In this work, we find that the background motion can be well described by a linear model over time, based on which we propose a linear background subtraction scheme. Compared to the conventional quadratic subtraction, the advantage of linear subtraction emerges within the frequency range below $6 \times 10^{-9}~{\rm Hz}$. Taking dark photons with purely gravitational interactions, dark photons with additional $U(1)_{B}$ or $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge interactions, and low-frequency gravitational waves as examples, we illustrate that the linear subtraction scheme can result in an enhancement of more than one order of magnitude in the exclusion limits of Gaia-like experiments in the low-frequency range.</description>

      <title>Three-loop contributions to $b\to s\gamma$ associated with the current-current operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work, we calculated all three-loop diagrams contributing to the decay amplitude for $b \to s \gamma$ where none of the gluons touch the $b$-leg. In the present paper, we complete the calculation by working out all remaining three-loop diagrams (of order $\alpha_s^2$) associated with the current-current operators $O_1$ and $O_2$ at the physical value of the charm-quark mass $m_c$. Using the programs AMFlow and DiffExp to solve the differential equations for the master integrals, we obtained precise numerical results at 23 values for $z=m_c^2/m_b^2$, ranging from $z=1/1000$ to $z=1/5$, along with asymptotic expansions around $z=0$. For certain diagrams, the asymptotic expansion breaks down in the physical $z$-range, necessitating a Taylor expansion (which we do around $z=1/10$). In all expansions, we retained power terms up to $z^{20}$ and included the accompanying $\log(z)$ terms to all powers for asymptotic expansions. Numerical results for the sum of all diagrams (including those calculated in the previous paper) are presented in tabular form, while the mentioned expansions of individual diagram classes are provided electronically. We note that our results for the asymptotic expansions around $z=0$ are in good agreement with those recently published by Fael et al. and Czaja et al..</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic $|G_E/G_M|$ ratios of hyperons at large timelike $q^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, it has become possible to measure not only the magnitude of the electric ($G_E$) and magnetic ($G_M$) form factors of spin $\frac{1}{2}$ baryons, but also to measure the relative phases of those quantities in the timelike kinematic region. Aiming to interpret present $|G_E/G_M|$ data on hyperons of the baryon octet, as well as to predict future data, we present model calculations of that ratio for large invariant 4-momentum square $q^2$ in the timelike region ($q^2&gt;0$). Without any further parameter fitting,we extend to the timelike region a covariant quark model previously developed to describe the kinematic spacelike region ($q^2 \le 0$) of the baryon octet form factors. The model takes into account both the effects of valence quarks and the excitations of the meson cloud which dresses the baryons. This application to the timelike region assumes an approximation based on unitarity and analyticity that is valid only in the large $q^2$ region. Using the recent data from BESIII we establish the regime of validity of this approximation. We report here that our results for the effective form factor (combination of $|G_E|$ and $|G_M|$) are in good agreement with the data already for $q^2$ values above 15 GeV$^2$. In addition, a more conservative onset of the validity of the approximation is provided by the newly available $|G_E/G_M|$ data which suggest that our predictions may be compared against data for $q^2 \ge $ 20 GeV$^2$. This is expected in the near future, when the range of the present measurements is expanded to the 20--50 GeV$^2$ region.</description>

Abstract: We apply the method of QCD sum rules to study the $q c \bar q \bar c$ tetraquark states with the exotic quantum number $J^{PC} = 3^{-+}$, and extract the mass of the lowest-lying state to be ${4.49^{+0.45}_{-0.41}}$ GeV. To construct the relevant tetraquark currents we need to explicitly add the covariant derivative operator. Our systematic analysis of these interpolating currents indicates that: a) this state readily decays into the $P$-wave $[\rho J/\psi] / [\omega J/\psi ]$ channel but not into the $ [\rho \chi_{c2}]/[\omega \chi_{c2}]/[J/\psi f_2(1270)]$ channels, and b) it readily decays into the $[D^* \bar D_2^*]$ channel but not into the $P$-wave $[D^* \bar D^*]$ channel.</description>

      <title>Semi-visible jets + X: Illuminating Dark Showers with Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential to search for semi-visible jets (SVJs) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) using initial-state radiation (ISR). Both photon ISR and jet ISR channels are considered, using a benchmark signal model with the decay of a leptophobic $Z^\prime$ mediator forming two SVJs. We compare and extend several techniques to decompose the missing transverse momentum into per-jet contributions, in order to reconstruct the mediator mass and to define a new observable measuring the fraction of invisible dark hadrons. The presence of ISR facilitates the identification of the SVJs, and the resulting boost improves the resolution of the observables, especially for models with high invisible fractions. We combine the two observables to propose a complete search strategy and discuss an extension of the strategy to probe the whole model parameter space.</description>

      <title>Fermion masses and mixings in the supersymmetric Pati-Salam landscape from Intersecting D6-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the complete landscape of three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from intersecting D6-branes on a type IIA $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold has been enumerated consisting of 33 independent models with distinct gauge coupling relations at the string scale. Here, we study the phenomenology of all such models by providing the detailed particle spectra and the analysis of the possible 3-point and the 4-point Yukawa interactions in order to accommodate all standard-model fermion masses and mixings. We find that only 17 models contain viable Yukawa textures to explain quarks masses, charged-leptons' masses, neutrino-masses, quarks' mixings and leptons' mixings. These viable models split into four classes, viz. a single model with 3 Higgs fields from the bulk and sixteen models with either 6, 9 or 12 Higgs from the $\mathcal{N}=2$ sector. The models perform successively better with the increasing number of Higgs pairs. Remarkably, the class of models with 12 Higgs naturally predicts the Dirac-type neutrino masses in normal ordering consistent with both the experimental constraints as well as the bounds from the swampland program.</description>

Abstract: We study the influence of a rotation on the string tension and the temperature of the confinement-deconfinement transition of gluodynamics by gauge/gravity duality. We explore two distinct approaches, global transformation and local transformation, to introduce rotation and compare the results. It is shown that the string tension extracted from the free energy in the presence of a heavy quarkonium decreases with the increasing angular velocity, while the transition temperature determined by the Polyakov loop increases with increasing angular velocity, which is in line with lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>SPECTER: Efficient Evaluation of the Spectral EMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Energy Mover's Distance (EMD) has seen use in collider physics as a metric between events and as a geometric method of defining infrared and collinear safe observables. Recently, the Spectral Energy Mover's Distance (SEMD) has been proposed as a more analytically tractable alternative to the EMD. In this work, we obtain a closed-form expression for the Riemannian-like p = 2 SEMD metric between events, eliminating the need to numerically solve an optimal transport problem. Additionally, we show how the SEMD can be used to define event and jet shape observables by minimizing the distance between events and parameterized energy flows (similar to the EMD), and we obtain closed-form expressions for several of these observables. We also present the SPECTER framework, an efficient and highly parallelized implementation of the SEMD metric and SEMD-derived shape observables as an analogue of the previously-introduced SHAPER for EMD-based computations. We demonstrate that computing the SEMD with SPECTER can be up to a thousand times faster than computing the EMD with standard optimal transport libraries.</description>

      <title>A try for dark energy in quantum field theory: The vacuum energy of neutrino field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we try to interpret the origin of dark energy in quantum field theory (QFT). The vacuum energy of a field in QFT is a quartic-divergence input, and its physical contribution to dark energy is calculated in the UV-free scheme. There is a mass-energy window that the active vacuum energy of neutrino fields can naturally meet the observation of dark energy density, and a neutrino with a typical mass $\sim$ 10 meV is expected. The normal hierarchical spectrum of neutrinos is preferred by naturalness, and the neutrino mass window set by dark energy is about 6.3 meV $\lesssim m_1 \lesssim$ 16.3 meV, 10.7 meV $\lesssim m_2 \lesssim$ 18.4 meV, 50.5 meV $\lesssim m_3 \lesssim$ 52.7 meV.</description>

      <title>Hybrid SO(10) Axion Model Without Quality Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invisible axion models that solve the strong CP problem via the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism typically have a quality problem that arises from quantum gravity effects which violate all global symmetries. These models therefore require extreme fine-tuning of parameters for consistency. We present a new solution to the quality problem in a unified $SO(10)\times U(1)_a$ gauge model, where $U(1)_a$ is an anomaly free axial gauge symmetry. PQ symmetry emerges as an accidental symmetry in this setup, which admits a PQ breaking scale as large as $4\times 10^{11}$ GeV, allowing for the axion to be the cosmological dark matter. We call this a hybrid axion model due to its unique feature that it interpolates between the popular KSVZ and DFSZ axion models. Its predictions for the experimentally measurable axion couplings to the nucleon and electron are distinct from those of the usual models, a feature that can be used to test it. Furthermore, the model has no domain wall problem and it provides a realistic and predictive framework for fermion masses and mixings.</description>

      <title>Interplay between $M_W$, $\Omega_{\rm CDM} h^2$, and $(g-2)_{\mu}$ in Flavor Symmetry-Based Supersymmetric Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the phenomenological implications of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) augmented by a non-abelian flavor symmetry labeled as sMSSM. Incorporating this flavor symmetry allows for a significant reduction in the original plethora of free parameters present in the MSSM, ultimately reducing them down to just seven in sMSSM. This reduction of free parameters is not achieved through ad hoc assumptions like in the constrained MSSM (CMSSM); rather, it is grounded in theoretical considerations. Our work focuses on exploring the interplay between the $W$ boson mass ($M_W$) predictions, the cold dark matter (CDM) relic abundance ($\Omega_{\rm CDM} h^2$), and the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ anomaly. We identified correlations among the theoretical parameters arising from this interplay, which can be complemented by experimental constraints such as the Higgs boson mass, B-physics observables, and charge and color breaking minima. Additionally, our investigations show that the $(g-2)_{\mu}$ discrepancy and the Planck bounds on $\Omega_{\rm CDM} h^2$ can be addressed within the sMSSM, but only in a very narrow region of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Light new physics in the top quark sample from the Large Hadron Collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contrary to the general trend of looking for new physics at energies beyond the current reach of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), this article proposes a strategy to look for light new physics via a meticulous study of well known and well-measured kinematic distributions. In this article, we propose performing such a study in the top-quark sample since the LHC, being a top-quark factory, helps in precise measurement of several observables related to the properties of the top-quark. One such observable is the invariant mass $m_{b\ell}$ of the b-jet and the charged lepton obtained from fully leptonic decay of pair-produced $t \bar{t}$ events. Such a strategy can be employed to extract hints for any Beyond Standard Model (BSM) scenario that allow for an exotic particle with mass close to the mass of top-quark ($m_t$) and can yield the same final state as fully leptonic decay of pair-produced top quarks. To provide a concrete study, we analyze a supersymmetric scenario with light right-handed stop quark with mass $\approx m_t$. The particle spectrum is such that the mass differences between the particles involved in the signal are small enough to lie in a potential blindspot and may be not yet firmly excluded by current LHC searches. Such spectra can yield a deviation from the Standard Model prediction in the lower region of the $m_{b\ell}$ distribution. This feature can be observed in any BSM framework that harbours light new physics that have so far escaped the LHC searches and hence can be used to extract light new physics signal irrespective of the underlying theory.</description>

      <title>Natural anomaly-mediation from the landscape with implications for LHC SUSY searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supersymmetric models with the anomaly-mediated SUSY breaking (AMSB) have run into serious conflicts with 1. LHC \textit{sparticle} and Higgs mass constraints, 2. constraints from wino-like WIMP dark matter searches and 3. bounds from naturalness. These conflicts may be avoided by introducing changes to the underlying phenomenological models providing a setting for natural anomaly-mediation (nAMSB). We examine spectra of nAMSB arising from string landscape. Here, we investigated LHC constraints on nAMSB models that allow $m_{3/2}$ to lie within 90$-$200 TeV which may soon be discovered or falsified by a combination of 1. soft OS dilepton plus jet+ MET (OSDLJMET) searches which arise from higgsino pair production, 2. non-boosted hadronically decaying wino pair production searches and 3. same-sign diboson + MET searches arising from wino pair production followed by wino decay to W +higgsino. Some excess above SM background in the OSDLJMET channel already seems to be present in both ATLAS and CMS data.</description>

      <title>The study of hadronic rescattering on $K^{*0}$ resonance yield in baryon-rich QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of hadronic rescattering on $K^{*0}$ resonance yield can be studied by measuring $K^{*0}/K$ ratio as a function of centrality or multiplicity. This study investigates how the size of the system and the chemical composition (meson-meson versus meson-baryon interaction) of the matter formed in heavy-ion collisions impact the process of hadronic rescattering. It is shown that existing calculation of $K^{*0}/K$ ratio, which considers the interaction of $K^{*0}$ and $K$ mesons with only light mesons in the hadronic medium (neglecting interactions with baryons), fails to explain the measured $K^{*0}/K$ ratio at RHIC BES energies. To understand the multiplicity dependence of the $K^{*0}/K$ ratio at RHIC BES and SPS energies ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ $&lt;$ 20 GeV), the Ultra Relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model is employed. UrQMD calculations suggest that for a given multiplicity, $K^{*0}/K$ is more suppressed in Au+Au collision at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =7.7 GeV, compared to that in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ =200 GeV. This is possibly because of formation different type of QCD medium at 200 GeV and 7.7 GeV, and change in interaction cross-section between hadrons with change in particle type and energy.</description>

Abstract: For neutron stars, there exist universal relations insensitive to the equation of states, the so called I-Love-Q relations, which show the connections among the moment of inertia, tidal Love number and quadrupole moment. In this paper, we show that these relations also apply to dark stars, bosonic or fermionic. The relations can be extended to higher ranges of the variables, clarifying the deviations for dark stars in the literature, as those curves all approximate the ones generated by a polytropic equation of state, when taking the low density (pressure) limit. Besides, we find that for equation of states with scaling symmetries, the I-Love-Q curves do not change when adjusting the scaling parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study axion-photon couplings in compactifications of type IIB string theory. We find that these couplings are systematically suppressed compared to the inverse axion periodicity, as a result of two effects. First, couplings to the QED theta angle are suppressed for axion mass eigenstates that are light compared to the mass scale set by stringy instantons on the cycle supporting QED. Second, in compactifications with many axions the intersection matrix is sparse, making kinetic mixing weak. We study the resulting phenomenology in an ensemble of $200{,}000$ toy models constructed from the Kreuzer-Skarke database up to the maximum Hodge number $h^{1,1}=491$. We examine freeze-in production and decay of thermal axions, birefringence of the cosmic microwave background, X-ray spectrum oscillations, and constraints on the QCD axion from supernovae. We conclude that compactifications in this corner of the landscape involve many invisible axions, as well as a handful that may be detectable via photon couplings.</description>

      <title>Learning New Physics from Data -- a Symmetrized Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thousands of person-years have been invested in searches for New Physics (NP), the majority of them motivated by theoretical considerations. Yet, no evidence of beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics has been found. This suggests that model-agnostic searches might be an important key to explore NP, and help discover unexpected phenomena which can inspire future theoretical developments. A possible strategy for such searches is identifying asymmetries between data samples that are expected to be symmetric within the Standard Model (SM). We propose exploiting neural networks (NNs) to quickly fit and statistically test the differences between two samples. Our method is based on an earlier work, originally designed for inferring the deviations of an observed dataset from that of a much larger reference dataset. We present a symmetric formalism, generalizing the original one; avoiding fine-tuning of the NN parameters and any constraints on the relative sizes of the samples. Our formalism could be used to detect small symmetry violations, extending the discovery potential of current and future particle physics experiments.</description>

Abstract: The first Edition of this book was released in 2000, just before the symposium ``Thirty Years of Supersymmetry'' was held at the William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute (FTPI) of the University of Minnesota. Founders and trailblazers of supersymmetry descended on FTPI, as well as a large crowd of younger theorists deeply involved in research in this area. Since then 23 years have elapsed and significant changes happened in supersymmetry (SUSY). Its history definitely needs an update. Such an update is presented below. The Second Edition of the revised collection will be released in 2024.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of the evolution of the Universe in modified loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the evolution of the Universe in the framework of a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I) with various inflationary potentials, including chaotic, Starobinsky, generalized Starobinsky, polynomials of the first and second kinds, generalized T- models and natural inflation. In all these models, the big bang singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce, and the evolution of the Universe both before and after the bounce is universal and weakly depends on the inflationary potentials, as long as the evolution is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton at the bounce. In particular, the evolution in the pre-bounce region can be universally divided into three different phases: pre-bouncing, pre-transition, and pre-de Sitter. The pre-bouncing phase occurs immediately before the quantum bounce, during which the evolution of the Universe is dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton. Thus, the equation of state of the inflaton is about one, w = 1. Soon, the inflation potential takes over, so w rapidly falls from one to negative one. This pre-transition phase is very short and quickly turns into the pre-de Sitter phase, whereby the effective cosmological constant with a Planck size takes over and dominates the rest of the contracting phase. In the entire pre-bounce regime, the evolution of the expansion factor and the inflaton can be approximated by analytical solutions, which are universal and independent of the inflation potentials.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for Scaling Dimensions of Neutral Operators in scalar CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01414v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the scaling dimension $\Delta_n$ for the class of composite operators $\phi^n$ in the $\lambda \phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\epsilon$ taking the double scaling limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and $\lambda \rightarrow 0$ with fixed $\lambda n$ via a semiclassical approach. Our results resum the leading power of $n$ at any loop order. In the small $\lambda n$ regime we reproduce the known diagrammatic results and predict the infinite series of higher-order terms. For intermediate values of $\lambda n$ we find that $\Delta_n/n$ increases monotonically approaching a $(\lambda n)^{1/3}$ behavior in the $\lambda n \to \infty$ limit. We further generalize our results to neutral operators in the $\phi^4$ in $d=4-\epsilon$, $\phi^3$ in $d=6-\epsilon$, and $\phi^6$ in $d=3-\epsilon$ theories with $O(N)$ symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09081v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schwarzschild radii of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mass range of 6x10^{14}g to 4x10^{19}g match the sizes of nuclei to atoms. I discuss the resulting quantum-mechanical suppression in the accretion of matter by PBHs in dense astrophysical environments, such as planets or stars.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic study of the $ \Omega \alpha $ interaction in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-particle momentum correlation between the Omega-baryon ($\Omega$) and the $^{4}He (\alpha) $ in high-energy heavy ion collisions is explored.
  Such correlations as an alternative source of information can help us further understand the interaction between $ \Omega $ and nucleons (N).
  $ \Omega\alpha $ potentials in the single-folding potential approach are constructed by employing two different available $\Omega N $ interactions in $^{5}S_{2}$ channel, i.e, one is based on the (2 + 1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations near the physical point by the HAL QCD collaboration, and another is based on the meson exchanges with effective Lagrangian, where in the latter case coupled channels effect is considered.
  It is found that the correlation functions at small size source depends on the used potential model. This implicitly means that at high density nuclear medium, $ \Omega \alpha $ momentum correlation could drive the feature of $ \Omega N $ interactions.
  Moreover, by extracting the scattering length and the effective range from obtained $ \Omega\alpha $ potentials, the correlation functions are calculated within the Lednicky-Lyuboshits (LL) formalism.
  It is shown that since the $\Omega\alpha $ has large interaction range, the LL formula leads to different results at small source size.</description>

      <title>Probing for an IR-fixed Point in QCD by Superallowed Gamow-Teller Transitions in Doubly Magic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04991v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This brief note is to point out that the recent measurements at GSI and RIKEN of the superallowed Gamow-Teller transition in the doubly magic closed-shell nucleus $^{100}$Sn could give an indication for a possibly important {\it fundamental} quenching, thus-far unrecognized, of $g_A$, unambiguously distinct from nuclear correlation effects in the framework of nuclear effective field theory. The result, either confirmed or ruled out both experimentally and theory, can have strong impacts on nuclear physics vis-\`a-vis with nuclear effective field theory as well as on particle physics relevant for going beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Maximal chirality transfer in the photon-graviton conversion in the early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While photons and gravitons do not interact significantly, photons can be converted to gravitons in a background magnetic field -- a phenomenon known as the Gertsenshtein effect. In this paper, we investigate whether chiral electromagnetic (EM) waves can be converted to chiral gravitational waves (GW) in the presence of primordial magnetic fields during the radiation-dominated epoch of the early universe. We consider two situations wherein chirality is either present in the propagating EM waves or it exists in the background magnetic field. Our analysis shows that while the conversion probability increases with stronger magnetic fields, it remains insensitive to the chiral nature of the background magnetic field. Consequently, the net chirality parameter is independent of the chirality of the background field in both cases. Finally, we demonstrate that the present-day energy density of the produced chiral GWs peaks at a frequency of $\sim 100$ GHz, and the corresponding characteristic strain will be highly sensitive to current and future missions designed to detect high-frequency GWs.</description>

      <title>On Two Nucleons Near Unitarity with Perturbative Pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the expansion of two-nucleon S-wave scattering phase shifts and pole parameters about Unitarity in Chiral Effective Field Theory with Perturbative Pions at N2LO: the only LO scale is the scattering momentum; NLO adds scattering length, effective range and non-iterated one-pion exchange (OPE); N2LO adds once-iterated OPE. We take advantage of the high degree of symmetry of the nontrivial fixed point at Unitarity, where Physics is universal and invariant under both scaling and Wigner's combined SU(4) transformation of spin and isospin. Both are explicitly but weakly broken in the Unitarity Expansion, including by OPE. This version applies in the Unitarity Window (45deg&lt;delta(k)&lt;135deg), including around k=mpi. Agreement in the 1S0 channel is very good. Apparent large discrepancies in the 3S1 channel at k&gt;100MeV are remedied by taking only the central part of the pion's N2LO contribution. In contradistinction to the tensor part, it is invariant under Wigner-SU(4) symmetry and hence identical in 1S0 and 3S1. NLO pions are Wigner-invariant. In the resulting $\chi$EFT with Perturbative Pions in the Unitarity Expansion, both channels describe PWAs and empirical pole parameters well within several mutually consistent quantitative theory uncertainty estimates. Pionic effects are small, even for k&gt;mpi. Empirically determined breakdown scales agree well with $\Lambda_{NN}=\frac{16\pi f_\pi^2}{g_A^2M}$=300MeV where iterated OPE is not suppressed. We therefore hypothesise: The footprint of both scale invariance and Wigner-symmetry in the Unitarity Expansion shows persistence, i.e. both dominate even for k=mpi and are more relevant than chiral symmetry, so that the tensor/Wigner-SU(4) symmetry-breaking part of OPE does not enter before N3LO. We also speculate that this may resolve a conflict with the strength of the tensor interaction in the large-Nc expansion.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray bursts and kilonovae from the accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first seconds-long multidimensional general relativistic neutrino magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accretion-induced collapse (AIC) in rapidly rotating, magnetized white dwarfs (WDs). Our findings show that, with sufficiently strong initial magnetic fields and rotation, these systems can generate relativistic jets and neutron-rich outflows with properties consistent with long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) accompanied by kilonovae, such as GRB 211211A and GRB 230703A. Notably, our models reproduce the power and duration of these LGRBs and the associated kilonovae without the need for tuning parameters. Additionally, our results suggest that the AIC of WDs could be an important site of the production for heavy $r$-process elements.</description>

      <title>Efficient generation of divergent and collimated hot electrons via a novel multi-beam two-plasmon decay and stimulated Raman scattering mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions, the preheating risks associated with hot electrons generated by laser plasma instabilities (LPI) are contingent upon the angular characteristics of these hot electrons for a given total energy. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we reveal a novel multi-beam collaborative mechanism of two-plasmon decay (TPD) and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS), and investigate the angular variations of hot electrons generated from this shared TPD-SRS (STS) instability driven collectively by dual laser beams with varying incident angles $\theta_{in}$ ($24^\circ$ to $55^\circ$ at the incident plane) for typical ICF conditions. In the simulations with $\theta_{in}\gtrsim44^\circ$, STS emerges as the dominant mechanism responsible for hot electron generation, leading to a wide angular distribution of hot electrons that exhibit both pronounced divergent and collimated components. The common Langmuir wave associated with STS plays a crucial role in accelerating both components.By properly modeling the STS common wave gains, we establish scaling relations between these gains and the energies of collimated and divergent hot electrons. These relations reveal that the divergent hot electrons are more sensitive to variations in gain compared to the collimated electrons. Additionally, the calculated gains qualitatively predict the asymmetry in hot electron angular distributions when the density gradients deviate from the bisector of the laser beams. Our findings offers insights for hot electron generation with multiple beams, potentially complementing previous experiments that underscore the critical role of overlapped intensity from symmetric beams within the same cone and the dominance of dual-beam coupling.</description>

      <title>Impact parameter dependence of the effect of background field on coupling constant in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the impact parameter dependence of the background field's effect on the coupling constant of the $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow l^{+} l^{-} \gamma$ process in heavy-ion collisions. The peripheral electric fields of heavy ions collide, and after photon annihilation into lepton pairs, the subsequent emission of radiation photons will be affected by the background field. Numerical estimates indicate that the dependence of this effect on the impact parameter is significant during this process.</description>
