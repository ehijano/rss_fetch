      <title>A Starter Kit for Diversity-Oriented Communities for Undergraduates: Near-Peer Mentorship Programs</title>

Abstract: This mentoring resource is a guide to establishing and running near-peer mentorship programs. It is based on the working knowledge and best practices developed by the Access Network, a collection of nine student-led communities at universities across the country working towards a vision of a more diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible STEM environment. Many of these communities, also referred to as sites, include a near-peer mentoring program that is developed to best support their local context. The format of these programs vary, ranging from structured classes with peer mentoring groups to student clubs supporting 1-on-1 relationships. To further support program participants as both students and as whole people, sites often run additional events such as lecture series, workshops, and social activities guided tailored to each student community's needs. Through this process, student leaders have generated and honed best practices for all aspects of running their sites. This guide is an attempt to synthesize those efforts, offering practical advice for student leaders setting up near-peer mentorship programs in their own departments. It has been written through the lens of undergraduate near-peer mentorship programs, although our framework could easily be extended to other demographics (e.g. high schoolers, graduate students, etc.). Our experience is with STEM mentorship specifically, though these practices can extend to any discipline. In this document, we outline best practices for designing, running, and sustaining near-peer mentorship programs. We provide template resources to assist with this work, and lesson plans to run mentor and mentee training sessions. We hope you find this guide useful in designing, implementing, and re-evaluating community oriented near-peer mentoring programs.</description>

      <title>Qualitative observations in university physics laboratories: an example from classical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key skills of a researcher is noticing what's going on. Both in the experiment one's performing and in one's data: is there something interesting, reason to doubt one's data or suspect that one's theoretical description is insufficient? Many experiments developed for undergraduate teaching still focus on quantitative evaluation. Here we take an alternative approach where careful observation identifies the interesting qualitative behaviour of a ball dropped with a water bottle balanced on top of it, but where numerical agreement with a simple theoretical model is impossible. Thus 'success' occurs when students are satisfied with their efforts and the development of their experimental process. Laboratory note keeping can also be introduced in a meaningful, non-formulaic way since students are making independent observations and method changes. We describe pedagogical and didactic considerations for the implementation of the experiment in a classroom, including variations and extensions, and give examples of experimental outcomes. We suggest that considering qualitative behaviour may be a fruitful strategy for identifying experiments that are both amenable to student autonomy and embedding skills such as laboratory note keeping in a flexible and genuine way.</description>
