      <title>A joint channel estimation and beamforming separation principle for massive MIMO systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that separating beamforming (i.e., downlink precoding and uplink combining) and channel estimation in multi-user MIMO wireless systems incurs no loss of optimality under general conditions that apply to a wide variety of models in the literature, including canonical reciprocity-based cellular and cell-free massive MIMO system models. Specifically, we provide conditions under which optimal processing in terms of ergodic achievable rates can be decomposed into minimum mean-square error (MMSE) channel estimation followed by MMSE beamforming, for both centralized and distributed architectures. Applications of our results are illustrated in terms of concrete examples and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communications over Memoryless Relay Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of bistatic integrated sensing and communications over memoryless relay channels is considered, where destination concurrently decodes the message sent by the source and estimates unknown parameters from received signals with the help of a relay. A state-dependent discrete memoryless relay channel is considered to model this setup, and the fundamental limits of the communication-sensing performance tradeoff are characterized by the capacity-distortion function. An upper bound on the capacity-distortion function is derived, extending the cut-set bound results to address the sensing operation at the destination. A hybrid-partial-decode-and-compress-forward coding scheme is also proposed to facilitate source-relay cooperation for both message transmission and sensing, establishing a lower bound on the capacity-distortion function. It is found that the hybrid-partial-decode-and-compress-forward scheme achieves optimal sensing performance when the communication task is ignored. Furthermore, the upper and lower bounds are shown to coincide for three specific classes of relay channels. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the communication-sensing tradeoff and demonstrate the benefits of integrated design.</description>

      <title>Data Fusion and Aggregation Methods to Develop Composite Indexes for a Sustainable Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on environmental risk modeling relies on numerous indicators to quantify the magnitude and frequency of extreme climate events, their ecological, economic, and social impacts, and the coping mechanisms that can reduce or mitigate their adverse effects. Index-based approaches significantly simplify the process of quantifying, comparing, and monitoring risks associated with other natural hazards, as a large set of indicators can be condensed into a few key performance indicators. Data fusion techniques are often used in conjunction with expert opinions to develop key performance indicators. This paper discusses alternative methods to combine data from multiple indicators, with an emphasis on their use-case scenarios, underlying assumptions, data requirements, advantages, and limitations. The paper demonstrates the application of these data fusion methods through examples from current risk and resilience models and simplified datasets. Simulations are conducted to identify their strengths and weaknesses under various scenarios. Finally, a real-life example illustrates how these data fusion techniques can be applied to inform policy recommendations in the context of drought resilience and sustainability.</description>

      <title>On Lattice Isomorphism Problems for Lattices from LCD Codes over Finite Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These days, post-quantum cryptography based on the lattice isomorphism problem has been proposed. Ducas-Gibbons introduced the hull attack, which solves the lattice isomorphism problem for lattices obtained by Construction A from an LCD code over a finite field. Using this attack, they showed that the lattice isomorphism problem for such lattices can be reduced to the lattice isomorphism problem with the trivial lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and the graph isomorphism problem. While the previous work by Ducas-Gibbons only considered lattices constructed by a code over a \textit{finite field}, this paper considers lattices constructed by a code over a \textit{finite ring} $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$, which is a more general case. In particular, when $k$ is odd, an odd prime power, or not divisible by $4$, we show that the lattice isomorphism problem can be reduced to the lattice isomorphism problem for $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and the graph isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically optimal cyclic subspace codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subspace codes, and in particular cyclic subspace codes, have gained significant attention in recent years due to their applications in error correction for random network coding. In this paper, we introduce a new technique for constructing cyclic subspace codes with large cardinality and prescribed minimum distance. Using this new method, we provide new constructions of cyclic subspace codes in the Grassmannian $\mathcal{G}_q(n,k)$ of all $k$-dimensional $\mathbb{F}_q$-subspaces of an $n$-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}_q$, when $k\mid n$ and $n/k$ is a composite number, with minimum distance $2k-2$ and large size. We prove that the resulting codes have sizes larger than those obtained from previously known constructions with the same parameters. Furthermore, we show that our constructions of cyclic subspace codes asymptotically reach the Johnson type bound II for infinite values of $n/k$.</description>

      <title>Joint Access Point Activation and Power Allocation for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Aided ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems are investigated where distributed access points jointly serve users and sensing targets. We demonstrate that only a subset of access points (APs) has to be activated for both tasks, while deactivating redundant APs is essential for power savings. This motivates joint active AP selection and power control for optimizing energy efficiency. The resultant problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP). To address this, we propose a model-based Branch-and-Bound approach as a strong baseline to guide a semi-supervised heterogeneous graph neural network (HetGNN) for selecting the best active APs and the power allocation. Comprehensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed HetGNN reduces power consumption by 20-25\% and runs nearly 10,000 times faster than model-based benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Introducing Meta-Fiber into Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for MIMO Communications: A Low-Complexity Design with only Two Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs), which integrate multiple programmable metasurface layers, have recently emerged as a promising technology for advanced wave-domain signal processing. SIMs benefit from flexible spatial degree-of-freedom (DoF) while reducing the requirement for costly radio-frequency (RF) chains. However, current state-of-the-art SIM designs face challenges such as complex phase shift optimization and energy attenuation from multiple layers. To address these aspects, we propose incorporating meta-fibers into SIMs, with the aim of reducing the number of layers and enhancing the energy efficiency. First, we introduce a meta-fiber-connected 2-layer SIM that exhibits the same flexible signal processing capabilities as conventional multi-layer structures, and explains the operating principle. Subsequently, we formulate and solve the optimization problem of minimizing the mean square error (MSE) between the SIM channel and the desired channel matrices. Specifically, by designing the phase shifts of the meta-atoms associated with the transmitting-SIM and receiving-SIM, a non-interference system with parallel subchannels is established. In order to reduce the computational complexity, a closed-form expression for each phase shift at each iteration of an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed. We show that the proposed algorithm is applicable to conventional multi-layer SIMs. The channel capacity bound and computational complexity are analyzed to provide design insights. Finally, numerical results are illustrated, demonstrating that the proposed two-layer SIM with meta-fiber achieves over a 25% improvement in channel capacity while reducing the total number of meta-atoms by 59% as compared with a conventional seven-layer SIM.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Deep Learning-Based Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided Extremely Large-Scale MIMO Systems on Resource-Limited Edge Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless technologies such as 6G aim to meet demanding requirements such as ultra-high data rates, low latency, and enhanced connectivity. Extremely Large-Scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) are key enablers, with XL-MIMO boosting spectral and energy efficiency through numerous antennas, and RIS offering dynamic control over the wireless environment via passive reflective elements. However, realizing their full potential depends on accurate Channel State Information (CSI). Recent advances in deep learning have facilitated efficient cascaded channel estimation. However, the scalability and practical deployment of existing estimation models in XL-MIMO systems remain limited. The growing number of antennas and RIS elements introduces a significant barrier to real-time and efficient channel estimation, drastically increasing data volume, escalating computational complexity, requiring advanced hardware, and resulting in substantial energy consumption. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight deep learning framework for efficient cascaded channel estimation in XL-MIMO systems, designed to minimize computational complexity and make it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Using spatial correlations in the channel, we introduce a patch-based training mechanism that reduces the dimensionality of input to patch-level representations while preserving essential information, allowing scalable training for large-scale systems. Simulation results under diverse conditions demonstrate that our framework significantly improves estimation accuracy and reduces computational complexity, regardless of the increasing number of antennas and RIS elements in XL-MIMO systems.</description>

      <title>RDD Function: A Tradeoff Between Rate and Distortion-in-Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel function named Rate Distortion-in-Distortion (RDD) function as an extension of the classical rate-distortion (RD) function, where the expected distortion constraint is replaced by the Gromov-type distortion. This distortion, integral to the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance, effectively defines the similarity in spaces of different dimensions without a direct metric between them. While our RDD function qualifies as an informational RD function, encoding theorems substantiate its status as an operational RD function, thereby underscoring its potential applicability in real-world source coding. Due to the high computational complexity associated with Gromov-type distortion, the RDD function cannot be solved analytically. Consequently, we develop an alternating mirror descent algorithm that significantly reduces computational complexity by employing decomposition, linearization, and relaxation techniques. Simulations on classical sources and different grids demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. By examining the distinctions and connections between the RDD function and the RD function, we anticipate that RDD function will play a novel role in foreseeable future scenarios.</description>

      <title>Majority Logic Decoding of Affine Grassmann Codes Over Nonbinary Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the decoding problem of affine Grassmann codes over nonbinary fields. We use matrices of different ranks to construct a large set consisting of parity checks of affine Grassmann codes, which are orthogonal with respect to a fixed coordinate. By leveraging the automorphism groups of these codes, we generate a set of orthogonal parity checks for each coordinate. Using these parity checks, we perform majority logic decoding to correct a large number of errors in affine Grassmann codes. The order of error correction capability and the complexity of this decoder for affine Grassmann codes are the same as those of the majority logic decoder for Grassmann codes proposed in [BS21].</description>

      <title>Remote Safety Monitoring: Significance-Aware Status Updating for Situational Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a problem of remote safety monitoring, where a monitor pulls status updates from multiple sensors monitoring several safety-critical situations. Based on the received updates, multiple estimators determine the current safety-critical situations. Due to transmission errors and limited channel resources, the received status updates may not be fresh, resulting in the possibility of misunderstanding the current safety situation. In particular, if a dangerous situation is misinterpreted as safe, the safety risk is high. We study the joint design of transmission scheduling and estimation for multi-sensor, multi-channel remote safety monitoring, aiming to minimize the loss due to the unawareness of potential danger. We show that the joint design of transmission scheduling and estimation can be reduced to a sequential optimization of estimation and scheduling. The scheduling problem can be formulated as a Restless Multi-armed Bandit (RMAB) , for which it is difficult to establish indexability. We propose a low-complexity Maximum Gain First (MGF) policy and prove it is asymptotically optimal as the numbers of sources and channels scale up proportionally, without requiring the indexability condition. We also provide an information-theoretic interpretation of the transmission scheduling problem. Numerical results show that our estimation and scheduling policies achieves higher performance gain over periodic updating, randomized policy, and Maximum Age First (MAF) policy.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Multiview Learning via Wyner Common Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incomplete multiview clustering is of high recent interest, fueled by the advancement of common information-based deep multiview learning. The practical scenarios where unpaired multiview data with missing values have wide applications in generative learning, cross-modal retrieval, and wireless device identification problems. Following the perspective that the shared information between the incomplete multiview data aligns with the cluster targets, recent works have generalized the well-known common information frameworks in information theory multiview learning problems, with improved performance reported. Different from previous works, we extend the frameworks to incomplete multiview clustering problems and propose an efficient solver: Wyner Incomplete MultiView Clustering (WyIMVC). Interestingly, the common randomness in WyIMVC allows for joint clustering and missing value inference in contrast to the compared methods in the literature. Moreover, leveraging the difference-of-convex structure of the formulated problems, we propose an efficient solver with a convergence guarantee independent of initialization. Empirically, our solver outperforms the state-of-the-art solvers in a range of incomplete multiview datasets with varying numbers of views and dimensions.</description>

      <title>Several new classes of self-orthogonal minimal linear codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear codes have attracted considerable attention in coding theory and cryptography due to their significant applications in secret sharing schemes, secure two-party computation, Galois geometries, among others. As two special subclasses of linear codes, minimal linear codes and self-orthogonal linear codes are of particular interest. Constructing linear codes that possess both minimality and self-orthogonality is very interesting. The main purpose of this paper is to construct self-orthogonal minimal linear codes that violate the Ashikhmin-Barg (AB for short) condition over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_p$. First, we present several classes of self-orthogonal minimal linear codes violating the AB condition over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_2$ and determine their weight distributions. Next, for any odd prime $p$, we construct two classes of self-orthogonal linear codes from $p$-ary functions, which contain some optimal or almost optimal codes. Finally, based on plateaued functions, we construct two classes of self-orthogonal linear codes that violate the AB condition. Their weight distributions are also provided. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to investigate the constructions of linear codes that violate the AB condition and satisfy self-orthogonality.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Berman-intersection-dual Berman (BiD) codes. These are abelian codes of length $3^m$ that can be constructed using Kronecker products of a $3 \times 3$ kernel matrix. BiD codes offer minimum distance close to that of Reed-Muller (RM) codes at practical blocklengths, and larger distance than RM codes asymptotically in the blocklength. Simulations of BiD codes of length $3^5=243$ in the erasure and Gaussian channels show that their block error rates under maximum-likelihood decoding are similar to, and sometimes better, than RM, RM-Polar, and CRC-aided Polar codes.</description>

      <title>Learning-Aided Iterative Receiver for Superimposed Pilots: Design and Experimental Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superimposed pilot transmission scheme offers substantial potential for improving spectral efficiency in MIMO-OFDM systems, but it presents significant challenges for receiver design due to pilot contamination and data interference. To address these issues, we propose an advanced iterative receiver based on joint channel estimation, detection, and decoding, which refines the receiver outputs through iterative feedback. The proposed receiver incorporates two adaptive channel estimation strategies to enhance robustness under time-varying and mismatched channel conditions. First, a variational message passing (VMP) method and its low-complexity variant (VMP-L) are introduced to perform inference without relying on time-domain correlation. Second, a deep learning (DL) based estimator is developed, featuring a convolutional neural network with a despreading module and an attention mechanism to extract and fuse relevant channel features. Extensive simulations under multi-stream and high-mobility scenarios demonstrate that the proposed receiver consistently outperforms conventional orthogonal pilot baselines in both throughput and block error rate. Moreover, over-the-air experiments validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed design. Among the methods, the DL based estimator achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and complexity, highlighting its suitability for real-world deployment in dynamic wireless environments.</description>

      <title>Improved Differential Evolution for Enhancing the Aggregated Channel Estimation of RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-Free Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems are investigated with the support of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The RIS phase shifts are designed for improved channel estimation in the presence of spatial correlation. Specifically, we formulate the channel estimate and estimation error expressions using linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation for the aggregated channels. An optimization problem is then formulated to minimize the average normalized mean square error (NMSE) subject to practical phase shift constraints. To circumvent the problem of inherent nonconvexity, we then conceive an enhanced version of the differential evolution algorithm that is capable of avoiding local minima by introducing an augmentation operator applied to some high-performing Diffential Evolution (DE) individuals. Numerical results indicate that our proposed algorithm can significantly improve the channel estimation quality of the state-of-the-art benchmarks.</description>

      <title>High Girth Spatially-Coupled LDPC Codes with Hierarchical Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-cyclic (QC) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a class of LDPC codes with a simple construction facilitating hardware implementation while achieving excellent performance. In this paper, we introduce an algorithm that constructs QC spatially-coupled (SC) LDPC codes with large girth while keeping the constraint length small. The algorithm offers a "protograph to basegraph" construction, focusing on finding small lifting sizes of QC codes while avoiding short cycles. This work extends the hierarchical quasi-cyclic (HQC) construction for block LDPC codes proposed by Wang et al. to the spatially coupled case. The construction is based on the cycle relevant matrix (CRM) derived from the periodic structure of time-invariant SC-LDPC codes. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm effectively achieves the target girth with a small lifting factor, enabling low-complexity SC code construction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Low-Power Wake-Up Signal (LP-WUS) and Low-Power Synchronization Signal (LP-SS), introduced in 3GPP 5G-Advanced Release 19, represent a major step forward in enabling power-efficient IoT communications. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the LP-WUS and LP-SS procedures in the RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE states, and outlines key physical layer design choices. The LP-WUS is designed to be detected by a low-power energy detector (ED), allowing the main radio (MR) to remain switched off. This architecture enables power savings of up to 80% compared to conventional 5G paging mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Completion Approach for the Construction of MDP Convolutional Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum Distance Profile (MDP) convolutional codes are an important class of channel codes due to their maximal delay-constrained error correction capabilities. The design of MDP codes has attracted significant attention from the research community. However, only limited attention was given to addressing the complexity of encoding and decoding operations. This paper aims to reduce encoding complexity by constructing partial unit-memory MDP codes with structured and sparse generator matrices. In particular, we present a matrix completion framework that extends a structured superregular matrix (e.g., Cauchy) over a small field to a sparse sliding generator matrix of an MDP code. We show that the proposed construction can reduce the encoding complexity compared to the current state-of-the-art MDP code designs.</description>

Abstract: Decoders for Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes are usually tailored to an application and optimized once the specific content and structure of the parity matrix are known. In this work we consider the parity matrix as an argument of the Min-Sum decoder, and provide a GPU implementation that is independent of the content of the parity matrix, and relies only on its dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems represent an innovative approach in wireless communication, recently applied in multiple access to optimize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio through port selection. This letter frames the port selection problem as a multi-label classification task for the first time, improving best-port selection with limited port observations. We address this challenge by leveraging liquid neural networks (LNNs) to predict the optimal port under emerging fluid antenna multiple access scenarios alongside a more general $\alpha$-$\mu$ fading model. We also apply hyperparameter optimization to refine LNN architectures for different observation scenarios. Our approach yields lower outage probability values than existing methods.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits via CRB of semi-blind channel estimation in Massive MIMO systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of the deterministic and stochastic Cram\'er-Rao Bounds (CRB) for semi-blind channel estimation in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. We derive and analyze mathematically tractable expressions for both metrics under various asymptotic regimes, which govern the growth rates of the number of antennas, the number of users, the training sequence length, and the transmission block length. Unlike the existing work, our results show that the CRB can be made arbitrarily small as the transmission block length increases, but only when the training sequence length grows at the same rate and the number of users remains fixed. However, if the number of training sequences remains proportional to the number of users, the channel estimation error is always lower-bounded by a non-vanishing constant. Numerical results are presented to support our findings and demonstrate the advantages of semi-blind channel estimation in reducing the required number of training sequences.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Matrix Recovery with High-Dimensional Noise via Optimal Shrinkage of Singular Values and Wavelet Shrinkage of Singular Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel data-driven algorithm designed to recover low-rank matrices whose entries satisfy a mixed H\"older condition in the presence of high-dimensional noise with a separable covariance structure. The algorithm, coined extended optimal shrinkage and wavelet shrinkage (e$\mathcal{OWS}$), emphasizes the asymptotic structure, where the matrix size is significantly larger than the rank of the signal matrix. The denoising process begins with the adaptation of the well-known optimal shrinkage of singular values. This is followed by an iterative procedure that organizes the matrix using a coupled metric on the rows and columns, constructed by building a tree structure for both dimensions. This hierarchical organization induces a tensor Haar-Walsh basis on the matrix. An adapted wavelet shrinkage technique is applied to further denoise the reconstructed matrix, modifying the Haar-Walsh coefficients based on the analysis of the first-order perturbation of singular vectors. We provide theoretical guarantees for these estimators, demonstrating a convergence rate that highlights the efficacy of our algorithm. Simulations show successful matrix recovery, with a small mean squared error between the estimate and the ground truth, and accurate reconstruction of the singular vector spaces.</description>

      <title>A CLuP algorithm to practically achieve $\sim 0.76$ SK--model ground state free energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider algorithmic determination of the $n$-dimensional Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model ground state free energy. It corresponds to a binary maximization of an indefinite quadratic form and under the \emph{worst case} principles of the classical NP complexity theory it is hard to approximate within a $\log(n)^{const.}$ factor. On the other hand, the SK's random nature allows (polynomial) spectral methods to \emph{typically} approach the optimum within a constant factor. Naturally one is left with the fundamental question: can the residual (constant) \emph{computational gap} be erased?
  Following the success of \emph{Controlled Loosening-up} (CLuP) algorithms in planted models, we here devise a simple practical CLuP-SK algorithmic procedure for (non-planted) SK models. To analyze the \emph{typical} success of the algorithm we associate to it (random) CLuP-SK models. Further connecting to recent random processes studies [94,97], we characterize the models and CLuP-SK algorithm via fully lifted random duality theory (fl RDT) [98]. Moreover, running the algorithm we demonstrate that its performance is in an excellent agrement with theoretical predictions. In particular, already for $n$ on the order of a few thousands CLuP-SK achieves $\sim 0.76$ ground state free energy and remarkably closely approaches theoretical $n\rightarrow\infty$ limit $\approx 0.763$. For all practical purposes, this renders computing SK model's near ground state free energy as a \emph{typically} easy problem.</description>

      <title>Wi-Fi: Twenty-Five Years and Counting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today, Wi-Fi is over 25 years old. Yet, despite sharing the same branding name, today's Wi-Fi boasts entirely new capabilities that were not even on the roadmap 25 years ago. This article aims to provide a holistic and comprehensive technical and historical tutorial on Wi-Fi, beginning with IEEE 802.11b (Wi-Fi 1) and looking forward to IEEE 802.11bn (Wi-Fi 8). This is the first tutorial article to span these eight generations. Rather than a generation-by-generation exposition, we describe the key mechanisms that have advanced Wi-Fi. We begin by discussing spectrum allocation and coexistence, and detailing the IEEE 802.11 standardization cycle. Second, we provide an overview of the physical layer and describe key elements that have enabled data rates to increase by over 1,000x. Third, we describe how Wi-Fi Medium Access Control has been enhanced from the original Distributed Coordination Function to now include capabilities spanning from frame aggregation to wideband spectrum access. Fourth, we describe how Wi-Fi 5 first broke the one-user-at-a-time paradigm and introduced multi-user access. Fifth, given the increasing use of mobile, battery-powered devices, we describe Wi-Fi's energy-saving mechanisms over the generations. Sixth, we discuss how Wi-Fi was enhanced to seamlessly aggregate spectrum across 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands to improve throughput, reliability, and latency. Finally, we describe how Wi-Fi enables nearby Access Points to coordinate in order to improve performance and efficiency. In the Appendix, we further discuss Wi-Fi developments beyond 802.11bn, including integrated mmWave operations, sensing, security and privacy extensions, and the adoption of AI/ML.</description>

      <title>Metric complexity is a Bryant--Tupper diversity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metric complexity (sometimes called Leinster--Cobbold maximum diversity) of a compact metric space is a recently introduced isometry-invariant of compact metric spaces which generalizes the notion of cardinality, and can be thought of as a metric-sensitive analogue of maximum entropy. On the other hand, the notion of diversity introduced by Bryant and Tupper is an assignment of a real number to every finite subset of a fixed set, which generalizes the notion of a metric. We establish a connection between these concepts by showing that the former quantity naturally produces an example of the latter. Moreover, in contrast to several examples in the literature, the diversity that arises from metric complexity is Minkowski-superlinear for compact subsets of the real line.</description>

      <title>Precoded Zak-OTFS for Per-Carrier Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation the carrier waveform is a pulse in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, formally a quasi-periodic localized function with specific periods along delay and Doppler. When the channel delay spread is less than the delay period, and the channel Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, the response to a single Zak-OTFS carrier provides an image of the scattering environment and can be used to predict the effective channel at all other carriers. The image of the scattering environment changes slowly, making it possible to employ precoding at the transmitter. Precoding techniques were developed more than thirty years ago for wireline modem channels (V.34 standard) defined by linear convolution where a pulse in the time domain (TD) is used to probe the one-dimensional partial response channel. The action of a doubly spread channel on Zak-OTFS modulation determines a two-dimensional partial response channel defined by twisted convolution, and we develop a novel precoding technique for this channel. The proposed precoder leads to separate equalization of each DD carrier which has significantly lower complexity than joint equalization of all carriers. Further, the effective precoded channel results in non-interfering DD carriers which significantly reduces the overhead of guard carriers separating data and pilot carriers, which improves the spectral efficiency significantly.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction for Constant-Excitation Stabilizer Codes under Coherent Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective coherent noise poses challenges for fault-tolerant quantum error correction (FTQEC), as it falls outside the usual stochastic noise models. While constant excitation (CE) codes can naturally avoid coherent noise, a complete fault-tolerant framework for the use of these codes under realistic noise models has been elusive. Here, we introduce a complete fault-tolerant architecture for CE CSS codes based on dual-rail concatenation. After showing that transversal CNOT gates violate CE code constraints, we introduce CE-preserving logical CNOT gates and modified Shor- and Steane-type syndrome extraction schemes using zero-controlled NOT gates and CE-compatible ancilla. This enables fault-tolerant syndrome-extraction circuits fully compatible with CE constraints. We also present an extended stabilizer simulation algorithm that efficiently tracks both stochastic and collective coherent noise. Using our framework, we identify minimal CE codes, including the $[[12,1,3]]$ and $[[14,3,3]]$ codes, and demonstrate that the $[[12,1,3]]$ code achieves strong performance under coherent noise. Our results establish the first complete FTQEC framework for CE codes, demonstrating their robustness to coherent noise. This highlights the potential of CE codes as a possible solution for quantum processors dominated by collective coherent noise.</description>

      <title>Consensus, Inconsistency, Emergence: what's paraconsistency got to do with it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The consensus problem, briefly stated, consists of having processes in an asynchronous distributed system agree on a value. It is widely known that the consensus problem does not have a deterministic solution that ensures both termination and consistency, if there is at least one faulty process in the system. This result, known as the FLP impossibility theorem, led to several generalizations and developments in theoretical distributed computing. This paper argues that the FLP impossibility theorem holds even under a generalized definition of computation through oracles. Furthermore, using a theoretical machinery from complex systems, this paper also posits that inconsistency may be an emergent feature of consensus over distributed systems by examining how a system transitions phases. Under the same complex systems framework, this paper examines paraconsistent logics, arguing that while inconsistency is not an emergent feature for these logics, triviality may be. Lastly, some attention is given to the possibility of developing consensus algorithms capable of paraconsistent reasoning.</description>

      <title>Approaching Rate-Distortion Limits in Neural Compression with Lattice Transform Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural compression has brought tremendous progress in designing lossy compressors with good rate-distortion (RD) performance at low complexity. Thus far, neural compression design involves transforming the source to a latent vector, which is then rounded to integers and entropy coded. While this approach has been shown to be optimal on a few specific sources, we show that it can be highly sub-optimal on synthetic sources whose intrinsic dimensionality is greater than one. With integer rounding in the latent space, the quantization regions induced by neural transformations, remain square-like and fail to match those of optimal vector quantization. We demonstrate that this phenomenon is due to the choice of scalar quantization in the latent space, and not the transform design. By employing lattice quantization instead, we propose Lattice Transform Coding (LTC) and show that it approximately recovers optimal vector quantization at reasonable complexity. On real-world sources, LTC improves upon standard neural compressors. LTC also provides a framework that can integrate structurally (near) optimal information-theoretic designs into lossy compression; examples include block coding, which yields coding gain over optimal one-shot coding and approaches the asymptotically-achievable rate-distortion function, as well as nested lattice quantization for low complexity fixed-rate coding.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity of Correlated Phase-Noise Channels: An Electro-Optic Frequency Comb Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capacity of a discrete-time channel with correlated phase noises is investigated. In particular, the electro-optic frequency comb system is considered, where the phase noise of each subchannel is a combination of two independent Wiener phase-noise sources. Capacity upper and lower bounds are derived for this channel and are compared with lower bounds obtained by numerically evaluating the achievable information rates using quadrature amplitude modulation constellations. Capacity upper and lower bounds are provided for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The multiplexing gain (pre-log) is shown to be $M-1$, where $M$ represents the number of subchannels. A constant gap between the asymptotic upper and lower bounds is observed, which depends on the number of subchannels $M$. For the specific case of $M=2$, capacity is characterized up to a term that vanishes as the SNR grows large.</description>

      <title>Robust Instance Optimal Phase-Only Compressed Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase-only compressed sensing (PO-CS) concerns the recovery of sparse signals from the phases of complex measurements. Recent results show that sparse signals in the standard sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ can be exactly recovered from complex Gaussian phases by a linearization procedure, which recasts PO-CS as linear compressed sensing and then applies (quadratically constrained) basis pursuit to obtain $\mathbf{x}^\sharp$. This paper focuses on the instance optimality and robustness of $\mathbf{x}^{\sharp}$. First, we strengthen the nonuniform instance optimality of Jacques and Feuillen (2021) to a uniform one over the entire signal space. We show the existence of some universal constant $C$ such that $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2\le Cs^{-1/2}\sigma_{\ell_1}(\mathbf{x},\Sigma^n_s)$ holds for all $\mathbf{x}$ in the unit Euclidean sphere, where $\sigma_{\ell_1}(\mathbf{x},\Sigma^n_s)$ is the $\ell_1$ distance of $\mathbf{x}$ to its closest $s$-sparse signal. This is achieved by showing the new sensing matrices corresponding to all approximately sparse signals simultaneously satisfy RIP. Second, we investigate the estimator's robustness to noise and corruption. We show that dense noise with entries bounded by some small $\tau_0$, appearing either prior or posterior to retaining the phases, increments $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2$ by $O(\tau_0)$. This is near-optimal (up to log factors) for any algorithm. On the other hand, adversarial corruption, which changes an arbitrary $\zeta_0$-fraction of the measurements to any phase-only values, increments $\|\mathbf{x}^\sharp-\mathbf{x}\|_2$ by $O(\sqrt{\zeta_0\log(1/\zeta_0)})$. The developments are then combined to yield a robust instance optimal guarantee that resembles the standard one in linear compressed sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13105v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Service Rate Region (SRR) of Reed-Muller (RM) codes in the context of distributed storage systems. The SRR is a convex polytope comprising all achievable data access request rates under a given coding scheme. It represents a critical metric for evaluating system efficiency and scalability. Using the geometric properties of RM codes, we characterize recovery sets for data objects, including their existence, uniqueness, and enumeration. This analysis reveals a connection between recovery sets and minimum-weight codewords in the dual RM code, providing a framework for identifying small recovery sets. Using these results, we derive explicit and tight bounds for the maximal achievable demand for individual data objects, which define the maximal simplex within the service rate region.</description>

      <title>On the Redundancy of Function-Correcting Codes over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14410v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Function-correcting codes (FCCs) protect specific function evaluations of a message against errors. This condition imposes a less stringent distance requirement than classical error-correcting codes (ECCs), allowing for reduced redundancy. FCCs were introduced by Lenz et al. (2021), who also established a lower bound on the optimal redundancy for FCCs over the binary field. Here, we derive an upper bound within a logarithmic factor of this lower bound. We show that the same lower bound holds for any finite field. Moreover, we show that this bound is tight for sufficiently large fields by demonstrating that it also serves as an upper bound. Furthermore, we construct an encoding scheme that achieves this optimal redundancy. Finally, motivated by these two extreme regimes, we conjecture that our bound serves as a valid upper bound across all finite fields.</description>

      <title>Generalized Code Index Modulation Aided AFDM for Spread Spectrum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently proposed affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a new transmission waveform that has shown excellent performance in high-mobility environments, making it a sensible option for the next-generation wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate an energy-efficient generalized code index modulation scheme for AFDM by leveraging spread spectrum, referred to as GCIM-AFDM-SS, to combat the interference caused by the doubly dispersive channels. Specifically, the information bits are conveyed by the transmitted symbols as well as the indices of the selected spreading codes in our proposed GCIM-AFDM-SS scheme. To avoid extensive computations, we also develop a lowcomplexity maximal ratio combining (MRC) detector algorithm, which recovers the spreading codes first and demodulates the symbols afterwards. Moreover, an upper bound on the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed GCIM-AFDM-SS system with maximum-likelihood (ML) detection is derived. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed GCIM-AFDM-SS system over the classical AFDM spread spectrum (AFDM-SS) and the existing index modulated AFDM (IM-AFDM) systems.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Multiuser Scheduling in MIMO-OFDM Systems with Hybrid Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the multiuser scheduling problem in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and hybrid beamforming in which a base station (BS) communicates with multiple users over millimeter wave (mmWave) channels in the downlink. Improved scheduling is critical for enhancing spectral efficiency and the long-term performance of the system from the perspective of proportional fairness (PF) metric in hybrid beamforming systems due to its limited multiplexing gain. Our objective is to maximize PF by properly designing the analog and digital precoders within the hybrid beamforming and selecting the users subject to the number of radio frequency (RF) chains. Leveraging the characteristics of mmWave channels, we apply a two-timescale protocol. On a long timescale, we assign an analog beam to each user. Scheduling the users and designing the digital precoder are done accordingly on a short timescale. To conduct scheduling, we propose combinatorial solutions, such as greedy and sorting algorithms, followed by a machine learning (ML) approach. Our numerical results highlight the trade-off between the performance and complexity of the proposed approaches. Consequently, we show that the choice of approach depends on the specific criteria within a given scenario.</description>

      <title>Maximal Achievable Service Rates of Codes and Connections to Combinatorial Designs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the service-rate region (SRR) of distributed storage systems that employ linear codes. We focus on systems where each server stores one code symbol, and a user recovers a data symbol by accessing any of its recovery groups, subject to per-server capacity limits. The SRR--the convex polytope of simultaneously achievable request rates--captures system throughput and scalability. We first derive upper and lower bounds on the maximum request rate of each data object. These bounds hold for all linear codes and depend only on the number of parity checks orthogonal to a particular set of codeword coordinates associated with that object, i.e., the equations used in majority-logic decoding, and on code parameters. We then check the bound saturation for 1) all non-systematic codes whose SRRs are already known and 2) systematic codes. For the former, we prove the bounds are tight. For systematic codes, we show that the upper bound is achieved whenever the supports of minimum-weight dual codewords form a 2-design. As an application, we determine the exact per-object demand limits for binary Hamming codes. Our framework provides a new lens to address the SRR problem through combinatorial design theory.</description>

      <title>Poset-Markov Channels: Capacity via Group Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing channel capacity is in general intractable because it is given by the limit of a sequence of optimization problems whose dimensionality grows to infinity. As a result, constant-sized characterizations of feedback or non-feedback capacity are known for only a few classes of channels with memory. This paper introduces poset-causal channels$\unicode{x2014}$a new formalism of a communication channel in which channel inputs and outputs are indexed by the elements of a partially ordered set (poset). We develop a novel methodology that allows us to establish a single-letter upper bound on the feedback capacity of a subclass of poset-causal channels whose memory structure exhibits a Markov property and symmetry. The methodology is based on symmetry reduction in optimization. We instantiate our method on two channel models: the Noisy Output is The STate (NOST) channel$\unicode{x2014}$for which the bound is tight$\unicode{x2014}$and a new two-dimensional extension of it.</description>

      <title>Towards the ultimate limits of quantum channel discrimination and quantum communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distinguishability is fundamental to information theory and extends naturally to quantum systems. While quantum state discrimination is well understood, quantum channel discrimination remains challenging due to the dynamic nature of channels and the variety of discrimination strategies. This work advances the understanding of quantum channel discrimination and its fundamental limits. We develop new tools for quantum divergences, including sharper bounds on the quantum hypothesis testing relative entropy and additivity results for channel divergences. We establish a quantum Stein's lemma for memoryless channel discrimination, and link the strong converse property to the asymptotic equipartition property and continuity of divergences. Notably, we prove the equivalence of exponentially strong converse properties under coherent and sequential strategies. We further explore the interplay among operational regimes, discrimination strategies, and channel divergences, deriving exponents in various settings and contributing to a unified framework for channel discrimination. Finally, we recast quantum communication tasks as discrimination problems, uncovering deep connections between channel capacities, channel discrimination, and the mathematical structure of channel divergences. These results bridge two core areas of quantum information theory and offer new insights for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Barycentric bounds on the error exponents of quantum hypothesis exclusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state exclusion is an operational task that has significance in studying foundational questions related to interpreting quantum theory. In such a task, one is given a system whose state is randomly selected from a finite set, and the goal is to identify a state from the set that is not the true state of the system. An error, i.e., an unsuccessful exclusion, occurs if and only if the state identified is the true state. In this paper, we study the optimal error probability of quantum state exclusion and its error exponent -- the rate at which the error probability decays asymptotically -- from an information-theoretic perspective. Our main finding is a single-letter upper bound on the error exponent of state exclusion given by the multivariate log-Euclidean Chernoff divergence, and we prove that this improves upon the best previously known upper bound. We also extend our analysis to the more complicated task of quantum channel exclusion, and we establish a single-letter and efficiently computable upper bound on its error exponent, even assuming the use of adaptive strategies. We derive both upper bounds, for state and channel exclusion, based on one-shot analysis and formulate them as a type of multivariate divergence measure called a barycentric Chernoff divergence. Moreover, our result on channel exclusion has implications in two important special cases. First, for the special case of two hypotheses, our upper bound provides the first known efficiently computable upper bound on the error exponent of symmetric binary channel discrimination. Second, for the special case of classical channels, we show that our upper bound is achievable by a parallel strategy, thus solving the exact error exponent of classical channel exclusion and generalising a similar result on symmetric binary classical channel discrimination.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kneser--Poulsen conjecture asserts that the volume of a union of balls in Euclidean space cannot be increased by bringing their centres pairwise closer. We prove that its natural information-theoretic counterpart is true. This follows from a complete answer to a question asked in arXiv:2210.12842 about Gaussian convolutions, namely that the R\'enyi entropy comparisons between a probability measure and its contractive image are preserved when both undergo simultaneous heat flow. An inequality that unifies Costa's result on the concavity of entropy power with the entropic Kneser--Poulsen theorem is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02777v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The even online Kolmogorov complexity of a string $x = x_1 x_2 \cdots x_{n}$ is the minimal length of a program that for all $i\le n/2$, on input $x_1x_3 \cdots x_{2i-1}$ outputs $x_{2i}$. The odd complexity is defined similarly. The sum of the odd and even complexities is called the dialogue complexity.
  In [Bauwens, 2014] it is proven that for all $n$, there exist $n$-bit $x$ for which the dialogue complexity exceeds the Kolmogorov complexity by $n\log \frac 4 3 + O(\log n)$. Let $\mathrm C^s(x)$ denote the Kolmogorov complexity with space bound~$s$. Here, we prove that the space-bounded dialogue complexity with bound $s + 6n + O(1)$ is at most $\mathrm C^{s}(x) + O(\log (sn))$, where $n=|x|$.</description>

      <title>Improved Offline Contextual Bandits with Second-Order Bounds: Betting and Freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider off-policy selection and learning in contextual bandits, where the learner aims to select or train a reward-maximizing policy using data collected by a fixed behavior policy. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we propose a novel off-policy selection method that leverages a new betting-based confidence bound applied to an inverse propensity weight sequence. Our theoretical analysis reveals that this method achieves a significantly improved, variance-adaptive guarantee over prior work. Second, we propose a novel and generic condition on the optimization objective for off-policy learning that strikes a different balance between bias and variance. One special case, which we call freezing, tends to induce low variance, which is preferred in small-data regimes. Our analysis shows that it matches the best existing guarantees. In our empirical study, our selection method outperforms existing methods, and freezing exhibits improved performance in small-sample regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates prime and co-prime integer matrices and their properties. It characterizes all pairwise co-prime integer matrices that are also prime integer matrices. This provides a simple way to construct families of pairwise co-prime integer matrices, that may have applications in multidimensional co-prime sensing and multidimensional Chinese remainder theorem.</description>

      <title>GPS-Aided Deep Learning for Beam Prediction and Tracking in UAV mmWave Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication enables high data rates for cellular-connected Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, a robust beam management remains challenging due to significant path loss and the dynamic mobility of UAVs, which can destabilize the UAV-base station (BS) link. This research presents a GPS-aided deep learning (DL) model that simultaneously predicts current and future optimal beams for UAV mmWave communications, maintaining a Top-1 prediction accuracy exceeding 70% and an average power loss below 0.6 dB across all prediction steps. These outcomes stem from a proposed data set splitting method ensuring balanced label distribution, paired with a GPS preprocessing technique that extracts key positional features, and a DL architecture that maps sequential position data to beam index predictions. The model reduces overhead by approximately 93% (requiring the training of 2 ~ 3 beams instead of 32 beams) with 95% beam prediction accuracy guarantees, and ensures 94% to 96% of predictions exhibit mean power loss not exceeding 1 dB.</description>

      <title>Statistical Signal Processing for Quantum Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, quantum error mitigation (QEM) is essential for producing reliable outputs from quantum circuits. We present a statistical signal processing approach to QEM that estimates the most likely noiseless outputs from noisy quantum measurements. Our model assumes that circuit depth is sufficient for depolarizing noise, producing corrupted observations that resemble a uniform distribution alongside classical bit-flip errors from readout. Our method consists of two steps: a filtering stage that discards uninformative depolarizing noise and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that computes a maximum likelihood (ML) estimate over the remaining data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on small-qubit systems using IBM circuit simulations in Qiskit and compare its performance to contemporary statistical QEM techniques. We also show that our method scales to larger qubit counts using synthetically generated data consistent with our noise model. These results suggest that principled statistical methods can offer scalable and interpretable solutions for quantum error mitigation in realistic NISQ settings.</description>

      <title>A Generic Construction of $q$-ary Near-MDS Codes Supporting 2-Designs with Lengths Beyond $q+1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A linear code with parameters $[n, k, n - k + 1]$ is called maximum distance separable (MDS), and one with parameters $[n, k, n - k]$ is called almost MDS (AMDS). A code is near-MDS (NMDS) if both it and its dual are AMDS. NMDS codes supporting combinatorial $t$-designs have attracted growing interest, yet constructing such codes remains highly challenging. In 2020, Ding and Tang initiated the study of NMDS codes supporting 2-designs by constructing the first infinite family, followed by several other constructions for $t &gt; 2$, all with length at most $q + 1$. Although NMDS codes can, in principle, exceed this length, known examples supporting 2-designs and having length greater than $q + 1$ are extremely rare and limited to a few sporadic binary and ternary cases. In this paper, we present the first \emph{generic construction} of $q$-ary NMDS codes supporting 2-designs with lengths \emph{exceeding $q + 1$}. Our method leverages new connections between elliptic curve codes, finite abelian groups, subset sums, and combinatorial designs, resulting in an infinite family of such codes along with their weight distributions.</description>

      <title>Coupled Entropy: A Goldilocks Generalization for Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence is presented that the accuracy of Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics framework is improved using the coupled entropy, which carefully establishes the physical measures of complex systems. While Nonextensive Statistical Mechanics (NSM) has developed into a powerful toolset, questions have persisted as to how to evaluate whether its proposed solutions properly characterize the uncertainty of heavy-tailed distributions. The entropy of the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) is $1+\kappa+\ln\sigma$, where $\kappa$ is the shape or nonlinear coupling and $\sigma$ is the scale. A generalized entropy should retain the uncertainty due to the scale, while minimizing the dependence of the nonlinear coupling. The Tsallis entropy of the GPD instead subtracts a function of the inverse-scale and converges to one as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. Colloquially, the Tsallis entropy is too cold. The normalized Tsallis entropy (NTE) rectifies the positive dependence on the scale but introduces a nonlinear term multiplying the scale and the coupling, making it too hot. The coupled entropy measures the uncertainty of the GPD to be $1+\ln_\frac{\kappa}{1+\kappa}\sigma=1+\frac{1+\kappa}{\kappa}(\sigma^\frac{\kappa}{1+\kappa}-1)$, which converges to $\sigma$ as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. One could say, the coupled entropy allows scientists, engineers, and analysts to eat their porridge, confident that its measure of uncertainty reflects the mathematical physics of the scale of non-exponential distributions while minimizing the dependence on the shape or nonlinear coupling. The training of the coupled variational autoencoder is an example of the unique ability of the coupled entropy to improve the performance of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Tight Bound for Quantum Unitary Time-Reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-reversal of unitary evolution is fundamental in quantum information processing. Many scenarios, particularly those in quantum learning and metrology, assume free access to the time-reverse of an unknown unitary. In this paper, we settle the query complexity of the unitary time-reversal task: approximately implementing $U^{-1}$ given only black-box access to an unknown $d$-dimensional unitary $U$. We provide a tight query lower bound $\Omega((1-\epsilon)d^2)$ for the unitary time-reversal to within diamond norm error $\epsilon$. Notably, our lower bound applies to general coherent protocols with unbounded ancillas, and holds even when $\epsilon$ is an average-case distance error. Moreover, our result implies a query lower bound $\Omega(d^2)$ for approximately implementing control-$U$ up to an irrelevant phase, which is also tight with respect to the dimension.</description>

      <title>Token-based Audio Inpainting via Discrete Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio inpainting refers to the task of reconstructing missing segments in corrupted audio recordings. While prior approaches-including waveform and spectrogram-based diffusion models-have shown promising results for short gaps, they often degrade in quality when gaps exceed 100 milliseconds (ms). In this work, we introduce a novel inpainting method based on discrete diffusion modeling, which operates over tokenized audio representations produced by a pre-trained audio tokenizer. Our approach models the generative process directly in the discrete latent space, enabling stable and semantically coherent reconstruction of missing audio. We evaluate the method on the MusicNet dataset using both objective and perceptual metrics across gap durations up to 300 ms. We further evaluated our approach on the MTG dataset, extending the gap duration to 500 ms. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing baselines, particularly for longer gaps, offering a robust solution for restoring degraded musical recordings. Audio examples of our proposed method can be found at https://iftach21.github.io/</description>

      <title>Total/dual correlation/coherence, redundancy/synergy, complexity, and O-information for real and complex valued multivariate data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Firstly, assuming Gaussianity, equations for the following information theory measures are presented: total correlation/coherence (TC), dual total correlation/coherence (DTC), O-information, TSE complexity, and redundancy-synergy index (RSI). Since these measures are functions of the covariance matrix "S" and its inverse "S^-1", the associated Wishart and inverse-Wishart distributions are of note. DTC is shown to be the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for the inverse-Wishart pair "(S^-1)" and its diagonal matrix "D=diag(S^-1)", shedding light on its interpretation as a measure of "total partial correlation", -lndetP, with test hypothesis H0: P=I, where "P" is the standardized inverse covariance (i.e. P=(D^-1/2)(S^-1)(D^-1/2). The second aim of this paper introduces a generalization of all these measures for structured groups of variables. For instance, consider three or more groups, each consisting of three or more variables, with predominant redundancy within each group, but with synergistic interactions between groups. O-information will miss the between group synergy (since redundancy occurs more often in the system). In contrast, the structured O-information measure presented here will correctly report predominant synergy between groups. This is a relevant generalization towards structured multivariate information measures. A third aim is the presentation of a framework for quantifying the contribution of "connections" between variables, to the system's TC, DTC, O-information, and TSE complexity. A fourth aim is to present a generalization of the redundancy-synergy index for quantifying the contribution of a group of variables to the system's redundancy-synergy balance. Finally, it is shown that the expressions derived here directly apply to data from several other elliptical distributions. All program codes, data files, and executables are available (https://osf.io/jd37g/).</description>
