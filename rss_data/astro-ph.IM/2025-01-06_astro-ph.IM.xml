      <title>Distribution of the H\"ogbom CLEAN Algorithm Using Tiled Images with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data sizes for next generation radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), are far above that of their predecessors. The CLEAN algorithm was originally developed by H\"ogbom [1974], long before such data sizes were thought possible and is still the most popular tool used for deconvolution in interferometric imaging. In order to facilitate these new large data sizes and reduce computation time a distributed approach to the algorithm has been investigated. The serial nature of the CLEAN algorithm, due to its matching pursuit design, makes this challenging. Splitting the image into a number of tiles which can be individually deconvolved has been investigated, but this creates discontinuities in the deconvolved image and makes it difficult to deconvolve faint sources in the presence of a point spread function associated with bright sources in other tiles. A method of feedback between each of the tiles has been developed to deal with these problems. This new approach has been tested on a simulated dataset containing multiple point sources of known intensity. When compared to a standard H\"ogbom deconvolution the tiled feedback version produced a reconstructed image, containing sources up to 2.1 Jy, which agreed to between -0.1 Jy and +0.04 Jy of the standard method across the whole deconvolved image at a speed up to 10.66 times faster.</description>

      <title>ORACLE: A Real-Time, Hierarchical, Deep-Learning Photometric Classifier for the LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ORACLE, the first hierarchical deep-learning model for real-time, context-aware classification of transient and variable astrophysical phenomena. ORACLE is a recurrent neural network with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and has been trained using a custom hierarchical cross-entropy loss function to provide high-confidence classifications along an observationally-driven taxonomy with as little as a single photometric observation. Contextual information for each object, including host galaxy photometric redshift, offset, ellipticity and brightness, is concatenated to the light curve embedding and used to make a final prediction. Training on $\sim$0.5M events from the Extended LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge, we achieve a top-level (Transient vs Variable) macro-averaged precision of 0.96 using only 1 day of photometric observations after the first detection in addition to contextual information, for each event; this increases to $&gt;$0.99 once 64 days of the light curve has been obtained, and 0.83 at 1024 days after first detection for 19-way classification (including supernova sub-types, active galactic nuclei, variable stars, microlensing events, and kilonovae). We also compare ORACLE with other state-of-the-art classifiers and report comparable performance for the 19-way classification task, in addition to delivering accurate top-level classifications much earlier. The code and model weights used in this work are publicly available at our associated GitHub repository (https://github.com/uiucsn/ELAsTiCC-Classification).</description>

      <title>An Integral Field Unit for the Binospec Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binospec is a wide-field optical (360 to 1000 nm) spectrograph commissioned at the MMT 6.5m telescope in 2017. In direct imaging mode Binospec addresses twin 8$^\prime$ (wide) by 15$^\prime$ (slit length) fields of view. We describe an optical fiber based integral field unit (IFU) that remaps a 12$^{\prime\prime}$ x 16$^{\prime\prime}$ contiguous region onto two pseudo slits, one in each Binospec channel. The IFU, commissioned in 2023, fits into the space of a standard slit mask frame and can be deployed as desired in a mixed program of slit masks, long slits, and IFU observations. The IFU fibers are illuminated by a hexagonal lenslet array with a 0.6$^{\prime\prime}$ pitch. A separate bundle of sky fibers consists of close-packed bare fibers arranged within an 11.8$^{\prime\prime}$ circular aperture. The 640 IFU fibers and 80 sky fibers have a core diameter of 150$\mu$m, corresponding to 0.90$^{\prime\prime}$. Three gratings are available, 270lpm with R$\sim$2000, 600lpm with R$\sim$5300, and 1000 lpm with R$\sim$6000.</description>

      <title>Jewel Optics I: non-redundant Fizeau beam combination without the guilt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The enduring technique of aperture masking interferometry, now more than 150 years old, is still widely practised today for it opens a window of high angular resolution astronomy that remains difficult to access by any competing technology. However, the requirement to apodise the pupil into a non-redundant array dramatically limits the throughput, typically to $\sim$10\% or less. This in turn has a dramatic impact on sensitivity, limiting observational reach to only bright science targets. This paper presents "Jewel Optics", a novel technology that leverages the gains in signal fidelity conferred by non-redundant Fizeau beam combination without the sensitivity penalty incurred by traditional aperture masks. Our approach fragments the pupil into several sets of sparse-array non-redundant patterns, each of which is encoded onto a unique phase wedge. After extensive searching, solutions could be found where all individual sets are fully non-redundant while fully tiling the available area of the input pupil. Each pattern is assigned a common phase wedge which diverts light from those sub-apertures onto a unique, defined region of the detector. We demonstrate a prototype designed for use in the VAMPIRES instrument at the Subaru telescope and find excellent agreement between the design and lab results. We discuss a design refinement for producing fully achromatic Jewel Optics, and finally we highlight the potential for future work with these novel optical components.</description>

      <title>The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) and its prototype phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomy is key today to broaden our understanding of the high energy Universe. When an ultra-high energy (UHE) particle interacts in the atmosphere or underground, it initiates an extensive air shower that produces a coherent radio emission in the 50-200 MHz range. The GRAND project is an envisioned observatory of UHE particles (cosmic rays, gamma rays and especially neutrinos) that will consist of 200,000 radio antennas deployed over 20 different locations each of $\sim$ 10,000 $\rm km^2$. In its current phase, it consists of 3 prototypes running autonomously in 3 different locations: GRAND@Auger in Argentina, GRAND@Nan\c{c}ay in France and GRANDProto300 in China, all at commissioning stage. The first goal of these pathfinders is to demonstrate the viability of the GRAND detection concept. GRANDProto300 will also propose a rich science case, by allowing the study of the transition between galactic and extra-galactic cosmic ray sources. In the following, we present the detection concept, the preliminary designs and layout and the ongoing developments of the experiment.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Anthropogenic Air and Light Pollution on Astrophysics and Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light and air pollution are the two main forms of pollution, containing the highest concentration in urban areas. I set out to investigate the effects of anthropogenic air and light pollution on the night sky, how this affects the astronomical data-collecting process, and how the general public perceives both forms of pollution. This paper utilizes primary and secondary research, referring to different sources: data collected through my telescope, astrophotography, other scientists' research, and survey responses from over 40 people across 2 areas: Southern California and Guadalajara, Mexico. Through this, I have found strong correlations between increased aerosol particles from air pollutants and increased night sky brightness, increased aerosol particles amplifying cloud formation, which in turn increases light reflection, and a correlation between different areas and what they believe about pollution, with many being misinformed on air and light pollution themselves.</description>

      <title>Sequencing Silicates in the IRS Debris Disk Catalog I: Methodology for Unsupervised Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Debris disks, which consist of dust, planetesimals, planets, and gas, offer a unique window into the mineralogical composition of their parent bodies, especially during the critical phase of terrestrial planet formation spanning 10 to a few hundred million years. Observations from the $\textit{Spitzer}$ Space Telescope have unveiled thousands of debris disks, yet systematic studies remain scarce, let alone those with unsupervised clustering techniques. This study introduces $\texttt{CLUES}$ (CLustering UnsupErvised with Sequencer), a novel, non-parametric, fully-interpretable machine-learning spectral analysis tool designed to analyze and classify the spectral data of debris disks. $\texttt{CLUES}$ combines multiple unsupervised clustering methods with multi-scale distance measures to discern new groupings and trends, offering insights into compositional diversity and geophysical processes within these disks. Our analysis allows us to explore a vast parameter space in debris disk mineralogy and also offers broader applications in fields such as protoplanetary disks and solar system objects. This paper details the methodology, implementation, and initial results of $\texttt{CLUES}$, setting the stage for more detailed follow-up studies focusing on debris disk mineralogy and demographics.</description>

      <title>Photometry of outer Solar System objects from the Dark Energy Survey II: a joint analysis of trans-Neptunian absolute magnitudes, colors, lightcurves and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the 696 trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with absolute magnitudes $5.5 &lt; H_r &lt; 8.2$ detected in the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we characterize the relationships between their dynamical state and physical properties -- namely $H_r$, indicating size; colors, indicating surface composition; and flux variation semi-amplitude $A$, indicating asphericity and surface inhomogeneity. We seek ``birth'' physical distributions that can recreate these parameters in every dynamical class. We show that the observed colors of these TNOs are consistent with 2 Gaussian distributions in $griz$ space, ``near-IR bright'' (NIRB) and ``near-IR faint'' (NIRF), presumably an inner and outer birth population, respectively. We find a model in which both the NIRB and NIRF $H_r$ and $A$ distributions are independent of current dynamical states, supporting their assignment as birth populations. All objects are consistent with a common rolling $p(H_r)$, but NIRF objects are significantly more variable. Cold classicals (CCs) are purely NIRF, while hot classical (HC), scattered, and detached TNOs are consistent with $\approx70\%$ NIRB, and resonances' NIRB fractions show significant variation. The NIRB component of the HCs and of some resonances have broader inclination distributions than the NIRFs, i.e. their current dynamics retains information about birth location. We find evidence for radial stratification within the birth NIRB population, in that HC NIRBs are on average redder than detached or scattered NIRBs; a similar effect distinguishes CCs from other NIRFs. We estimate total object counts and masses of each class within our $H_r$ range. These results will strongly constrain models of the outer solar system.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Detection via Differentiable Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct imaging of exoplanets is crucial for advancing our understanding of planetary systems beyond our solar system, but it faces significant challenges due to the high contrast between host stars and their planets. Wavefront aberrations introduce speckles in the telescope science images, which are patterns of diffracted starlight that can mimic the appearance of planets, complicating the detection of faint exoplanet signals. Traditional post-processing methods, operating primarily in the image intensity domain, do not integrate wavefront sensing data. These data, measured mainly for adaptive optics corrections, have been overlooked as a potential resource for post-processing, partly due to the challenge of the evolving nature of wavefront aberrations. In this paper, we present a differentiable rendering approach that leverages these wavefront sensing data to improve exoplanet detection. Our differentiable renderer models wave-based light propagation through a coronagraphic telescope system, allowing gradient-based optimization to significantly improve starlight subtraction and increase sensitivity to faint exoplanets. Simulation experiments based on the James Webb Space Telescope configuration demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving substantial improvements in contrast and planet detection limits. Our results showcase how the computational advancements enabled by differentiable rendering can revitalize previously underexploited wavefront data, opening new avenues for enhancing exoplanet imaging and characterization.</description>

      <title>Observations of Microlensed Images with Dual-field Interferometry: On-sky Demonstration and Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interferometric observations of gravitational microlensing events offer an opportunity for precise, efficient, and direct mass and distance measurements of lensing objects, especially those of isolated neutron stars and black holes. However, such observations have previously been possible for only a handful of extremely bright events. The recent development of a dual-field interferometer, GRAVITY Wide, has made it possible to reach out to significantly fainter objects and increase the pool of microlensing events amenable to interferometric observations by two orders of magnitude. Here, we present the first successful observation of a microlensing event with GRAVITY Wide and the resolution of microlensed images in the event OGLE-2023-BLG-0061/KMT-2023-BLG-0496. We measure the angular Einstein radius of the lens with subpercent precision, $\theta_{\rm E} = 1.280 \pm 0.009$ mas. Combined with the microlensing parallax detected from the event light curve, the mass and distance to the lens are found to be $0.472 \pm 0.012\,M_{\odot}$ and $1.81 \pm 0.05$ kpc, respectively. We present the procedure for the selection of targets for interferometric observations and discuss possible systematic effects affecting GRAVITY Wide data. This detection demonstrates the capabilities of the new instrument, and it opens up completely new possibilities for the follow-up of microlensing events and future routine discoveries of isolated neutron stars and black holes.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Energy Resolution of LaBr$_3$(Ce) Crystal for GECAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study aims to provide an accurate estimation of the intrinsic resolution of LaBr$_3$(Ce) crystal through a combination of experimental and simulation methods. We re-analyzed the data from previous Wide-Angle Compton Coincidence (WACC) and Hard X-ray Calibration Facility (HXCF) experiments, conducted PMT Single-Photoelectron Calibration (SPEC) and radial non-uniformity (also called Spot Scanning, SS) experiments to acquire new data, and combined these results with Geant4 simulations to isolate the contribution of each physical process to the total energy resolution, thereby allowing for a precise estimation of the scintillator's intrinsic resolution. For 100 keV X-rays, the total energy resolution of LaBr$_3$(Ce) crystal is 3.99% $\pm$ 0.04% (expressed as 1-$\sigma$), with statistical fluctuations and intrinsic resolution as the main components, contributing 2.47% $\pm$ 0.00% and 3.06% $\pm$ 0.06%, respectively. We identify two main sources of intrinsic resolution: one primarily due to non-proportional scintillation, contributing 2.28% $\pm$ 0.00%, and the other due to fluctuations in the energy transfer process, contributing 2.04% $\pm$ 0.08%. We quantified six components of the total energy resolution and reconstructed the photon response using Geant4. The consistency between the reconstructed relative light yield and the experimental measurements validated the mass model of the LaBr$_3$(Ce) detector used in the simulations.</description>

Abstract: Based on TESS observations of a $\delta$ Scuti variable WASP-33 obtained in 2019 and 2022, we thoroughly investigate the power spectrum of this target photometric flux and construct a statistically exhaustive model for its variability. This model contains $30$ robustly justified harmonics detected in the both TESS sectors simultaneously, $13$ less robust harmonics detected in a single TESS sector, a red noise and a quasiperiodic noise terms. This allowed us to greatly improve the accuracy of the exoplanet WASP-33 b transit timings, reducing the TTV residuals r.m.s. drastically, by a factor of $3.5$, from $63$ s to $18$ s. Finally, our analysis does not confirm existence of a detectable orbital phase variation claimed previously based on WASP-33 TESS photometry of 2019.</description>

      <title>Extending the cosmic distance ladder two orders of magnitude with strongly lensed Cepheids, carbon AGB, and RGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters can create extreme magnification near the cluster caustics, thereby enabling detection of individual luminous stars in high-redshift background galaxies. Those stars can include non-explosive standard candles such as Cepheid variables, carbon stars in the asymptotic giant branch, and stars at the tip of the red-giant branch out to $z\lesssim1$. A large number of such detections, combined with modeling of the magnification affecting these stars (including microlensing), opens the door to extending the distance range of these standard candles by two orders of magnitude, thereby providing a check on the distances derived from supernovae. Practical measurement of a distance modulus depends on measuring the apparent magnitude of a ``knee feature'' in the lensed luminosity function due to the great abundance of red-giant-branch stars just below the luminosity of the tip of the red-giant branch. As a bonus, strongly lensed stars detected in deep exposures also provide a robust method of mapping small dark-matter substructures, detections of which also cluster around the critical curves of small-scale dark matter halos.</description>

      <title>Doppler correlation-driven vetoes for the Frequency Hough analysis in continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an improved method for vetoing candidates of continuous gravitational-wave sources during all-sky searches utilizing the Frequency Hough pipeline. This approach leverages linear correlations between source parameters induced by the Earth Doppler effect, which can be effectively identified through the Hough Transform. Candidates that do not align with these patterns are considered spurious and can thus be vetoed, enhancing the depth and statistical significance of follow-up analyses. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the method calibration, which intrinsically linked to the total duration of the observing run. On average, the procedure successfully vetoes $56\%$ of candidates. To assess the method performance, we conducted a Monte-Carlo simulation injecting fake continuous-wave signals into data from the third observing run of the LIGO detectors. This analysis allowed us to infer strain amplitude upper limits at a $90\%$ confidence level. We found that the optimal sensitivity is $h_0^{90\%} = 3.62^{+0.23}_{-0.22}\times 10^{-26}$ in the [128, 200] Hz band, which is within the most sensible frequency band of the LIGO detectors.</description>

      <title>Continuous In-Situ and Remote Sun Observation for Space Weather Monitoring and Mitigation of Infrastructure Threats Through an Optimized Heliocentric Satellite Constellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although vital for life on Earth, solar activity poses questions and increasing threats to humanity due to the Sun's unknown dynamics, intensified by our dependence on terrestrial and space-based infrastructure. This situation is compounded by significant gaps in our understanding of space weather phenomena, the Sun's magnetic field, and the need for rapid responses to unpredicted solar events. To address these issues, an optimized heliocentric satellite constellation is proposed that leverages satellites in an Elliptical Walker Constellation. This system offers (among others) equally distributed arguments of periapsis separations and cross-coupled true anomalies with respect to the Sun-centric coordinate frame. In this paper it is also demonstrated that this strategic multi-spacecraft configuration makes it possible to distinguish spatial and temporal changes in solar wind phenomena, reconstruct, in 3D, Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs), predict which space or ground-based infrastructure and when it will be affected by CMEs, maintain continuous coverage of the critical Sun-Earth line throughout the mission's duration, and protect future missions by providing simultaneously in-situ and remote measurements from small and cost-effective satellites.</description>
