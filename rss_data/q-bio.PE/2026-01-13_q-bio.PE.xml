      <title>Designing a Resilient Allee-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In stochastic population dynamics, stochastic wandering can produce transition to an absorbing state. In particular, under Allee effects, low densities amplify the possibility of population collapse. We investigate this in an Allee-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (Allee-OU) model, that couples a bistable Allee growth equation, with demographic noise, and environmental fluctuations modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This process replaces the bifurcation parameter of the deterministic Allee effect equation. In the model, small noise may induce escape from the safe basin around the positive equilibrium toward extinction. We construct a stochastic control, altering the process to have a stationary distribution. We enable tractable control design, approximating the process by one with a stationary distribution. Two controlled models are developed, one acting directly on population size and another also modulating the environment. A threshold-based implementation minimizes the frequency of interventions while maximizing safe time. Simulations demonstrate that the control stabilizes fluctuations around the equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Modeling and analysis of a novel two-strain dengue epidemics model considering secondary infections with increased mortality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we develop and analyze a deterministic two-strain host--vector model for dengue transmission that incorporates key immuno-epidemiological mechanisms, including temporary cross-immunity, antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), disease-induced mortality during secondary infections, and explicit vector co-infection. The human population is divided into compartments for primary and secondary infections, while the mosquito population includes single- and co-infected classes. ADE is modeled through distinct primary ($\alpha$) and secondary ($\sigma$) transmission rates. Using the next-generation matrix method, we derive the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and establish the local stability of the disease-free equilibrium for $R_0 &lt; 1$. Analytical results show that one-strain endemic equilibria lose stability under ADE conditions ($\sigma &gt; \alpha$), allowing invasion by a heterologous strain. Employing center-manifold theory and numerical continuation (COCO), we demonstrate the occurrence of backward bifurcation, bistability between disease-free and endemic states, and Hopf-induced oscillations. Numerical simulations confirm transitions among disease-free, endemic, and periodic regimes as key parameters vary. The model highlights how ADE, waning cross-immunity, and vector co-infection interact to generate complex dengue dynamics and provides insights useful for designing effective control and vaccination strategies in dengue-endemic regions.</description>

      <title>The selective advantage of neighborhood-aware mutants in Moran process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolution occurs in populations of reproducing individuals. In stochastic descriptions of evolutionary dynamics, such as the Moran process, individuals are chosen randomly for birth and for death. If the same type is chosen for both steps, then the reproductive event is wasted, because the composition of the population remains unchanged. Here we introduce a new phenotype, which we call a replacer. Replacers are efficient competitors. When a replacer is chosen for reproduction, the offspring will always replace an individual of another type (if available). We determine the selective advantage of replacers in well-mixed populations and on one-dimensional lattices. We find that being a replacer substantially boosts the fixation probability of neutral and deleterious mutants. In particular, fixation probability of a single neutral replacer who invades a well-mixed population of size $N$ is of the order of $1/\sqrt N$ rather than the standard $1/N$. Even more importantly, replacers are much better protected against invasions once they have reached fixation. Therefore, replacers dominate the mutation selection equilibrium even if the phenotype of being a replacer comes at a substantial cost: curiously, for large population size and small mutation rate the relative fitness of a successful replacer can be as low as $1/e$.</description>

      <title>When is local search both effective and efficient?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02634v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems implicitly define fitness landscapes that combine the numeric structure of the 'fitness' function to be maximized with the combinatorial structure of which assignments are 'adjacent'. Local search starts at an assignment in this landscape and successively moves assignments until no further improvement is possible among the adjacent assignments. Classic analyses of local search algorithms have focused more on the question of effectiveness ("did we find a good solution?") and often implicitly assumed that there are no doubts about their efficiency ("did we find it quickly?"). But there are many reasons to doubt the efficiency of local search. Even if we focus on fitness landscapes on the hypercube that are single peaked on every subcube (i.e., semismooth fitness landscapes) where effectiveness is obvious, many local search algorithms are known to be inefficient. Since fitness landscapes are unwieldy exponentially large objects, we focus on their polynomial-sized representations by instances of valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSP). We define a "direction" for valued constraints such that directed VCSPs generate semismooth fitness landscapes. We call VCSPs oriented if they do not have any pair of variables with arcs in both directions. Since recognizing if a VCSP-instance is directed or oriented is coNP-complete, we generalized oriented VCSPs as conditionally-smooth fitness landscapes that are recognizable in polynomial time for a VCSP-instance. We prove that many popular local search algorithms like random ascent, simulated annealing, history-based rules, jumping rules, and the Kernighan-Lin heuristic are very efficient on conditionally-smooth landscapes. But conditionally-smooth landscapes are still expressive enough so that algorithms like steepest ascent and random facet require a super-polynomial number of steps to find the fitness peak.</description>
