      <title>The Fraction of Clumpy Galaxies in JWST Surveys over $2&lt;z&lt;12$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift galaxies exhibit compact regions of intense star formation, known as ``clumps,'' which are conspicuous in the rest-frame ultraviolet. Studying them can shed light on how they form and evolve and inform theoretical models of galaxy evolution. We examine the evolution of clumpy galaxies with redshift and stellar mass over $2&lt;z&lt;12$ with James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging from the JWST Advanced Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Off-center clumps are detected in the rest-frame near-ultraviolet (NUV) using similar techniques to those in earlier studies based on Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. This is done for a sample of 9,121 star-forming galaxies with stellar masses $\log\left(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\right) \geq 8$. The fraction of clumpy galaxies, $f_{\rm{clumpy}}$, increases from $\sim20\%$ at $z&gt;6.5$ to $\sim80\%$ at $z\sim2.75$ at $\log\left(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\right) \geq 9$. Our $f_{\rm{clumpy}}$ values are generally higher at fixed redshift and increase faster with decreasing redshift than what studies based on HST data found, which we attribute largely to the higher sensitivity of JWST. Clumps make up $15-20\%$ of the NUV luminosity of clumpy galaxies, with little dependence on redshift or stellar mass. $f_{\rm{clumpy}}$ correlates with stellar mass and there is little correlation with specific star-formation rate. Our $f_{\rm{clumpy}}$ measurements are compared with those from simulations as well as other observations. At low redshifts ($z\lesssim5.75$) and intermediate-to-high stellar masses ($\log\left(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}\right) \geq 9$), our results suggest gas fragmentation due to violent disk instabilities to be the dominant mechanism for forming clumps. At high redshifts and low stellar masses, compression of gas during mergers appears to dominate.</description>

      <title>Tidal Tails of Nearby Open Clusters. II. A Review of Simulated Properties and the Reliability of Observational Catalogues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Recent studies using Gaia data have reported tidal tail detections for tens to hundreds of open clusters. However, a comprehensive assessment of the reliability &amp; completeness of these detections is lacking. Aims: This work aims to summarise the expected properties of tidal tails based on N-body simulations, review the reliability of tidal tail detections in the literature, and grade them according to a set of diagnostic tests. Methods: We used a grid of 68-20000 Msun simulated clusters &amp; analysed the formation &amp; evolution of the tails. We compiled 122 catalogues (58 unique clusters) from literature, within 500 pc of the Sun. We employed tests based on photometric, morphological &amp; dynamical signatures, &amp; comparisons with simulations, to grade their tails. Results: Based on the simulations, we analysed the complex morphology of the tails &amp; their properties (e.g., size, span, stellar types, number density, &amp; mass function) at various cluster masses &amp; ages. During the first 200 Myr of evolution, the tails typically form a characteristic S shape, with an amplitude that scales with cluster mass. The tail span increases at a rate of 4 times the initial velocity dispersion, &amp; the near-tail is predominantly populated by recent escapees. Conclusions: In the 122 published tail catalogues, we found that 15 gold &amp; 55 silver catalogues passed the majority of the tests. The remaining 51 were graded as bronze; care should be taken before using these for further analysis. The age, metallicity, binary fraction, &amp; mass function of stars in the tails were generally consistent with those of their parent clusters. The gold/silver catalogues (69 catalogues of 40 clusters) represent reliable samples for detailed analyses of tails. Future data will be essential for further validation &amp; for leveraging tidal tails as tracers of cluster dissolution &amp; the Galactic potential.</description>

      <title>Statistical Investigation of B-fields in Cores and Filaments Using JCMT/SCUPOL Legacy Survey Archival Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SCUPOL, the polarimeter for SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), was used for polarization observations of 104 regions at 850 micron wavelength and 15 arcsec resolution in the mapping mode by Matthews et al. (2009). They presented the polarization values and magnetic field morphologies in these regions. In this work, we took the opportunity to use this big legacy survey data to investigate further the collective statistical properties of the measured polarization in different star-forming regions containing cores and filaments. We did not reproduce the polarization maps but used the polarization value catalogs to investigate the statistics of distributions. In some of these regions, the data from the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA) polarization observation at 1.3 mm wavelength and 2.5 arcsec resolution were also available from the TADPOL survey (Hull et al., 2014). We used that data and compared it with JCMT/SCUPOL values. We also study how the direction of outflows appears to relate to the mean B-field direction from large scale (JCMT observation at 15 arcsec) to small scale (CARMA observation at 2.5 arcsec) for the nine core regions common in both.</description>

      <title>The Missing Giant: Do FAST Spectroscopic Observations Reveal a Scarcity of Large Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Astronomical Environments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with over 100 carbon atoms is crucial to resolving the origin of unidentified infrared emission (UIE) bands. These bands are commonly observed in nebulae and the interstellar medium, yet their spectroscopic assignment has remained unknown for decades. Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), the world's most sensitive instrument operating in the decimeter-wavelength range, we conducted a search for rotational transitions of large, quasi-symmetric PAHs. Our sample included two prototypical UIE sources, NGC 7027 and TMC-1, along with a non-UIE source, IRC+10216, for comparison. A matched filter technique was employed to isolate comb-like spectral features from quasi-symmetric PAHs containing 138 to 194 carbon atoms in the FAST spectra. This method significantly enhanced detection sensitivity to these astrophysically critical molecular signatures. Although no such features were detected, we derived upper limits on the abundance of large PAHs based on simplifying assumptions. These upper limits are lower than the values predicted by theoretical models, which might tentatively suggest that large PAHs may not be the primary carriers of UIE bands. However, this conclusion should be treated as tentative, given that it rests on simplistic assumptions which have not been empirically validated.</description>

      <title>Measurement of circumgalactic extinction in the Kilo-Degree Survey's Data Release 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies reside in extended dark matter halos, but their baryonic content, especially dust, remains less well understood. We aim to investigate the amount and distribution of dust in galactic halos by measuring shifts in the observed magnitudes of background galaxies. Dust absorbs and scatters shorter-wavelength light, reddening background sources. We quantify this effect using multi-band magnitude shifts in the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) Data Release 4, distinguishing it from achromatic magnification. Our pipeline is validated using MICE2 mock catalogues, and we explore potential systematics arising from galaxy selection, in contrast to previous quasar-based studies. Simulations show that input halo and dust masses can be recovered independently and jointly using galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) and magnitude shifts. A minimum redshift separation of $\Delta z_{\mathrm B}\sim0.3$ and brightness cuts are required to minimise overlap effects and the effects of photometric noise, respectively. Applying our pipeline to KiDS data, we first confirm the achromaticity of magnitude shifts in five near-infrared filters ($ZYJHK_{\rm s}$). In optical bands ($ugri$), joint analysis constrains halo mass and dust mass to $0.2$ dex and $0.3$ dex, respectively, yielding $M_{\rm dust}=7.24^{+0.52}_{-0.64} \times 10^7\,M_\odot$ and $\log(M_{\rm halo}^{\rm DM}/M_\odot)=12.33^{+0.08}_{-0.04}$. These results agree with previous studies and represent the first successful measurement of magnitude shifts and halo extinction with KiDS, confirming that galaxies reside in extended baryonic halos enriched by gas and dust from feedback processes.</description>

      <title>Overview of complex organic molecule observations in protostellar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex organic molecules (COMs) have been detected abundantly at various stages of star formation, particularly in the warm protostellar phase. The progress in gas-phase measurements has been accelerated by the advent of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and in ice measurements by the James Webb Space Telescope. Particularly, the community has moved from single-source studies of COMs to statistical analyses because of these powerful instruments. In this article, I review surveys that consider COMs in the gas and ice. The two takeaways from this review include; 1. Gas-phase abundance ratios for some COMs show a small difference across many objects and the ice abundance ratios show similar or higher values to the gas, both pointing to the importance of ice chemistry in COM formation, 2. Some COM ratios show larger differences across many objects which could be due to either chemical or physical effects, thus both factors need to be considered when interpreting the data.</description>

      <title>A Spectroscopic Hunt for Post-Red Supergiants in the Large Magellanic Cloud II: Turbulent Line Broadening in the Spectra of LMC Yellow Supergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars in the Hertzsprung gap are a mixed population of objects in short-lived evolutionary phases: yellow supergiants (YSGs) evolving towards the red supergiant (RSG) phase, partially-stripped post-RSGs, and other, rarer outcomes of stellar evolution. Studies of sufficiently large samples of these objects can constrain massive star structure and evolution during these poorly-understood phases. As part of our ongoing program searching for post-RSGs, we characterized the spectral line profiles of 32 YSGs in the Large Magellanic Cloud using high-resolution spectra obtained with the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan 2/Clay telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We find that the line profiles are strongly broadened by turbulent photospheric motion. After fitting the profiles to measure microturbulent and macroturbulent velocities, we identify two groups within our sample that are separated by the ratio of the two velocity scales. In both groups, the macroturbulent velocity scales with stellar properties such as effective temperature. Additionally, we find statistically-significant correlations between the macroturbulent velocity and other possible probes of large-scale photospheric motions: line profile asymmetry, as well as the amplitude and quality factor of the stochastic low frequency variability measured from {\it Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite} lightcurves. These correlations differ between the two groups of YSGs. Finally, we construct 1D evolutionary models of YSGs in both pre- and post-RSG phases, and find reasonable agreement between the convective velocities in these models and our measured microturbulent velocities. However, the macroturbulent velocities are much higher than the convective velocities in the models.</description>

      <title>Thackeray's globules in IC 2944: the rocket effect revisited by ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prominent Thackeray's globules are a collection of cloudlets seen in silhouette against the bright emission of the IC 2944 HII region, ionized by the Collinder 249 cluster of early-type stars (placed at 2331$\pm$30 pc, derived from a Gaia DR3 analysis of the parallaxes of 11 massive stars). Here we present the analysis of Band 3 ALMA data that reveals the cold emission (continuum and molecular) associated with the neutral gas and its kinematic behavior. Many of the globules follow a linear velocity gradient that can be explained as the result of an acceleration process due to the rocket effect, where freshly ionized material streams away from the globule, compressing and accelerating it. We identified 46 globules (12 of which are new detections), measured their kinematics, and estimated their densities and masses. At least 5 of them are associated with emission of dense molecular tracers and/or millimeter continuum sources and have indications of possible gravitational collapse. We applied a simple model for the acceleration of the globules which accounts for the observed kinematics. In this scenario only the most massive of the globules will be able to gravitationally collapse before being completely destroyed, in the process reaching speeds of tens km/s, and potentially becoming low-mass walkaway/runaway protostars.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in AGN Disks: Tracing Massive Black Hole Growth Across Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dense and gaseous environments of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can catalyze repeated mergers of stellar-mass black holes (BHs), potentially explaining the high-mass tail of binary black hole (BBH) mergers observed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). We present a semi-analytical population synthesis framework that captures key physical processes in AGN disks, including gas capture, migration, binary pair-up, gas hardening, and dynamical binary-single interactions. Our simulations show that AGN disks can produce hierarchical mergers, especially near migration traps, and may contribute to the high-mass, high-spin BBH population. This work opens prospects for constraining both the AGN channel and supermassive black hole growth with future gravitational-wave detections.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx Discovery of Strong Water Ice Absorption and an Extended Carbon Dioxide Coma in 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In mid-August 2025, 0.75-5.0 micron SPHEREx imaging spectrophotometric and ancillary NASA-IRTF SpeX 0.7-2.5 micron low-resolution spectral observations of Interstellar Object 3I ATLAS were obtained. The combined spectrophotometry is dominated by features due to water ice absorption and CO2 gas emission. A bright, 3 arcmin radius CO2 gas coma was clearly resolved, corresponding to Qgas,CO2 = 9.4 x 10{^26} molec/sec. From the SPHEREx photometry, we put conservative, preliminary 3sigma upper limits on the gas production rates for H2O and CO of 1.5 x 10{^26} and 2.8 x 10{^26} molec/sec. No obvious jet, tail, or trail structures were found in SPHEREx images. Assuming all observed 1-um flux is scattered light from an pv = 0.04 albedo spherical nucleus, its radius would be 23 km. Compared to the nucleus size limit r = 2.8km of Jewitt+ 2025, this suggests that greater than 99 percent of the measured SPHEREx continuum flux is from coma dust.</description>

      <title>The Status of the Astrophysical Parameters of Upper Main Sequence Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calibrating the ages, masses, and radii of stars on the upper main sequence depends heavily on accurate measurements of the effective temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff}$) and surface gravity ($\log g$). These parameters are difficult to obtain meticulously due to the nature of hot stars, which exhibit features such as rapid rotation, atomic diffusion, pulsation, and stellar winds. We compare the $T_\mathrm{eff}$, and $\log g$, values of apparent normal B-F stars in four recent catalogues that employ different methods and pipelines to obtain these parameters. We derived various statistical parameters to compare the differences between the catalogues and discussed the astrophysical implications of these differences. Our results show that the huge differences in $T_\mathrm{eff}$, (up to $10^4$\,K) and $\log g$, (up to 2 dex) between the catalogues have serious implications on the determination of ages, masses, and radii of the stars in question. We conclude that there appears to be no homogeneous set of stellar parameters on the upper main sequence, and one must be cautious when interpreting results obtained from using only one of the catalogues. The homogenisation of said parameters is an essential task for the future and will have a significant impact on astrophysical research dealing with stars on the upper main sequence.</description>

      <title>Explaining the Weak Evolution of the High-Redshift Mass-Metallicity Relation with Galaxy Burst Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations suggest a nearly constant gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z \gtrsim 5$, in agreement with many theoretical predictions. This lack of evolution contrasts with observations at $z \lesssim 3$, which find an increasing normalization of the MZR with decreasing redshift. We analyze a high-redshift suite of FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations to identify the physical drivers of the MZR. Previous studies have explained the weak evolution of the high-redshift MZR in terms of weakly evolving or saturated gas fractions, but we find this alone does not explain the evolution in FIRE-2. Instead, stellar feedback following intense bursts of star formation drives enriched gas out of galaxies, resetting their interstellar medium and separating their histories into distinct ``burst cycles". We develop the ``Reduced Burst Model", a simplified gas-regulator model that successfully reproduces the simulated MZR and identifies the dominant drivers of its evolution. As redshift decreases, the metallicity of inflows within burst cycles increases at fixed stellar mass due to increased wind recycling of enriched gas. Meanwhile, the metal mass produced by stars per inflowing gas mass within these cycles decreases because of decreased star formation per gas mass inflowing into the galaxy. The effects of these two processes on the median metallicity largely cancel, holding the MZR constant for $z = 5 - 12$. At fixed stellar mass, the simulations predict lower gas metallicities at higher $\rm H\alpha$-derived star formation rates, in qualitative agreement with the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR), but this effect is reduced in rest UV-selected samples.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of tidal spiral arms: Machine learning-assisted identification of equations and application to the Milky Way</title>

Abstract: Understanding the spiral arms of the Milky Way (MW) remains a key open question in galactic dynamics. Tidal perturbations, such as the recent passage of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr), could play a significant role in exciting them. We aim to analytically characterize the dynamics of tidally induced spiral arms, including their phase-space signatures. We ran idealized test-particle simulations resembling impulsive satellite impacts, and used the Sparse Identification of Non-linear Dynamics (SINDy) method to infer their governing Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We validated the method with analytical derivations and a realistic $N$-body simulation of a MW-Sgr encounter analogue. For small perturbations, a linear system of equations was recovered with SINDy, consistent with predictions from linearised collisionless dynamics. In this case, two distinct waves wrapping at pattern speeds $\Omega \pm \kappa/m$ emerge. For large impacts, we empirically discovered a non-linear system of equations, representing a novel formulation for the dynamics of tidally induced spiral arms. For both cases, these equations describe wave properties like amplitude and pattern speed, and their shape and temporal evolution in different phase-space projections. We fit the Gaia $L_Z-V_R$ waves with the linear model, providing a reasonable fit and plausible parameters for the Sgr passage. However, the predicted amplitude ratio of the two waves is inconsistent with observations, supporting a more complex origin for this feature (e.g. multiple passages, bar, spiral arms). We merge data-driven discovery with theory to create simple, accurate models of tidal spiral arms that match simulations and provide a simple tool to fit Gaia and external galaxy data. This methodology could be extended to model complex phenomena like self-gravity and dynamical friction. (ABR)</description>

      <title>CU-JADE: A Method for Traversing Extinction Jumps along the Line of Sight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although interstellar dust extinction serves as a powerful distance estimator, the solar system's location within the Galactic plane complicates distance determinations, especially for molecular clouds (MCs) at varying distances along the line of sight (LoS). The presence of complex extinction patterns along the LoS introduces degeneracies, resulting in less accurate distance measurements to overlapping MCs in crowded regions of the Galactic plane. In this study, we develop the CUSUM-based Jump-point Analysis for Distance Estimation (CU-JADE), a novel method designed to help mitigate these observational challenges. The key strengths of CU-JADE include: (1) sensitivity to detect abrupt jumps in Distance-$A_{\lambda}$ ($D$-$A$) datasets, (2) minimal systematic errors as demonstrated on both mock and observed data, and (3) the ability to combine CUSUM analysis with multiwavelength data to improve the completeness of distance measurements for nearby gas structures, even for extinction values as low as $\Delta A_{V} \gtrsim 0.15$ mag. By combining CO survey data with a large sample of stars characterized by high-precision parallaxes and extinctions, we uncovered the multilayered molecular gas distribution in the high-latitude Cepheus region. We also determined accurate distances to MCs beyond the Cygnus Rift by analyzing the intricate structure of gas and extinction within the Galactic plane. Additionally, we constructed a full-sky 3D extinction map extending to 4 kpc, which provides critical insights into dense interstellar medium components dominated by molecular hydrogen. These results advance our understanding of the spatial distribution and physical properties of MCs across the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>The Tremaine-Weinberg method at high redshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18292v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the reliability of the Tremaine-Weinberg (TW) method in measuring the pattern speed of barred galaxies at high redshifts. Measuring pattern speeds at high redshift may help to shed light on the time evolution of interactions between galactic bars and dark matter halos. The TW method has been extensively employed for nearby galaxies, and its accuracy in determining bar pattern speeds has been validated through numerical simulations. For nearby galaxies, the method yields acceptable results when the inclination angle of the galaxy and the position angle of the bar fall within appropriate ranges. However, the application of the TW method to high-redshift galaxies remains unexplored in both observations and simulations. For this study we generated mock observations of barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. These simulated observations were tailored to mimic the integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy data that the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) would capture at a redshift of $z\simeq 1.2$. By applying the TW method to these mock observations and comparing the results with the known pattern speeds, we demonstrate that the TW method performs adequately for barred galaxies whose bars are sufficiently long to be detected by JWST at high redshifts. This work opens a new avenue for applying the TW method to investigate the properties of high-redshift barred galaxies.</description>

      <title>Populations of evolved massive binary stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud I: Predictions from detailed evolution models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. The majority of massive stars are born with a close binary companion. How this affects their evolution and fate is still largely uncertain, especially at low metallicity. Aims. We derive synthetic populations of massive post-interaction binary products and compare them with corresponding observed populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Methods. We analyse 53298 detailed binary evolutionary models computed with MESA. Our models include the physics of rotation, mass and angular momentum transfer, magnetic internal angular momentum transport, and tidal spin-orbit coupling. They cover initial primary masses of 5-100Msun, initial mass ratios of 0.3-0.95, and all initial periods for which interaction is expected. They are evolved through the first mass transfer and the donor star death, a possible ensuing Be/X-ray binary phase, and they end when the mass gainer leaves the main sequence. Results.In our fiducial synthetic population, 8% of the OB stars in the SMC are post-mass transfer systems, and 7% are merger products. In many of our models, the mass gainers are spun up and form Oe/Be stars. While our model underpredicts the number of Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC, it reproduces the main features of their orbital period distribution and the observed number of SMC binary WR stars. We expect $\sim$50 OB+BH binaries below and $\sim$170 above 20d orbital period. The latter might produce merging double BHs. However, their progenitors, the predicted long-period WR+OB binaries, are not observed. Conclusions. While the comparison with the observed SMC stars supports many physics assumptions in our high-mass binary models, a better match of the large number of observed OBe stars and Be/X-ray binaries likely requires a lower merger rate and/or a higher mass transfer efficiency during the first mass transfer. The fate of the initially wide O star binaries remains uncertain.</description>

      <title>The Prospect from the Upcoming CMB Experiment LiteBIRD to Discover Axion-like Particles Using Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of axion-like particles (ALPs) can be probed from their signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) due to the photon-ALP resonant conversion over the mass range of ALPs that matches with the effective mass of photons in the plasma in the astrophysical systems. Such a conversion can also occur in the Milky Way halo and disk and can cause a unique spatial and spectral distortion. The signal is highly non-Gaussian and cannot be measured precisely by the usual power-spectrum approach. We devise a new technique to search for this signal from the upcoming full-sky CMB experiment LiteBIRD using its multi-frequency band using a template-based spatial profile of the ALP distortion signal. This technique captures the large-scale non-Gaussian aspects of the ALP distortion signal in terms of a spatial template and makes it possible to search for any non-zero ALP signal. We show that the inference of the ALP coupling using the template-based technique from LiteBIRD can provide constraints on the coupling constant approximately $ g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ for ALP masses below $10^{-14}$ eV at 95\% confidence interval which is an order of magnitude better than the current bounds from CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST) at $g_{a\gamma} &lt; 6.6 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$, This shows the capability of future multi-band CMB experiment LiteBIRD in opening the discovery space towards physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic star candidates in Gaia Data Release 3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars, binary pairs with a cool giant fueling accretion onto a hot compact companion, offer unique insights to our understanding of stellar evolution. Yet, only a few hundred symbiotic stars are confirmed. Here, we report on a new search for symbiotic star candidates in Gaia Data Release 3 (GDR3), based entirely on the archive's astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic information. To begin our search, we identified known symbiotic stars in GDR3 and assessed their absolute magnitude and colors, which are dominated by the cool giant. We also considered measures of astrometric quality that might be affected by binary motion in these systems. Finally, from those sources with Gaia spectroscopic data, we built a low-resolution spectral template that characterizes the unique features of these systems, including H$\alpha$ emission from interaction with the giant's wind and radiation from the hot star. We then queried the full GDR3 archive for sources with spectroscopic data that are bright (&lt; 17 mag in G-band), have modest relative parallax uncertainties (&lt; 20%), and fall within a region of color-magnitude space characteristic of red giants, keeping only sources with spectra that quantitatively match our template. A machine-learning algorithm, trained on known symbiotic stars, produced a new catalog of 1,674 sources. From cross-matches with infrared and X-ray surveys, we present 25 of these sources as particularly compelling candidates for new symbiotic stars.</description>

      <title>Growing the Intermediate-mass Black Hole in Omega Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of fast-moving stars in the core of Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen), the most massive globular cluster (GC) in the Milky Way, has provided strong evidence for the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). As $\omega$ Cen, is likely the accreted nucleus of a dwarf galaxy, this IMBH also represents a unique opportunity to study BH seeding mechanisms and their potential role in the formation of supermassive BHs. We present Monte Carlo $N$-body models of $\omega$ Cen with detailed treatments for the loss cone dynamics involving stars, binaries, and compact objects. Starting with BH seeds of $500-5000 \, M_{\odot}$ (consistent with runaway collisions of massive stars), our cluster models grow IMBHs with masses of $\sim50{,}000 \, M_{\odot}$ after 12 Gyr, while successfully reproducing the present-day surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of $\omega$ Cen. We find a population of fast stars similar to those observed in the core of $\omega$ Cen, with the fastest stars originating from binaries that were tidally disrupted by the IMBH. The IMBH growth is primarily driven by mergers with $30-40 \, M_{\odot}$ BHs, suggesting a present-day IMBH-BH merger rate of $\sim(4-8)\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$ in $\omega$ Cen-like GCs. Our models also predict a similar rate of tidal disruption events ($\sim5\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$) which, depending on the frequency of $\omega$ Cen-like GCs per galaxy, may represent anywhere from $0.1\%$ to $10\%$ of the observed TDE rate.</description>

      <title>Detection of young massive white dwarfs in core-collapsed globular cluster NGC 362</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Core-collapsed globular clusters are ideal targets to explore the presence of stellar collision products. Here, we have studied seventeen FUV bright white dwarf members in the globular cluster NGC 362 using data obtained from the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) mounted on AstroSat and from HST. Multi-wavelength spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are analyzed using UV and optical data sets to characterize and determine the parameters of white dwarfs. Fourteen of the white dwarfs fit single-component SEDs well, while three showed a good fit with a two-component SED model,indicating a binary system comprising a white dwarf and a low-mass main-sequence star. The effective temperature, radius, luminosity, and mass of white dwarfs range between 22000 - 70000 K, 0.008 - 0.028 Rsun, 0.09 - 3.0 Lsun, and 0.30 - 1.13 Msun, respectively. The effective temperature, radius, luminosity, and mass of the companions (low-mass main-sequence stars) are 3500 - 3750 K, 0.150 - 0.234 Rsun,0.003 - 0.01 Lsun, and 0.14 - 0.24 Msun, respectively. The three binary systems (WD-MS), along with the massive WDs may have formed through dynamical processes that occurred during the core collapse of the cluster. This is the first evidence of a massive WD formation in a core-collapsed cluster, which is the missing link in the formation of a fast radio burst (FRB) progenitor in a globular cluster. This study provides evidence that NGC 362 hosts stellar systems that may evolve into exotic stars such as Type Ia supernovae, and/or FRBs in the future. *This is paper VI of the Globular Cluster UVIT Legacy Survey.</description>
