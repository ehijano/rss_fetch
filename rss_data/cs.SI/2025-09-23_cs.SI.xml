      <title>QUINTA: Reflexive Sensibility For Responsible AI Research and Data-Driven Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) continues to prioritize fairness and the concern for historically marginalized communities, the importance of intersectionality in AI research has gained significant recognition. However, few studies provide practical guidance on how researchers can effectively incorporate intersectionality into critical praxis. In response, this paper presents a comprehensive framework grounded in critical reflexivity as intersectional praxis. Operationalizing intersectionality within the AI/DS (Artificial Intelligence/Data Science) pipeline, Quantitative Intersectional Data (QUINTA) is introduced as a methodological paradigm that challenges conventional and superficial research habits, particularly in data-centric processes, to identify and mitigate negative impacts such as the inadvertent marginalization caused by these practices. The framework centers researcher reflexivity to call attention to the AI researchers' power in creating and analyzing AI/DS artifacts through data-centric approaches. To illustrate the effectiveness of QUINTA, we provide a reflexive AI/DS researcher demonstration utilizing the \#metoo movement as a case study. Note: This paper was accepted as a poster presentation at Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO) Conference in 2023.</description>

      <title>Survivors, Complainers, and Borderliners: Upward Bias in Online Discussions of Academic Conference Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online discussion platforms, such as community Q&amp;A sites and forums, have become important hubs where academic conference authors share and seek information about the peer review process and outcomes. However, these discussions involve only a subset of all submissions, raising concerns about the representativeness of the self-reported review scores. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study comparing the review score distributions of self-reported submissions in online discussions (based on data collected from Zhihu and Reddit) with those of all submissions. We reveal a consistent upward bias: the score distribution of self-reported samples is shifted upward relative to the population score distribution, with this difference statistically significant in most cases. Our analysis identifies three distinct contributors to this bias: (1) survivors, authors of accepted papers who are more likely to share good results than those of rejected papers who tend to conceal bad ones; (2) complainers, authors of high-scoring rejected papers who are more likely to voice complaints about the peer review process or outcomes than those of low scores; and (3) borderliners, authors with borderline scores who face greater uncertainty prior to decision announcements and are more likely to seek advice during the rebuttal period. These findings have important implications for how information seekers should interpret online discussions of academic conference reviews.</description>

      <title>Hodge Decomposition for Urban Traffic Flow: Limits on Dense OD Graphs and Advantages on Road Networks - Los Angeles Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study Hodge decomposition (HodgeRank) for urban traffic flow on two graph representations: dense origin--destination (OD) graphs and road-segment networks. Reproducing the method of Aoki et al., we observe that on dense OD graphs the curl and harmonic components are negligible and the potential closely tracks node divergence, limiting the added value of Hodge potentials. In contrast, on a real road network (UTD19, downtown Los Angeles; 15-minute resolution), potentials differ substantially from divergence and exhibit clear morning/evening reversals consistent with commute patterns. We quantify smoothness and discriminability via local/global variances derived from the graph spectrum, and propose flow-aware embeddings that combine topology, bidirectional volume, and net-flow asymmetry for clustering. Code and preprocessing steps are provided to facilitate reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Limited Improvement of Connectivity in Scale-Free Networks by Increasing the Power-Law Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been well-known that many real networks are scale-free (SF) but extremely vulnerable against attacks. We investigate the robustness of connectivity and the lengths of the shortest loops in randomized SF networks with realistic exponents $2.0 &lt; \gamma \leq 4.0$. We show that smaller variance of degree distributions leads to stronger robustness and longer average length of the shortest loops, which means the existing of large holes. These results will provide important insights toward enhancing the robustness by changing degree distributions.</description>

      <title>MPCG: Multi-Round Persona-Conditioned Generation for Modeling the Evolution of Misinformation with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Misinformation evolves as it spreads, shifting in language, framing, and moral emphasis to adapt to new audiences. However, current misinformation detection approaches implicitly assume that misinformation is static. We introduce MPCG, a multi-round, persona-conditioned framework that simulates how claims are iteratively reinterpreted by agents with distinct ideological perspectives. Our approach uses an uncensored large language model (LLM) to generate persona-specific claims across multiple rounds, conditioning each generation on outputs from the previous round, enabling the study of misinformation evolution. We evaluate the generated claims through human and LLM-based annotations, cognitive effort metrics (readability, perplexity), emotion evocation metrics (sentiment analysis, morality), clustering, feasibility, and downstream classification. Results show strong agreement between human and GPT-4o-mini annotations, with higher divergence in fluency judgments. Generated claims require greater cognitive effort than the original claims and consistently reflect persona-aligned emotional and moral framing. Clustering and cosine similarity analyses confirm semantic drift across rounds while preserving topical coherence. Feasibility results show a 77% feasibility rate, confirming suitability for downstream tasks. Classification results reveal that commonly used misinformation detectors experience macro-F1 performance drops of up to 49.7%. The code is available at https://github.com/bcjr1997/MPCG</description>

      <title>Growing unlabeled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Models of growing networks are a central topic in network science. In these models, vertices are usually labeled by their arrival time, distinguishing even those node pairs whose structural roles are identical. In contrast, unlabeled networks encode only structure, so unlabeled growth rules must be defined in terms of structurally distinguishable outcomes; network symmetries therefore play a key role in unlabeled growth dynamics. Here, we introduce and study models of growing unlabeled trees, defined in analogy to widely-studied labeled growth models such as uniform and preferential attachment. We develop a theoretical formalism to analyze these trees via tracking their leaf-based statistics. We find that while many characteristics of labeled network growth are retained, numerous critical differences arise, caused primarily by symmetries among leaves in common neighborhoods. In particular, degree heterogeneity is enhanced, with the strength of this enhancement depending on details of growth dynamics: mild enhancement for uniform attachment, and extreme enhancement for preferential attachment. These results and the developed analytical formalism may be of interest beyond the setting of growing unlabeled trees.</description>

      <title>Tracking Patterns in Toxicity and Antisocial Behavior Over User Lifetimes on Large Social Media Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An increasing amount of attention has been devoted to the problem of "toxic" or antisocial behavior on social media. In this paper we analyze such behavior at very large scales: we analyze toxicity over a 14-year time span on nearly 500 million comments from Reddit and Wikipedia, grounded in two different proxies for toxicity.
  At the individual level, we analyze users' toxicity levels over the course of their time on the site, and find a striking reversal in trends: both Reddit and Wikipedia users tended to become less toxic over their life cycles on the site in the early (pre-2013) history of the site, but more toxic over their life cycles in the later (post-2013) history of the site. We also find that toxicity on Reddit and Wikipedia differ in a key way, with the most toxic behavior on Reddit exhibited in aggregate by the most active users, and the most toxic behavior on Wikipedia exhibited in aggregate by the least active users. Finally, we consider the toxicity of discussion around widely-shared pieces of content, and find that the trends for toxicity in discussion about content bear interesting similarities with the trends for toxicity in discussion by users.</description>

      <title>Supervised Link Prediction in Co-Authorship Networks Based on Author Node-Based Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the emergence of future research collaborations between authors in academic social networks (SNs) is a very effective example that demonstrates the link prediction problem. This problem refers to predicting the potential existence or absence of a link between a pair of nodes (authors) on the co-authorship network. Various similarity and aggregation metrics were proposed in the literature for predicting the potential link between two authors on such networks. However, the relevant research did not investigate the impact of similarity of research interests of two authors or the similarity of their affiliations on the performance of predicting the potential link between them. Additionally, the impact of the aggregation of the research performance indices of two authors on link prediction performance was not highlighted. To this end, in this paper we propose an integrative supervised learning framework for predicting potential collaboration in co-authorship network based on similarity of the research interests and the similarity of the affiliations of each pair of authors in this network. Moreover, our proposed framework integrates the aggregation of research performance indices of each author pair and the similarity between the two authors nodes with the research interest and affiliation similarity as four metrics for predicting the potential link between each two authors. Our experimental results obtained from applying our proposed link prediction approach to the two largest connected graphs of two huge academic co-authorship networks, namely ArnetMiner and DBLP, show the great performance of this approach in predicting potential links between two authors on large-scale academic SNs.</description>

      <title>Predictable Drifts in Collective Cultural Attention: Evidence from Nation-Level Library Takeout Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting changes in consumer attention for cultural products, such as books, movies, and songs, is notoriously difficult. Past research on predicting the popularity of individual products suggests the existence of intrinsic prediction limits. However, little is known about the limits for predicting collective attention across cultural products. Here, we analyze four years of nationwide library loan data for approximately 2 million individuals, comprising over 100 million loans of more than 660,000 unique books. We find that culture, as measured by popularity distributions of loaned books, drifts continually from month to month at a near-constant rate, leading to a growing divergence over time, and that drifts vary between different book genres. By linking book loans to registry data, we investigate the influence of age, sex, educational level, and geographical area on cultural drift, finding heterogeneous effects from the different demographic groups. Our findings have important implications for market forecasting and developing robust recommender systems, highlighting the need to account for specific drift dynamics for different types of items and demographic groups.</description>

      <title>Predicting Movie Success with Multi-Task Learning: A Hybrid Framework Combining GPT-Based Sentiment Analysis and SIR Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a hybrid framework for predicting movie success. The framework integrates multi-task learning (MTL), GPT-based sentiment analysis, and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) propagation modeling. The study examines limitations in existing approaches. It models static production attributes, information dissemination, and audience sentiment at the same time. The framework uses 5,840 films from 2004 to 2024 and approximate 300,000 user reviews. It shows predictive performance with classification accuracy of 0.964 and regression metrics of MAE 0.388. Ablation analysis indicates component interactions. Selective feature combinations perform better than the comprehensive model. This result questions assumptions about feature integration. The model shows virality patterns between successful and unsuccessful films. Innovations include epidemiological modeling for information diffusion, multidimensional sentiment features from GPT-based analysis, and a shared representation architecture that optimizes multiple success metrics. The framework provides applications in the film production lifecycle. It also contributes to understanding how audience engagement leads to commercial outcomes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the dynamics of external and self-citations and their role in shaping scientific impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms driving the distribution of scientific citations is a key challenge in assessing the scientific impact of authors. We investigate the influence of the preferential attachment rule (PAR) in this process by analysing individual citation events from the DBLP dataset and two Scopus-based datasets, enabling us to estimate the probability of citations being assigned preferentially. Our findings reveal that, for the aggregated dataset, PAR dominates the citation distribution process, with approximately 70% of citations adhering to this mechanism. However, analysis at the individual level shows significant variability, with some authors experiencing a greater prevalence of preferential citations, particularly in the context of external citations. In contrast, self-citations exhibit notably different behaviour, with only 20% following PAR. We also demonstrate that the prominence of PAR increases with an author's citability (average citations per paper), suggesting that more citable authors are preferentially cited, while less-cited authors experience more random citation patterns. Furthermore, we show that self-citations may influence bibliometric indices, such as the h-index. Our results confirm the distinct dynamics of self-citations compared to external citations, raising questions about the mechanisms driving self-citation patterns. These findings provide new insights into citation behaviours and highlight the limitations of existing approaches.</description>
