      <title>Enhancing Financial Data Visualization for Investment Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating the intricate landscape of financial markets requires adept forecasting of stock price movements. This paper delves into the potential of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for predicting stock dynamics, with a focus on discerning nuanced rise and fall patterns. Leveraging a dataset from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the study incorporates multiple features to enhance LSTM's capacity in capturing complex patterns. Visualization of key attributes, such as opening, closing, low, and high prices, aids in unraveling subtle distinctions crucial for comprehensive market understanding. The meticulously crafted LSTM input structure, inspired by established guidelines, incorporates both price and volume attributes over a 25-day time step, enabling the model to capture temporal intricacies. A comprehensive methodology, including hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search, Early Stopping, and Callback mechanisms, leads to a remarkable 53% improvement in predictive accuracy. The study concludes with insights into model robustness, contributions to financial forecasting literature, and a roadmap for real-time stock market prediction. The amalgamation of LSTM networks, strategic hyperparameter tuning, and informed feature selection presents a potent framework for advancing the accuracy of stock price predictions, contributing substantively to financial time series forecasting discourse.</description>

      <title>DeepTraderX: Challenging Conventional Trading Strategies with Deep Learning in Multi-Threaded Market Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DeepTraderX (DTX), a simple Deep Learning-based trader, and present results that demonstrate its performance in a multi-threaded market simulation. In a total of about 500 simulated market days, DTX has learned solely by watching the prices that other strategies produce. By doing this, it has successfully created a mapping from market data to quotes, either bid or ask orders, to place for an asset. Trained on historical Level-2 market data, i.e., the Limit Order Book (LOB) for specific tradable assets, DTX processes the market state $S$ at each timestep $T$ to determine a price $P$ for market orders. The market data used in both training and testing was generated from unique market schedules based on real historic stock market data. DTX was tested extensively against the best strategies in the literature, with its results validated by statistical analysis. Our findings underscore DTX's capability to rival, and in many instances, surpass, the performance of public-domain traders, including those that outclass human traders, emphasising the efficiency of simple models, as this is required to succeed in intricate multi-threaded simulations. This highlights the potential of leveraging "black-box" Deep Learning systems to create more efficient financial markets.</description>

      <title>Long Short-Term Memory Pattern Recognition in Currency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the analysis of financial markets through the lens of Wyckoff Phases, a framework devised by Richard D. Wyckoff in the early 20th century. Focusing on the accumulation pattern within the Wyckoff framework, the research explores the phases of trading range and secondary test, elucidating their significance in understanding market dynamics and identifying potential trading opportunities. By dissecting the intricacies of these phases, the study sheds light on the creation of liquidity through market structure, offering insights into how traders can leverage this knowledge to anticipate price movements and make informed decisions. The effective detection and analysis of Wyckoff patterns necessitate robust computational models capable of processing complex market data, with spatial data best analyzed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and temporal data through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The creation of training data involves the generation of swing points, representing significant market movements, and filler points, introducing noise and enhancing model generalization. Activation functions, such as the sigmoid function, play a crucial role in determining the output behavior of neural network models. The results of the study demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of deep learning models in detecting Wyckoff patterns within financial data, underscoring their potential for enhancing pattern recognition and analysis in financial markets. In conclusion, the study highlights the transformative potential of AI-driven approaches in financial analysis and trading strategies, with the integration of AI technologies shaping the future of trading and investment practices.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Learning Patterns in Financial Time-Series for Trend-Following Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecasting models for systematic trading strategies do not adapt quickly when financial market conditions rapidly change, as was seen in the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, causing many forecasting models to take loss-making positions. To deal with such situations, we propose a novel time-series trend-following forecaster that can quickly adapt to new market conditions, referred to as regimes. We leverage recent developments from the deep learning community and use few-shot learning. We propose the Cross Attentive Time-Series Trend Network -- X-Trend -- which takes positions attending over a context set of financial time-series regimes. X-Trend transfers trends from similar patterns in the context set to make forecasts, then subsequently takes positions for a new distinct target regime. By quickly adapting to new financial regimes, X-Trend increases Sharpe ratio by 18.9% over a neural forecaster and 10-fold over a conventional Time-series Momentum strategy during the turbulent market period from 2018 to 2023. Our strategy recovers twice as quickly from the COVID-19 drawdown compared to the neural-forecaster. X-Trend can also take zero-shot positions on novel unseen financial assets obtaining a 5-fold Sharpe ratio increase versus a neural time-series trend forecaster over the same period. Furthermore, the cross-attention mechanism allows us to interpret the relationship between forecasts and patterns in the context set.</description>
