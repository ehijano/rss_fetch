      <title>Optimised Design of a Current Mirror in 150 nm GaAs Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Current Mirror (CM) is a basic building block commonly used in analogue and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Its significance lies in its ability to replicate and precisely regulate the current, making it crucial in various applications such as amplifiers, filters and data converters. Recently, there has been a growing need for smaller and more energy-efficient Radio Frequency (RF) devices due to the advancements in wireless communication, the Internet of Things (IoT) and portable electronics. This research aims to propose an improved and optimised CM design focusing on compactness and energy-efficient operation. Through a comprehensive methodology involving transistor sizing, biasing techniques, load resistance selection, frequency response stabilisation and noise analysis, the proposed high swing CM design achieves a gain of at least 6.005 dB, a reduced power consumption of 91.17 mW, a wide bandwidth of 22.60 kHz and improved linearity as well as accuracy through precise current matching and minimised mismatch. This optimised CM design will further boost the realisation of compact and lower power RF devices, contributing to the advancement of analogue circuit design techniques and enhancing system performance, accuracy and reliability.</description>

      <title>Applications of wavelet transform in classification of local field potential recorded from the rat brain in conditioned place preference paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the multi-label classification of Local Field Potential (LFP) data from the hippocampus (HIP) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) in the rat brain, focusing on reward responses using the Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) paradigm. Rats were conditioned with saline, morphine, and food rewards, and LFP recordings were conducted from both HIP and NAc during pre- and post-tests. The LFP data were classified into four categories: treatment types, test phases, recording channels, and chamber positions within the CPP setup. Features were extracted using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), Wavelet Coherence, and Wavelet Scattering. Classification was performed via Decision Trees, Multilayer Perceptrons, and Support Vector Machines. Notably, in the Food group, HIP and combined HIP-NAc features yielded the highest classification accuracy for CPP chambers, whereas NAc features excelled in the Morphine group. Employing wavelet scattering, an 80% classification accuracy was achieved across treatment groups, test phases, and channels. Exceptionally high classification accuracies were observed for Food-post-test-HIP (99.75%) and Morphine-post-test-NAc (99.58%). The study reveals that NAc activity is pivotal for morphine-induced CPP, whereas HIP and HIP-NAc connectivity are crucial for food-induced CPP. The proposed methodology provides a novel avenue for precisely classifying LFP data, shedding light on neural circuit activities underlying behavioral responses.</description>

      <title>Holographic Joint Communications and Sensing With Cramer-Rao Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joint Communication and Sensing (JCAS) technology facilitates the seamless integration of communication and sensing functionalities within a unified framework, enhancing spectral efficiency, reducing hardware complexity, and enabling simultaneous data transmission and environmental perception. This paper explores the potential of holographic JCAS systems by leveraging reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHS) to achieve high-resolution hybrid holographic beamforming while simultaneously sensing the environment. As the holographic transceivers are governed by arbitrary antenna spacing, we first derive exact Cram\'er-Rao Bounds (CRBs) for azimuth and elevation angles to rigorously characterize the three-dimensional (3D) sensing accuracy. To optimize the system performance, we propose a novel weighted multi-objective problem formulation that aims to simultaneously maximize the communication rate and minimize the CRBs. However, this formulation is highly non-convex due to the inverse dependence of the CRB on the optimization variables, making the solution extremely challenging. To address this, we propose a novel algorithmic framework based on the Majorization-Maximization (MM) principle, employing alternating optimization to efficiently solve the problem. The proposed method relies on the closed-form surrogate functions that majorize the original objective derived herein, enabling tractable optimization. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under diverse system configurations, demonstrating its potential for next-generation holographic JCAS systems.</description>

      <title>On Performance of LoRa Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper advocates a fluid antenna system (FAS) assisting long-range communication (LoRa-FAS) for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Our focus is on pilot sequence overhead and placement for FAS. Specifically, we consider embedding pilot sequences within symbols to reduce the equivalent symbol error rate (SER), leveraging the fact that the pilot sequences do not convey source information and correlation detection at the LoRa receiver needs not be performed across the entire symbol. We obtain closed-form approximations for the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the FAS channel, assuming perfect channel state information (CSI). Moreover, the approximate SER, hence the bit error rate (BER), of the proposed LoRa-FAS is derived. Simulation results indicate that substantial SER gains can be achieved by FAS within the LoRa framework, even with a limited size of FAS. Furthermore, our analytical results align well with that of the Clarke's exact spatial correlation model. Finally, the correlation factor for the block correlation model should be selected as the proportion of the exact correlation matrix's eigenvalues greater than $1$.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound Phase Aberrated Point Spread Function Estimation with Convolutional Neural Network: Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging systems rely on accurate point spread function (PSF) estimation to support advanced image quality enhancement techniques such as deconvolution and speckle reduction. Phase aberration, caused by sound speed inhomogeneity within biological tissue, is inevitable in ultrasound imaging. It distorts the PSF by increasing sidelobe level and introducing asymmetric amplitude, making PSF estimation under phase aberration highly challenging. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework for estimating phase-aberrated PSFs using U-Net and complex U-Net architectures, operating on RF and complex k-space data, respectively, with the latter demonstrating superior performance. Synthetic phase aberration data, generated using the near-field phase screen model, is employed to train the networks. We evaluate various loss functions and find that log-compressed B-mode perceptual loss achieves the best performance, accurately predicting both the mainlobe and near sidelobe regions of the PSF. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our approach in estimating PSFs under varying levels of phase aberration.</description>

      <title>Audio signal interpolation using optimal transportation of spectrograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating an artificial audio signal that interpolates between given source and target sounds. Our approach relies on the computation of Wasserstein barycenters of the source and target spectrograms, followed by phase reconstruction and inversion. In contrast with previous works, our new method considers the spectrograms globally and does not operate on a temporal frame-to-frame basis. An other contribution is to endow the transportation cost matrix with a specific structure that prohibits remote displacements of energy along the time axis, and for which optimal transport is made possible by leveraging the unbalanced transport framework. The proposed cost matrix makes sense from the audio perspective and also allows to reduce the computation load. Results with synthetic musical notes and real environmental sounds illustrate the potential of our novel approach.</description>

      <title>Handling systematic node biases in TDoA positioning systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Node-specific hardware biases represent significant error source in wireless Time of Arrival (ToA) and Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) positioning. While bias estimation and treatment are well-established in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), their application in wireless Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) remains a significant challenge. This work proposes a methodology, based on GNSS data processing, to mitigate these systematic biases. Specifically, the concept of Differential Transmitter Bias (DTB) is introduced to account for node-specific hardware variations. These DTB are in fact analogous to the Differential Code Bias (DCB) used in GNSS. This paper includes an analysis based on real data from a network of wireless nodes employed in an indoor navigation context and shows that the DTB exhibits remarkable stability, allowing it to be treated as a constant during an entire positioning session, with small variations as low as 2m, which is in the same uncertainty level as the noise of the measurements used by a TDoA-based positioning engine. In an operating positioning service context, these DTB would be transmitted to the user, similarly to GNSS, where satellite clock corrections are provided through navigation messages. This would allow the user to callibrate the TDoA measurements in order to obtain positioning with errors on the meter level.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Doubly-Robust Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in next-generation communication systems is challenged by the heterogeneity of traffic and network conditions, which call for the use of highly contextual, site-specific, data. A promising solution is to rely not only on real-world data, but also on synthetic pseudo-data generated by a network digital twin (NDT). However, the effectiveness of this approach hinges on the accuracy of the NDT, which can vary widely across different contexts. To address this problem, this paper introduces context-aware doubly-robust (CDR) learning, a novel semi-supervised scheme that adapts its reliance on the pseudo-data to the different levels of fidelity of the NDT across contexts. CDR is evaluated on the task of downlink beamforming, showing superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches.</description>

      <title>High-Dynamic Radar Sequence Prediction for Weather Nowcasting Using Spatiotemporal Coherent Gaussian Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weather nowcasting is an essential task that involves predicting future radar echo sequences based on current observations, offering significant benefits for disaster management, transportation, and urban planning. Current prediction methods are limited by training and storage efficiency, mainly focusing on 2D spatial predictions at specific altitudes. Meanwhile, 3D volumetric predictions at each timestamp remain largely unexplored. To address such a challenge, we introduce a comprehensive framework for 3D radar sequence prediction in weather nowcasting, using the newly proposed SpatioTemporal Coherent Gaussian Splatting (STC-GS) for dynamic radar representation and GauMamba for efficient and accurate forecasting. Specifically, rather than relying on a 4D Gaussian for dynamic scene reconstruction, STC-GS optimizes 3D scenes at each frame by employing a group of Gaussians while effectively capturing their movements across consecutive frames. It ensures consistent tracking of each Gaussian over time, making it particularly effective for prediction tasks. With the temporally correlated Gaussian groups established, we utilize them to train GauMamba, which integrates a memory mechanism into the Mamba framework. This allows the model to learn the temporal evolution of Gaussian groups while efficiently handling a large volume of Gaussian tokens. As a result, it achieves both efficiency and accuracy in forecasting a wide range of dynamic meteorological radar signals. The experimental results demonstrate that our STC-GS can efficiently represent 3D radar sequences with over $16\times$ higher spatial resolution compared with the existing 3D representation methods, while GauMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in forecasting a broad spectrum of high-dynamic weather conditions.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Deep Learning on Stereo EEG for Predicting Seizure Freedom in Epilepsy Patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting seizure freedom is essential for tailoring epilepsy treatment. But accurate prediction remains challenging with traditional methods, especially with diverse patient populations. This study developed a deep learning-based graph neural network (GNN) model to predict seizure freedom from stereo electroencephalography (sEEG) data in patients with refractory epilepsy. We utilized high-quality sEEG data from 15 pediatric patients to train a deep learning model that can accurately predict seizure freedom outcomes and advance understanding of brain connectivity at the seizure onset zone. Our model integrates local and global connectivity using graph convolutions with multi-scale attention mechanisms to capture connections between difficult-to-study regions such as the thalamus and motor regions. The model achieved an accuracy of 92.4% in binary class analysis, 86.6% in patient-wise analysis, and 81.4% in multi-class analysis. Node and edge-level feature analysis highlighted the anterior cingulate and frontal pole regions as key contributors to seizure freedom outcomes. The nodes identified by our model were also more likely to coincide with seizure onset zones. Our findings underscore the potential of new connectivity-based deep learning models such as GNNs for enhancing the prediction of seizure freedom, predicting seizure onset zones, connectivity analysis of the brain during seizure, as well as informing AI-assisted personalized epilepsy treatment planning.</description>

      <title>FaultGPT: Industrial Fault Diagnosis Question Answering System by Vision Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, employing single-modality large language models based on mechanical vibration signals as Tuning Predictors has introduced new perspectives in intelligent fault diagnosis. However, the potential of these methods to leverage multimodal data remains underexploited, particularly in complex mechanical systems where relying on a single data source often fails to capture comprehensive fault information. In this paper, we present FaultGPT, a novel model that generates fault diagnosis reports directly from raw vibration signals. By leveraging large vision-language models (LVLM) and text-based supervision, FaultGPT performs end-to-end fault diagnosis question answering (FDQA), distinguishing itself from traditional classification or regression approaches. Specifically, we construct a large-scale FDQA instruction dataset for instruction tuning of LVLM. This dataset includes vibration time-frequency image-text label pairs and human instruction-ground truth pairs. To enhance the capability in generating high-quality fault diagnosis reports, we design a multi-scale cross-modal image decoder to extract fine-grained fault semantics and conducted instruction tuning without introducing additional training parameters into the LVLM. Extensive experiments, including fault diagnosis report generation, few-shot and zero-shot evaluation across multiple datasets, validate the superior performance and adaptability of FaultGPT in diverse industrial scenarios.</description>

      <title>Network Resource Optimization for ML-Based UAV Condition Monitoring with Vibration Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As smart cities begin to materialize, the role of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and their reliability becomes increasingly important. One aspect of reliability relates to Condition Monitoring (CM), where Machine Learning (ML) models are leveraged to identify abnormal and adverse conditions. Given the resource-constrained nature of next-generation edge networks, the utilization of precious network resources must be minimized. This work explores the optimization of network resources for ML-based UAV CM frameworks. The developed framework uses experimental data and varies the feature extraction aggregation interval to optimize ML model selection. Additionally, by leveraging dimensionality reduction techniques, there is a 99.9% reduction in network resource consumption.</description>

      <title>Benefits of Mutual Coupling in Dynamic Metasurface Antennas for Optimizing Wireless Communications -- Theory and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) are a promising embodiment of next-generation reconfigurable antenna technology to realize base stations and access points with reduced cost and power consumption. A DMA is a thin structure patterned on its front with reconfigurable radiating metamaterial elements (meta-atoms) that are excited by waveguides or cavities. Mutual coupling between the meta-atoms can result in a strongly non-linear dependence of the DMA's radiation pattern on the configuration of its meta-atoms. However, besides the obvious algorithmic challenges of working with physics-compliant DMA models, it remains unclear how mutual coupling in DMAs influences the ability to achieve a desired wireless functionality. In this paper, we provide theoretical, numerical and experimental evidence that strong mutual coupling in DMAs increases the radiation pattern sensitivity to the DMA configuration and thereby boosts the available control over the radiation pattern, improving the ability to tailor the radiation pattern to the requirements of a desired wireless functionality. Counterintuitively, we hence encourage next-generation DMA implementations to enhance (rather than suppress) mutual coupling, in combination with suitable physics-compliant modeling and optimization. We expect the unveiled mechanism by which mutual coupling boosts the radiation pattern control to also apply to other reconfigurable antenna systems based on tunable lumped elements.</description>

      <title>Continual Person Identification using Footstep-Induced Floor Vibrations on Heterogeneous Floor Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Person identification is important for smart buildings to provide personalized services such as health monitoring, activity tracking, and personnel management. However, previous person identification relies on pre-collected data from everyone, which is impractical in many buildings and public facilities in which visitors are typically expected. This calls for a continual person identification system that gradually learns people's identities on the fly. Existing studies use cameras to achieve this goal, but they require direct line-of-sight and also have raised privacy concerns in public. Other modalities such as wearables and pressure mats are limited by the requirement of device-carrying or dense deployment. Thus, prior studies introduced footstep-induced structural vibration sensing, which is non-intrusive and perceived as more privacy-friendly. However, this approach has a significant challenge: the high variability of vibration data due to structural heterogeneity and human gait variations, which makes online person identification algorithms perform poorly. In this paper, we characterize the variability in footstep-induced structural vibration data for accurate online person identification. To achieve this, we quantify and decompose different sources of variability and then design a feature transformation function to reduce the variability within each person's data to make different people's data more separable. We evaluate our approach through field experiments with 20 people. The results show a 70% variability reduction and a 90% accuracy for online person identification.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Formulations for System Identification of Linear Dynamics with Bilinear Observation Models</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we address the identification problem for the systems characterized by linear time-invariant dynamics with bilinear observation models. More precisely, we consider a suitable parametric description of the system and formulate the identification problem as the estimation of the parameters defining the mathematical model of the system using the observed input-output data. To this end, we propose two probabilistic frameworks. The first framework employs the Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach, which accurately finds the optimal parameter estimates by maximizing a likelihood function. Subsequently, we develop a tractable first-order method to solve the optimization problem corresponding to the proposed ML approach. Additionally, to further improve tractability and computational efficiency of the estimation of the parameters, we introduce an alternative framework based on the Expectation--Maximization (EM) approach, which estimates the parameters using an appropriately designed cost function. We show that the EM cost function is invex, which ensures the existence and uniqueness of the optimal solution. Furthermore, we derive the closed-form solution for the optimal parameters and also prove the recursive feasibility of the EM procedure. Through extensive numerical experiments, the practical implementation of the proposed approaches is demonstrated, and their estimation efficacy is verified and compared, highlighting the effectiveness of the methods to accurately estimate the system parameters and their potential for real-world applications in scenarios involving bilinear observation structures.</description>

      <title>Time-Domain Classification of the Brain Reward System: Analysis of Natural and Drug Reward Driven Local Field Potential Signals in Hippocampus and Nucleus Accumbens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08288</link>

Abstract: Addiction is a major public health concern characterized by compulsive reward-seeking behavior. The excitatory glutamatergic signals from the hippocampus (HIP) to the Nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediate learned behavior in addiction. Limited comparative studies have investigated the neural pathways activated by natural and unnatural reward sources. This study has evaluated neural activities in HIP and NAc associated with food (natural) and morphine (drug) reward sources using local field potential (LFP). We developed novel approaches to classify LFP signals into the source of reward and recorded regions by considering the time-domain feature of these signals. Proposed methods included a validation step of the LFP signals using autocorrelation, Lyapunov exponent and Hurst exponent to assess the meaningful stability of these signals (lack of chaos). By utilizing the probability density function (PDF) of LFP signals and applying Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD), data were classified to the source of the reward. Also, HIP and NAc regions were visually separated and classified using the symmetrized dot pattern technique, which can be applied in real-time to ensure the deep brain region of interest is being targeted accurately during LFP recording. We believe our method provides a computationally light and fast, real-time signal analysis approach with real-world implementation.</description>

      <title>R-MTLLMF: Resilient Multi-Task Large Language Model Fusion at the Wireless Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-task large language models (MTLLMs) are important for many applications at the wireless edge, where users demand specialized models to handle multiple tasks efficiently. However, training MTLLMs is complex and exhaustive, particularly when tasks are subject to change. Recently, the concept of model fusion via task vectors has emerged as an efficient approach for combining fine-tuning parameters to produce an MTLLM. In this paper, the problem of enabling edge users to collaboratively craft such MTLMs via tasks vectors is studied, under the assumption of worst-case adversarial attacks. To this end, first the influence of adversarial noise to multi-task model fusion is investigated and a relationship between the so-called weight disentanglement error and the mean squared error (MSE) is derived. Using hypothesis testing, it is directly shown that the MSE increases interference between task vectors, thereby rendering model fusion ineffective. Then, a novel resilient MTLLM fusion (R-MTLLMF) is proposed, which leverages insights about the LLM architecture and fine-tuning process to safeguard task vector aggregation under adversarial noise by realigning the MTLLM. The proposed R-MTLLMF is then compared for both worst-case and ideal transmission scenarios to study the impact of the wireless channel. Extensive model fusion experiments with vision LLMs demonstrate R-MTLLMF's effectiveness, achieving close-to-baseline performance across eight different tasks in ideal noise scenarios and significantly outperforming unprotected model fusion in worst-case scenarios. The results further advocate for additional physical layer protection for a holistic approach to resilience, from both a wireless and LLM perspective.</description>

      <title>Robust Information Selection for Hypothesis Testing with Misclassification Penalties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of robust information selection for a Bayesian hypothesis testing / classification task, where the goal is to identify the true state of the world from a finite set of hypotheses based on observations from the selected information sources. We introduce a novel misclassification penalty framework, which enables non-uniform treatment of different misclassification events. Extending the classical subset selection framework, we study the problem of selecting a subset of sources that minimize the maximum penalty of misclassification under a limited budget, despite deletions or failures of a subset of the selected sources. We characterize the curvature properties of the objective function and propose an efficient greedy algorithm with performance guarantees. Next, we highlight certain limitations of optimizing for the maximum penalty metric and propose a submodular surrogate metric to guide the selection of the information set. We propose a greedy algorithm with near-optimality guarantees for optimizing the surrogate metric. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms in several instances of the information set selection problem.</description>
