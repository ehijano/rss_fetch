      <title>Towards improved property prediction of two-dimensional (2D) materials using many-body Quantum Monte Carlo methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of two-dimensional (2D) materials has grown dramatically in the last two decades. 2D materials can be utilized for a variety of next-generation optoelectronic, spintronic, clean energy, and quantum computation applications. These 2D structures, which are often exfoliated from layered van der Waals (vdW) materials, possess highly inhomogeneous electron densities and can possess short- and long-range electron correlations. The complexities of 2D materials make them challenging to study with standard mean-field electronic structure methods such as density functional theory (DFT), which relies on approximations for the unknown exchange-correlation functional. In order to overcome the limitations of DFT, highly accurate many-body electronic structure approaches such as Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) can be utilized. In the past decade, DMC has been used to calculate accurate magnetic, electronic, excitonic, and topological properties in addition to accurately capturing interlayer interactions and cohesion and adsorption energetics of 2D materials. This approach has been applied to 2D systems of wide interest including graphene, phosphorene, MoS$_2$, CrI$_3$, VSe$_2$, GaSe, GeSe, borophene, and several others. In this review article, we highlight some successful recent applications of DMC to 2D systems for improved property predictions beyond standard DFT.</description>

      <title>Skeletal Density Measurements for Adsorbent Nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their tunable material properties, sorptive materials have a wide range of applications in energy storage, water treatment, carbon capture, analytical chemistry, and more. One crucial factor in determining the effectiveness of such materials is their skeletal density, or "true density" because it is often used to calculate key metrics, such as storage capacities. In this paper, we present skeletal density measurements through helium pycnometry for several types of adsorbent carbon materials derived from either corncob, sawdust, coffee grounds, polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC), graphitic carbon nitride (GCN), or metal organic frameworks (MOFs). The measured skeletal density of sawdust-based activated carbon was 2.02 +/- 0.05 g/$cm^{ 3}$. The measured skeletal density of coffee-based activated carbon was 2.23 +/- 0.06 $cm^{ 3}$. We also expound upon the impact that skeletal density has upon hydrogen excess adsorption measurements and other calculated engineering quantities. If a skeletal density is underestimated by 10%, it can affect the room temperature excess adsorption by at least 5% at 100 bar and by 7% at 200 bar, depending on the material type.</description>

      <title>Isolated anions induced high ionic conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key materials in solid-state lithium batteries is fast ion conductors. However, the Li+ ion transport in inorganic crystals involves complex factors, making it a mystery to find and design ion conductors with low migration barriers. In this work, a distinctive structural characteristic involving isolated anions has been discovered to enhance high ionic conductivity in crystals. It is an effective way to create a smooth energy potential landscape and construct local pathways for lithium ion migration. By adjusting the spacing and arrangement of the isolated anions, these local pathways can connect with each other, leading to high ion conductivity. By designing different space groups and local environments of the Se2- anions in the Li8SiSe6 composition, combined with the ion transport properties obtained from AIMD simulations, we define isolated anions and find that local environment with higher point group symmetry promotes the formation of cage-like local transport channels. Additionally, the appropriate distance between neighboring isolated anions can create coplanar connections between adjacent cage-like channels. Furthermore, different types of isolated anions can be used to control the distribution of cage-like channels in the lattice. Based on the structural characteristic of isolated anions, we discovered compounds with isolated N3-, Cl-, I-, and S2- features from the crystal structure databases. The confirmation of ion transport in these structures validates the proposed design method of using isolated anions as structural features for fast ion conductors and leads to the discovery of several new fast ion conductor materials.</description>

      <title>Raman Spectroscopic Fingerprint of Exfoliated S=1 Triangular Lattice Antiferromagnet NiGa$_2$S$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials have been an exciting area of research ever since scientists first isolated a single layer of graphene. Now, since the emergence of 2D magnets, there has been even more potential for interesting properties and applications ranging from spintronics to topological magnonics. Here we report the first successful exfoliation of bilayer and few-layer flakes of S = 1 triangular lattice antiferromagnet NiGa$_2$S$_4$. We establish the reported number of layers of the material by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and detail a careful characterization using Raman spectroscopy to see how the optical, electronic, and structural properties of the crystal change as a function of sample thickness. Our results provide a reliable method of determining the number of layers of the material by means of Raman spectroscopy. The study is accompanied by electronic structure calculations of bulk versus monolayer NiGa$_2$S$_4$. We conclude with an analysis of the possibility of doping monolayer NiGa$_2$S$_4$ by proximity to a metal.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of hole mobility for 4H-silicon carbide through suppressing interband electron-phonon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4H-Silicon Carbide (4H-SiC) possesses a high Baliga figure of merit, making it a promising material for power electronics. However, its applications are limited by its low hole mobility. Herein, we found that the hole mobility of 4H-SiC is mainly limited by the strong interband electron-phonon scattering using mode-level first-principles calculations. Our research indicates that applying compressive strain can reverse the sign of crystal-field splitting and change the ordering of electron bands close to the valence band maximum. Therefore, the interband electron-phonon scattering is severely suppressed, and the out-of-plane hole mobility of 4H-SiC can be enhanced by 200% with 2% uniaxial compressive strain applied. This work provides new insights into the electron transport mechanisms in semiconductors and suggests a strategy to improve hole mobility that could be applied to other semiconductors with hexagonal crystalline geometries.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a Family of Dimerized Quantum Magnets in Ternary Metal Borides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimerized quantum magnets are exotic crystalline materials where Bose-Einstein condensation of magnetic excitations can happen. However, known dimerized quantum magnets are limited to only a few oxides and halides. Here, we unveil 9 dimerized quantum magnets and 11 conventional antiferromagnets in ternary metal borides MTB$_4$ (M = Sc, Y, La, Ce, Lu, Mg, Ca, Al; T = V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni). In this type of structure, 3d transition-metal atoms T are arranged in dimers. Quantum magnetism in these compounds is dominated by strong antiferromagnetic interactions between Cr (both Cr and Mn for M = Mg and Ca) atoms within the structural dimers, with much weaker interactions between the dimers. These systems are proposed to be close to a quantum critical point between a disordered singlet spin-dimer phase, with a spin gap, and the ordered conventional N\'eel antiferromagnetic phase. This new family of dimerized quantum magnets greatly enriches the materials inventory that allows investigations of the spin-gap phase. All the quantum-, conventionally-, and non-magnetic systems identified, together with experimental synthesis methods of a phase suitable for characterization, provide a platform with abundant possibilities to tune the magnetic exchange coupling by doping and study this unconventional type of quantum phase transition. This work opens up new avenues for studying the quantum magnetism of spin dimers in borides and establishes a theoretical workflow for future searches for dimerized quantum magnets in other families or types of materials.</description>

      <title>How precisely are solute clusters in RPV steels characterized by atom probe experiments?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom probe tomography (APT) is a powerful microscopy technique to characterize nano-sized clusters of the alloying elements in the bulk of reactor pressure vessel (RPV) steels. These clusters are known to dominantly determine the evolution of mechanical properties under irradiation. The results are conventionally summarized as the overall number density N and the average diameter D of the solute clusters identified in the material. Here, we demonstrate that these descriptors are intrinsically imprecise because they are steered by the parameters involved in the measurement and data processing, some of which are directly under the control of the operators, but some others not. Consequently, a direct comparison between data derived at different laboratories is compromised, and key trends such as the evolution with dose, are masked. This study relies on a state-of-the-art physical model for neutron irradiation in steels to make reliable estimates of the true microstructure before the measurement is performed, which allows the prediction of the population of solute clusters that are not seen by APT. We mimic APT measurements from simulated microstructures, performing a detailed study of the effects of the parameters of the analysis. We show that the values of N and D reported in the scientific literature can be matched by the predictions of our theoretical model only if specific sets of parameters are used for each laboratory that issued the measurements. We also show that if, on the contrary, all studied cases are analyzed in a consistent way, the scatter of N and D values is reduced.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Technique Study of C2H4 Adsorption on a Model Single-Atom Rh1 Catalyst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-atom catalysts are potentially ideal model systems to investigate structure-function relationships in catalysis, if the active sites can be uniquely determined. In this work, we study the interaction of C2H4 with a model Rh/Fe3O4(001) catalyst that features 2-, 5-, and 6-fold coordinated Rh adatoms, as well as Rh clusters. Using multiple surface-sensitive techniques in combination with calculations of density functional theory (DFT), we follow the thermal evolution of the system and disentangle the behavior of the different species. C2H4 adsorption is strongest at the 2-fold coordinated Rh1 with a DFT-determined adsorption energy of -2.26 eV. However, desorption occurs at lower temperatures than expected because the Rh migrates into substitutional sites within the support, where the molecule is more weakly bound. Adsorption at the 5-fold coordinated Rh sites is predicated to -1.49 eV, but the superposition of this signal with that from small Rh clusters and additional heterogeneity leads to a broad C2H4 desorption shoulder in TPD above room temperature.</description>

      <title>Electric-field-induced magnetic toroidal moment in a time-reversal-odd antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, antiferromagnets with broken time-reversal (T) symmetry have been found to exhibit ferromagnet-like behaviors (e.g., anomalous Hall effect) despite the absence of net magnetization. However, antiferromagnets characterized by T-odd scalar quantities are expected to exhibit unique properties different from the ferromagnet-like behavior. One such example is the diagonal electrotoroidic (ET) effect, in which the application of an electric field E induces a magnetic toroidal moment, an ordered arrangement of magnetic vortices, in the direction parallel to E. Herein, we report the observation of the diagonal ET effect probed by E-induced nonreciprocal directional dichroism in Co2SiO4 holding a T-odd scalar quantity, magnetic toroidal monopole. Using the ET effect, a pair of domain states related to one another by the T operation is spatially resolved. Furthermore, we reveal the inversion of the domain pattern by a magnetic field, which is explained by trilinear coupling ascribed to the piezomagnetic effect. Our observation of the diagonal ET effect paves the way for the exploration of unique functionalities of T-odd antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Fully printed flexible perovskite solar modules with improved energy alignment by tin oxide surface modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully printed flexible perovskite solar cells (f-PSCs) show great potential for the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics owing to their compatibility with high-throughput roll-to-roll (R2R) production. However, the challenge remains in the deficiency in controlling interfacial recombination losses of the functional layer, causing remarkable loss of power conversion efficiency (PCE) in industrial production. Here, a fullerene-substituted alkylphosphonic acid dipole layer is introduced between the R2R-printed tin oxide electron transport layer and the perovskite active layer to reduce the energetic barrier and to suppress surface recombination at the buried interface. The resulting f-PSCs exhibit a PCE of 17.0% with negligible hysteresis, retain 95% of their initial PCE over 3000 bending cycles and achieve a T95 lifetime of 1200 h under 1 sun and 65 degreeC in nitrogen atmosphere. Moreover, the fully printed flexible perovskite solar mini-modules (f-PSMs) with a 20.25 cm2 aperture area achieve a PCE of 11.6%. The encapsulated f-PSMs retain 90% of their initial PCE after 500 h damp-heat testing at 65 degreeC and 85% relative humidity (ISOS-D3). This work marks an important progress toward the realization of efficient and stable flexible perovskite photovoltaics for commercialization.</description>

      <title>Feedback loop dependent charge density wave imaging by scanning tunneling spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy (STS) is a unique technique to probe the local density of states (LDOS) at the atomic scale by measuring the tunneling conductance between a sharp tip and a sample surface. However, the technique suffers of well-known limitations, the so-called set-point effect, which can potentially introduce artifacts in the measurements. We compare several STS imaging schemes applied to the LDOS modulations of the charge density wave state on atomically flat surfaces, and demonstrate that only constant-height STS is capable of mapping the intrinsic LDOS. In the constant-current STS, commonly used and easier-to-implement, the tip-sample distance variations imposed by the feedback loop result in set-point-dependent STS images and possibly mislead the identification of the CDW gap edges.</description>

      <title>Optical read and write of spin states in organic diradicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical control and read-out of the ground state spin structure has been demonstrated for defect states in crystalline semiconductors, including the diamond NV- center, and these are promising systems for quantum technologies. Molecular organic semiconductors offer synthetic control of spin placement, in contrast to current limitations in these crystalline systems. Here we report the discovery of spin-optical addressability in a diradical molecule that comprises two trityl radical groups coupled via a fluorene bridge. We demonstrate the three important properties that enable operation as a spin-photon interface: (i) triplet and singlet spin states show photoluminescence peaked at 640 and 700 nm respectively; this allows easy optical measurement of ground state spin. (ii) the ground state spin exchange is small (~60 {\mu}eV) that allows preparation of ground state spin population. This can be achieved by spin-selective excited state intersystem crossing, and we report up to 8% microwave-driven contrast in photoluminescence. (iii) both singlet and triplet manifolds have near-unity photoluminescence quantum yield, which is in contrast to the near-zero quantum yields in prior reports of molecular diradicals. Our results establish these tuneable open-shell organic molecules as a platform to engineer tailor-made spin-optical interfaces.</description>

      <title>Controlled fabrication of freestanding monolayer SiC by electron irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design and preparation of novel quantum materials with atomic precision are crucial for exploring new physics and for device applications. Electron irradiation has demonstrated as an effective method for preparing novel quantum materials and quantum structures that could be challenging to obtain otherwise. It features the advantages of precise control over the patterning of such new materials and their integration with other materials with different functionalities. Here, we present a new strategy for fabricating freestanding monolayer SiC within nanopores of a graphene membrane. By regulating the energy of the incident electron beam and the in-situ heating temperature in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), we can effectively control the patterning of nanopores and subsequent growth of monolayer SiC within the graphene lattice. The resultant SiC monolayers seamlessly connect with the graphene lattice, forming a planar structure distinct by a wide direct bandgap. Our in-situ STEM observations further uncover that the growth of monolayer SiC within the graphene nanopore is driven by a combination of bond rotation and atom extrusion, providing new insights into the atom-by-atom self-assembly of freestanding two-dimensional (2D) monolayers.</description>

      <title>Helimagnetism in CrBr$_2$ and CrIBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In CrX$_2$ (X=Br, I), a Jahn-Teller effect distorts the octahedral configuration of the anions about Cr, resulting in a "ribbon chain" structure. We previously observed helimagnetism in CrI$_2$ propagating along the ribbon chains, with an 80-90$^{\circ}$ rotation per Cr ion. Via neutron scattering, we report that CrBr$_2$ and the solid solution CrIBr are also helimagnetic, with N\'{e}el temperatures of 17 and 12 K, respectively, and signs of intermediate magnetic transitions in both compounds. The helical angle between spins on consecutive Cr ions along the ribbon chains increases with increasing Br substitution, from 89.7$^{\circ}$ (CrI$_2$) to 116$^{\circ}$ (CrIBr) to 147$^{\circ}$ (CrBr$_2$), possibly as a result of decreasing longer-range intrachain spin interactions with the increased electron localization of the lighter anions.</description>

      <title>Construction and Observation of Flexibly Controllable High-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Skin Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is one of the most fundamental phenomena in non-Hermitian physics. Although it is established that one-dimensional NHSE originates from the nontrivial spectral winding topology, the topological origin behind the higher-dimensional NHSE remains unclear so far. This poses a substantial challenge in constructing and manipulating high-dimensional NHSEs. Here, an intuitive bottom-to-top scheme to construct high-dimensional NHSEs is proposed, through assembling multiple independent one-dimensional NHSEs. Not only the elusive high-dimensional NHSEs can be effectively predicted from the well-defined one-dimensional spectral winding topologies, but also the high-dimensional generalized Brillouin zones can be directly synthesized from the one-dimensional counterparts. As examples, two two-dimensional nonreciprocal acoustic metamaterials are experimentally implemented to demonstrate highly controllable multi-polar NHSEs and hybrid skin-topological effects, where the sound fields can be frequency-selectively localized at any desired corners and boundaries. These results offer a practicable strategy for engineering high-dimensional NHSEs, which could boost advanced applications such as selective filters and directional amplifiers.</description>

      <title>Nature of long-lived moir\'e interlayer excitons in electrically tunable MoS$_{2}$/MoSe$_{2}$ heterobilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interlayer excitons in transition-metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers combine high binding energy and valley-contrasting physics with long optical lifetime and strong dipolar character. Their permanent electric dipole enables electric-field control of emission energy, lifetime, and location. Device material and geometry impacts the nature of the interlayer excitons via their real- and momentum-space configurations. Here, we show that interlayer excitons in MoS$_{2}$/MoSe$_{2}$ heterobilayers are formed by charge carriers residing at the Brillouin zone edges, with negligible interlayer hybridization. We find that the moir\'e superlattice leads to the reversal of the valley-dependent optical selection rules, yielding a positively valued g-factor and cross-polarized photoluminescence. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that the interlayer exciton population retains the optically induced valley polarization throughout its microsecond-long lifetime. The combination of long optical lifetime and valley polarization retention makes MoS$_{2}$/MoSe$_{2}$ heterobilayers a promising platform for studying fundamental bosonic interactions and developing excitonic circuits for optical information processing.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of intrinsic nonlinear Hall effect in antiferromagnetic topological insulator sandwiches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear Hall effect (NHE) can originate from the quantum metric mechanism in antiferromagnetic topological materials with PT symmetry, which has been experimentally observed in MnBi2Te4. In this work, we propose that breaking PT symmetry via external electric fields can lead to a dramatic enhancement of NHE, thus allowing for an electric control of NHE. Microscopically, this is because breaking PT symmetry can lift spin degeneracy of a Kramers' pair, giving rise to additional contributions within one Kramers' pair of bands. We demonstrate this enhancement through a model Hamiltonian that describes an antiferromagnetic topological insulator sandwich structure.</description>

      <title>Changes in boiling controlled by molar concentration-dependent diffusion of surfactants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boiling is a prevalent phase-change process that plays a vital role in facilitating efficient heat transfer from a heating surface. While this heat transfer mechanism is generally effective, a rapid increase in surface temperature can lead to hydrodynamic instabilities, resulting in a boiling crisis. Previous studies have shown that surfactants often improve boiling performance and change the boiling crisis behavior. Conventional wisdom in this field attributes that these changes in boiling behavior are tied to the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the particular surfactant. However, our work reveals that these changes in boiling behavior are independent of the CMC for three nonionic surfactants across a wide range of molar concentrations. In addition, visual snapshots of the bubbling behavior indicate changes in bubble formation, such as bubble size and nucleation site density, influenced by the molar concentration-dependent diffusion timescale of surfactants. Hence, these findings offer compelling evidence that boiling behavior, encompassing both boiling performance and boiling crisis, is governed by the dynamic adsorption of surfactants rather than dictated by the CMC. This becomes evident when quantifying the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat flux (CHF) using the logarithm of molar concentration, as predicted by theory. Building upon these findings, we propose insights for controlling when CHF modification occurs in specific scenarios involving any surfactants. These insights hold significant potential for optimizing heat transfer processes and leveraging surfactants in energy-related applications to maximize boiling efficiency.</description>

      <title>Versatile polymer method to dry-flip two-dimensional moir\'e hetero structures for nanoscale surface characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG), in which two sheets of monolayer graphene are precisely stacked to a specific angle, has opened up a plethora of new opportunities in the field of topology, superconductivity, and other strongly correlated effects. Most conventional ways of preparing twisted bilayer devices require the use of high process temperatures and solvents and are not well-suited for preparing samples which need to be flipped to be compatible with characterization techniques like STM, ARPES, PFM, SThM etc. Here, we demonstrate a very simple polymer-based method using Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC), which can be used for making flipped twisted bilayer graphene devices. This allowed us to produce flipped twisted samples without the need of any solvents and with high quality as confirmed by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy. We believe that this dry flip technique can be readily extended to twist 2D materials beyond graphene, especially air-sensitive materials which require operation under inert atmosphere, where often solvents cannot be used.</description>

      <title>A computationally efficient queue-based algorithm for simulating volume-controlled drainage under the influence of gravity on volumetric images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating non-wetting fluid invasion in volumetric images of porous materials is of broad interest in applications as diverse as electrochemical devices and CO2 sequestration. Among available methods, image-based algorithms offer much lower computational cost compared to direct numerical simulations. Recent work has extended image-based method to incorporate more physics such as gravity and volume-controlled invasion. The present work combines these two developments to develop an image-based invasion percolation algorithm that incorporates the effect of gravity. Additionally, the presented algorithm was developed using a priority queue algorithm to drastically reduce the computational cost of the simulation. The priority queue-based method was validated against previous image-based methods both with and without the effect of gravity, showing identical results. It was also shown that the new method provides a speedup of 20X over the previous image-based methods. Finally, comparison with experimental results at three Bond numbers showed that the model can predict the real invasion process with a high accuracy with and without gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory of spin Nernst effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the microscopic theory of the spin Nernst effect, which is a transverse spin current directly induced by a temperature gradient, employing the linear response theory with Luttinger's gravitational potential method. We consider a generic, non-interacting electron system with randomly distributed impurities and evaluate the spin current response to the gravitational potential. Our theory takes into account a contribution of the local equilibrium current modified by Luttinger's gravitational potential and is thus consistent with the thermodynamic principle that thermal responses should vanish. The Ward-Takahashi identities ensure that the spin Nernst current is well-behaved at low temperatures in any order of the random impurity potentials. Furthermore, we microscopically derive the spin-current version of Mott's formula, which associates the spin Nernst coefficient with the spin Hall conductivity. The spin-current version of the St\v{r}eda formula is also discussed. To demonstrate these findings, the spin Nernst current of three-dimensional Dirac electrons is computed. Our theory is general and can therefore be extended to interacting electron systems, where Mott's formula no longer holds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that a large and tunable valley-selective Hall effect can be realized in a centrosymmetric system via light-induced breaking of inversion and time-reversal symmetries. This is demonstrated in graphene driven by bicircularly polarized light, which consists of a linear combination of left- and right-handed circularly polarized light with different frequencies. We also show that our Hall conductivity is two orders of magnitude larger than the maximum value obtained in noncentrosymmetric systems, and that the main valley can be switched by tuning a phase difference between the left- and right-handed circularly polarized light. Our results will enable us to generate and control the valley-selective Hall effect in centrosymmetric systems.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate [110] symmetric tilt FCC grain boundaries (GBs) by a recently developed approach for quasiperiodic interfaces using the Landau-Brazovskii model. On special tilt angles associated with quadratic algebraic numbers, quasiperiodic GBs exhibit generalized Fibonacci substitution rules. The transition mechanism from quasiperiodic GBs to periodic GBs is explored through sphere offsets and spectral coalescence. We also propose an accurate method to calculate the GB energy for arbitrary tilt angle and analyze the factors affecting the GB energy. The revealing GB energy change is continue along with tilt angle except periodic GBs.</description>

      <title>Theory and Modeling of Transport in Nanoporous Materials: From Microscopic to Coarse-Grained Descriptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review presents the state of the art on the theory, molecular simulation, and coarse-grained strategies applied to the transport of gases and liquids in nanoporous materials (pore size in the range 1 - 100 nm). Recent advances in the understanding of molecular diffusion and transport under thermodynamic gradients in nanoporous adsorbents are discussed with special emphasis on small molecules in zeolites, active carbons, metal organic frameworks, but also in nanoporous materials with larger pores such as ordered and disordered mesoporous oxides. We provide a description of the fundamentals and principles of the different atom-scale and mesoscopic methods as well as of the theoretical formalisms that can be used to address such an important problem. Special attention is paid to the investigation of different molecular transport coefficients - including the so-called self, collective and transport diffusivities - but also to the determination of free energy barriers and their role in overall adsorption/separation process rates. We also introduce other available approaches such as hierarchical simulations and upscaling strategies.</description>

Abstract: Electronic structure simulation (ESS) has been used for decades to provide quantitative scientific insights on an atomistic scale, enabling advances in chemistry, biology, and materials science, among other disciplines. Following standard practice in scientific computing, the software packages driving these studies have been implemented in compiled languages such as FORTRAN and C. However, the recent introduction of machine learning (ML) into these domains has meant that ML models must be coded in these languages, or that complex software bridges have to be built between ML models in Python and these large compiled software systems. This is in contrast with recent progress in modern ML frameworks which aim to optimise both ease of use and high performance by harnessing hardware acceleration of tensor programs defined in Python. We introduce MESS: a modern electronic structure simulation package implemented in JAX; porting the ESS code to the ML world. We outline the costs and benefits of following the software development practices used in ML for this important scientific workload. MESS shows significant speedups n widely available hardware accelerators and simultaneously opens a clear pathway towards combining ESS with ML. MESS is available at https://github.com/graphcore-research/mess.</description>

      <title>Electron Confinement-Induced Plasmonic Breakdown in Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmon resonance in metals represents the collective oscillation of the free electron gas density and enables enhanced light-matter interactions in nanoscale dimensions. Traditionally, the classical Drude model describes the plasmonic excitation, wherein the plasma frequency exhibits no spatial dispersion. Here, we show conclusive experimental evidence of the breakdown of the plasmon resonance and a consequent photonic metal-insulator transition in an ultrathin archetypal refractory plasmonic material, hafnium nitride (HfN). Epitaxial HfN thick films exhibit a low-loss and high-quality Drude-like plasmon resonance in the visible spectral range. However, as the film thickness is reduced to nanoscale dimensions, the Coulomb interaction among electrons increases due to the electron confinement, leading to the spatial dispersion of the plasma frequency. Importantly, with the further decrease in thickness, electrons lose their ability to shield the incident electric field, turning the medium into a dielectric. The breakdown of the plasmon resonance in epitaxial ultrathin metals could be useful for fundamental physics studies in transdimensional regimes and novel photonic device applications.</description>

      <title>Strength of Kitaev Interaction in Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ and Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kitaev spin liquid is proposed to be promisingly realized in low spin-orbit coupling $3d$ systems, represented by Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ and Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$. However, the existence of Kitaev interaction is still debatable among experiments, and obtaining the strength of Kitaev interaction from first-principles calculations is also challenging. Here, we report the state-dependent anisotropy of Kitaev interaction, based on which a convenient method is developed to rapidly determine the strength of Kitaev interaction. Applying such method and density functional theory calculations, it is found that Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ with $3d^7$ configuration exhibits considerable ferromagnetic Kitaev interaction. Moreover, by further applying the symmetry-adapted cluster expansion method, a realistic spin model is determined for Na$_3$Ni$_2$BiO$_6$ with $3d^8$ configuration. Such model indicates negligible small Kitaev interaction, but it predicts many properties, such as ground states and field effects, which are well consistent with measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the heavy elements, Sb or Bi, located at the hollow sites of honeycomb lattice, do not contribute to emergence of Kitaev interaction through proximity, contradictory to common belief. The presently developed anisotropy method will be beneficial not only for computations but also for measurements.</description>

      <title>Determination of Optimal Chain Coupling made by Embedding in D-Wave Quantum Annealer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The qubits in a D-wave quantum annealer (D-wave QA) are designed on a Pegasus graph that is different from structure of a combinatorial optimization problem. This situation requires embedding with the chains connected by ferromagnetic (FM) coupling $J_c$ between the qubits. Weak and strong $J_c$ values induce chain breaking and enforcement of chain energy, which reduce the accuracy of quantum annealing (QA) measurements, respectively. In addition, we confirmed that even though the D-Wave Ocean package provides a default coupling $J_c^{\text{default}}$, it is not an optimal coupling $J_c^{\text{optimal}}$ that maximizes the possible correct rate of QA measurements. In this paper, we present an algorithm how $J_c^{\text{optimal}}$ with the maximum probability $p$ for observing the possible lowest energy is determined. Finally, we confirm that the extracted $J_c^{\text{optimal}}$ show much better $p$ than $J_c^{\text{default}}$ in QA measurements of various parameters of frustrated and fully connected combinatorial optimization problems. The open code is available in \textit{https://github.com/HunpyoLee/OptimizeChainStrength}.</description>

      <title>Computational Supremacy of Quantum Eigensolver by Extension of Optimized Binary Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a quantum eigensolver (QE) which is based on an extension of optimized binary configurations measured by quantum annealing (QA) on a D-Wave Quantum Annealer (D-Wave QA). This approach performs iterative QA measurements to optimize the eigenstates $\vert \psi \rangle$ without the derivation of a classical computer. The computational cost is $\eta M L$ for full eigenvalues $E$ and $\vert \psi \rangle$ of the Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ of size $L \times L$, where $M$ and $\eta$ are the number of QA measurements required to reach the converged $\vert \psi \rangle$ and the total annealing time of many QA shots, respectively. Unlike the exact diagonalized (ED) algorithm with $L^3$ iterations on a classical computer, the computation cost is not significantly affected by $L$ and $M$ because $\eta$ represents a very short time within $10^{-2}$ seconds on the D-Wave QA. We selected the tight-binding $\hat{H}$ that contains the exact $E$ values of all energy states in two systems with metallic and insulating phases. We confirmed that the proposed QE algorithm provides exact solutions within the errors of $5 \times 10^{-3}$. The QE algorithm will not only show computational supremacy over the ED approach on a classical computer but will also be widely used for various applications such as material and drug design.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic fragments in periodic solids: Eliminating the need for supercells and background charges in electronic structure calculations of defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03373</link>

Abstract: To date, computational methods for modeling defects (vacancies, adsorbates, etc.) rely on periodic supercells in which the defect is far enough from its repeated image such that they can be assumed non-interacting. Defects in real solids, however, can be spaced microns or more apart, whereas affordable supercells for density functional theory calculations are no wider than a few nanometers. The relative proximity and periodic repetition of the defect's images may lead to unphysical artifacts, especially if the defect is charged and/or open-shell. Furthermore, to avoid divergence of the periodic electrostatics, a compensating background charge must be introduced if the defect is charged. Even if post-hoc corrections are used, this is a source of unquantifiable error and, in some cases, renders energies useless. In this communication, we introduce an embedding formalism such that a pristine, primitive unit cell may be used for the periodic mean field, after which atoms may be moved or charged within an embedded fragment. This fragment can then be treated with a post-Hartree Fock method to capture important electron correlations pertaining to the defect. By eliminating the need for compensating background charges and periodicity of the defect, we circumvent all associated unphysicalities and numerical issues. Furthermore, the primitive cell calculations drastically reduce computational expense compared to supercell approaches. This method is size-intensive with respect to energy differences and can be routinely applied even to multireference defects, localized excited states, etc. using a variety of fragment solvers. In examining with this approach bond-breaking in a fluorine-substituted graphane monolayer, a difficult testing ground for condensed-phase electronic structure methods, we observe key aspects of the dissociation pathway, specifically a covalent-to-ionic avoided crossing.</description>

      <title>A discrete dislocation analysis of size-dependent plasticity in torsion</title>

Abstract: A method for solving three dimensional discrete dislocation plasticity boundary-value problems using a monopole representation of the dislocations is presented. At each time step, the displacement, strain and stress fields in a finite body are obtained by superposition of infinite body dislocation fields and an image field that enforces the boundary conditions. The three dimensional infinite body fields are obtained by representing dislocations as being comprised of points, termed monopoles, that carry dislocation line and Burgers vector information. The image fields are obtained from a three dimensional linear elastic finite element calculation. The implementation of the coupling of the monopole representation with the finite element method, including the interaction of curved dislocations with free surfaces, is presented in some detail because it differs significantly from an implementation with a line based dislocation representation. Numerical convergence and the modeling of dislocation loop nucleation for large scale computations are investigated. The monopole discrete dislocation plasticity framework is used to investigate the effect of size and initial dislocation density on the torsion of wires with diameters varying over three orders of magnitude. Depending on the initial dislocation source density and the wire diameter, three regimes of torsion-twist response are obtained: (i) for wires with a sufficiently small diameter, plastic deformation is nucleation controlled and is strongly size dependent; (ii) for wires with larger diameters dislocation plasticity is dislocation interaction controlled, with the emergence of geometrically necessary dislocations and dislocation pile-ups playing a key role, and is strongly size dependent; and (iii) for wires with sufficiently large diameters plastic deformation becomes less heterogeneous and the dependence on size is greatly diminished.</description>

      <title>Even Integer Quantum Hall Effect in Materials with Hidden Spin Texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Because spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is invisible in the band structure when inversion symmetry exists, whether spins are trivially degenerate or strongly coupled to momentum due to SOC is presumed to make little difference in transport measurements, such as magnetoresistance and quantum oscillations. In this work, however, we show that hidden Rashba SOC in a centrosymmetric two-dimensional material can lead to the quantum Hall effect with only even-integer plateaus, unlike a spinless electron gas. Here, two Rashba layers that are degenerate but with opposite SOC due to inversion symmetry, hybridize with each other and create two doubly-degenerate bands with hidden spin texture. Correspondingly, two branches of Landau levels interact, resulting in significant suppression of spin splitting due to the balancing of intralayer SOC and interlayer hybridization. Furthermore, we show that breaking inversion symmetry restores the ordinary quantum Hall fluid by introducing spin-split Fermi surfaces. Our theory can apply to centrosymmetric materials with strong SOC, as demonstrated in a recent experiment on the two-dimensional semiconductor Bi$_2$O$_2$Se.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Representations and Node Embedding Graph Neural Networks for Accurate and Multi-scale Analysis of Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03563v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning algorithms, such as graph neural networks (GNN), have successfully predicted material properties. However, the superior performance of GNN usually relies on end-to-end learning on large material datasets, which may lose the physical insight of multi-scale information about materials. And the process of labeling data consumes many resources and inevitably introduces errors, which constrains the accuracy of prediction. We propose to train the GNN model by self-supervised learning on the node and edge information of the crystal graph. Compared with the popular manually constructed material descriptors, the self-supervised atomic representation can reach better prediction performance on material properties. Furthermore, it may provide physical insights by tuning the range information. Applying the self-supervised atomic representation on the magnetic moment datasets, we show how they can extract rules and information from the magnetic materials. To incorporate rich physical information into the GNN model, we develop the node embedding graph neural networks (NEGNN) framework and show significant improvements in the prediction performance. The self-supervised material representation and the NEGNN framework may investigate in-depth information from materials and can be applied to small datasets with increased prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>Tight-binding theory of spin-spin interactions, Curie temperatures, and quantum Hall effects in topological (Hg,Cr)Te in comparison to non-topological (Zn,Cr)Te, and (Ga,Mn)N</title>

Abstract: Earlier theoretical results on $p$-$d$ and $d$-$d$ exchange interactions for zinc-blende semiconductors with $\mathrm{Cr}^{2{+}}$ and $\mathrm{Mn}^{3{+}}$ ions are revisited and extended by including contributions beyond the dominating ferromagnetic (FM) superexchange term [i.e., the interband Bloembergen-Rowland-Van Vleck contribution and antiferromagnetic (AFM) two-electron term], and applied to topological Cr-doped HgTe and non-topological (Zn,Cr)Te and (Ga,Mn)N in zinc-blende and wurtzite crystallographic structures. From the obtained values of the $d$-$d$ exchange integrals $J_{ij}$, and by combining the Monte-Carlo simulations with the percolation theory for randomly distributed magnetic ions, we determine magnitudes of Curie temperatures $T_{\text{C}}(x)$ for $\mathrm{Zn}_{1-x}\mathrm{Cr}_x\mathrm{Te}$ and $\mathrm{Ga}_{1-x}\mathrm{Mn}_x\mathrm{N}$ and compare to available experimental data. Furthermore, we find that competition between FM and AFM $d$-$d$ interactions can lead to a spin-glass phase in the case of $\mathrm{Hg}_{1-x}\mathrm{Cr}_x\mathrm{Te}$. This competition, along with a relatively large magnitude of the AF $p$-$d$ exchange energy $N_0\beta$ can stabilize the quantum spin Hall effect, but may require the application of tilted magnetic field to observe the quantum anomalous Hall effect in HgTe quantum wells doped with Cr, as confirmed by the Chern number determination.</description>

      <title>Voltage dependent first-principles barriers to Li transport within Li ion battery Solid Electrolyte Interphases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charging a Li ion battery requires Li ion transport between the cathode and the anode. This Li ion transport is dependent upon (among other factors) the electrostatic environment the ion encounters within the Solid Electrolyte Interphase (SEI), which separates the anode from the surrounding electrolyte. Previous first principles work has illuminated the reaction barriers through likely atomistic SEI environments, but has had difficulty accurately reflecting the larger electrostatic potential landscape that an ion encounters moving through the SEI. In this work, we apply the recently developed Quantum Continuum Approximation (QCA) technique to provide an equilibrium electronic potentiostat for first-principles interface calculations. Using QCA, we calculate the potential barrier for Li ion transport through LiF, Li$_2$O, and Li$_2$CO$_3$ SEIs along with LiF-LiF, and LiF-Li$_2$O grain boundaries, all paired with Li metal anodes. We demonstrate that the SEI potential barrier is dependent on the anode electrochemical potentials in each system. Finally, we use these techniques to estimate the change in the diffusion barrier for a Li ion moving in a LiF SEI as a function of anode potential. We find that properly accounting for interface and electronic voltage effects significantly lowers reaction barriers compared to previous literature results.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in typical fluorite-type ferroelectrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While ferroelectric hafnia ($\mathrm{HfO_2}$) has become a technically important material for microelectronics, the physical origin of its ferroelectricity remains poorly understood. The tetragonal $P4_2/nmc$ phase is commonly assigned as its paraelectric mother phase but has no soft mode at the Brillouin zone center. In this work, we propose that the paraelectric-ferroelectric transition in hafnia-like $Pca2_1$ ferroelectric family can be described by a $Pcca$-$Pca2_1$ transition, where the $Pcca$ mother phase will evolve into either the $Pca2_1$ ferroelectric phase or the centrosymmetric $P2_1/c$ monoclinic phase, depending on the strain conditions. The $Pcca$ phase is directly linked to both phases in the context of continuous phase transition. Hafnia is regarded as a special case of this family, in that it has accidental atomic degeneracy because all anions are oxygen. The theory is also correlated to the seven-coordination theory that explains the ferroelectricity in hafnia from a chemical perspective. In addition, the strain conditions to promote the ferroelectric phase in hafnia are discussed.</description>

Abstract: An analysis of the processes of plastic deformation and acoustic relaxation in a high-entropy alloy Al$_{0.5}$CoCrCuFeNi was carried out. The following have been established: dominant dislocation defects; types of barriers that prevent the movement of dislocations; mechanisms of thermally activated movement of various elements of dislocation lines through barriers at room and low temperatures. Based on modern dislocation theory, quantitative estimates have been obtained for the most important characteristics of dislocations and their interaction with barriers.</description>

Abstract: The nature of the anomalous metal state has been a major puzzle in condensed matter physics for more than three decades. Here, we report systematic investigation and modulation of the anomalous metal states in high-temperature interface superconductor FeSe films on SrTiO3 substrate. Remarkably, under zero magnetic field, the anomalous metal state persists up to 20 K in pristine FeSe films, an exceptionally high temperature standing out from previous observations. In stark contrast, for the FeSe films with nano-hole arrays, the characteristic temperature of the anomalous metal state is considerably reduced. We demonstrate that the observed anomalous metal states originate from the quantum tunneling of vortices adjusted by the Ohmic dissipation. Our work offers a perspective for understanding the origin and modulation of the anomalous metal states in two-dimensional bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Faraday effect caused by a break of spatial symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is widely known that the magneto-optical Faraday effect is linear in magnetization, and therefore the Faraday angles for the states with opposite magnetizations are of opposite sign but equal in modulus. Here we demonstrate that under certain spatial symmetry-breaking conditions, an asymmetric Faraday effect (AFE) arises, meaning that the Faraday angles for opposite magnetic states differ not only in sign but in absolute value as well. Experimental investigations of AFE are performed in a one-dimensional all-garnet magnetophotonic crystal, where AFE appears in the vicinity of the cavity resonance for an oblique incidence of light with an inclined light polarization plane. The magnitude of the observed asymmetry between Faraday rotations for the two opposite magnetizations is very large and reaches 30$\%$ of the absolute value of the Faraday effect. We confirm the generality of the suggested effect by the numerical analysis of several different configurations in which AFE arises. The discovered AFE is of prime importance for nanoscale magnonics and optomagnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The boson peak (BP), a low-energy excess in the vibrational density of states over the Debye contribution, is often identified as a characteristic of amorphous solid materials. Despite decades of efforts, its microscopic origin still remains a mystery. Recently, it has been proposed, and corroborated with simulations, that the BP might stem from intrinsic localized modes involving one-dimensional (1D) string-like excitations (``stringlets"). We build on a theory originally proposed by Lund that describes the localized modes as 1D vibrating strings, but we specify the stringlet size distribution to be exponential, as observed in simulations. We provide an analytical prediction for the BP frequency $\omega_{BP}$ in the temperature regime well below the observed glass transition temperature $T_g$. The prediction involves no free parameters and accords quantitatively with prior simulation observations in 2D and 3D model glasses based on inverse power law potentials. The comparison of the string model to observations is more uncertain when compared to simulations of an Al-Sm metallic glass material at temperatures well above $T_g$. Nonetheless, our stringlet model of the BP naturally reproduces the softening of the BP frequency upon heating and offers an analytical explanation for the experimentally observed scaling with the shear modulus in the glass state and changes in this scaling in simulations of glass-forming liquids. Finally, the theoretical analysis highlights the existence of a strong damping for the stringlet modes above $T_g$, which leads to a large low-frequency contribution to the 3D vibrational density of states, observed in both experiments and simulations.</description>

Abstract: Hedgehog and antihedgehog spin textures in magnets behave as emergent monopoles and antimonopoles, which give rise to astonishing transport and electromagnetic phenomena. Using the Kondo-lattice model in three dimensions, we theoretically study collective spin-wave excitation modes of magnetic hedgehog lattices which have recently been discovered in itinerant magnets such as MnSi1-xGex and SrFeO3. It is revealed that the spin-wave modes, which appear in the sub-terahertz regime, have dominant amplitudes localized at Dirac strings connecting hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs and are characterized by their translational oscillations. It is found that their spectral features sensitively depend on the number and configuration of the Dirac strings and, thus, can be exploited for identifying the topological phase transitions associated with the monopole-antimonopole pair annihilations.</description>

      <title>Cuprate-like Electronic Structures in Infinite-Layer Nickelates with Substantial Hole Dopings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting infinite-layer (IL) nickelates offer a new platform for investigating the long-standing problem of high-temperature superconductivity. Many models were proposed to understand its superconducting mechanisms based on the calculated electronic structure, and the multiple Fermi surfaces and multiple orbitals involved create complications and controversial conclusions. Over the past 5 years, the lack of direct measurements of the electronic structure has hindered the understanding of nickelate superconductors. Here we fill this gap by directly resolving the electronic structures of the parent compound LaNiO$_2$ and superconducting La$_{0.8}$Ca$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We find that their Fermi surfaces consist of a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) hole pocket and a three-dimensional (3D) electron pocket at the Brillouin zone corner, whose volumes change upon Ca doping. The Fermi surface topology and band dispersion of the hole pocket closely resemble those observed in hole-doped cuprates. However, the cuprate-like band exhibits significantly higher hole doping in superconducting La$_{0.8}$Ca$_{0.2}$NiO$_2$ compared to superconducting cuprates, highlighting the disparities in the electronic states of the superconducting phase. Our observations highlight the novel aspects of the IL nickelates, and pave the way toward the microscopic understanding of the IL nickelate family and its superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: Pressure evolution of the crystal structure and magnetism of the honeycomb $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ is studied using high-pressure x-ray diffraction, magnetometry, and density-functional band-structure calculations. Hydrostatic compression transforms antiferromagnetic $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ ($R\bar 3$) into paramagnetic $\alpha'$-RuBr$_3$ ($P\bar 1$) where short Ru-Ru bonds cause magnetism collapse above 1.3 GPa at 0 K and 2.5 GPa at 295 K. Below this critical pressure, the N\'eel temperature of $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ increases with the slope of 1.8 K/GPa. Pressure tunes $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ away from the Kitaev limit, whereas increased third-neighbor in-plane coupling and interlayer coupling lead to a further stabilization of the collinear zigzag state. Both $\alpha$- and $\alpha'$-RuBr$_3$ are metastable at ambient pressure, but their transformation into the thermodynamically stable $\beta$-polymorph is kinetically hindered at room temperature.</description>

Abstract: We consider nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$ covered by an ionic surface charge and reveal the appearance of polar states with relatively high polarization ~5 microC/cm$^2$ and stored free charge ~10 microC/cm$%2$, which can mimic "mid-gap" states associated with a surface field-induced transfer of Cu and/or In ions in the van der Waals gap. The change in the ionic screening degree and mismatch strains induce a broad range of the transitions between paraelectric phase, antiferroelectric, ferrielectric, and ferri-ionic states in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. The states' stability and/or metastability is determined by the minimum of the system free energy consisting of electrostatic energy, elastic energy, and a Landau-type four-well potential of the ferrielectric dipole polarization. The possibility to govern the transitions by strain and ionic screening can be useful for controlling the tunneling barrier in thin film devices based on CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. Also, we predict that the CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes reveal features of the controllable negative capacitance effect, which make them attractive for advanced electronic devices, such as nano-capacitors and gate oxide nanomaterials with reduced heat dissipation.</description>

Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) with symmetry-protected surface states, offer exciting opportunities for next-generation photonic and optoelectronic device applications. The heterojunctions of TIs and semiconductors (e.g. Si, Ge) have been observed to excellent photo-responsive characteristics. However, the realization of high-frequency operations in these heterojunctions can be hindered by unwanted 1/f (or Flicker) noise and phase noise. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of 1/f noise figures becomes paramount for the effective utilization of such materials.Here we report optoelectronic response and 1/f noise characteristics of a p-n diode fabricated using topological insulator, Bi2Se3 and silicon for potential photo-detector. Through meticulous temperature-dependent current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements, we ascertain crucial parameters like barrier height, ideality factor, and reverse saturation current of the photodetector. The low-frequency 1/f conductance noise spectra suggest a significant presence of trap states influencing the optoelectronic transport properties. The forward noise characteristics exhibit typical 1/f features, having a uni-slope across four decades of frequency, suggesting a homogeneous distribution of barrier height. The spectral and photocurrent-dependent responses show the power law behavior of noise level on photon flux. The hybrid heterojunction demonstrates excellent photo-response and reasonably low noise level, promising signatures for the room-temperature visible photodetector applications.</description>
