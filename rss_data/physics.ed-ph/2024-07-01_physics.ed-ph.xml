      <title>Statistical Analysis on Scale and Regional Distribution of Undergraduate Physics Programs in Korean Universities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the temporal changes in undergraduate-level physics programs at Korean universities from 1915 to 2023 by analyzing data on physics-related departments and their students using basic statistics and the scaling theory of statistical physics. Our analysis reveals that the number of departments peaked around the turn of the 21st century, and it has been steadily decreasing ever since, with particularly severe declines in private universities located outside the capital region. Besides the change in the overall numbers, we also show the change in the self-identity of physics-related departments reflected in department names, which reveals a recent trend of emphasizing more application-side such as semiconductors and data. As a sophisticated measure to quantify regional imbalances relative to the population eligible for higher education, we present scaling exponents from the scaling theory, which shows a shift from sublinear to linear for departments and a shift from linear to superlinear for students. The result indicates the exacerbation of the regional imbalance of university-level physics education in Korea.</description>
