      <title>Equivalence Relations on Vertex Operator Algebras, I: Genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this first of a series of two papers, we investigate two different equivalence relations obtained by generalizing the notion of genus of even lattices to the setting of vertex operator algebras (or two-dimensional chiral algebras). The bulk genus equivalence relation was defined in arXiv:math/0209333 and groups (suitably regular) vertex operator algebras according to their modular tensor category and central charge. Hyperbolic genus arXiv:2004.01441 tests isomorphy after tensoring with a hyperbolic plane vertex algebra. Physically, two rational chiral algebras are said to belong to the same bulk genus if they live on the boundary of the same 2+1d topological quantum field theory; they belong to the same hyperbolic genus if they can be related by current-current exactly marginal deformations after tensoring a non-chiral compact boson.
  As one main result, we prove the conjecture that the hyperbolic genus defines a finer equivalence relation than the bulk genus. This is based on a new, equivalent characterization of the hyperbolic genus that uses the maximal lattice inside a vertex operator algebra and its commutant (or coset).
  We discuss the implications of these constructions for the classification of rational conformal field theory. In particular, we propose a program for (partially) classifying $c=32$, holomorphic vertex operator algebras (or chiral conformal field theories), and obtain novel lower bounds, via a generalization of the Smith-Minkowski-Siegel mass formula, on the number of vertex operator algebras at higher central charges. Finally, we conjecture a Siegel-Weil identity which computes the "average" torus partition function of an ensemble of chiral conformal field theories defined by any hyperbolic genus, and interpret this formula physically in terms of disorder-averaged holography.</description>

      <title>Emergent Non-Invertible Symmetries Bridging UV and IR Phases -- The Adjoint QCD Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07123v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we demonstrate how an emergent non-invertible symmetry along a renormalization group (RG) flow reveals connections between microscopic and macroscopic physics. We illustrate this using (3+1)-dimensional Adjoint QCD with two flavors of Weyl fermions as an example. For the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ case, C\'ordova and Dumitrescu proposed a non-supersymmetric deformation of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM theory leading to dynamical abelianization, followed by monopole condensation, and resulting in a confining infrared (IR) phase characterized by disjoint copies of the $\mathbb{CP}^1$ sigma model. In this scenario, we point out that the abelianized phase has an emergent non-invertible symmetry, which is matched with the non-invertible symmetry of the IR $\mathbb{CP}^1$ phase, associated to the Hopf solitons. This result illustrate how an emergent non-invertible symmetry can be used to provide a bridge connecting the IR solitons and their properties with the ones of microscopic degrees of freedom in gauge theories with one-form symmetries. Moreover, based on this insight we generalize these results to other gauge theories with any number of colors, and propose a candidate for the UV baryon operator in all these cases.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory of Weyl Group and its Interpretation as Weyl Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give an extensive description of Weyl quadratic gravity as the gauge theory of the Weyl group. The previously discovered (vectorial) torsion/non-metricity equivalence is shown to be built-in as it corresponds to a redefinition of the generators of the Weyl group. We present a generalisation of the torsion/non-metricity duality which includes, aside from the vector, also a traceless 3-tensor with two antisymmetric indices and vanishing skew symmetric part. A discussion of this relation in the case of minimally coupled matter fields is given. We further point out that a Rarita-Schwinger field can couple minimally to all the components of torsion and some components of non-metricity. Alongside we present the same gauge construction for the Poincar\'e and conformal groups. We show that even though the Weyl group is a subgroup of the conformal group, the gauge theory of the latter is actually only a special case of Weyl quadratic gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity from Weyl conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent developments in physical implications of Weyl conformal geometry. The associated Weyl quadratic gravity is a gauge theory of the Weyl group of dilatations and Poincar\'e symmetry. Weyl geometry is defined by equivalence classes of the metric and Weyl gauge field ($\omega_\mu$), related by Weyl gauge transformations. Weyl geometry can be seen as a covariantised version of Riemannian geometry with respect to Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). This Weyl gauge-covariant formulation of Weyl geometry is metric, which avoids long-held criticisms on the physical relevance of this geometry. Weyl quadratic gravity and its geometry have interesting properties: Weyl gauge symmetry spontaneously broken to Einstein-Hilbert gravity (Riemannian geometry) respectively, with $\Lambda&gt;0$; this is the only true gauge theory of a space-time symmetry i.e. with a physical Weyl gauge boson and is Weyl-anomaly free; all fields and masses have geometric origin, with no added scalar compensators; the theory is the leading order of a Weyl gauge invariant DBI action of conformal geometry that gives a natural analytical continuation of the former to $d$ dimensions; Weyl anomaly is recovered in the broken phase; in the limit of vanishing Weyl gauge current, one obtains conformal gravity and Riemannian geometry; SM has a natural embedding in Weyl conformal geometry with no new degrees of freedom, with a successful Starobinsky-Higgs inflation. Briefly, Weyl conformal geometry alone generates a (quantum) gauge theory of gravity, leading to a unified description by the gauge principle of Einstein-Hilbert gravity and SM.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave forms for extreme mass ratio collisions from supersymmetric gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the wave form emitted by a particle moving along an arbitrary (in general open) geodesic of the Schwarzschild geometry. The mathematical problem can be phrased in terms of quantities in ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories that can be calculated by using localization and the AGT correspondence. In particular through this mapping, the post-Newtonian expansion of the wave form is expressed as a double instanton sum with rational coefficients that resums all tail contributions into Gamma functions and exponentials. The formulae we obtain are valid for generic values of the orbital quantum numbers $\ell$ and $m$. For $\ell=2,3$ we check explicitly that our results agree with the small mass ratio limit of the wave forms derived in the Multipole Post-Minkowskian and the amplitudes approaches. We show how the so-called tail and tail of tail contributions to the wave form arise in our approach. Finally, we derive a universal formula for the soft limit of the wave form that resums all logarithmic divergent terms of the form $\omega^{n-1} (\log \omega)^n$.</description>

      <title>Matrix models for extremal and integrated correlators of higher rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study extremal and integrated correlators of half-BPS operators in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ SQCD and $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM with $SU(3)$ gauge group. We focus on the large R-charge sector where the number of operators insertions becomes very large. In this regime, we demonstrate that the correlators are described by a combination of Wishart and Jacobi matrix models, coupled in a non-trivial way. The size of the matrices in each model corresponds to the maximal number of insertions for each of the two single trace generators. This dual matrix model representation allows us to extract the behavior of the correlators at weak and strong coupling in a 't Hooft-like double scaling limit, including nonperturbative corrections. Although this work focuses on $SU(3)$, we expect that our techniques can be extended to $SU(N)$ for $N&gt;3$ as well.</description>

      <title>D-Brane Effective Lagrangian in Spacetimes with Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the transformation of $D_p$-branes to $D_{p-1}$-branes under T-duality when the $D$-brane is embedded in a spacetime with a boundary. Our goal is to derive the higher-derivative corrections to the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) Lagrangian for both the bulk and boundary terms.
  For the bulk terms, we calculate the $\alpha'$ corrections for the massless open string fields, up to the 8th order in the dimensionless Maxwell field strength. We demonstrate that the bulk Lagrangian can satisfy the T-duality constraint without residual total derivative terms in the base space. This determines the most general independent couplings of the massless open string fields in the bulk Lagrangian, encompassing 145 coupling constants, up to three parameters. Two of these parameters are physical and are determined by disk-level S-matrix elements, while the third is unphysical and can be eliminated by field redefinitions and integration by parts. The final result for the bulk Lagrangian consists of 49 couplings.
  For the boundary terms, the application of T-duality symmetry to massless open and closed string fields enables us to extend the DBI Lagrangian to include the boundary unit normal vector field $n_\mu$ and its first derivative.</description>

      <title>Correlators for pseudo Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudo-Hermitian system is a class of non-Hermitian system with Hamiltonian satisfying the condition $\eta^{-1}H^\dagger\eta=H$. We develop the in-in and Schwinger Keldysh formalism to calculate cosmological correlators for pseudo-Hermitian systems. We study a model consists of massive symplectic fermions coupled to the primordial curvature perturbation. The three-point function for the primordial curvature perturbation is computed up to one-loop and compared to earlier work where the loop correction comes from a massive scalar boson. The two results differ by a minus sign. Therefore, the one loop correction to the three-point function cannot be used to distinguished scalar bosons and symplectic fermions. To conclude, we discuss possibilities where the scalar bosons and symplectic fermions may be distinguished.</description>

      <title>Electroweak $\eta_w$ meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the Standard Model is accompanied by a new pseudo-scalar degree of freedom, $\eta_w$-meson, which cancels the topological susceptibility of the electroweak vacuum and gets its mass from this effect. The prediction is based on the analyticity properties of the Chern-Simons correlator combined with the basic features of gravity. Depending on the quality-level of the $U(1)_{B+L}$-symmetry, $\eta_w$ emerges as a $B+L$ pseudo-Goldstone boson or as a St\"uckelberg $2$-form of the electroweak gauge redundancy. An intriguing scenario of the first category is the emergence of $\eta_w$ in the form of the phase of a $U(1)_{B+L}$-violating fermion condensate triggered by the instantons, somewhat similarly to $\eta'$-meson in QCD. Regardless of its particular origin, the presence of $\eta_w$-meson in the theory appears to be a matter of consistency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls using fully three-dimensional numerical simulations. We consider two different scenarios: first, the classical stability of gauged Q-balls with respect to generic three-dimensional perturbations, and second, the behaviour of gauged Q-balls during head-on and off-axis collisions at relativistic velocities. With regards to stability, we find that there exist gauged Q-ball configurations which are classically stable in both logarithmic and polynomial scalar field models. With regards to relativistic collisions, we find that the dynamics can depend on many different parameters such as the collision velocity, relative phase, relative charge, and impact parameter of the colliding Q-balls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shadow formalism is a technique in two-dimensional CFT allowing straightforward computation of conformal blocks in the limit of infinitely large central charge. We generalize the construction of shadow operator for superconformal field theories. We demonstrate that shadow formalism yields known expressions for the large-c limit of the four-point superconformal block on a plane and of the one-point superconformal block on a torus. We also explicitly find the two-point global torus superconformal block in the necklace channel and check it against the Casimir differential equation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement island and Page curve for one-sided charged black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16457v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the method of calculating the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation of black holes using the "in" vacuum state, which describes one-sided asymptotically flat neutral black hole formed by gravitational collapse, to dynamic charged black holes. We explore the influence of charge on the position of the boundary of island $\partial I$ and the Page time. Due to their distinct geometric structures, we discuss non-extremal and extremal charged black holes separately. In non-extremal cases, the emergence of island saves the bound of entropy at late times, and the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation satisfies the Page curve. Moreover, we also find that the position of the boundary of island $\partial I$ depends on the position of the cutoff surface (observers), differing from the behavior in eternal charged black holes. In extremal black holes, when the island exists, the entanglement entropy is approximately equal to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, while the entanglement entropy becomes ill-defined when island is absent. Our analysis underscores how different geometric configurations significantly influence the behavior of entropy.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that the $L^2$ metric on the moduli space of hyperbolic monopoles, defined using the Coulomb gauge-fixing condition, diverges. This article shows that an alternative gauge-fixing condition inspired by supersymmetry cures this divergence. The resulting geometry is a hyperbolic analogue of the hyperk\"ahler geometry of Euclidean monopole moduli spaces.</description>

      <title>Kundt Gravitational Waves Coupled with a Non-Noetherian Conformal Scalar Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type N spacetimes of the Kundt class are presented as solutions to the Einstein's equations sourced by a real scalar field whose equation of motion is conformally invariant and that generalizes the standard conformal scalar field. The specific spacetimes considered model gravitational waves with uniform and totally geodesic wave fronts, propagating in a maximally symmetric background, and are characterized by the value of their constant scalar curvature and by the so-called wave profile function. All subclasses of such spacetimes are analyzed. It is shown that the scalar field solutions generically divide into two branches, of which one has a strikingly different behavior from that of the standard conformal case. The scalar field contributes to the equation satisfied by the wave profile function by adding new singular terms. Closed form and mode solutions for the wave profile function are found for different scenarios. The resulting energy-momentum tensor has a null eigenvector, but is more general than the pure radiation type usually coupled with this kind of spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Properties of dynamical regular black holes in semiclassical gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regular black holes have become a popular alternative to the singular mathematical black holes predicted by general relativity as they circumvent mathematical pathologies associated with the singularity while preserving crucial black hole features such as the trapping of light. Based on the assumption that semiclassical gravity is valid in the vicinity of their apparent horizons, we review their thermodynamic properties in static scenarios and demonstrate that 1-loop corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, accounting for the entanglement entropy of fields, depend on the regularization scheme used. Taking backreaction effects into consideration, we investigate their full dynamical evolution and we examine the behavior of the null energy condition. We find that it is always violated in the vicinity of the outer horizon while being satisfied in the vicinity of the inner horizon, which implies that the trapped spacetime region, as determined from the behavior of null geodesic congruences, is effectively separated into a null energy condition-violating and a non-violating domain. Our findings suggest that quantum effects are more dominant close to the outer apparent horizon and become more pronounced towards the final stages of the evaporation process.</description>

Abstract: Hydrodynamic turbulence exhibits nonequilibrium behaviour with $k^{-5/3}$ energy spectrum, and equilibrium behaviour with $k^{d-1}$ energy spectrum and zero viscosity, where $d$ is the space dimension. Using recursive renormalization group {in Craya-Herring basis}, we show that the nonequilibrium solution is valid only for $d &lt; 6$, whereas equilibrium solution with zero viscosity is the only solution for $d&gt;6$. Thus, $d=6$ is the critical dimension for hydrodynamic turbulence. In addition, we show that the energy flux changes sign from positive to negative near $d=2.15$. We also compute the energy flux and Kolmogorov's constants for various $d$'s, and observe that our results are in good agreement with past numerical results.</description>

      <title>The spin-one Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation revisited: analytical study of its structure and a careful choice of interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau equation is investigated for spin one bosons with the so-called natural (normal) and unnatural (abnormal) parity states for non-minimal vector interactions. To illustrate the current state of knowledge about the equation, a thorough but concise discussion is made on what can be achieved analytically within this framework for well-known phenomenological interactions, including Coulomb, soft-core, Cornell, Kratzer, and exponential type interactions. In the non-exponential cases, the equation, depending on the chosen interaction, is studied in relation to the confluent, doubly-confluent, and biconfluent Heun functions. Furthermore, to show the need for careful treatment of various parity states, a Kratzer-type potential, such as a generalized Coulomb interaction, is discussed in depth using the Lie algebraic approach, showing the need for careful analysis of abnormal parity states in a fairly explicit way. The energies obtained are discussed using some figures to explicitly show the different regimes, as well as the absence of the Klein paradox. Finally, some directions for future work that would undoubtedly need to be explored in this field are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We compute the modular Hamiltonians of regions having the future horizon lying on a null plane. For a CFT this is equivalent to regions with boundary of arbitrary shape lying on the null cone. These Hamiltonians have a local expression on the horizon formed by integrals of the stress tensor. We prove this result in two different ways, and show that the modular Hamiltonians of these regions form an infinite dimensional Lie algebra. The corresponding group of unitary transformations moves the fields on the null surface locally along the null generators with arbitrary null line dependent velocities, but act non locally outside the null plane. We regain this result in greater generality using more abstract tools on algebraic quantum field theory. Finally, we show that modular Hamiltonians on the null surface satisfy a Markov property that leads to the saturation of the strong sub-additive inequality for the entropies and to the strong super-additivity of the relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Conservation Laws in Horava Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.00576v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Horava gravity has been proposed as a renormalizable quantum gravity without the ghost problem through anisotropic scaling dimensions which break Lorentz symmetry in UV. In the Hamiltonian formalism, due to the Lorentz-violating terms, the constraint structure looks quite different from that of general relativity (GR) but we have recently found that "there exists the case where we can recover the same number of degrees of freedom as in GR", in a rather general set-up. In this paper, we study its Lagrangian perspectives and examine the full diffeomorphism (Diff) symmetry and its associated conservation laws in Horava gravity. Surprisingly, we find that the full Diff symmetry in the action can also be recovered when a certain condition, called "super-condition", which super-selects the Lorentz-symmetric sector in Horava gravity, is satisfied. This indicates that the broken Lorentz symmetry, known as "foliation-preserving" Diff, is just an "apparent" symmetry of the Horava gravity action and rather its "full action symmetry can be as large as the Diff in GR ". The super-condition exactly corresponds to the tertiary constraint in Hamiltonian formalism which is the second-class constraint and provides a non-trivial realization of the Lorentz symmetry otherwise being absent apparently. From the recovered Lorentz symmetry in the action, we obtain the conservation laws with the Noether currents as in covariant theories. The general formula for the conserved Noether charges reproduces the mass of four-dimensional static black holes with an "arbitrary" cosmological constant in Horava gravity, and is independent of ambiguities associated with the choice of asymptotic boundaries. We also discuss several challenging problems, including its implications to Hamiltonian formalism, black hole thermodynamics, radiations from colliding black holes.</description>

      <title>Weyl quadratic gravity as a gauge theory and non-metricity vs torsion duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13384v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review (non-supersymmetric) gauge theories of four-dimensional space-time symmetries and their quadratic action. The only true gauge theory of such a symmetry (with a physical gauge boson) that has an exact geometric interpretation, generates Einstein gravity in its spontaneously broken phase and is anomaly-free, is that of Weyl gauge symmetry (of dilatations). Gauging the full conformal group does not generate a true gauge theory of physical (dynamical) associated gauge bosons. Regarding the Weyl gauge symmetry, it is naturally realised in Weyl conformal geometry, where it admits two different but equivalent geometric formulations, of same quadratic action: one non-metric but torsion-free, the other Weyl gauge-covariant and metric (with respect to a new differential operator). To clarify the origin of this intriguing result, a third equivalent formulation of this gauge symmetry is constructed using the standard, modern approach on the tangent space (uplifted to space-time by the vielbein), which is metric but has vectorial torsion. This shows an interesting duality vectorial non-metricity vs vectorial torsion of the corresponding formulations, related by a projective transformation. We comment on the physical meaning of these results.</description>

      <title>Rotating Black Holes in a Viable Lorentz-Violating Gravity: Finding Exact Solutions Without Tears</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a two-step procedure for finding Kerr-type rotating black hole solutions without tears. Considering the low-energy sector of Horava gravity as a viable Lorentz-violating gravity in four dimensions which admits a different speed of gravity, we find the exact rotating black hole solutions (with or without cosmological constant). We find that the singular region extends to r &lt; 0 region from the ring singularity at r = 0 in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates. There are two Killing horizons where g^rr = 0 and the black hole thermodynamics laws are still valid. We find the rotating black hole solutions with electromagnetic charges only when we consider the noble electromagnetic couplings, in such a way that the speed of light is the same as the speed of gravity. With the noble choice of couplings, our Lorentz-violating gravity can be consistent with the recently-observed time delay of the coincident GW and GRB signals. Furthermore, in Appendices, we show that (a) the uniqueness of the invariant line element ds^2 under Diff_F, contrary to LV action, (b) the solutions are the Petrov type I with four distinct principal null vectors, and (c) the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the geodesic particles are not separable.</description>

      <title>Holographic phenomenology via overlapping degrees of freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11016v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The holographic principle suggests that regions of space contain fewer physical degrees of freedom than would be implied by conventional quantum field theory. Meanwhile, in Hilbert spaces of large dimension $2^n$, it is possible to define $N \gg n$ Pauli algebras that are nearly anti-commuting (but not quite) and which can be thought of as "overlapping degrees of freedom". We propose to model the phenomenology of holographic theories by allowing field-theory modes to be overlapping, and derive potential observational consequences. In particular, we build a Fermionic quantum field whose effective degrees of freedom approximately obey area scaling and satisfy a cosmic Bekenstein bound, and compare predictions of that model to cosmic neutrino observations. Our implementation of holography implies a finite lifetime of plane waves, which depends on the overall UV cutoff of the theory. To allow for neutrino flux from blazar TXS 0506+056 to be observable, our model needs to have a cutoff $k_{\mathrm{UV}} \lesssim 500\, k_{\mathrm{LHC}}\,$. This is broadly consistent with current bounds on the energy spectrum of cosmic neutrinos from IceCube, but high energy neutrinos are a potential challenge for our model of holography. We motivate our construction via quantum mereology, i.e. using the idea that EFT degrees of freedom should emerge from an abstract theory of quantum gravity by finding quasi-classical Hilbert space decompositions. We also discuss how to extend the framework to Bosons. Finally, using results from random matrix theory we derive an analytical understanding of the energy spectrum of our theory. The numerical tools used in this work are publicly available within the GPUniverse package, https://github.com/OliverFHD/GPUniverse .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the question of scale versus conformal invariance on maximally symmetric curved backgrounds and study general 2-derivative conformally invariant free theories of vectors and tensors. For spacetime dimension $D&gt;4$, these conformal theories can be diagonalized into standard massive fields in which unbroken conformal symmetry non-trivially mixes components of different spins. In $D=4$, the tensor case becomes a conformal theory mixing a partially massless spin-2 field with a massless spin-1 field. For massless linearized gravity in $D = 4$, we confirm through direct calculation that correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators take the conformally invariant form, despite the absence of standard conformal symmetry at the level of the action.</description>

Abstract: We argue that on-shell excitations with large negative energies are created rapidly when the string coupling increases with time. This does not indicate an inconsistency in string theory since the negative energy on-shell excitation is always entangled with an on-shell excitation with a positive energy. The total energy of this energy-EPR state vanishes. We discuss the reason the energy-EPR states appear in string theory and the role they might play in black hole physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the collision dynamics of $U(1)$ gauged Q-balls by performing high-resolution numerical simulations in axisymmetry. Focusing on the case of relativistic head-on collisions, we consider the effects of the initial velocity, relative phase, relative charge, and electromagnetic coupling strength on the outcome of the collision. We find that the collision dynamics can depend strongly on these parameters; most notably, electromagnetic effects can significantly alter the outcome of the collision when the gauge coupling is large. When the gauge coupling is small, we find that the dynamics generally resemble those of ordinary (non-gauged) Q-balls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05789v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any nonlinear field theory giving rise to static solutions with finite energy like, e.g., topological solitons, allows us to derive a continuous infinity of integral identities which any such solution has to obey. These integral identities can always be understood as being generated by field transformations and their related Noether currents. We also explain why all integral identities generated by coordinate transformations become trivial for Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) solitons, i.e., topological solitons which saturate a topological energy bound. Finally, we consider applications of these identities to a broad class of nonlinear scalar theories, including the Skyrme model. More concretely, we find nontrivial integral identities that can be seen as model-independent relations between certain physical properties of the solitons in such theories, and we comment on the possible connection between these new relations and those already found in the context of astrophysical compact objects. We also demonstrate the usefulness of said identities to estimate the precision of the numerical calculation of soliton observables.</description>

Abstract: This work studies domain walls between chirally-separated vacua in supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM) on $\mathbb{R}^3\times\mathbb{S}^1$ in the semiclassical limit. For all gauge groups we explicitly find the electric fluxes of all BPS domain walls and fully characterize the representation that they form under the global symmetry of SYM. We compute the characters of these representations formed by the semiclassical domain walls. We also compute these characters for the worldvolume TQFTs appearing in the literature for $SU(N)$ and $Sp(N)$ gauge groups. We find complete agreement between the two computations, providing thus a dynamical test of the proposed worldvolume TQFTs. We also propose a new worldvolume TQFT for $E_6$ domain walls, subjecting it to the same tests. Finally, we study deconfinement of quarks on domain walls for all gauge groups. We show that for all gauge groups confining strings (stable in the abelianized regime) can end on domain walls, regardless of whether or not the group has a center.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider non-critical heterotic strings compactified on $S^1$. For full rank theories, they are related to odd self-dual lattices and are structurally of the same form as the critical non-supersymmetric theories. For dimensions up to 14 the associated moduli spaces are Coxeter polytopes already studied by Vinberg and Kaplinskaya. In the heterotic string context, the Coxeter diagrams of these moduli spaces are related through transformations representing the process of dimension changing tachyon condensation of Hellerman-Swanson. For dimensions 8 and 6 respectively on $S^1$ and $T^2$ we show that at special points in the moduli space the subcritical string is the CHS background for two coincident NS5-branes and the intersection of two such pairs. These configurations are interpreted as an end result of condensing heterotic winding tachyons along one or two Scherck-Schwarz circles at self-dual radius. We give evidence that in the first case there is a T-duality between the pair of NS5-branes and a recently constructed non-supersymmetric heterotic 6-brane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new infinite family of integrable deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM) parameterized by an interaction function of several variables, which extends the formalism of arXiv:2405.05899, and includes deformations of the PCM by functions of both the stress tensor and higher-spin conserved currents. We show in detail that every model in this class admits a Lax representation for its equations of motion, and that the Poisson bracket of the Lax connection takes the Maillet form, establishing the existence of an infinite set of Poisson-commuting conserved charges. We argue that the non-Abelian T-dual of any model in this family is classically integrable, and that T-duality "commutes" with a general deformation in this class, in a sense which we make precise. Finally, we demonstrate that these higher-spin auxiliary field deformations can be extended to accommodate the addition of a Wess-Zumino term, and we exhibit the Lax connection in this case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the consistency condition for ``strong'' sustained rapid turn inflation with third order slow roll (SRRT) in two-field cosmological models with oriented scalar manifold as a geometric PDE which constrains the metric and potential of such models. When supplemented by appropriate boundary conditions, the equation determines one of these objects in terms of the other and hence selects ``fiducial'' models for strong SRRT inflation. When the scalar potential is given, the equation can be simplified by fixing the conformal class of the scalar field metric (equivalently, fixing a complex structure which makes the scalar manifold into a complex Riemann surface). Then the consistency equation becomes a contact Hamilton-Jacobi PDE which determines the scalar field metric within the given conformal class. We analyze this equation with standard methods of PDE theory, discuss its approximation near a nondegenerate critical point of the scalar potential and extract natural asymptotic conditions for its solutions at such points. We also give numerical examples of solutions to a simple Dirichlet problem. For the case of elliptic curves relevant to two-field axion cosmology, we determine the general symmetry-adapted solution of the equation for potentials with a single charge vector.</description>

We link the operator complexity of the density matrix to the state/operator complexity of purified states using three purification schemes: time-independent, time-dependent, and instantaneous purification. We propose inequalities among the operator and state complexities of mixed states and their purifications, demonstrated with a single qubit, two-qubit Werner states, and infinite-dimensional diagonal mixed states. We find that the complexity of a vacuum evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles created between left and right Rindler wedges. Finally, for the thermofield double state evolving from zero to finite temperature, we show that 1) the state complexity follows the Lloyd bound, reminiscent of the quantum speed limit, and 2) the Krylov state/operator complexities are subadditive in contrast to the holographic volume complexity.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Primordial Magnetic Blackhole: Cosmic Production and Physical Implication</title>

Abstract: The electroweak monopole, when coupled to gravity, turns to the Reissner-Nordstrom type primordial magnetic blackhole whose mass is bounded below, with the lower bound $M_P \sqrt \alpha$. This changes the overall picture of the monopole production mechanism in the early universe drastically and has deep implications in cosmolpgy. In particular, this enhances the possibility that the electroweak monopoles turned to the primordial magnetic blackholes could become the seed of stellar objects and galaxies, and account for the dark matter of the universe. Moreover, this tells that we have a new type of primordial blackhole different from the popular primordial blackhole in cosmology, the electroweak primordial magnetic blackhole based on a totally different production mechanism. We discuss the physical implications of the electroweak primordial magnetic blackhole.</description>

      <title>One loop determinant in the extremal black hole from quasinormal modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we evaluate the one loop partition function of a scalar field in the near horizon geometry of the extremal Reissner Nordstr\"{o}m black hole from an infinite product over quasinormal modes using the Denef-Hartnoll-Sachdev (DHS) formula. We show that, the logarithmic divergent term of the one loop partition function computed using the DHS formula agrees with the heat kernel method. Using the same formula, we also evaluate the one loop partition function of scalar field in the near extremal Kerr Newman black hole and observe that it reduces to the same in the near horizon $AdS_2\times S^2$ geometry of the extremal Reissner Nordstr\"{o}m black hole when the angular velocity at the horizon is tuned to $2\pi T_{BH}$ value. We observe that, for higher spin fields, the mode functions become irregular at the horizon for certain quasinormal frequencies and therefore we remove them to obtain the one loop determinant.</description>

      <title>Restrictions on realizable unitary operations imposed by symmetry and locality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2003.05524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to a fundamental result in quantum computing, any unitary transformation on a composite system can be generated using so-called 2-local unitaries that act only on two subsystems. Beyond its importance in quantum computing, this result can also be regarded as a statement about the dynamics of systems with local Hamiltonians: although locality puts various constraints on the short-term dynamics, it does not restrict the possible unitary evolutions that a composite system with a general local Hamiltonian can experience after a sufficiently long time. Here we show that this universality does not remain valid in the presence of conservation laws and global continuous symmetries such as U(1) and SU(2). In particular, we show that generic symmetric unitaries cannot be implemented, even approximately, using local symmetric unitaries. Based on this no-go theorem, we propose a method for experimentally probing the locality of interactions in nature. In the context of quantum thermodynamics, our results mean that generic energy-conserving unitary transformations on a composite system cannot be realized solely by combining local energy-conserving unitaries on the components. We show how this can be circumvented via catalysis.</description>

      <title>Phase diagrams of quasinormal frequencies for Schwarzschild, Kerr, and Taub-NUT black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Newman-Janis algorithm, which involves complex-coordinate transformations, establishes connections between static and spherically symmetric black holes and rotating and/or axially symmetric ones, such as between Schwarzschild black holes and Kerr black holes, and between Schwarzschild black holes and Taub-NUT black holes. However, the transformations in the two samples are based on different physical mechanisms. The former connection arises from the exponentiation of spin operators, while the latter from a duality operation. In this paper, we mainly investigate how the connections manifest in the dynamics of black holes. Specifically, we focus on studying the correlations of quasinormal frequencies among Schwarzschild, Kerr, and Taub-NUT black holes. This analysis allows us to explore the physics of complex-coordinate transformations in the spectrum of quasinormal frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the general relativistic approach requires exotic matter with negative energy density, constructing wormholes containing realistic matter is a crucial challenge. Therefore, extending General Relativity to non-minimal cases may be an alternative option. In this paper, we investigate wormholes which are supported by the non-minimally coupled electromagnetic fields to gravity in $Y(R)F^2$ form where $F^2$ is the Maxwell invariant and $Y(R)$ is a function of the Ricci scalar $R$. We consider both electrically and magnetically charged cases. Then we give some exact asymptotically AdS/dS and flat solutions for traversable wormhole geometries. By discussing whether these obtained geometries satisfy the energy conditions and vanishing sound speed condition, we determine stable solutions containing realistic matter for some parameter values.</description>

      <title>Null energy condition violation during inflation and pulsar timing array observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10685v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, evidence of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) signals observed by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations, has prompted investigations into their origins. We explore the compatibility of a proposed inflationary scenario, incorporating an intermediate null energy condition (NEC)-violating phase, with the PTA observations. The NEC violation potentially amplifies the primordial tensor power spectrum, offering a promising explanation for PTA observations. Numerical analyses, primarily focused on NANOGrav's 15-year results, reveal the model's compatibility with PTA data. Notably, the model predicts a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum in the mHz frequency range, which sets our scenario apart from other interpretations predicting a red primordial GW spectrum on smaller scales.</description>

      <title>Generalized Free Cumulants for Quantum Chaotic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) is the leading conjecture for the emergence of statistical mechanics in generic isolated quantum systems and is formulated in terms of the matrix elements of operators. An analog known as the ergodic bipartition (EB) describes entanglement and locality and is formulated in terms of the components of eigenstates. In this paper, we significantly generalize the EB and unify it with the ETH, extending the EB to study higher correlations and systems out of equilibrium. Our main result is a diagrammatic formalism that computes arbitrary correlations between eigenstates and operators based on a recently uncovered connection between the ETH and free probability theory. We refer to the connected components of our diagrams as generalized free cumulants. We apply our formalism in several ways. First, we focus on chaotic eigenstates and establish the so-called subsystem ETH and the Page curve as consequences of our construction. We also improve known calculations for thermal reduced density matrices and comment on an inherently free probabilistic aspect of the replica approach to entanglement entropy previously noticed in a calculation for the Page curve of an evaporating black hole. Next, we turn to chaotic quantum dynamics and demonstrate the ETH as a sufficient mechanism for thermalization, in general. In particular, we show that reduced density matrices relax to their equilibrium form and that systems obey the Page curve at late times. We also demonstrate that the different phases of entanglement growth are encoded in higher correlations of the EB. Lastly, we examine the chaotic structure of eigenstates and operators together and reveal previously overlooked correlations between them. Crucially, these correlations encode butterfly velocities, a well-known dynamical property of interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Late-Time constraints on Interacting Dark Energy: Analysis independent of $H_0$, $r_d$ and $M_B$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00056v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated a possible interaction between cold dark matter and dark energy, corresponding to a well-known interacting dark energy model discussed in the literature within the context of resolving the Hubble tension. We put constraints on it in a novel way, by creating new likelihoods with an analytical marginalization over the Hubble parameter $H_0$, the sound horizon $r_d$, and the supernova absolute magnitude $M_B$. Our aim is to investigate the impacts on the coupling parameter of the interacting model, $\xi$, and the equation of state of dark energy $w$ and the matter density parameter $\Omega_{m,0}$. The late-time cosmological probes used in our analysis include the PantheonPlus (calibrated and uncalibrated), cosmic chronometers, and baryon acoustic oscillation samples and the Pantheon for comparison. Through various combinations of these datasets, we demonstrate hints of an up to $2\sigma$ deviation from the standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Inflation From Fluctuating Baby-Skyrme Brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the inflationary dynamics induced by small fluctuations on the Skyrme brane, characterized by a time-dependent perturbative function $\tilde{\phi}$. In the low-energy regime, the model successfully reproduces standard inflation, with a potential term dictated by the Skyrmion at the brane. Gravity localization is achieved at the brane, and the lowest energy scale is established at the asymptotic boundary. The model demonstrates the capability to emulate standard inflation dynamics, resembling $\tilde{\phi}^4$ potential characteristics under certain conditions. At higher energy levels, the behaviour of $\tilde{\phi}$ is contingent upon the Skyrme term coupling constant $\lambda$, influencing reheating phases. The wave-like nature of fluctuations allows for energy transfer, resulting in a possibly lower reheating temperature. We also discuss the prospect of $\lambda$ changing sign during inflation, presenting a non-standard coupling dependent on the matter field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate how table-top settings combining hyperbolic lattices with nonlinear dynamics universally encode aspects of the bulk-boundary-correspondence between gravity in anti-de-Sitter (AdS) space and conformal field theory (CFT). Our concrete and broadly applicable holographic toy model simulates gravitational self-interactions in the bulk and features an emergent CFT with nontrivial correlations on the boundary. We measure the CFT data contained in the two- and three-point functions and clarify how a thermal CFT is simulated through an effective black hole geometry. As a concrete example, we propose and simulate an experimentally feasible protocol to measure the holographic CFT using electrical circuits.</description>

      <title>Wilsonian Renormalization of Neural Network Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Separating relevant and irrelevant information is key to any modeling process or scientific inquiry. Theoretical physics offers a powerful tool for achieving this in the form of the renormalization group (RG). Here we demonstrate a practical approach to performing Wilsonian RG in the context of Gaussian Process (GP) Regression. We systematically integrate out the unlearnable modes of the GP kernel, thereby obtaining an RG flow of the GP in which the data sets the IR scale. In simple cases, this results in a universal flow of the ridge parameter, which becomes input-dependent in the richer scenario in which non-Gaussianities are included. In addition to being analytically tractable, this approach goes beyond structural analogies between RG and neural networks by providing a natural connection between RG flow and learnable vs. unlearnable modes. Studying such flows may improve our understanding of feature learning in deep neural networks, and enable us to identify potential universality classes in these models.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of hairy black holes in shift-symmetric theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alternative theories of gravity may be put to the test by making use of gravitational wave observations. Scalar-tensor theories provide a relatively simple framework that allows for compact object solutions with characteristics different from those of their general relativity counterparts. In shift-symmetric theories, black hole hair may arise when a linear coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant is introduced. The effect of this coupling on the black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) has been shown to be small, therefore limiting the observational interest in the theory. In general, however, one expects that additional shift-symmetric terms in the Lagrangian may be relevant, and indeed, it has been shown that they can have a nontrivial impact on the mass and scalar charge of the stationary solutions. In this work we explore the effect that various such terms have on the axial and polar QNMs of the hairy black hole solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. We avoid directly computing the overlap of two partition functions within different spacetime manifolds and instead obtain them separately via reweight-annealing scheme. The incremental process can be designed along the path of real physical parameters in this frame, and all intermediates are EEs of corresponding parameters, so the algorithm efficiency is improved by more than $10^4$ of times. The calculation of EE becomes much cheaper and simpler. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

Abstract: This study examines the holographic representation of the quantum theory of transmission lines, which play a crucial role in quantum computing and quantum information. Utilizing Yurke and Denker's quantum circuit network theory within the framework of continuous MERA (cMERA) in AdS space, we analyze the quantization and interactions of transmission lines. The metric is revealed to be described by the inductance of the quantum circuit, which is AdS-space in its 0-limit. These results provide new insights into handling and controlling complex phenomena in quantum circuits, potentially advancing the understanding of quantum computing and quantum communication.</description>

Abstract: We construct a relativistic quantum communication channel between two localized qubit systems, mediated by a relativistic quantum field, that can achieve the theoretical maximum for the quantum capacity in arbitrary curved spacetimes using the Unruh-DeWitt detector formalism. Using techniques from algebraic quantum field theory, we express the quantum capacity of the quantum communication channel purely in terms of the correlation functions of the field and the causal propagator for the wave equation. Consequently, the resulting quantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are independent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice of Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.</description>

Abstract: A crucial aspect of wormhole (WH) physics is the inclusion of exotic matter, which requires violating the null energy condition. Here, we explore the potential for WHs to be sustained by quark matter under conditions of extreme density along with the phantom-like generalized cosmic Chaplygin gas (GCCG) in symmetric teleparallel gravity. Theoretical and experimental studies on baryon structures indicate that strange quark matter, composed of u (up), d (down), and s (strange) quarks, represents the most energy-efficient form of baryonic matter. Drawing from these theoretical insights, we use the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) bag model equation of state to characterize ordinary quark matter. By formulating specific configurations for the bag parameter, we develop several WH models corresponding to different shape functions for the isotropic and anisotropic cases. Our analysis strongly suggests that an isotropic WH is not theoretically possible. Furthermore, we investigate traversable WH solutions utilizing a phantom-like GCCG, examining their feasibility. This equation of state, capable of violating the null energy condition, can elucidate late-time cosmic acceleration through various beneficial parameters. In this framework, we derive WH solutions for both constant and variable redshift functions. We have employed the volume integral quantifier (VIQ) method for both studies to assess the quantity of exotic matter. Furthermore, we have done the equilibrium analysis through the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, which supports the viability of our constructed WH model.</description>
