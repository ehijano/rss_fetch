      <title>Frozen natural spinors for Cholesky decomposition based two-component relativistic coupled cluster method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient and cost-effective implementation for the exact two-component atomic mean field (X2CAMF) based coupled cluster (CC) method, which integrates frozen natural spinors (FNS) and the Cholesky decomposition (CD) technique. The use of CD approximation greatly reduces the storage requirement of the calculation without any significant reduction in accuracy. Compared to four-component methods, the FNS and CD-based X2CAMF-CC approach gives similar accuracy as that of the canonical four-component relativistic coupled cluster method at a fraction of the cost. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated by the calculation of a medium-sized uranium complex involving the correlation of over 1000 virtual spinors.</description>

      <title>Statistical theory of cumulant mapping in an imperfect apparatus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cumulant mapping has been recently suggested [Frasinski, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 24, 207767 (2022)] as an efficient approach to observing multi-particle fragmentation pathways, while bypassing the restrictions of the usual coincidence-measurement approach. We present a formal analysis of the cumulant-mapping technique in the presence of moderate external noise, which induces spurious correlations between the fragments. Suppression of false-cumulant signal may impose severe restrictions on the stability of the experimental setup and/or the permissible average event rate, which increase with the cumulant order. We outline the constraints on the process being investigated, which allow cumulant mapping to remain competitive in the presence of external noise. We further propose a simple test for false-cumulant detection, based on the power-law relationship between the average event rate and the cumulant.</description>

      <title>Two-Component Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Theory of Charged Excitations With Consistent Treatment of Spin-Orbit Coupling and Dynamic Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a two-component formulation of algebraic diagrammatic construction theory for simulating spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation in charged electronic states and photoelectron spectra. Our implementation supports Hartree-Fock and multiconfigurational reference wavefunctions, enabling efficient correlated calculations of relativistic effects using single-reference (SR-) and multireference (MR-) ADC. We combine the SR- and MR-ADC methods with three flavors of spin-orbit two-component Hamiltonians and benchmark their performance for a variety of atoms and small molecules. When multireference effects are not important, the SR-ADC approximations are competitive in accuracy to MR-ADC, often showing closer agreement with experimental results. However, for electronic states with multiconfigurational character and in non-equilibrium regions of potential energy surfaces, the MR-ADC methods are more reliable, predicting accurate excitation energies and zero-field splittings. Our results demonstrate that the two-component ADC methods are promising approaches for interpreting and predicting the results of modern spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Topological junction states in graphene nanoribbons: A route to topological chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators with propagating topological edge states are promising for dissipationless transport, while their one-dimensional analogs are capable of hosting localized topological junction states that are mainly envisaged for quantum computing and spintronics. Here, in contrast, we propose to use localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. By using this classification, we theoretically model a double-junction transport device that shows enhanced interaction with NO$_2$ molecule. Our results show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue for topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.</description>

      <title>Free the Design Space of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks: High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-order tensors. After decades of research, we recently achieve an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ \citep{bonvicini2024irreducible} with factorial time/space complexity. This work, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contraction with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set \citep{pearce2023brauer}, through this path matrices technique. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available in the appendix where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in &lt;0.1s, 0.5s, 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s, respectively.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 2D Materials via Symmetry-Constrained Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative model for 2D materials has shown significant promise in accelerating the material discovery process. The stability and performance of these materials are strongly influenced by their underlying symmetry. However, existing generative models for 2D materials often neglect symmetry constraints, which limits both the diversity and quality of the generated structures. Here, we introduce a symmetry-constrained diffusion model (SCDM) that integrates space group symmetry into the generative process. By incorporating Wyckoff positions, the model ensures adherence to symmetry principles, leading to the generation of 2,000 candidate structures. DFT calculations were conducted to evaluate the convex hull energies of these structures after structural relaxation. From the generated samples, 843 materials that met the energy stability criteria (Ehull &lt; 0.6 eV/atom) were identified. Among these, six candidates were selected for further stability analysis, including phonon band structure evaluations and electronic properties investigations, all of which exhibited phonon spectrum stability. To benchmark the performance of SCDM, a symmetry-unconstrained diffusion model was also evaluated via crystal structure prediction model. The results highlight that incorporating symmetry constraints enhances the effectiveness of generated 2D materials, making a contribution to the discovery of 2D materials through generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Advancing Surface Chemistry with Large-Scale Ab-Initio Quantum Many-Body Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive simulation of surface chemistry is of paramount importance for progress in fields from catalysis to electrochemistry and clean energy generation. Ab-initio quantum many-body methods should be offering deep insights into these systems at the electronic level, but are limited in their efficacy by their steep computational cost. In this work, we build upon state-of-the-art correlated wavefunctions to reliably converge to the `gold standard' accuracy in quantum chemistry for application to extended surface chemistry. Efficiently harnessing graphics processing unit acceleration along with systematically improvable multiscale resolution techniques, we achieve linear computational scaling up to 392 atoms in size. These large-scale simulations demonstrate the importance of converging to these extended system sizes, achieving a validating handshake between simulations with different boundary conditions for the interaction of water on a graphene surface. We provide a new benchmark for this water-graphene interaction that clarifies the preference for water orientations at the graphene interface. This is extended to the adsorption of carbonaceous molecules on chemically complex surfaces, including metal oxides and metal-organic frameworks, where we consistently achieve chemical accuracy compared to experimental references, and well inside the scatter of traditional density functional material modeling approaches. This pushes the state of the art for simulation of molecular adsorption on surfaces, and marks progress into a post-density functional era for more reliable and improvable approaches to first-principles modeling of surface problems at an unprecedented scale and accuracy using ab-initio quantum many-body methods.</description>

      <title>Inferring intermediate states by leveraging the many-body Arrhenius law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable states appear as long-lived intermediate states in various natural transport phenomena which are governed by energy landscapes. Moreover, they dominate a system's evolution in deciding the selective outcome or shedding light on the preferred mechanism on how a system explores the energy landscape. It is thus crucial to develop techniques to quantify these metastabilities hence uncovering key details of the energy landscape. Here, we propose a powerful method by leveraging a many-body Arrhenius law that detects the metastabilites in an escape problem, involving interacting particles with excluded volume confined to a complex energy landscape. Observing transport in colloidal systems or translocation of macromolecules through biological pores can be an ideal test bed to verify our results.</description>

      <title>Large Deviation Theory Approach to Fluctuation Theorems and Landauer's Principle through Heat Redefinition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large deviation theory (LDT) provides a mathematical framework for quantifying the probabilities of rare events in stochastic systems. In this study, we modeled chemical reaction systems using LDT and demonstrated that the fluctuation theorem for nonequilibrium reaction systems can be derived from the symmetry of the cumulant generating function, as defined through the rate function. Notably, this derivation does not rely on the assumption of local detailed balance. Furthermore, we redefine heat using this rate function based on information theory, enabling the evaluation of Landauer's principle, which addresses the minimum energy cost associated with information erasure. These findings underscore the utility of LDT as a comprehensive framework for analyzing a wide range of nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Capturing the elusive curve-crossing in low-lying states of butadiene with dressed TDDFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A striking example of the need to accurately capture states of double-excitation character in molecules is seen in predicting photo-induced dynamics in small polyenes. Due to the coupling of electronic and nuclear motions,the dark 2$^1$Ag state, known to have double-excitation character, can be reached after an initial photo-excitation to the bright $^1$Bu state via crossings of their potential energy surfaces. However, the shapes of the surfaces are so poorly captured by most electronic structure methods, that the crossing is missed or substantially mis-located. We demonstrate that the frequency-dependent kernel of dressed TDDFT beyond Tamm-Dancoff successfully captures the curve-crossing, providing an energy surface close to the highly accurate but more expensive $\delta$-CR-EOMCC(2,3) benchmark reference. This, along with its accurate prediction of the excitation character of the state makes dressed TDDFT a practical and accurate route to electronic structure quantities needed in modeling ultrafast dynamics in molecules.</description>

      <title>Generalized coupled cluster theory for ground and excited state intersections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled cluster theory in the standard formulation is unable to correctly describe conical intersections among states of the same symmetry. This limitation has restricted the practical application of an otherwise highly accurate electronic structure model, particularly in nonadiabatic dynamics. Recently, the intersection problem among the excited states was fully characterized and resolved. However, intersections with the ground state remain an open challenge, and addressing this problem is our objective here. We present a generalized coupled cluster framework that correctly accounts for the geometric phase effect and avoids bifurcations of the solutions to the ground state equations. Several applications are presented that demonstrate the correct description of ground state conical intersections. We also propose how the framework can be used for other electronic-structure methods.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear semiclassical spectroscopy of ultrafast molecular polariton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that allows for the systematic and efficient description of the ultrafast nonlinear response of molecular polaritons, i.e., hybrid light-matter states, in the collective regime of large numbers of molecules $\mathcal N$ coupled to the cavity photon mode. Our approach is based on a semiclassical, mean-field evolution of the molecular Hamiltonian and the cavity field, which is complemented by a perturbative expansion of both light and matter counterparts in the input fields entering the cavity. In addition, expansion in terms of the pulse phases enables us to disentangle different excitation pathways in Liouville space, thereby distinguishing contributions to the nonlinear response. The formalism extends traditional free-space nonlinear spectroscopy by incorporating the feedback of matter onto the light field via the induced polarization. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by applying it to the calculation of pump-probe polariton spectra and show how, by storing the pulses, the cavity facilitates additional excitation pathways which are not possible in free space. Our method, which does not scale with $\mathcal N$, is broadly applicable and can be extended to a wide range of current experiments investigating the dynamical nonlinear response of hybrid light-matter states.</description>
