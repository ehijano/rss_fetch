      <title>A Search for Ultra-Light Vector Dark Matter with a Rotating Torsion Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for ultra-light vector dark matter interacting with a rotating torsion balance with a baryon minus lepton number composition dipole. Our search spans candidate masses in the ultra-low mass range from 1.3~$\times10^{-22}$ to 1.9~$\times10^{-18}$ eV. We set limits on the coupling strength to baryon minus lepton number for each dark matter candidate reaching a peak sensitivity of $g_{B-L} \leq 9 \times 10^{-26}$.</description>

      <title>Unbinned measurement of thrust in $e^+e^-$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 91.2 GeV with ALEPH archived data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong coupling constant ($\alpha_{S}$) is a fundamental parameter of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong force. Some of the earliest precise constraints on $\alpha_{S}$ came from measurements of event shape observables, such as thrust ($T$), using hadronic $Z$ boson decays produced in $e^+e^-$ collisions. However, recent work has revealed discrepancies between event-shape-based extractions of $\alpha_{S}$ and values determined using other experimental methods. This work reexamines archived $e^+e^-$ data collected at a collision energy of $\sqrt{s}=91.2$ GeV by the ALEPH detector at the Large Electron-Positron Collider. Modern machine learning techniques are used to correct for detector effects in an unbinned manner, allowing the $T$ distribution to be measured with higher granularity than previous ALEPH measurements. The new measurement reveals a small but systematic shift towards larger values of $\tau=1-T$, and the potential implications of this shift for $\alpha_{S}$ extractions are illustrated by comparing to state-of-the-art theoretical calculations. In addition, the region of $-6&lt;\log\tau&lt;-2$, where poorly-understood non-perturbative effects are large, is compared to modern parton shower Monte Carlo simulations. This measurement provides unique new inputs for $\alpha_{S}$ extractions and also improves constraints on phenomenological models of QCD dynamics such as parton fragmentation and hadronization.</description>

      <title>Discovery of XYZ particles at the BESIII Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charmonium is a bound state of a charmed quark and a charmed antiquark, and a charmoniumlike state is a resonant structure that contains at least a charmed quark-antiquark pair but has properties that are incompatible with a conventional charmonium state. The charmoniumlike states are also called XYZ particles to indicate their underlying nature is still unclear. The BESIII experiment has contributed significantly in the study of the XYZ particles, and here we review the discoveries of the Zc(3900), Zc(4020), and Zcs(3985) tetraquark states and the observations of several new vector charmoniumlike states at the BESIII experiment.</description>

      <title>Charge Trap Analysis in a SENSEI Skipper-CCD: Understanding Low-Energy Backgrounds in Rare-Event Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skipper Charge-Coupled Devices (Skipper-CCDs) are ultra-low-threshold detectors capable of detecting energy deposits in silicon at the eV scale. Increasingly used in rare-event searches, one of the major challenges in these experiments is mitigating low-energy backgrounds. In this work, we present results on trap characterization in a silicon Skipper-CCD produced in the same fabrication run as the SENSEI experiment at SNOLAB. Lattice defects contribute to backgrounds in rare-event searches through single-electron charge trapping. To investigate this, we employ the charge-pumping technique at different temperatures to identify dipoles produced by traps in the CCD channel. We fully characterize a fraction of these traps and use this information to extrapolate their contribution to the single-electron background in SENSEI. We find that this subpopulation of traps does not contribute significantly but more work is needed to assess the impact of the traps that can not be characterized.</description>

      <title>Constraints on effective field theories via quadruple-differential angular decay rates from $t$-channel single-top-quark production at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Events with $t$-channel single top quarks are used to probe effective field theory operators in $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV proton-proton collision data corresponding to 140 fb$^{-1}$ recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. An analysis method leveraging Fourier techniques applied to quadruple-differential decay rates based on observables containing angular information about the decays of the top quarks is used to achieve high sensitivity. The relevant effective field theory operators are those sensitive to top-quark decay and $t$-channel production vertices. Their Wilson coefficients are tightly constrained, with results compatible with Standard Model predictions.</description>

      <title>Likelihood Reconstruction for Radio Detectors of Neutrinos and Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy neutrinos and cosmic rays are excellent probes of astroparticle physics phenomena. For astroparticle physics analyses, robust and accurate reconstruction of signal parameters such as arrival direction and energy is essential. Radio detection is an established detector concept explored by many observatories; however, current reconstruction methods ignore bin-to-bin noise correlations, which limits reconstruction resolution and, so far, has prevented calculations of event-by-event uncertainties. In this work, we present a likelihood description of neutrino or cosmic-ray signals in radio detectors with correlated noise, as present in all neutrino and cosmic-ray radio detectors. We demonstrate, with simulation studies of both neutrinos and cosmic-ray radio signals, that signal parameters such as energy and direction, including event-by-event uncertainties with correct coverage, can be obtained. This method reduces reconstruction uncertainties and biases compared to previous approaches. Additionally, the Likelihood can be used for event selection and enables differentiable end-to-end detector optimization. The reconstruction code is available through the open-source software NuRadioReco.</description>

      <title>Seafloor Topography Enhances KM3NeT Sensitivity to ANITA-like Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the concept of \textit{topographic enhancement} in the context of ultra-high-energy neutrino detection by underwater neutrino telescopes. We demonstrate that the local topography around KM3NeT/ARCA can increase the detection efficiency in scenarios involving long-lived particles by up to a factor of $\sim 3$ due to the presence of an underwater mountain range in the direction of Malta. We consider a simplified model-independent approach that parametrizes the new physics able to generate both track-like and cascade-like signals in neutrino telescopes. When explaining the KM3-230213A event with a diffuse dark flux hypothesis, including its azimuthal direction--in addition to the zenith angle--provides additional constraints on the parameter space. In this effective model, the observations by KM3NeT and ANITA-IV can be simultaneously explained and the global tension with the lack of a corresponding detection in IceCube is reduced to 2.4 sigma. This work underscores the importance of incorporating topographic effects in the design and optimization of next-generation neutrino telescopes, as is done in the context of mountain-based detectors such as TAMBO. We present a numerical code which can be used to easily extend this topographical analysis to other experiments.</description>

      <title>Potential of discovering $\Xi_{cc}^+$ in $\Lambda_b $ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to search for $\Xi_{cc}^+$ in the decay $\Lambda_b \to \Xi_{cc}^+ D^-$, which serves as a tagged and reconstructible source of $\Xi_{cc}^+$, providing an experimentally clean environment for its discovery. A possible fully charged final state is $[(pK^- K^- \pi^+)_{\Xi^0_c} \pi^ + ]_{\Xi_{cc}^+} \,(K^+ \pi^- \pi^-)_{D^-}$, where the subscripts indicate the parent hadron in the decay chain. We estimate the branching fraction to be ${\cal B}(\Lambda_b \to \Xi_{cc}^+ D^-) = ( 5.1 \pm 3.9) \times 10^{-4}$, while the fully charged final state corresponds to an effective branching fraction of order $10^{-8}$. These results indicate that LHCb has the potential to discover the $\Xi_{cc}^+$. The prospects for observing $\Omega_{cc}^+$ are also briefly discussed.</description>

Abstract: We present updated predictions for rapidity and transverse-momentum spectra in Higgs-plus-jet production at proton colliders, combining NLO fixed-order QCD with next-to-leading energy-logarithmic resummation. Preliminary results for the $Z$-boson case are also discussed. Our study underscores the importance of improving fixed-order predictions for Higgs- and $Z$-plus-jet observables to meet the precision demands of Higgs and electroweak measurements at the LHC and future FCC energies.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Flavor Fragmentation and Jet Structure from HF-NRevo: Bridging to Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present recent progress on the Heavy-Flavor Non-Relativistic Evolution (HF-NRevo) framework, designed to describe leading-power fragmentation of heavy-flavored hadrons at moderate to large transverse momentum. Starting from NLO NRQCD calculations for all partonic channels into pseudoscalar quarkonia, we construct the NRFF1.0 collinear fragmentation functions via DGLAP evolution in a variable-flavor number scheme. We outline future prospects in the heavy-ion context, where HF-NRevo can serve as a baseline for modeling in-medium modifications of heavy-flavor fragmentation in nuclear collisions. Its accurate modeling of the partonic hierarchy and threshold effects makes it ideally suited to explore jet-quenching sensitivity, energy-loss mechanisms, and the emergence of medium-modified fragmentation functions in the quark-gluon plasma. Moreover, it provides a natural baseline for implementing in-medium hadronization scenarios, including quarkonium regeneration and fragmentation-function apparent-shape distortion. These developments provide new handles for exploring heavy-flavor dynamics at the HL-LHC and future collider facilities.</description>

      <title>Scintillation of liquid nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid nitrogen is commonly used in cryogenic applications and is a promising medium for the direct immersion cooling of sensors used for nuclear and particle physics experiments. The scintillation properties of gaseous nitrogen are well-documented, but little is known about the scintillation of liquid nitrogen. If present, scintillation light from interactions of ambient radioactivity could produce backgrounds for rare event searches such as the direct detection of dark matter. Using a coincidence-tagged alpha decay, we demonstrate that liquid nitrogen exhibits measurable, albeit very faint, scintillation. Assuming the same scintillation wavelength spectrum as gaseous nitrogen, we estimate a relative scintillation yield of $Y_{\text{LN}}/Y^{\text{STP}}_{\text{GN}} = 0.0142 \pm 0.0005\text{(stat)} \pm 0.0030\text{(sys)}$ with respect to gaseous nitrogen at standard temperature and pressure. Considering the average scintillation yield from alpha decays in gaseous nitrogen, this implies a scintillation yield for alpha decays in liquid nitrogen of $Y_{\text{LN}} = 2.39 \pm 0.56$ photons per MeV. To our knowledge this is the first measurement of scintillation in liquid nitrogen.</description>

      <title>Emergent spin polarization from $\rho$ meson condensation in rotating hadronic matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of vector mesons in extreme environments provides a unique probe of non-perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics. We investigate the conditions for Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of spin-1 $\rho$ mesons in dense rotating hadronic matter, a regime relevant to the peripheral heavy-ion collisions and the interiors of rapidly rotating neutron stars. When the $\rho$ meson chemical potential ($\mu_\rho$) approaches its effective mass ($m_\rho^*$), a phase transition to BEC occurs. We demonstrate that this transition is non-trivially influenced by global rotation, which couples to the spin of the $\rho$ mesons, leading to a macroscopic spin alignment of the condensate along the axis of rotation. This interplay between condensation and rotation results in distinct polarization patterns, which can serve as a possible signature of a BEC in experiments. The results suggest that rapidly rotating neutron stars may harbor an anisotropic, spin-polarized $\rho$-condensed phase, which could impact their equation of state.</description>

      <title>Effective Theory for Light Portal Dark Matter Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for the computation of light portal dark matter direct detection, incorporating a consistent treatment of finite momentum transfer. In this framework, dark matter interacts with Standard Model matter through a light mediator, which simultaneously serves as the force carrier for dark matter self-interaction, potentially with a distinct coupling strength. The corresponding effective theory relevant for detecting this class of dark matter is systematically constructed. Our analysis focuses on light (semi)relativistic dark matter, which may originate from cosmic-ray boosting and can be probed in high threshold experiments such as large-volume neutrino detectors. In this context, the nucleon matrix elements of the effective operators at finite momentum transfer are required, made available through recent advances in lattice QCD and related nonperturbative methods. The relativistic Fermi gas model is used to convert the nucleon-level momentum transfer to the nuclear level, thereby incorporating nuclear effects pertinent to heavy target experiments. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, we present ultraviolet-complete examples featuring spin-1 and spin-2 portal dark matter. For these models, we compute the differential cross sections with respect to momentum transfer, adopting parameter choices that address the so-called core-cusp problem in astrophysical observations via dark matter self-interactions.</description>

      <title>Search for new physics effects in $\nu\bar{\nu}\gamma$ production at a Tera-Z factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare decays of the Z boson provide a sensitive probe for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). This study investigates the $e^{+}e^{-} \to Z \to \nu\bar{\nu}\gamma$ process within the context of the Tera-Z programmes at future colliders such as the FCC-ee and CEPC. The SM predicts a one-loop branching ratio of $7.16 \times 10^{-10}$ for $Z \to \nu\bar{\nu}\gamma$, a value four times smaller than the current experimental limit from the LEP. To explore this window for new physics, we parameterize anomalous $Z\nu\bar{\nu}\gamma$ interactions using an Effective Field Theory framework, considering both dimension-6 and dimension-8 operators. A detailed simulation is performed by generating signal and background events with MadGraph, modeling particle showers with Pythia, and simulating detector effects with Delphes. The analysis employs key kinematic variables-including the photon energy ($E_\gamma$), missing transverse energy ($\not{E}_T$), and the missing transverse energy significance ($S_{\not{E}_T}$) to isolate the signal. The results yield upper limits on the anomalous couplings, from which we infer branching ratios for $Z \to \nu\bar{\nu}\gamma$ on the order of $10^{-9}$. This represents a significant improvement of several orders of magnitude over the LEP sensitivity. Consequently, this study demonstrates the unique potential of the Tera-Z runs not only to test the SM loop-level predictions with unprecedented precision but also to tightly constrain or reveal new anomalous interactions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The BESIII collaboration has recently observed a resonant structure $Y(4500)$ in $e^{+}e^{-}\to J/\psi K^{+}K^{-}$, whose origin remains unresolved. In this study, we analyze the cross section line shape of $e^{+}e^{-}\to J/\psi K^{+}K^{-}$ by taking into account the $\psi(4415)$ state and intermediate charmed meson loops. By treating $\psi(4415)$ as both a pure $S$-wave state and $S$-$D$ mixed states, and introducing the $Z_{cs}^{(\prime)}$ resonance, we find that the $Y(4500)$ peak at $\sqrt{s}=4.5~\text{GeV}$ arises from the triangle singularity mechanism in the $Z_{cs}^{(\prime)}$-mediated rescattering processes, supporting its interpretation as a threshold effect rather than a conventional resonance.</description>

      <title>Validation of field cage and cathode for low radioactivity operation with the CYGNO experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter, which is considered to account for approximately the 27% of the Universe's energy-mass content, remains an open issue in modern particle physics along with its composition. The CYGNO Experiment aims to exploit an innovative approach applied to the direct detection search of low energy nuclear recoils possibly induced by cold particle-like dark matter candidates. CYGNO employs a directional detector based on a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) filled with a He:CF$_{4}$ gas mixture and equipped with an optical readout. Currently, the CYGNO Collaboration is constructing the detector demonstrator, CYGNO-04, in Hall F at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). This 0.4 m$^3$ detector has the goal of proving the scalability of the technology and assessing the physics and radiopurity capabilities. Given the low radioactivity requirements, especially in internal components such as field cage and cathode, the reduction of material while keeping the correct electrical behavior is paramount. In this paper, we present the validation of several internal components, mainly focusing on the field cage material and support structure. The tests included geometrical asymmetries in the electric field response, collection efficiency as well as measurement of known physical quantities. A preferred configuration is found with a structure based on Nylon material which supports a PET or Kapton sheet with copper strips deposited on.</description>

      <title>New Hypernuclei Measurements from STAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypernuclei are bound states of hyperons (Y) and nucleons (N). Measurements on their yields can help us investigate their production mechanisms. In particular, the ${}^5_{\Lambda}$He and $^{4}_{\Lambda}$H(e) are bounded substantially tighter compared to the $^{3}_{\Lambda}$H. The large radius of the $^{3}_{\Lambda}$H leads to suppression in coalescence models, but not in the thermal model where the size of the nucleus does not play a role. As such, studying the $A=3$--5 hypernuclei yields allow us to extract information on the effects of hypernuclear binding on hypernuclei production in heavy-ion collisions.
  In these proceedings, we present measurements of ${}^5_{\Lambda}$He yields in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0$ GeV, $^{4}_{\Lambda}$H(e) yields in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0$--$4.5$ GeV, and $^{3}_{\Lambda}$H yields in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3$--$27$ GeV. Results on the directed flow of hypernuclei are also reported. The physics implications of these measurements are discussed.</description>

      <title>Model-independent mass determination of near-threshold states from short-range production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel observable for the precision measurements of a wide class of near-threshold dimer states: the short-range production rate of a dimer--spectator two-body system, composed of the given near-threshold state and one of its constituents. Within the framework of nonrelativistic effective field theory, these production rates exhibit characteristic line shapes for the specific partial wave and reach a model-independent minimum. This feature enables a precise extraction of their masses from experimental data, provided that the line shape can be resolved with sufficient accuracy. Applying this novel method to both the $T_{b\bar{b}1}(10610)B$ and $T_{b\bar{b}1}(10650)B^*$ systems allows for a precise determination of the binding energy $\delta$ of the $T_{b\bar{b}1}(10610)$ and $T_{b\bar{b}1}(10650)$ via the relation of $\delta=-{E_{\text{dip}}^{\text{exp}}}/{0.1983}$ once the respective dip position $E_{\text{dip}}^{\text{exp}}$ is experimentally identified.</description>

      <title>Opportunities at FCC-ee for quark &amp; lepton flavour physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FCC-ee phase of a Future Circular Collider is generating great interest due to its versatility, allowing the study of various electroweak thresholds, $Z$, $WW$, $ZH$, and $t \bar{t}$. Electroweak precision physics is complemented by flavour physics measurements based on the unprecedented statistics attainable at the $Z$ pole, and benefiting from the low-background experimental environment (similar to Belle II), and from the production of the full spectrum of hadron species together with large boosts (similar to LHCb). A wide range of measurements is possible, spanning a rich variety of physics cases in both quark and lepton flavour physics sectors. Other electroweak thresholds can also be considered in this endeavour. A commensurate effort from the theory community will be needed to interpret future measurements. I present an overview of the broad potential of the FCC-ee flavour physics program.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article describes experiments in space which measure charged cosmic ray particles in the range from $10\,\mathrm{GV}$ to $10^5\,\mathrm{GV}$ of magnetic rigidity $p/(Ze)$. In this energy range, cosmic rays are expected to originate from sources in the Milky Way and be confined to our galaxy. Spectra of nuclei and their chemical composition are discussed. The spectrum of antiprotons and the search for heavier anti-nuclei are covered. All spectra and especially those of electrons and positrons are analysed for indications of unconventional particle sources, acceleration or transport mechanisms.</description>

Abstract: By analysing $e^+e^-$ annihilation data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 368.48~pb$^{-1}$ collected at the centre-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s} = 4.918$ and $4.951$~GeV with the BESIII detector, we report the first observation of $\Lambda_{c}(2595)^{+}$ and $\Lambda_{c}(2625)^{+}\to \Lambda^{+}_{c}\pi^0\pi^0$ with statistical significances of 7.9$\sigma$ and 11.8$\sigma$, respectively. The branching fractions of $\Lambda_{c}(2595)^{+}$ and $\Lambda_{c}(2625)^{+}\to \Lambda^{+}_{c}\pi^0\pi^0$ are measured to be $(59.5 \pm 11.1_{\rm stat.} \pm 7.9_{\rm syst.}) \%$ and $(41.0 \pm 5.2_{\rm stat.} \pm 3.3_{\rm syst.}) \%$, respectively. The absolute branching fraction of $\Lambda_{c}(2595)^{+}$ is consistent with the expectation of the mechanism referred to as the threshold effect, proposed for the strong decays of $\Lambda_{c}(2595)^{+}$ within uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: Based on $(10087\pm44)\times 10^6$ $J/\psi$ events recorded with the BESIII detector, we search for the rare charmonium weak decays $J/\psi\to D_{s}^{-}\rho^{+}+c.c.$ and $J/\psi\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}+c.c.$ No signal is observed, and upper limits on the branching fractions at the $90\%$ confidence level are set as $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\to D_{s}^{-}\rho^{+}+c.c.)&lt;8.0\times10^{-7}$ and $\mathcal{B}(J/\psi\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}+c.c.)&lt;4.1\times10^{-7}$. Our results provide the most stringent experimental constraints on these decays.</description>

Abstract: Using $20.3\,\rm fb^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collision data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773\,GeV with the BESIII detector, we present the measurements of the absolute branching fractions of the doubly Cabibbo-suppressed decays $D^+\to K^+\pi^0$, $D^+\to K^+\eta$ and $ D^+ \to K^+ \eta^{\prime}$ with the double-tag method, with significantly improved precision compared to the previous measurements. The statistical significance of each signal decay exceeds $10\sigma$. The branching fractions are determined to be ${\mathcal B}(D^+\to K^+ \pi^0) = (1.45 \pm 0.06 \pm 0.08)\times 10^{-4}$, ${\mathcal B}(D^+\to K^+ \eta) = (1.17 \pm 0.10 \pm 0.03)\times 10^{-4}$ and ${\mathcal B}(D^+\to K^+ \eta^{\prime}) = (1.88 \pm 0.15 \pm 0.11)\times 10^{-4}$, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic. The branching fractions of $D^+\to K^+\eta$ and $ D^+ \to K^+ \eta^{\prime}$ are consistent with the world average values. The reported branching fraction of $D^+\to K^+\pi^0$ deviates with the world average value by 3$\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Joint neutrino oscillation analysis from the T2K and NOvA experiments</title>

Abstract: The landmark discovery that neutrinos have mass and can change type (or "flavor") as they propagate -- a process called neutrino oscillation -- has opened up a rich array of theoretical and experimental questions being actively pursued today. Neutrino oscillation remains the most powerful experimental tool for addressing many of these questions, including whether neutrinos violate charge-parity (CP) symmetry, which has possible connections to the unexplained preponderance of matter over antimatter in the universe. Oscillation measurements also probe the mass-squared differences between the different neutrino mass states ($\Delta m^2$), whether there are two light states and a heavier one (normal ordering) or vice versa (inverted ordering), and the structure of neutrino mass and flavor mixing. Here, we carry out the first joint analysis of data sets from NOvA and T2K, the two currently operating long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments (hundreds of kilometers of neutrino travel distance), taking advantage of our complementary experimental designs and setting new constraints on several neutrino sector parameters. This analysis provides new precision on the $\Delta m^2_{32}$ mass difference, finding $2.43^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\ \left(-2.48^{+0.03}_{-0.04}\right)\times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{eV}^2$ in the normal (inverted) ordering, as well as a $3\sigma$ interval on $\delta_{\rm CP}$ of $[-1.38\pi,\ 0.30\pi]$ $\left([-0.92\pi,\ -0.04\pi]\right)$ in the normal (inverted) ordering. The data show no strong preference for either mass ordering, but notably if inverted ordering were assumed true within the three-flavor mixing paradigm, then our results would provide evidence of CP symmetry violation in the lepton sector.</description>

      <title>Analog Hawking radiation emitted by a perfectly reflecting mirror</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.00550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog Hawking radiation emitted by a perfectly reflecting mirror in (1+3)-dimensional flat spacetime is investigated. This is accomplished by studying the reflected frequency and momentum based on Einstein's mirror, instead of the canonical way of solving, if possible, wave equations subjected to a dynamical Dirichlet boundary condition. In the case of a finite-size mirror, diffraction pattern appears in the radiation spectrum. Based on the relevant parameters in the proposed Analog Black Hole Evaporation via Lasers experiment, in which the Hawking temperature $T_{H}\simeq 0.03$ eV and the mirror area $A\simeq (50\;\mu\mathrm{m})^{2}$, the Hawking photon yield is estimated to be $N\simeq 16$/laser shot.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein Condensation and Dissipative Dynamics in a Relativistic Pion Gas</title>

Abstract: Pion condensation in ultra-relativistic collisions presents a compelling theoretical phenomenon with significant implications for the dynamics of hadronic matter. Various theoretical frameworks offer insight into the nature of high-temperature Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). The present study investigates the dissipative behavior of a relativistic pion gas undergoing Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Further, we obtain viscosity ($\eta$), bulk viscosity ($\zeta$), and speed of sound ($c_s$) by employing the Boltzmann transport equation with the relaxation time approximation. Findings show a substantial drop in $\eta/s$ and $\zeta/s$ with the fractional increase in condensation. This effect is becoming more evident in larger systems approaching the thermodynamic limit. Alongside the reduction in viscosities, the speed of sound also decreases with increasing condensation, indicating a softening of the equation of state. The analysis of finite-size effects reveals that larger systems exhibit more pronounced signatures of BEC. These results suggest that pion condensation can influence the hydrodynamic evolution of the hadronic phase in heavy-ion collisions, with consequential implications for interpreting collective flow observables and the underlying equation of state.</description>

Abstract: Axions are considered a key component of dark matter, characterized by very weak couplings to fermions and Chern-Simons couplings to gauge fields. We propose a novel detection mechanism based on symmetry-breaking magnetoelectric materials with a linear axionic coupling between magnetization and ferroelectric polarization. The focus is on a strain gradient Sr2IrO4 film, where the breaking of space-inversion symmetry results in an emergent polar phase and an out-of-plane magnetic moment, exhibiting a flexomagnetoelectric effect. In this material, the linear P||M enables a direct coupling between the external axion field and the intrinsic axion-like field, which amplifies the weak electromagnetic signals induced by axions, paving the way for pioneering axion detection. In contrast to conventional detection techniques, this mechanism is expected to enhance the sensitivity of the axion-electron and axion-photon coupling, providing a novel platform for axion detection and advancing the study of dark matter through the magnetoelectric effect.</description>

Abstract: The collective-flow-assisted nuclear shape-imaging method in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions has recently been used to characterize nuclear collective states. In this paper, we assess the foundations of the shape-imaging technique employed in these studies. We argue that some current UHIC nuclear imaging techniques neglect fundamental aspects of spontaneous symmetry-breaking and symmetry-restoration in colliding ions and incorrectly infer one-body multipole moments from studies of nucleonic correlations. Therefore, the impact of this approach on nuclear structure research has been overstated. Conversely, efforts to incorporate existing knowledge on nuclear shapes into analysis pipelines can be beneficial for benchmarking tools and calibrating models used to extract information from ultra-relativistic heavy-ion experiments.</description>

      <title>Fresh look at the nuclear transparency using the generalized parton distributions</title>

Abstract: Color transparency (CT) is a fundamental phenomenon in QCD in which hadrons produced in high-energy exclusive processes traverse nuclear matter with minimal interactions. Nuclear transparency, which quantifies this attenuation suppression, is a quantity with high sensitivity to CT effects and provides critical insights into QCD dynamics in nuclear environments. In this study, we revisit nuclear transparency using the framework of generalized parton distributions (GPDs). By constructing nuclear GPDs (nGPDs) through the incorporation of nuclear parton distribution functions, we calculate the nuclear transparency $ T(Q^2) $ for the carbon nucleus as a function of momentum transfer $ Q^2 $ considering various definitions and compare the results obtained with available experimental data. Our finding highlights the importance of choosing a physically motivated definition of nuclear transparency. Moreover, we emphasize that a more reliable determination of nGPDs requires a dedicated global analysis incorporating nuclear data. Such an approach is essential for improving the theoretical understanding of CT and for achieving consistency with experimental observations in the high-$ Q^2 $ regime.</description>

Abstract: We present the calculation of complete next-to-leading order electroweak corrections to the Higgs boson production in $gg\to g H$ channel. We apply the method of differential equations combined with the selection of optimized master integrals to accomplish the calculation of master integrals. We consider three distinct renormalization schemes. At leading order, the differential distributions and the total cross section show a strong dependence on the renormalization scheme. However, these discrepancies are considerably suppressed once electroweak corrections are taken into account. For $G_\mu$ scheme, the electroweak correction amounts to approximately $4.3\%$ of the total cross section. Importantly, we find that the EW corrections exhibit a strong dependence on Higgs transverse momentum.</description>
