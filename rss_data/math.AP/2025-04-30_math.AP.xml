      <title>Rigidity of symmetric doubly-periodic water waves near shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that symmetric, doubly periodic, capillary-gravity water waves in finite depth bifurcating from non-uniform non-stagnant shear flows are necessarily two-dimensional to leading order. This is in stark contrast to the case of uniform background flows, where the existence of truly three-dimensional bifurcating waves is well known. While this paper focuses on capillary-gravity water waves, our proof also applies to other suitable types of dynamic boundary conditions, such as hydroelastic waves.</description>

      <title>Continuum mechanics model of graphene as a doubly-periodic perforated thin elastic plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a continuum mechanics model of graphene is proposed, and its analytical solution is derived. Graphene is modeled as a doubly-periodic thin elastic plate with a hexagonal cell having a circular hole at the hexagon center. Graphene is characterized by a general chiral vector and is subject to remote tension. For the solution, the Filshtinskii solution obtained for the symmetric case is generalized for any chirality. The method uses the doubly-periodic Kolosov-Muskhelishvili complex potentials, the theory of the elliptic Weierstrass function and quasi-doubly-periodic meromorphic functions and reduces the model to an infinite system of linear algebraic equations with complex coefficients. Analytical expressions and numerical values for the stresses are displacements are obtained and discussed. The displacements expressions possess the Young modulus and Poisson ratio of the graphene bonds. They are derived as functions of the effective graphene moduli available in the literature.</description>

      <title>The effect of finite duration sources on modes and generalization of the d'Alembert solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of dispersive waves governed by linear wave equations, where a finite duration source is applied. The resulting wave may be viewed as the superposition of modes before the source is turned on and after it is turned off. We consider the problem of relating the modes after the source term is turned off to the modes before the source term was turned on. We obtain explicit formulas in both the wavenumber and position representations. A number of special cases are considered. Using the methods presented, we obtain a generalization of the d'Alembert solution which applies to linear wave equations with constant coefficients.</description>

      <title>Existence and multiplicity of positive solutions to a critical elliptic equation with logarithmic perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the existence and multiplicity of positive solutions for the following critical problem with logarithmic term:
  \begin{equation*}\label{eq11}\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
  -\Delta u={\mu\left|u\right|}^{{2}^{\ast }-2}u+\nu |u|^{q-2}u+\lambda u+\theta u\log {u}^{2}, &amp;x\in \Omega,\\ u=0, &amp;x\in \partial \Omega,\\ \end{array} \right.\end{equation*}
  where $\Omega$ $\subset$ $\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded smooth domain, $ \nu, \lambda\in \mathbb{R}$, $\mu&gt;0, \theta&lt;0$, $N\ge3$,
  ${2}^{\ast }=\frac{2N}{N-2}$ is the critical Sobolev exponent for the embedding $H^1_{0}(\Omega)\hookrightarrow L^{2^\ast}(\Omega)$ and $q\in (2, 2^*)$, and which can be seen as a Br$\acute{e}$zis-Nirenberg problem. Under some assumptions on the $\mu, \nu, \lambda, \theta$ and $q$, we will prove that the above problem has at least two positive solutions: One is the least energy solution, and the other one is the Mountain pass solution. As far as we know, the existing results on the existence of positive solutions to a Br$\acute{e}$zis-Nirenberg problem are to find a positive solution, and no one has given the existence of
  at least two positive solutions on it. So our results is totally new on this aspect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Green's function and the large time behavior of the one-dimensional Euler-Maxwell System with relaxation. Firstly, we construct the Green's function of linearized system and obtain the optimal time decay rates of its solutions. And then, we obtain the global existence and the optimal time decay rates of solutions to the nonlinear system by using Green's function and a suitable energy estimate.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Gaussians in the Hellinger-Kantorovich-Boltzmann gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study leverages the basic insight that the gradient-flow equation associated with the relative Boltzmann entropy, in relation to a Gaussian reference measure within the Hellinger-Kantorovich (HK) geometry, preserves the class of Gaussian measures. This invariance serves as the foundation for constructing a reduced gradient structure on the parameter space characterizing Gaussian densities. We derive explicit ordinary differential equations that govern the evolution of mean, covariance, and mass under the HK-Boltzmann gradient flow. The reduced structure retains the additive form of the HK metric, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics involved.
  We explore the geodesic convexity of the reduced system, revealing that global convexity is confined to the pure transport scenario, while a variant of sublevel semi-convexity is observed in the general case. Furthermore, we demonstrate exponential convergence to equilibrium through Polyak-Lojasiewicz-type inequalities, applicable both globally and on sublevel sets. By monitoring the evolution of covariance eigenvalues, we refine the decay rates associated with convergence. Additionally, we extend our analysis to non-Gaussian targets exhibiting strong log-lambda-concavity, corroborating our theoretical results with numerical experiments that encompass a Gaussian-target gradient flow and a Bayesian logistic regression application.</description>

      <title>Large-data regular solutions in a one-dimensional thermoviscoelastic evolution problem involving temperature-dependent viscosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The model \[
  \left\{ \begin{array}{l}
  u_{tt} = \big(\gamma(\Theta) u_{xt}\big)_x + au_{xx} - \big(f(\Theta)\big)_x, \\[1mm]
  \Theta_t = \Theta_{xx} + \gamma(\Theta) u_{xt}^2 - f(\Theta) u_{xt},
  \end{array} \right. \] for thermoviscoelastic evolution in one-dimensional Kelvin-Voigt materials is considered.
  By means of an approach based on maximal Sobolev regularity theory of scalar parabolic equations, it is shown that if $\gamma_0&gt;0$ is fixed, then there exists $\delta=\delta(\gamma_0)&gt;0$ with the property that for suitably regular initial data of arbitrary size an associated initial-boundary value problem posed in an open bounded interval admits a global classical solution whenever $\gamma\in C^2([0,\infty))$ and $f\in C^2([0,\infty))$ are such that $f(0)=0$ and $|f(\xi)| \le K_f \cdot (\xi+1)^\alpha$ for all $\xi\ge 0$ and some $K_f&gt;0$ and $\alpha&lt;\frac{3}{2}$, and that \[
  \gamma_0 \le \gamma(\xi) \le \gamma_0 + \delta
  \qquad \mbox{for all } \xi\ge 0. \] This is supplemented by a statement on global existence of certain strong solutions, particularly continuous in both components, under weaker conditions on the initial data.</description>

      <title>Boundary Control and Calder\'on type Inverse Problems in Non-local heat equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine various density results related to the solutions of the non-local heat equation at a specific time slice, focusing on two distinct models: one with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and the other with singular boundary data. We explore both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the approximations. Additionally, we address Calder\'on-type inverse problems for these parabolic models, where we recover the potentials by analyzing the solutions either on the boundary or at a particular time slice. In both the density results and the Calder\'on type inverse problems, the Pohozaev identity plays a crucial role. Finally, in the last section, we apply the Pohozaev identity to a specific elliptic eigenvalue problem and demonstrate that the eigenfunctions, when divided by an appropriate power of the distance function, can not vanish on any non-empty open subset of the boundary.</description>

      <title>On an Initial Value Problem Describing the Small Oscillations of a Floating Cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a coupled PDE-ODE system modeling the small oscillations of a floating cylinder interacting with small water waves. We consider the case when the floating is supposed to be an infinite circular cylinder, so that the equations of the free surface of the fluid can be written in one space dimension. The governing equations are formulated as an abstract evolution equation in a suitable Hilbert space, and we establish the well-posedness of the associated initial value problem. A key element of the proof is the analysis of a partial Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on an unbounded domain with a non-smooth boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the incompressible Euler equation and prove that the set of weak solutions is path-connected. More precisely, we construct paths of H\"older regularity $C^{1/2}$, valued in $C^0_{t, loc} L^2_x$ endowed with the strong topology. The main result relies on a convex integration construction adapted from the seminal work of De Lellis and Sz\'ekelyhidi [14, The Euler equations as a differential inclusion], extending it to a more broader geometric framework, replacing balls with arbitrary convex compact sets.</description>

      <title>Vladimirov-Pearson Operators on $\zeta$-regular Ultrametric Cantor Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20753v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new operator for certain types of ultrametric Cantor sets is constructed using the measure coming from the spectral triple associated with the Cantor set, as well as its zeta function. Under certain mild conditions on that measure, it is shown that it is an integral operator similar to the Vladimirov-Taibleson operator on the p-adic integers. Its spectral properties are studied, and the Markov property and kernel representation of the heat kernel generated by this so-called \emph{Vladimirov-Pearson} operator is shown, viewed as acting on a certain Sobolev space. A large class of these operators have a heat kernel and a Green function explicitly given by the ultrametric wavelets on the Cantor set, which are eigenfunctions of the operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this work is to establish a systematic study of boundary value problems within the framework of differential forms and variable exponent spaces. Specifically, we investigate the Hodge Laplacian and related first order systems like the div-curl systems, Hodge-Dirac systems, and Bogovskii-type problems in the context of variable exponent spaces. Our approach yields both existence theorems and elliptic estimates. These estimates provide key results such as the Hodge decomposition theorem, Gaffney inequality, and gauge fixing. These findings are crucial for advancing the nonlinear theory related to problems involving differential forms.</description>

      <title>Semi-discrete optimal transport techniques for the compressible semi-geostrophic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove existence of weak solutions of the 3D compressible semi-geostrophic (SG) equations with compactly supported measure-valued initial data. These equations model large-scale atmospheric flows. Our proof uses a particle discretisation and semi-discrete optimal transport techniques. We show that, if the initial data is a discrete measure, then the compressible SG equations admit a unique, twice continuously differentiable, energy-conserving and global-in-time solution. In general, by discretising the initial measure by particles and sending the number of particles to infinity, we show that for any compactly supported initial measure there exists a global-in-time solution of the compressible SG equations that is Lipschitz in time. This significantly generalises the original results due to Cullen and Maroofi (2003), and it provides the theoretical foundation for the design of numerical schemes using semi-discrete optimal transport to solve the 3D compressible SG equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, essential progress has been made in the nonlinear stability analysis of periodic Lugiato-Lefever waves against co-periodic and localized perturbations. Inspired by considerations from fiber optics, we introduce a novel iteration scheme which allows to perturb against sums of co-periodic and localized functions. This unifies previous stability theories in a natural manner.</description>

      <title>Another regularizing property of the 2D eikonal equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A weak solution of the two-dimensional eikonal equation amounts to a vector field $m\colon\Omega\subset\mathbb R^2\to\mathbb R^2$ such that $|m|=1$ a.e. and $\mathrm{div}\,m=0$ in $\mathcal D'(\Omega)$. It is known that, if $m$ has some low regularity, e.g., continuous or $W^{1/3,3}$, then $m$ is automatically more regular: locally Lipschitz outside a locally finite set. A long-standing conjecture by Aviles and Giga, if true, would imply the same regularizing effect under the Besov regularity assumption $m\in B^{1/3}_{p,\infty}$ for $p&gt;3$. In this note we establish that regularizing effect in the borderline case $p=6$, above which the Besov regularity assumption implies continuity. If the domain is a disk and $m$ satisfies tangent boundary conditions, we also prove this for $p$ slightly below $6$.</description>

      <title>Bulk metric reconstruction from entanglement data via minimal surface area variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the reconstruction of asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) bulk geometries from boundary entanglement entropy data for ball-shaped entangling regions. By deriving an explicit inversion formula, we relate variations in entanglement entropy to deviations of the bulk metric about a fixed background. Applying this formula, we recover the Schwarzschild-AdS spacetime in the low-temperature regime to first order. We further extend our analysis to include deformations of the bulk geometry with nontrivial dependence on boundary directions, and propose an iterative reconstruction scheme aimed at recovering the full spacetime starting close to a conformal fixed point. We do this by building on recent advances in the mathematics of inverse problems by introducing the higher-order linearization method as a new tool in the context of holographic bulk reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Dynamic output-based feedback stabilizability for linear parabolic equations with memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stabilizability of a general class of linear parabolic equations with a memory term, is achieve by explicit output feedback. The control input is given as a function of a state-estimate provided by an exponential dynamic Luenberger observer based on the output of sensor measurements. The numbers of actuators and sensors are finite. The feedback input and output injection operators are given explicitly involving appropriate orthogonal projections. For exponential kernels, exponential stabilizability can be achieved with the rate of the exponential kernel. The discretization and simulation of the controlled systems are addressed as well and results of simulations are reported showing the performance of the proposed dynamic output-based control feedback input. We include simulations for both exponential and weakly singular Riesz kernels, showing the success of the strategy in obtaining a stabilizing input.</description>

      <title>Removable sets for pseudoconvexity for weakly smooth boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for bounded domains in $\mathbb C^n$ with $\mathcal C^{1,1}$ smooth boundary, if there is a closed set $F$ of $2n-1$-Lebesgue measure $0$ such that $\partial \Omega \setminus F$ is $\mathcal C^{2}$-smooth and locally pseudoconvex at every point, then $\Omega$ is globally pseudoconvex. Unlike in the globally $\mathcal C^{2}$-smooth case, the condition ``$F$ of (relative) empty interior'' is not enough to obtain such a result. We also give some results under peak-set type hypotheses, which in particular provide a new proof of an old result of Grauert and Remmert about removable sets for pseudoconvexity under minimal hypotheses of boundary regularity.</description>

      <title>Convergence, concentration and critical mass phenomena in a model of cell motion with boundary signal production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08654v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model of cell motion with boundary signal production which describes some aspects of eukaryotic cell migration. Generic polarity markers located in the cell are transported by actin which they help to polymerize. This leads to a problem whose mathematical novelty is the nonlinear and nonlocal destabilizing term in the boundary condition.
  We provide a detailed study of the qualitative properties of this model, namely local and global existence, convergence and blow-up of solutions. We start with a complete analysis of local existence-uniqueness in Lebesgue spaces. This turns out to be particularly relevant, in view of the mass conservation property and of the existence of $L^p$ Liapunov functionals, also obtained in this paper.
  With the help of this local theory, we next study the global existence and convergence of solutions. In particular, in the case of quadratic nonlinearity, for any space dimension, we find an explicit, sharp mass threshold for global existence vs.~finite time blow-up of solutions. The proof is delicate, based on the possiblity to control the solution by means of the entropy function via an $\eps$-regularity type argument. This critical mass phenomenon is somehow reminiscent of the well-known situation for the $2d$ Keller-Segel system. For nonlinearitities with general power growth, under a suitable smallness condition on the initial data, we show that solutions exist globally and converge exponentially to a constant.
  As for the possibility of blow-up for large initial data, it turns out to occur only for nonlinearities with quadratic or superquadratic growth, whereas all solutions are shown to be global and bounded in the subquadratic case, thus revealing the existence of a sharp critical exponent for blow-up. Finally, we analyse some aspects of the blow-up asymptotics of solutions in time and space.</description>

      <title>The Maslov index, degenerate crossings and the stability of pulse solutions to the Swift-Hohenberg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04003v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the scalar Swift-Hohenberg equation with quadratic-cubic nonlinearity, it is known that symmetric pulse solutions exist for certain parameter regions. In this paper we develop a method to determine the spectral stability of these solutions by associating a Maslov index to them. This requires extending the method of computing the Maslov index introduced by Robbin and Salamon [Topology 32, no.4 (1993): 827-844] to so-called degenerate crossings. We extend their formulation of the Maslov index to degenerate crossings of general order in the case where the intersection is fully degenerate, meaning that if the dimension of the intersection is k, then each of the k crossings is a degenerate one. We then argue that, in this case, this index coincides with the number of unstable eigenvalues for the linearized evolution equation. Furthermore, we develop a numerical method to compute the Maslov index associated to symmetric pulse solutions. Finally, we consider several solutions to the Swift-Hohenberg equation and use our method to characterize their stability.</description>

Abstract: We study stability of travelling wave solutions to Korteweg--de Vries type equations which has the fractional dispersion and integer-indices double power nonlinearities. It may depend on parity combinations of the two indices and the strength of dispersion whether these equations have a ground state solution. Therefore, we observe the stability phenomena on travelling wave solutions from the perspective of the parities and the dispersion, and we give the classification of phenomena on travelling wave solutions. In this paper, we focus on stable travelling wave solutions.</description>

When $k=\frac4n$, problem $(E)$ only has the solutions with the form $$u_{\tilde x,t}(x)=\beta_n \Big(\frac{t}{t^2+|x-\tilde x|^2)}\Big)^{\frac{n}{2}}\quad \text{ for any $t&gt;0$, $\tilde x\in\mathbb{R}^n$},$$ where $n\in\mathbb{N}$, $\beta_n=2^{\frac n2} e^{\frac n2\psi(\frac n2) }&gt;0$. When $k\in(0,+\infty)\setminus\{\frac 4n\}$, problem $(E)$ has no any positive solution.</description>

      <title>Hypersonic flow onto a large curved wedge and the dissipation of shock wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flow field with a Mach number larger than 5 is named hypersonic flow. In this paper, we explore the existence of smooth flow field after shock for hypersonic potential flow past a curved smooth wedge with neither smallness assumption on the height of the wedge nor that it is a BV perturbation of a line. The asymptotic behaviour of the shock is also analysed. We prove that for given Bernoulli constant of the incoming flow, there exists a sufficient large constant such that if the Mach number of the incoming flow is larger than it, then there exists a global shock wave attached to the tip of the wedge together with a smooth flow field between it and the wedge. The state of the flow after shock is in a neighbourhood of a curve that is determined by the wedge and the density of the incoming flow. If the slope of the wedge has a positive limit as $x$ goes to infinity, then the slope of the shock tends to that of the self-similar case that the same incoming flow past a straight wedge with slope of the limit. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the slope of the wedge is parallel to the incoming flow at infinity, the strength of the shock will diminish to zero at infinity. The restrictions on the surface of a wedge have been greatly relaxed compared to the previous works on supersonic flow past wedges. The method employed in this paper is characteristic decomposition, and the existence of the solution is obtained by finding an invariant domain of the solution based on geometry structures of the governing equations. The ideas and methods presented here may be applicable to other problems.</description>

      <title>On a novel UCP result and its application to inverse conductive scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12360v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a novel Unique Continuation Principle (UCP) for a system of second-order elliptic PDEs system and apply it to investigate inverse problems in conductive scattering. The UCP relaxes the typical assumptions imposed on the domain or boundary with certain interior transmission conditions. This is motivated by the study of the associated inverse scattering problem and enables us to establish several novel unique identifiability results for the determination of generalized conductive scatterers using a single far-field pattern, significantly extending the results in [15,23]. A key technical advancement in our work is the combination of Complex Geometric Optics (CGO) techniques from [15,23] with the Fourier expansion method to microlocally analyze corner singularities and their implications for inverse problems. We believe that the methods developed can have broader applications in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Existence of nontrivial solutions to a critical Kirchhoff equation with a logarithmic type perturbation in dimension four</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a critical Kirchhoff equation with a logarithmic type subcritical term is considered in a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^4$. We view this problem as a critical elliptic equation with a nonlocal perturbation, and investigate how the nonlocal term affects the existence of weak solutions to the problem. By means of Ekeland's variational principle, Br\'{e}zis-Lieb's lemma and some convergence tricks for nonlocal problems, we show that this problem admits a local minimum solution and a least energy solution under some appropriate assumptions on the parameters. Moreover, under some further assumptions, the local minimum solution is also a least energy solution. Compared with the ones obtained in [3] and [8], our results show that the introduction of the nonlocal term enlarges the ranges of the parameters such that the problem admits weak solutions, which implies that the nonlocal term has a positive effect on the existence of weak solutions.</description>

      <title>Weak* Solutions III: A Convergent Front Tracking Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a modified Front Tracking (mFT) scheme for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws in one space dimension, in which we allow arbitrarily large nonlinear waves. We build the scheme by introducing and solving a ``generalized Riemann Problem'', which yields exact solutions for finite times. This allows us to treat the states adjacent to all waves exactly, and approximate compressive simple waves in addition to rarefactions, contacts and shocks. In particular, we require exact expression of the various wave curves and avoid the use of Taylor expansions. After construction of the scheme, under reasonable assumptions, we show that the mFT approximations converge to a weak* solution of the system. This essentially reduces existence of solutions with large amplitude data to obtaining uniform bounds on the total variation of the approximations.
  We then apply the scheme to the Euler equations of gas dynamics, for which we exactly solve the generalized Riemann Problem and define the scheme for both 3x3 and 2x2 systems, and prove the equivalence of Eulerian and Lagrangian frames. For the $p$-system, modeling isentropic gas dynamics in a Lagrangian frame, we show that there is no finite accumulation of interaction times. This means that the last remaining obstacle to global existence of large data, large amplitude solutions is the construction of a decreasing Glimm potential.</description>

      <title>Green's functions of the fractional Laplacian on a square -- boundary considerations and applications to the L\'{e}vy flight narrow capture problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the unit square, we introduce a method for accurately computing source-neutral Green's functions of the fractional Laplacian operator with either periodic or homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. This method involves analytically constructing the singular behavior of the Green's function in a neighborhood around the location of the singularity, and then formulating a ``smooth'' problem for the remainder term. This smooth problem can be solved for numerically using a basic finite difference scheme. This approach allows accurate extraction of the regular part of the Green's function (and its gradient, if so desired). This new tool enables quantification of properties and characteristics of the narrow capture problem, where a particle undergoing a L\'{e}vy flight of index $\alpha \in (0,1)$ searches for small target(s) of radius $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ for $0 &lt; \varepsilon \ll 1$ on a bounded two-dimensional domain. In particular, it allows us to show how boundary interactions and configuration of multiple targets impact expected search time. Furthermore, we are able to illustrate how a target can be ``shielded'' by obstacles, and how a L\'{e}vy flight search can be significantly superior in navigating these obstacles versus Brownian motion. All asymptotic predictions are confirmed by full numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>A Nystr\"{o}m Method for Scattering by a Two-layered Medium with a Rough Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02339v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with problems of scattering of time-harmonic acoustic waves by a two-layered medium with a non-locally perturbed boundary (called a rough boundary in this paper) in two dimensions, where a Dirichlet or impedance boundary condition is imposed on the boundary. The two-layered medium is composed of two unbounded media with different physical properties and the interface between the two media is considered to be a planar surface. We formulate the scattering problems considered as boundary value problems and prove the result of the well-posedness of each boundary value problem by utilizing the integral equation method associated with the two-layered Green function. Moreover, we develop a Nystr\"{o}m method for numerically solving the boundary value problems considered, based on the proposed integral equation formulations. We establish the convergence results of the Nystr\"{o}m method with the convergence rates depending on the smoothness of the rough boundary. It is worth noting that in establishing the well-posedness of the boundary value problems as well as the convergence results of the Nystr\"{o}m method, an essential role is played by the investigation of the asymptotic properties of the two-layered Green function for small and large arguments. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to show the effectiveness of the Nystr\"{o}m method.</description>

We obtain the monotonicity of parabolic frequency for the solution of two nonlinear parabolic equations with bounded Ricci curvature, then we apply the parabolic frequency monotonicity to get some integral type Harnack inequalities and we use -K1 instead of the lower bound 0 of Ricci curvature from Theorem 4.3 in 16, where K1 is any positive constant.</description>

      <title>Evolution of weights on a connected finite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a connected finite graph, we propose an evolution of weights including Ollivier's Ricci flow as a special case. During the evolution process, on each edge, the speed of change of weight is exactly the difference between the Wasserstein distance related to two probability measures and certain graph distance. Here the probability measure may be chosen as an $\alpha$-lazy one-step random walk, an $\alpha$-lazy two-step random walk, or a general probability measure. Based on the ODE theory, we show that the initial value problem has a unique global solution.
  A discrete version of the above evolution is applied to the problem of community detection. Our algorithm is based on such a discrete evolution, where probability measures are chosen as $\alpha$-lazy one-step random walk and $\alpha$-lazy two-step random walk respectively. Note that the later measure has not been used in previous works [2, 16, 21, 24]. Here, as in [21], only one surgery needs to be performed after the last iteration. Moreover, our algorithm is much easier than those of [2, 16, 21], which were all based on Lin-Lu-Yau's Ricci curvature. The code is available at https://github.com/mjc191812/Evolution-of-weights-on-a-connected-finite-graph.</description>

      <title>Relativistic dissipative fluids in the trace-fixed particle frame: Strongly hyperbolic quasi-linear first-order evolution equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a new first-order theory of relativistic dissipative fluids by adopting the trace-fixed particle frame. Whereas in a companion letter we show that this theory is hyperbolic, causal and stable at global equilibrium states, here we prove that the full nonlinear system of equations can be cast into a first-order quasilinear system which is strongly hyperbolic. By rewriting the system in first-order form, auxiliary constraints are introduced. However, we show that these constraints propagate, and thus our theory leads to a well-posed Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>\$PINN -- a Domain Decomposition Method for Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a novel computational approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with noisy and sparse initial and boundary data. Although, efficient quantification of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in big multi-scale problems remains challenging. We propose \$PINN a novel method of computing global uncertainty in PDEs using a Bayesian framework, by combining local Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks (BPINN) with domain decomposition. The solution continuity across subdomains is obtained by imposing the flux continuity across the interface of neighboring subdomains. To demonstrate the effectiveness of \$PINN, we conduct a series of computational experiments on PDEs in 1D and 2D spatial domains. Although we have adopted conservative PINNs (cPINNs), the method can be seamlessly extended to other domain decomposition techniques. The results infer that the proposed method recovers the global uncertainty by computing the local uncertainty exactly more efficiently as the uncertainty in each subdomain can be computed concurrently. The robustness of \$PINN is verified by adding uncorrelated random noise to the training data up to 15% and testing for different domain sizes.</description>

      <title>Strong Uniqueness by Kraichnan Transport Noise for the 2D Boussinesq Equations with Zero Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inviscid 2D Boussinesq equations driven by rough transport noise of Kraichnan type with regularity index $\alpha\in (0,1/2)$. For all $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, we establish the existence and uniqueness of probabilistic strong solutions for all $L^p$ initial vorticity and $L^2$ initial temperature, under the parameter constraint $0&lt;\alpha&lt; 1-1/(p\wedge 2)$. The key ingredient is the anomalous regularity due to the noise proven by Coghi and Maurelli \cite{CogMau} who dealt with stochastic 2D Euler equations. Combining techniques from analysis and probability, we demonstrate how the additional regularity from noise compensates the singularity due to the nonlinear parts and coupled terms.</description>
