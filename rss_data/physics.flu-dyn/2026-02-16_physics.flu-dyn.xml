      <title>The Asymptotic State of Decaying Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-time evolution of decaying homogeneous turbulence is a fundamental building block of the subject. We investigate the problem by using a comprehensive suite of Direct Numerical Simulations. The simulations cover initial Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers $Re_\lambda$ from $30 \text{ to } 145$, with multiple independent realizations obtained at each $Re_{\lambda}$ to ensure statistical robustness. The energy spectrum is initialized with the Birkhoff-Saffman (BS) form (with $E(k)\sim k^2$ for small $k$) in one case, and the Loitsianskii-Kolmogorov-Batchelor (LKB) form (with $E(k)\sim k^4$ for small $k$), in another. Simulations are performed for unprecedented durations, of the order of 200,000 initial eddy-turnover times in some instances. For both BS and LKB, the turbulent kinetic energy $En$ shows, after an initial transient, unambiguous power-law decay, $En\sim t^{-n}$, with nearly constant decay exponents $n$, whose values are consistent with past theoretical results (and thus not universal). We compute various length scales, second-order structure functions, and the spectral form at large wavenumbers; {we note that an initially set $-5/3$ slope disappears quickly, while a perceptible $-1$ power region appears.} In particular, we compare the present findings with predictions from the recent theory for decaying turbulence developed by Migdal \cite{migdal_this_issue}. The agreement for the BS case is excellent except for the large-wavenumber spectrum. A general discussion and assessment of results is provided in terms of the putative universality of energy decay. {A main conclusion is that the energy decay is significantly influenced by ``boundary effects", and that universality likely manifests only when those effects are removed. Alternatively, it may be more useful to discuss the universality of enstrophy decay.}</description>

      <title>Stokes flows in a sessile hemispherical drop due to evaporation and surface tension gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscous hydrodynamic flow in a small, slowly evaporating, sessile hemispherical droplet with a pinned contact line is considered. Analytical solutions are obtained for the Deegan outward flow, which is responsible for the coffee ring effect, as well as the Marangoni flow excited by a surface tension gradient. It is assumed that the surface tension gradient may be caused by anisotropic cooling of droplet surface or other factors, such as nonuniform illumination of an optically active surfactant. Two main types of boundary conditions, no-slip and full-slip, are considered in describing the flow-substrate interaction. It is shown that under the no-slip condition, there is a rigid relationship between the evaporation rate and the surface tension gradient, which imposes strict requirements on the temperature regime inside the droplet. This result offers a new vision of the critical Marangoni number, which describes the threshold for the transition of an evaporating droplet from capillary flow to developed Marangoni convection. The results of this work may attract the attention of experimenters to the study of the sensitivity of viscous flow in an evaporating droplet to the liquid-substrate boundary conditions, especially if the system under consideration passes into the Marangoni regime, when the no-slip condition changes to a partial or full slip condition due to the increase in viscous shear stress near the substrate.</description>

      <title>On the rheoscopic measurement of turbulent decay in wall-bounded flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quench experiments where the flow passes from a fully turbulent state to a laminar state by an abrupt decrease in the flow Reynolds number ($Re$) have been extensively studied in the literature to quantify the turbulent-laminar transition process in wall-bounded flows. Measurements have been classically made using rheoscopic fluid visualisations, which make turbulent coherent structures easily identifiable, allowing for quantification of the evolution of a turbulent fraction -- the percentage of a given observation window where turbulence is deemed active by the presence of coherent structures, such as streamwise vortices called rolls, and modulations of the streamwise velocity fluctuations called streaks. Decay characteristic times of these structures have therefore been extensively measured. However, owing to the nature of visualization based techniques, only a single decay time is typically extracted, whereas measurements of the velocity field can reveal distinct decay times associated with different velocity or kinetic energy components. As a result, the physical meaning of the decay time inferred from visualization alone is not straightforward. The goal of the present paper is to perform such a comparison quantitatively, using particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements and rheoscopic fluid visualisations in the same setup: a Couette-Poiseuille experiment. We observe via PIV different characteristic times of decay for streamwise (streaks) and spanwise (rolls) velocity fluctuations. We show that the characteristic time of decay of the turbulent fraction observed by visualisation is close to the decay of the streaks.</description>

      <title>On multiple stable states in Taylor-Couette flow with realistic end-wall boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Taylor-Couette flow with realistic no-slip boundary conditions at all surfaces through direct numerical simulations (DNS) and theoretical analysis. Imposing physically consistent end-wall conditions at the top and bottom lids significantly alters the flow dynamics compared to that for periodic boundary conditions. We extend the classical angular-momentum-flux framework to account for axial transport, which leads to a significantly improved agreement with the Eckhardt-Grossmann-Lohse model (Eckhardt et al. 2007). A systematic exploration of the parameter space $(Re, n) $ uncovers multiple long-lived states with different roll number $n$ configurations at identical Reynolds numbers $Re$, giving rise to pronounced hysteresis loops occurring under realistic boundary conditions. Our DNS for no-slip axial end caps reveal a sequence of structural transitions: as the inner-cylinder Reynolds number increases, the flow evolves from Taylor vortex flow through chaotic wavy vortex flow and turbulent wavy vortex flow to an axisymmetric turbulent Taylor vortex flow. Using modal energy budgets we identify transition mechanisms and quantify how the accessible phase-space volume and associated roll-specific angular momentum flux depend on control parameters and the specific flow state. Our findings demonstrate the impact of realistic boundary conditions on the dynamics in Taylor-Couette flow, and how they change the stability landscape of multiple states. The coexistence of distinct flow patterns and their stability analysis offers promising insights into transition dynamics between laminar and turbulent regimes in closed sheared flows.</description>

      <title>Enhanced numerical approaches for modeling insoluble surfactants in two-phase flows with the diffuse-interface method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surfactants reside at the interface of two-phase flows and significantly influence the flow dynamics. Numerical simulations are essential for a comprehensive understanding of such surfactant-laden flows and require a method that can accurately simulate surfactant transport along the interface. In this study, we focus on interfacial transport models for insoluble surfactants based on the diffuse-interface method and propose two approaches to improve their accuracy: (a) adopting a formulation that avoids the spatial derivatives of variables with sharp gradients and (b) allowing the width of the delta function to be specified independently of the interface width. These approaches are simple and practical in that they do not lead to significant increases in computational cost, implementation complexity, or degradation of interface-capturing accuracy. We conduct a series of numerical tests to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Finally, we present a challenging test case that is difficult to solve accurately and has not been previously discussed. We expect this case to serve as a valuable benchmark for evaluating and comparing the performances of various methods proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>A new model for two-layer liquid-gas stratified flows in pipes with general cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a new model for immiscible two-layer gas-liquid stratified flows in pipes with general cross sections. The bottom layer is occupied by an incompressible fluid in liquid phase with hydrodynamics based on a hydrostatic pressure, following a shallow water approximation. The top layer is occupied by a compressible gas, following an ideal gas law leading to conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The two subsystems are linked through non-conservative products, representing momentum and energy exchanges between layers. The hyperbolic properties of the resulting model are analyzed, including the derivation of entropy inequalities, and the approximations of eigenvalues of the corresponding coefficient matrix. Numerical tests are included to demonstrate the merits of the model and the numerical approximations, including well-balancedness, Riemann problems, and perturbations and convergence toward steady states at rest. Besides simulations of water and air where the density difference between layers is significant, a case where such difference is not so pronounced (like gas and liquid hydrogen) is also shown.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Electroviscous Lift Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: About forty years ago, it has been predicted that a charged particle, moving parallel to a charged wall in an electrolyte, should experience a lift force that, contrarily to electrostatic forces, is not screened at large distances. Up to now, such electroviscous lift force has not been directly measured. Here, we use Atomic Force Microscopy to directly measure the electroviscous lift force and quantify its dependency with the distance to the wall, the translation velocity or the particle's size. Observing that existing theories exhibit large discrepancies with our experimental observations, we develop an analytical approach combining lubrication theory to a previously introduced formalism for small screening length. The experimentally observed lift forces are in good agreement with our theoretical predictions and reveal, for the first time, a saturation of the lift force for increasing velocities. Altogether, our results characterize, through direct measurements and analytical approach, the properties of electroviscous forces between charged particles in viscous electrolytes in non-equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>A Corrected Open Boundary Framework for Lattice Boltzmann Immiscible Pseudopotential Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a prominent approach for simulating multiphase flows, valued for its physical intuitiveness and computational tractability. However, existing immiscible pseudopotential methods for modeling dynamic multi-component immiscible fluid systems involving open boundaries face persistent challenges, notably the influence of spurious currents on interface formation and breakup, as well as the effects of inlet and outlet boundary configurations on simulation stability. Therefore, this paper proposes a corrected open boundary framework based on Multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) for the immiscible pseudopotential model. Our method includes three key improvements: firstly, introducing correction coefficients to reconstruct the distribution function, in order to accurately recover the macroscopic quantities at the inlet boundary. Secondly, based on real-time mass flow rates at the inlet and outlet, the outlet boundary velocity is adjusted to ensure global mass conservation in the computational domain. Finally, the relaxation coefficient related to numerical stability is adjusted based on the viscosity of two-phase fluids to reduce spurious currents. To validate the reliability of the proposed corrected method, four benchmark cases were simulated: Laplace tests and Taylor deformation, two-phase Poiseuille flow, migration of droplets in microchannels, as well as droplet generation in T-shaped and co-flow devices. The results demonstrate that the corrected approach accurately captures various dynamic complex immiscible multiphase flows.</description>

      <title>Latent-space variational data assimilation in two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from limited measurements of a turbulent flow, data assimilation (DA) attempts to estimate all the spatio-temporal scales of motion. Success is dependent on whether the system is observable from the measurements, or how much of the initial turbulent field is encoded in the available measurements. Adjoint-variational DA minimises the discrepancy between the true and estimated measurements by optimising the initial velocity or vorticity field (the `state space'). Here we propose to instead optimise in a lower-dimensional latent space which is learned by implicit rank minimising autoencoders. Assimilating in latent space, rather than state space, redefines the observability of the measurements and identifies the physically meaningful perturbation directions which matter most for accurate prediction of the flow evolution. When observing coarse-grained measurements of two-dimensional Kolmogorov flow at moderate Reynolds numbers, the proposed latent-space DA approach estimates the full turbulent state with a relative error improvement of two orders of magnitude over the standard state-space DA approach. The small scales of the estimated turbulent field are predicted more faithfully with latent-space DA, greatly reducing erroneous small-scale velocities typically introduced by state-space DA. Furthermore, latent-space DA is demonstrated to be robust to noisy measurements at the range of Reynolds numbers considered. These findings demonstrate that the observability of the system from available data can be greatly improved when turbulent measurements are assimilated in the right space, or coordinates.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Transformer operator for the prediction of three-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19351v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven turbulence prediction methods often face challenges related to data dependency and lack of physical interpretability. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed Transformer operator (PITO) and its implicit variant (PIITO) for predicting three-dimensional (3D) turbulence, which are developed based on the vision Transformer (ViT) architecture with an appropriate patch size. Given the current flow field, the Transformer operator computes its prediction for the next time step. By embedding the large-eddy simulation (LES) equations into the loss function, PITO and PIITO can learn solution operators without using labeled data. Furthermore, PITO can automatically learn the subgrid scale (SGS) coefficient using a single set of flow data during training. Both PITO and PIITO exhibit excellent stability and accuracy on the predictions of various statistical properties and flow structures for the situation of long-term extrapolation exceeding 25 times the training horizon in decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT), and outperform the physics-informed Fourier neural operator (PIFNO). Furthermore, PITO exhibits a remarkable accuracy on the predictions of forced HIT where PIFNO fails. Notably, PITO and PIITO reduce GPU memory consumption by 79.5\% and 91.3\% while requiring only 31.5\% and 3.1\% of the parameters, respectively, compared to PIFNO. Moreover, both PITO and PIITO models are much faster compared to traditional LES method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Second-order structure functions and power spectral densities are popular tools in the study of statistical properties across scales, particularly for the analysis of turbulent flows. Although intimately related, analyses primarily use one or the other. We introduce a framework for estimating the power spectrum using the second-order structure function without applying Fourier transforms -- enabling one to take advantage of the real-space structure function calculations. We validate and showcase this method, comparing it to classical Fourier power spectrum estimates determined from analytical calculations, fractional Brownian motion, turbulence simulations, and space-physics and astrophysical observations of turbulence. We show that this method is able to robustly obtain the expected power law behaviour where we use turbulence ranges as test-cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study phase separation between coexisting active and passive fluids in three-dimensions, using numerical simulation and experiments. Chaotic flows of the active phase drive giant interfacial deformations, causing the co-existing phases to interpenetrate and generate a continuously reconfiguring bicontinuous morphology which persists over the lifetime of the active fluid. Active bicontinuous structures are dominated by sheet-like interfaces, in marked difference from passive liquid-liquid phase separation which is controlled by saddle-like surfaces. Activity and surface tension control the length scale of the bicontinuous structure. These results demonstrate how active stresses suppress the coarsening of conventional phase separation, generating steady-state reconfigurable morphologies not accessible with conventional surface-modifying agents or through quenching of transient phase separated structures.</description>

      <title>An Oscillation-Free Real Fluid Quasi-Conservative Finite Volume Method for Transcritical and Phase-Change Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new Real Fluid Quasi-Conservative (RFQC) finite volume method is developed to address the numerical simulation of real fluids involving shock waves in transcritical and phase-change flows. To eliminate the spurious pressure oscillations inherent in fully conservative schemes, we extend the classic quasi-conservative method, originally designed for two-phase flows, to real fluids governed by arbitrary equations of state (EoS). The RFQC method locally linearizes the real fluid EoS at each grid point and time step, constructing and evolving the frozen Gr\"uneisen coefficient $\Gamma$ and the linearization remainder $E_0$ via two advection equations. At the end of each time step, the evolved $\Gamma$ and $E_0$ are utilized to reconstruct the oscillation-free pressure field, followed by a thermodynamic re-projection applied to the conserved variables. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that, in smooth regions, the energy conservation error introduced by the RFQC method is a second-order small term dominated by the time-step. In discontinuous regions, this error is determined by the entropy increase rate, thereby maintaining consistency with the inherent truncation error of shock-capturing methods. A series of numerical tests verifies that the method can robustly simulate complex flow processes with only minor energy conservation errors, including transcritical flows, phase transitions, and shock-interface interactions. The RFQC method is proven to be both accurate and robust in capturing shock waves and phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The K-condition introduced by Shizuta and Kawashima provides a sufficient criterion for the global existence of smooth solutions to dissipative hyperbolic systems. For genuinely nonlinear characteristic fields, a weaker K-condition becomes necessary, although not sufficient. In this paper, we analyze this weaker K-condition through the study of acceleration waves propagating in an equilibrium state. We investigate two classes of hyperbolic models: one describing viscoelasticity with linear dissipation, and the other non-Newtonian fluids asymptotically converging to a power-law behavior. For viscoelastic models, the weaker K-condition is always satisfied and acceleration waves remain bounded. For non-Newtonian fluids, the validity of the condition depends on the power-law index $m$: it holds for Newtonian fluids ($m=1$), is violated for shear-thinning fluids ($m&lt;1$), and leads to an instantaneous regularization of acceleration waves for shear-thickening fluids ($m&gt;1$).</description>
