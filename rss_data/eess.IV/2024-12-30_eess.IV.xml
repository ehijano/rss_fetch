      <title>Pruning Unrolled Networks (PUN) at Initialization for MRI Reconstruction Improves Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning methods are highly effective for many image reconstruction tasks. However, the performance of supervised learned models can degrade when applied to distinct experimental settings at test time or in the presence of distribution shifts. In this study, we demonstrate that pruning deep image reconstruction networks at training time can improve their robustness to distribution shifts. In particular, we consider unrolled reconstruction architectures for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging and introduce a method for pruning unrolled networks (PUN) at initialization. Our experiments demonstrate that when compared to traditional dense networks, PUN offers improved generalization across a variety of experimental settings and even slight performance gains on in-distribution data.</description>

      <title>MRI Reconstruction with Regularized 3D Diffusion Model (R3DM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a powerful imaging technique widely used for visualizing structures within the human body and in other fields such as plant sciences. However, there is a demand to develop fast 3D-MRI reconstruction algorithms to show the fine structure of objects from under-sampled acquisition data, i.e., k-space data. This emphasizes the need for efficient solutions that can handle limited input while maintaining high-quality imaging. In contrast to previous methods only using 2D, we propose a 3D MRI reconstruction method that leverages a regularized 3D diffusion model combined with optimization method. By incorporating diffusion based priors, our method improves image quality, reduces noise, and enhances the overall fidelity of 3D MRI reconstructions. We conduct comprehensive experiments analysis on clinical and plant science MRI datasets. To evaluate the algorithm effectiveness for under-sampled k-space data, we also demonstrate its reconstruction performance with several undersampling patterns, as well as with in- and out-of-distribution pre-trained data. In experiments, we show that our method improves upon tested competitors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lumbar disk segmentation is essential for diagnosing and curing spinal disorders by enabling precise detection of disk boundaries in medical imaging. The advent of deep learning has resulted in the development of many segmentation methods, offering differing levels of accuracy and effectiveness. This study assesses the effectiveness of several sophisticated deep learning architectures, including ResUnext, Ef3 Net, UNet, and TransUNet, for lumbar disk segmentation, highlighting key metrics like as Pixel Accuracy, Mean Intersection over Union (Mean IoU), and Dice Coefficient. The findings indicate that ResUnext achieved the highest segmentation accuracy, with a Pixel Accuracy of 0.9492 and a Dice Coefficient of 0.8425, with TransUNet following closely after. Filtering techniques somewhat enhanced the performance of most models, particularly Dense UNet, improving stability and segmentation quality. The findings underscore the efficacy of these models in lumbar disk segmentation and highlight potential areas for improvement.</description>

      <title>WaveDiffUR: A diffusion SDE-based solver for ultra magnification super-resolution in remote sensing images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have recently achieved significant advancements in remote sensing superresolu-tion (SR). However, most existing methods are limited to low magnification rates (e.g., 2 or 4) due to the escalating ill-posedness at higher magnification scales. To tackle this challenge, we redefine high-magnification SR as the ultra-resolution (UR) problem, reframing it as solving a conditional diffusion stochastic differential equation (SDE). In this context, we propose WaveDiffUR, a novel wavelet-domain diffusion UR solver that decomposes the UR process into sequential sub-processes addressing conditional wavelet components. WaveDiffUR iteratively reconstructs low-frequency wavelet details (ensuring global consistency) and high-frequency components (enhancing local fidelity) by incorporating pre-trained SR models as plug-and-play modules. This modularity mitigates the ill-posedness of the SDE and ensures scalability across diverse applications. To address limitations in fixed boundary conditions at extreme magnifications, we introduce the cross-scale pyramid (CSP) constraint, a dynamic and adaptive framework that guides WaveDiffUR in generating fine-grained wavelet details, ensuring consistent and high-fidelity outputs even at extreme magnification rates.</description>

      <title>Brain Ageing Prediction using Isolation Forest Technique and Residual Neural Network (ResNet)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain aging is a complex and dynamic process, leading to functional and structural changes in the brain. These changes could lead to the increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. Accurate brain-age estimation utilizing neuroimaging data has become necessary for detecting initial signs of neurodegeneration. Here, we propose a novel deep learning approach using the Residual Neural Network 101 Version 2 (ResNet101V2) model to predict brain age from MRI scans. To train, validate and test our proposed model, we used a large dataset of 2102 images which were selected randomly from the International Consortium for Brain Mapping (ICBM). Next, we applied data preprocessing techniques, including normalizing the images and using outlier detection via Isolation Forest method. Then, we evaluated various pre-trained approaches (namely: MobileNetV2, ResNet50V2, ResNet101V2, Xception). The results demonstrated that the ResNet101V2 model has higher performance compared with the other models, attaining MAEs of 0.9136 and 0.8242 years for before and after using Isolation Forest process. Our method achieved a high accuracy in brain age estimation in ICBM dataset and it provides a reliable brain age prediction.</description>

      <title>Modality-Projection Universal Model for Comprehensive Full-Body Medical Imaging Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of deep learning in medical imaging has shown great promise for enhancing diagnostic, therapeutic, and research outcomes. However, applying universal models across multiple modalities remains challenging due to the inherent variability in data characteristics. This study aims to introduce and evaluate a Modality Projection Universal Model (MPUM). MPUM employs a novel modality-projection strategy, which allows the model to dynamically adjust its parameters to optimize performance across different imaging modalities. The MPUM demonstrated superior accuracy in identifying anatomical structures, enabling precise quantification for improved clinical decision-making. It also identifies metabolic associations within the brain-body axis, advancing research on brain-body physiological correlations. Furthermore, MPUM's unique controller-based convolution layer enables visualization of saliency maps across all network layers, significantly enhancing the model's interpretability.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Convolutional Neural Networks for COVID-19 classification in chest X-ray images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rapidly spread globally, impacting the lives of billions of people. The effective screening of infected patients is a critical step to struggle with COVID-19, and treating the patients avoiding this quickly disease spread. The need for automated and scalable methods has increased due to the unavailability of accurate automated toolkits. Recent researches using chest X-ray images suggest they include relevant information about the COVID-19 virus. Hence, applying machine learning techniques combined with radiological imaging promises to identify this disease accurately. It is straightforward to collect these images once it is spreadly shared and analyzed in the world. This paper presents a method for automatic COVID-19 detection using chest Xray images through four convolutional neural networks, namely: AlexNet, VGG-11, SqueezeNet, and DenseNet-121. This method had been providing accurate diagnostics for positive or negative COVID-19 classification. We validate our experiments using a ten-fold cross-validation procedure over the training and test sets. Our findings include the shallow fine-tuning and data augmentation strategies that can assist in dealing with the low number of positive COVID-19 images publicly available. The accuracy for all CNNs is higher than 97.00%, and the SqueezeNet model achieved the best result with 99.20%.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Dual-channel Encoding of Luminance and Contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is perceptual and physiological evidence that the retina registers and signals luminance and luminance contrast using dual-channel mechanisms. This process begins in the retina, wherein the luminance of a uniform zone and differentials of luminance in neighboring zones determine the degree of brightness or darkness of the zones. The neurons that process the information can be classified as "bright" or "dark" channels. The present paper provides an overview of these retinal mechanisms along with evidence that they provide brightness judgments that are log-linear across roughly seven orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>A Review on the Integration of Artificial Intelligence and Medical Imaging in IVF Ovarian Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool to enhance decision-making and optimize treatment protocols in in vitro fertilization (IVF). In particular, AI shows significant promise in supporting decision-making during the ovarian stimulation phase of the IVF process. This review evaluates studies focused on the applications of AI combined with medical imaging in ovarian stimulation, examining methodologies, outcomes, and current limitations. Our analysis of 13 studies on this topic reveals that, reveal that while AI algorithms demonstrated notable potential in predicting optimal hormonal dosages, trigger timing, and oocyte retrieval outcomes, the medical imaging data utilized predominantly came from two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound which mainly involved basic quantifications, such as follicle size and number, with limited use of direct feature extraction or advanced image analysis techniques. This points to an underexplored opportunity where advanced image analysis approaches, such as deep learning, and more diverse imaging modalities, like three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound, could unlock deeper insights. Additionally, the lack of explainable AI (XAI) in most studies raises concerns about the transparency and traceability of AI-driven decisions - key factors for clinical adoption and trust. Furthermore, many studies relied on single-center designs and small datasets, which limit the generalizability of their findings. This review highlights the need for integrating advanced imaging analysis techniques with explainable AI methodologies, as well as the importance of leveraging multicenter collaborations and larger datasets. Addressing these gaps has the potential to enhance ovarian stimulation management, paving the way for efficient, personalized, and data-driven treatment pathways that improve IVF outcomes.</description>

      <title>ProKAN: Progressive Stacking of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Efficient Liver Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing need for accurate and efficient 3D identification of tumors, particularly in liver segmentation, has spurred considerable research into deep learning models. While many existing architectures offer strong performance, they often face challenges such as overfitting and excessive computational costs. An adjustable and flexible architecture that strikes a balance between time efficiency and model complexity remains an unmet requirement. In this paper, we introduce proKAN, a progressive stacking methodology for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) designed to address these challenges. Unlike traditional architectures, proKAN dynamically adjusts its complexity by progressively adding KAN blocks during training, based on overfitting behavior. This approach allows the network to stop growing when overfitting is detected, preventing unnecessary computational overhead while maintaining high accuracy. Additionally, proKAN utilizes KAN's learnable activation functions modeled through B-splines, which provide enhanced flexibility in learning complex relationships in 3D medical data. Our proposed architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance in liver segmentation tasks, outperforming standard Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and fixed KAN architectures. The dynamic nature of proKAN ensures efficient training times and high accuracy without the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, proKAN provides better interpretability by allowing insight into the decision-making process through its learnable coefficients. The experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy, Dice score, and time efficiency, making proKAN a compelling solution for 3D medical image segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>MotionMap: Representing Multimodality in Human Pose Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human pose forecasting is inherently multimodal since multiple futures exist for an observed pose sequence. However, evaluating multimodality is challenging since the task is ill-posed. Therefore, we first propose an alternative paradigm to make the task well-posed. Next, while state-of-the-art methods predict multimodality, this requires oversampling a large volume of predictions. This raises key questions: (1) Can we capture multimodality by efficiently sampling a smaller number of predictions? (2) Subsequently, which of the predicted futures is more likely for an observed pose sequence? We address these questions with MotionMap, a simple yet effective heatmap based representation for multimodality. We extend heatmaps to represent a spatial distribution over the space of all possible motions, where different local maxima correspond to different forecasts for a given observation. MotionMap can capture a variable number of modes per observation and provide confidence measures for different modes. Further, MotionMap allows us to introduce the notion of uncertainty and controllability over the forecasted pose sequence. Finally, MotionMap captures rare modes that are non-trivial to evaluate yet critical for safety. We support our claims through multiple qualitative and quantitative experiments using popular 3D human pose datasets: Human3.6M and AMASS, highlighting the strengths and limitations of our proposed method.

      <title>TINQ: Temporal Inconsistency Guided Blind Video Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) has been actively researched for user-generated content (UGC) videos. Recently, super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely applied in UGC. Therefore, an effective BVQA method for both UGC and SR scenarios is essential. Temporal inconsistency, referring to irregularities between consecutive frames, is relevant to video quality. Current BVQA approaches typically model temporal relationships in UGC videos using statistics of motion information, but inconsistencies remain unexplored. Additionally, different from temporal inconsistency in UGC videos, such inconsistency in SR videos is amplified due to upscaling algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Inconsistency Guided Blind Video Quality Assessment (TINQ) metric, demonstrating that exploring temporal inconsistency is crucial for effective BVQA. Since temporal inconsistencies vary between UGC and SR videos, they are calculated in different ways. Based on this, a spatial module highlights inconsistent areas across consecutive frames at coarse and fine granularities. In addition, a temporal module aggregates features over time in two stages. The first stage employs a visual memory capacity block to adaptively segment the time dimension based on estimated complexity, while the second stage focuses on selecting key features. The stages work together through Consistency-aware Fusion Units to regress cross-time-scale video quality. Extensive experiments on UGC and SR video quality datasets show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art BVQA methods.

      <title>Geospatial Data Fusion: Combining Lidar, SAR, and Optical Imagery with AI for Enhanced Urban Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the integration of Lidar, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and optical imagery through advanced artificial intelligence techniques for enhanced urban mapping. By fusing these diverse geospatial datasets, we aim to overcome the limitations associated with single-sensor data, achieving a more comprehensive representation of urban environments. The research employs Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) as the primary deep learning model for urban feature extraction, enabling precise pixel-wise classification of essential urban elements, including buildings, roads, and vegetation. To optimize the performance of the FCN model, we utilize Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for hyperparameter tuning, significantly enhancing model accuracy. Key findings indicate that the FCN-PSO model achieved a pixel accuracy of 92.3% and a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 87.6%, surpassing traditional single-sensor approaches. These results underscore the potential of fused geospatial data and AI-driven methodologies in urban mapping, providing valuable insights for urban planning and management. The implications of this research pave the way for future developments in real-time mapping and adaptive urban infrastructure planning.</description>

      <title>MGAN-CRCM: A Novel Multiple Generative Adversarial Network and Coarse-Refinement Based Cognizant Method for Image Inpainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image inpainting is a widely used technique in computer vision for reconstructing missing or damaged pixels in images. Recent advancements with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated superior performance over traditional methods due to their deep learning capabilities and adaptability across diverse image domains. Residual Networks (ResNet) have also gained prominence for their ability to enhance feature representation and compatibility with other architectures. This paper introduces a novel architecture combining GAN and ResNet models to improve image inpainting outcomes. Our framework integrates three components: Transpose Convolution-based GAN for guided and blind inpainting, Fast ResNet-Convolutional Neural Network (FR-CNN) for object removal, and Co-Modulation GAN (Co-Mod GAN) for refinement. The model's performance was evaluated on benchmark datasets, achieving accuracies of 96.59% on Image-Net, 96.70% on Places2, and 96.16% on CelebA. Comparative analyses demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms existing methods, highlighting its effectiveness in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Self: Brainwave-Based Human Trait Identification</title>

Abstract: People exhibit unique emotional responses. In the same scenario, the emotional reactions of two individuals can be either similar or vastly different. For instance, consider one person's reaction to an invitation to smoke versus another person's response to a query about their sleep quality. The identification of these individual traits through the observation of common physical parameters opens the door to a wide range of applications, including psychological analysis, criminology, disease prediction, addiction control, and more. While there has been previous research in the fields of psychometrics, inertial sensors, computer vision, and audio analysis, this paper introduces a novel technique for identifying human traits in real time using brainwave data. To achieve this, we begin with an extensive study of brainwave data collected from 80 participants using a portable EEG headset. We also conduct a statistical analysis of the collected data utilizing box plots. Our analysis uncovers several new insights, leading us to a groundbreaking unified approach for identifying diverse human traits by leveraging machine learning techniques on EEG data. Our analysis demonstrates that this proposed solution achieves high accuracy. Moreover, we explore two deep-learning models to compare the performance of our solution. Consequently, we have developed an integrated, real-time trait identification solution using EEG data, based on the insights from our analysis. To validate our approach, we conducted a rigorous user evaluation with an additional 20 participants. The outcomes of this evaluation illustrate both high accuracy and favorable user ratings, emphasizing the robust potential of our proposed method to serve as a versatile solution for human trait identification.</description>

      <title>Spectral Enhancement and Pseudo-Anchor Guidance for Infrared-Visible Person Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of deep learning has facilitated the application of person re-identification (ReID) technology in intelligent security. Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match pedestrians across infrared and visible modality images enabling 24-hour surveillance. Current studies relying on unsupervised modality transformations as well as inefficient embedding constraints to bridge the spectral differences between infrared and visible images, however, limit their potential performance. To tackle the limitations of the above approaches, this paper introduces a simple yet effective Spectral Enhancement and Pseudo-anchor Guidance Network, named SEPG-Net. Specifically, we propose a more homogeneous spectral enhancement scheme based on frequency domain information and greyscale space, which avoids the information loss typically caused by inefficient modality transformations. Further, a Pseudo Anchor-guided Bidirectional Aggregation (PABA) loss is introduced to bridge local modality discrepancies while better preserving discriminative identity embeddings. Experimental results on two public benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SEPG-Net against other state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/1024AILab/ReID-SEPG.</description>

      <title>Extended Cross-Modality United Learning for Unsupervised Visible-Infrared Person Re-identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning visible-infrared person re-identification (USL-VI-ReID) aims to learn modality-invariant features from unlabeled cross-modality datasets and reduce the inter-modality gap. However, the existing methods lack cross-modality clustering or excessively pursue cluster-level association, which makes it difficult to perform reliable modality-invariant features learning. To deal with this issue, we propose a Extended Cross-Modality United Learning (ECUL) framework, incorporating Extended Modality-Camera Clustering (EMCC) and Two-Step Memory Updating Strategy (TSMem) modules. Specifically, we design ECUL to naturally integrates intra-modality clustering, inter-modality clustering and inter-modality instance selection, establishing compact and accurate cross-modality associations while reducing the introduction of noisy labels. Moreover, EMCC captures and filters the neighborhood relationships by extending the encoding vector, which further promotes the learning of modality-invariant and camera-invariant knowledge in terms of clustering algorithm. Finally, TSMem provides accurate and generalized proxy points for contrastive learning by updating the memory in stages. Extensive experiments results on SYSU-MM01 and RegDB datasets demonstrate that the proposed ECUL shows promising performance and even outperforms certain supervised methods.</description>

      <title>Completion as Enhancement: A Degradation-Aware Selective Image Guided Network for Depth Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Selective Image Guided Network (SigNet), a novel degradation-aware framework that transforms depth completion into depth enhancement for the first time. Moving beyond direct completion using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), SigNet initially densifies sparse depth data through non-CNN densification tools to obtain coarse yet dense depth. This approach eliminates the mismatch and ambiguity caused by direct convolution over irregularly sampled sparse data. Subsequently, SigNet redefines completion as enhancement, establishing a self-supervised degradation bridge between the coarse depth and the targeted dense depth for effective RGB-D fusion. To achieve this, SigNet leverages the implicit degradation to adaptively select high-frequency components (e.g., edges) of RGB data to compensate for the coarse depth. This degradation is further integrated into a multi-modal conditional Mamba, dynamically generating the state parameters to enable efficient global high-frequency information interaction. We conduct extensive experiments on the NYUv2, DIML, SUN RGBD, and TOFDC datasets, demonstrating the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of SigNet.</description>

      <title>FineVQ: Fine-Grained User Generated Content Video Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated content (UGC) videos has produced an urgent need for effective video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms to monitor video quality and guide optimization and recommendation procedures. However, current VQA models generally only give an overall rating for a UGC video, which lacks fine-grained labels for serving video processing and recommendation applications. To address the challenges and promote the development of UGC videos, we establish the first large-scale Fine-grained Video quality assessment Database, termed FineVD, which comprises 6104 UGC videos with fine-grained quality scores and descriptions across multiple dimensions. Based on this database, we propose a Fine-grained Video Quality assessment (FineVQ) model to learn the fine-grained quality of UGC videos, with the capabilities of quality rating, quality scoring, and quality attribution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FineVQ can produce fine-grained video-quality results and achieve state-of-the-art performance on FineVD and other commonly used UGC-VQA datasets. Both Both FineVD and FineVQ will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>A Prototype Unit for Image De-raining using Time-Lapse Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of single-image de-raining, a task that involves recovering rain-free background information from a single rain image. While recent advancements have utilized real-world time-lapse data for training, enabling the estimation of consistent backgrounds and realistic rain streaks, these methods often suffer from computational and memory consumption, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel solution: the Rain Streak Prototype Unit (RsPU). The RsPU efficiently encodes rain streak-relevant features as real-time prototypes derived from time-lapse data, eliminating the need for excessive memory resources. Our de-raining network combines encoder-decoder networks with the RsPU, allowing us to learn and encapsulate diverse rain streak-relevant features as concise prototypes, employing an attention-based approach. To ensure the effectiveness of our approach, we propose a feature prototype loss encompassing cohesion and divergence components. This loss function captures both the compactness and diversity aspects of the prototypical rain streak features within the RsPU. Our method evaluates various de-raining benchmarks, accompanied by comprehensive ablation studies. We show that it can achieve competitive results in various rain images compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Network on Motion-Blur Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In everyday life, photographs taken with a camera often suffer from motion blur due to hand vibrations or sudden movements. This phenomenon can significantly detract from the quality of the images captured, making it an interesting challenge to develop a deep learning model that utilizes the principles of adversarial networks to restore clarity to these blurred pixels. In this project, we will focus on leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to effectively deblur images affected by motion blur. A GAN-based Tensorflow model is defined, training and evaluating by GoPro dataset which comprises paired street view images featuring both clear and blurred versions. This adversarial training process between Discriminator and Generator helps to produce increasingly realistic images over time. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are the two evaluation metrics used to provide quantitative measures of image quality, allowing us to evaluate the effectiveness of the deblurring process. Mean PSNR in 29.1644 and mean SSIM in 0.7459 with average 4.6921 seconds deblurring time are achieved in this project. The blurry pixels are sharper in the output of GAN model shows a good image restoration effect in real world applications.</description>

      <title>Contrast-Optimized Basis Functions for Self-Navigated Motion Correction in Quantitative MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: The long scan times of quantitative MRI techniques make motion artifacts more likely. For MR-Fingerprinting-like approaches, this problem can be addressed with self-navigated retrospective motion correction based on reconstructions in a singular value decomposition (SVD) subspace. However, the SVD promotes high signal intensity in all tissues, which limits the contrast between tissue types and ultimately reduces the accuracy of registration. The purpose of this paper is to rotate the subspace for maximum contrast between two types of tissue and improve the accuracy of motion estimates.
  Methods: A subspace is derived that promotes contrasts between brain parenchyma and CSF, achieved through the generalized eigendecomposition of mean autocorrelation matrices, followed by a Gram-Schmidt process to maintain orthogonality. We tested our motion correction method on 85 scans with varying motion levels, acquired with a 3D hybrid-state sequence optimized for quantitative magnetization transfer imaging.
  Results: A comparative analysis shows that the contrast-optimized basis significantly improve the parenchyma-CSF contrast, leading to smoother motion estimates and reduced artifacts in the quantitative maps.
  Conclusion: The proposed contrast-optimized subspace improves the accuracy of the motion estimation.</description>

      <title>Structural Similarity in Deep Features: Image Quality Assessment Robust to Geometrically Disparate Reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) with references plays an important role in optimizing and evaluating computer vision tasks. Traditional methods assume that all pixels of the reference and test images are fully aligned. Such Aligned-Reference IQA (AR-IQA) approaches fail to address many real-world problems with various geometric deformations between the two images. Although significant effort has been made to attack Geometrically-Disparate-Reference IQA (GDR-IQA) problem, it has been addressed in a task-dependent fashion, for example, by dedicated designs for image super-resolution and retargeting, or by assuming the geometric distortions to be small that can be countered by translation-robust filters or by explicit image registrations. Here we rethink this problem and propose a unified, non-training-based Deep Structural Similarity (DeepSSIM) approach to address the above problems in a single framework, which assesses structural similarity of deep features in a simple but efficient way and uses an attention calibration strategy to alleviate attention deviation. The proposed method, without application-specific design, achieves state-of-the-art performance on AR-IQA datasets and meanwhile shows strong robustness to various GDR-IQA test cases. Interestingly, our test also shows the effectiveness of DeepSSIM as an optimization tool for training image super-resolution, enhancement and restoration, implying an even wider generalizability. \footnote{Source code will be made public after the review is completed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed impressive achievements in cancer survival analysis by integrating multimodal data, e.g., pathology images and genomic profiles. However, the heterogeneity and high dimensionality of these modalities pose significant challenges for extracting discriminative representations while maintaining good generalization. In this paper, we propose a Cohort-individual Cooperative Learning (CCL) framework to advance cancer survival analysis by collaborating knowledge decomposition and cohort guidance. Specifically, first, we propose a Multimodal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) module to explicitly decompose multimodal knowledge into four distinct components: redundancy, synergy and uniqueness of the two modalities. Such a comprehensive decomposition can enlighten the models to perceive easily overlooked yet important information, facilitating an effective multimodal fusion. Second, we propose a Cohort Guidance Modeling (CGM) to mitigate the risk of overfitting task-irrelevant information. It can promote a more comprehensive and robust understanding of the underlying multimodal data, while avoiding the pitfalls of overfitting and enhancing the generalization ability of the model. By cooperating the knowledge decomposition and cohort guidance methods, we develop a robust multimodal survival analysis model with enhanced discrimination and generalization abilities. Extensive experimental results on five cancer datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in integrating multimodal data for survival analysis.</description>

      <title>BLS-GAN: A Deep Layer Separation Framework for Eliminating Bone Overlap in Conventional Radiographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional radiography is the widely used imaging technology in diagnosing, monitoring, and prognosticating musculoskeletal (MSK) diseases because of its easy availability, versatility, and cost-effectiveness. In conventional radiographs, bone overlaps are prevalent, and can impede the accurate assessment of bone characteristics by radiologists or algorithms, posing significant challenges to conventional and computer-aided diagnoses. This work initiated the study of a challenging scenario - bone layer separation in conventional radiographs, in which separate overlapped bone regions enable the independent assessment of the bone characteristics of each bone layer and lay the groundwork for MSK disease diagnosis and its automation. This work proposed a Bone Layer Separation GAN (BLS-GAN) framework that can produce high-quality bone layer images with reasonable bone characteristics and texture. This framework introduced a reconstructor based on conventional radiography imaging principles, which achieved efficient reconstruction and mitigates the recurrent calculations and training instability issues caused by soft tissue in the overlapped regions. Additionally, pre-training with synthetic images was implemented to enhance the stability of both the training process and the results. The generated images passed the visual Turing test, and improved performance in downstream tasks. This work affirms the feasibility of extracting bone layer images from conventional radiographs, which holds promise for leveraging bone layer separation technology to facilitate more comprehensive analytical research in MSK diagnosis, monitoring, and prognosis.

      <title>Window-based Channel Attention for Wavelet-enhanced Learned Image Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14090v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learned Image Compression (LIC) models have achieved superior rate-distortion performance than traditional codecs. Existing LIC models use CNN, Transformer, or Mixed CNN-Transformer as basic blocks. However, limited by the shifted window attention, Swin-Transformer-based LIC exhibits a restricted growth of receptive fields, affecting the ability to model large objects for image compression. To address this issue and improve the performance, we incorporate window partition into channel attention for the first time to obtain large receptive fields and capture more global information. Since channel attention hinders local information learning, it is important to extend existing attention mechanisms in Transformer codecs to the space-channel attention to establish multiple receptive fields, being able to capture global correlations with large receptive fields while maintaining detailed characterization of local correlations with small receptive fields. We also incorporate the discrete wavelet transform into our Spatial-Channel Hybrid (SCH) framework for efficient frequency-dependent down-sampling and further enlarging receptive fields. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances, reducing BD-rate by 18.54%, 23.98%, 22.33%, and 24.71% on four standard datasets compared to VTM-23.1.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Latent Diffusion Model for Enhanced Feature Extraction from Medical Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various imaging modalities are used in patient diagnosis, each offering unique advantages and valuable insights into anatomy and pathology. Computed Tomography (CT) is crucial in diagnostics, providing high-resolution images for precise internal organ visualization. CT's ability to detect subtle tissue variations is vital for diagnosing diseases like lung cancer, enabling early detection and accurate tumor assessment. However, variations in CT scanner models and acquisition protocols introduce significant variability in the extracted radiomic features, even when imaging the same patient. This variability poses considerable challenges for downstream research and clinical analysis, which depend on consistent and reliable feature extraction. Current methods for medical image feature extraction, often based on supervised learning approaches, including GAN-based models, face limitations in generalizing across different imaging environments. In response to these challenges, we propose LTDiff++, a multiscale latent diffusion model designed to enhance feature extraction in medical imaging. The model addresses variability by standardizing non-uniform distributions in the latent space, improving feature consistency. LTDiff++ utilizes a UNet++ encoder-decoder architecture coupled with a conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) at the latent bottleneck to achieve robust feature extraction and standardization. Extensive empirical evaluations on both patient and phantom CT datasets demonstrate significant improvements in image standardization, with higher Concordance Correlation Coefficients (CCC) across multiple radiomic feature categories. Through these advancements, LTDiff++ represents a promising solution for overcoming the inherent variability in medical imaging data, offering improved reliability and accuracy in feature extraction processes.</description>

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder, often diagnosed using X-rays due to its cost-effectiveness. While Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides superior soft tissue visualization and serves as a valuable supplementary diagnostic tool, its high cost and limited accessibility significantly restrict its widespread use. To explore the feasibility of bridging this imaging gap, we conducted a feasibility study leveraging a diffusion-based model that uses an X-ray image as conditional input, alongside target depth and additional patient-specific feature information, to generate corresponding MRI sequences. Our findings demonstrate that the MRI volumes generated by our approach is visually closer to real MRI scans. Moreover, increasing inference steps enhances the continuity and smoothness of the synthesized MRI sequences. Through ablation studies, we further validate that integrating supplementary patient-specific information, beyond what X-rays alone can provide, enhances the accuracy and clinical relevance of the generated MRI, which underscores the potential of leveraging external patient-specific information to improve the MRI generation.

      <title>Compact Visual Data Representation for Green Multimedia -- A Human Visual System Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Human Visual System (HVS), with its intricate sophistication, is capable of achieving ultra-compact information compression for visual signals. This remarkable ability is coupled with high generalization capability and energy efficiency. By contrast, the state-of-the-art Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard achieves a compression ratio of around 1,000 times for raw visual data. This notable disparity motivates the research community to draw inspiration to effectively handle the immense volume of visual data in a green way. Therefore, this paper provides a survey of how visual data can be efficiently represented for green multimedia, in particular when the ultimate task is knowledge extraction instead of visual signal reconstruction. We introduce recent research efforts that promote green, sustainable, and efficient multimedia in this field. Moreover, we discuss how the deep understanding of the HVS can benefit the research community, and envision the development of future green multimedia technologies.</description>

      <title>M3-CVC: Controllable Video Compression with Multimodal Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional and neural video codecs commonly encounter limitations in controllability and generality under ultra-low-bitrate coding scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose M3-CVC, a controllable video compression framework incorporating multimodal generative models. The framework utilizes a semantic-motion composite strategy for keyframe selection to retain critical information. For each keyframe and its corresponding video clip, a dialogue-based large multimodal model (LMM) approach extracts hierarchical spatiotemporal details, enabling both inter-frame and intra-frame representations for improved video fidelity while enhancing encoding interpretability. M3-CVC further employs a conditional diffusion-based, text-guided keyframe compression method, achieving high fidelity in frame reconstruction. During decoding, textual descriptions derived from LMMs guide the diffusion process to restore the original video's content accurately. Experimental results demonstrate that M3-CVC significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art VVC standard in ultra-low bitrate scenarios, particularly in preserving semantic and perceptual fidelity.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Impact of Evaluation Metrics in Kinetic Models for Consensus-based Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we extend a recently introduced kinetic model for consensus-based segmentation of images. In particular, we will interpret the set of pixels of a 2D image as an interacting particle system which evolves in time in view of a consensus-type process obtained by interactions between pixels and external noise. Thanks to a kinetic formulation of the introduced model we derive the large time solution of the model. We will show that the choice of parameters defining the segmentation task can be chosen from a plurality of loss functions characterising the evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Quantitative Cerebral Perfusion Images Directly From Measured Sinogram Data Acquired Using C-arm Cone-Beam CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To shorten the door-to-puncture time for better treating patients with acute ischemic stroke, it is highly desired to obtain quantitative cerebral perfusion images using C-arm cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) equipped in the interventional suite. However, limited by the slow gantry rotation speed, the temporal resolution and temporal sampling density of typical C-arm CBCT are much poorer than those of multi-detector-row CT in the diagnostic imaging suite. The current quantitative perfusion imaging includes two cascaded steps: time-resolved image reconstruction and perfusion parametric estimation. For time-resolved image reconstruction, the technical challenge imposed by poor temporal resolution and poor sampling density causes inaccurate quantification of the temporal variation of cerebral artery and tissue attenuation values. For perfusion parametric estimation, it remains a technical challenge to appropriately design the handcrafted regularization for better solving the associated deconvolution problem. These two challenges together prevent obtaining quantitatively accurate perfusion images using C-arm CBCT. The purpose of this work is to simultaneously address these two challenges by combining the two cascaded steps into a single joint optimization problem and reconstructing quantitative perfusion images directly from the measured sinogram data. In the developed direct cerebral perfusion parametric image reconstruction technique, TRAINER in short, the quantitative perfusion images have been represented as a subject-specific conditional generative model trained under the constraint of the time-resolved CT forward model, perfusion convolutional model, and the subject's own measured sinogram data. Results shown in this paper demonstrated that using TRAINER, quantitative cerebral perfusion images can be accurately obtained using C-arm CBCT in the interventional suite.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model Based Visual Compensation Guidance and Visual Difference Analysis for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing free-energy guided No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) methods still suffer from finding a balance between learning feature information at the pixel level of the image and capturing high-level feature information and the efficient utilization of the obtained high-level feature information remains a challenge. As a novel class of state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative model, the diffusion model exhibits the capability to model intricate relationships, enabling a comprehensive understanding of images and possessing a better learning of both high-level and low-level visual features. In view of these, we pioneer the exploration of the diffusion model into the domain of NR-IQA. Firstly, we devise a new diffusion restoration network that leverages the produced enhanced image and noise-containing images, incorporating nonlinear features obtained during the denoising process of the diffusion model, as high-level visual information. Secondly, two visual evaluation branches are designed to comprehensively analyze the obtained high-level feature information. These include the visual compensation guidance branch, grounded in the transformer architecture and noise embedding strategy, and the visual difference analysis branch, built on the ResNet architecture and the residual transposed attention block. Extensive experiments are conducted on seven public NR-IQA datasets, and the results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms SOTA methods for NR-IQA.</description>

      <title>AddSR: Accelerating Diffusion-based Blind Super-Resolution with Adversarial Diffusion Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01717v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blind super-resolution methods based on stable diffusion showcase formidable generative capabilities in reconstructing clear high-resolution images with intricate details from low-resolution inputs. However, their practical applicability is often hampered by poor efficiency, stemming from the requirement of thousands or hundreds of sampling steps. Inspired by the efficient adversarial diffusion distillation (ADD), we design~\name~to address this issue by incorporating the ideas of both distillation and ControlNet. Specifically, we first propose a prediction-based self-refinement strategy to provide high-frequency information in the student model output with marginal additional time cost. Furthermore, we refine the training process by employing HR images, rather than LR images, to regulate the teacher model, providing a more robust constraint for distillation. Second, we introduce a timestep-adaptive ADD to address the perception-distortion imbalance problem introduced by original ADD. Extensive experiments demonstrate our~\name~generates better restoration results, while achieving faster speed than previous SD-based state-of-the-art models (e.g., $7$$\times$ faster than SeeSR).</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Pansharpening: Critical Review, Tools and Future Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperspectral pansharpening consists of fusing a high-resolution panchromatic band and a low-resolution hyperspectral image to obtain a new image with high resolution in both the spatial and spectral domains. These remote sensing products are valuable for a wide range of applications, driving ever growing research efforts. Nonetheless, results still do not meet application demands. In part, this comes from the technical complexity of the task: compared to multispectral pansharpening, many more bands are involved, in a spectral range only partially covered by the panchromatic component and with overwhelming noise. However, another major limiting factor is the absence of a comprehensive framework for the rapid development and accurate evaluation of new methods. This paper attempts to address this issue.
  We started by designing a dataset large and diverse enough to allow reliable training (for data-driven methods) and testing of new methods. Then, we selected a set of state-of-the-art methods, following different approaches, characterized by promising performance, and reimplemented them in a single PyTorch framework. Finally, we carried out a critical comparative analysis of all methods, using the most accredited quality indicators. The analysis highlights the main limitations of current solutions in terms of spectral/spatial quality and computational efficiency, and suggests promising research directions.
  To ensure full reproducibility of the results and support future research, the framework (including codes, evaluation procedures and links to the dataset) is shared on https://github.com/matciotola/hyperspectral_pansharpening_toolbox, as a single Python-based reference benchmark toolbox.</description>

      <title>LiRCDepth: Lightweight Radar-Camera Depth Estimation via Knowledge Distillation and Uncertainty Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, radar-camera fusion algorithms have gained significant attention as radar sensors provide geometric information that complements the limitations of cameras. However, most existing radar-camera depth estimation algorithms focus solely on improving performance, often neglecting computational efficiency. To address this gap, we propose LiRCDepth, a lightweight radar-camera depth estimation model. We incorporate knowledge distillation to enhance the training process, transferring critical information from a complex teacher model to our lightweight student model in three key domains. Firstly, low-level and high-level features are transferred by incorporating pixel-wise and pair-wise distillation. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-aware inter-depth distillation loss to refine intermediate depth maps during decoding. Leveraging our proposed knowledge distillation scheme, the lightweight model achieves a 6.6% improvement in MAE on the nuScenes dataset compared to the model trained without distillation.

      <title>Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</description>
