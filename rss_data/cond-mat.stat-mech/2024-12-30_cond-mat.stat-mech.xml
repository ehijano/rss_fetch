      <title>Ansatz for the Two-Dimensional Ising Model in an External Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ansatz applied to the two-dimensional Ising model in an external magnetic field h gives rise to an exactly soluble model. The singularity in the magnetization found by Onsager does not survive the presence of the external magnetic field as found earlier by Lee and Yang in 1952. However, the singularity in the heat capacity remains even in the presence of the magnetic field. A surprising result is the presence of negative heat capacity for h &gt; 0.</description>

      <title>Proof of absence of local conserved quantities in two- and higher-dimensional quantum Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Ising models with transverse and longitudinal fields on the hypercubic lattices with dimensions higher than one have no local conserved quantities other than the Hamiltonian. This holds for any value of the longitudinal field, including zero, as far as the transverse field and the Ising interactions are nonzero. The conserved quantity considered here is ``local'' in a very weak sense: it can be written as a linear combination of operators whose side lengths of the supports in one direction do not exceed half the system size, while the side lengths in the other directions are arbitrary. We also prove that the above result holds even in the ladder system. Our results extend the recently developed technique of the proof of absence of local conserved quantities in one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions and to the ladder.</description>

      <title>Relaxation behavior near the first-order phase transition line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Metropolis algorithm, we simulate the relaxation process of the three-dimensional kinetic Ising model. Starting from a random initial configuration, we first present the average equilibration time across the entire phase boundary. It is observed that the average equilibration time increases significantly as the temperature decreases from the critical temperature ($T_{\rm c}$). The average equilibration time along the first-order phase transition (1st-PT) line exhibits an ultra-slow relaxation. We also investigate the dynamic scaling behavior with system sizes, and find that dynamic scaling holds not only at $T_{\rm c}$, but also below $T_{\rm c}$. The dynamic exponent below $T_{\rm c}$ is larger than that at $T_{\rm c}$. Additionally, we analyze the dynamic scaling of the average autocorrelation time and find that it depends on system size only near $T_{\rm c}$, while it becomes size-independent both above and below $T_{\rm c}$. The extremely slow relaxation dynamics observed near the 1st-PT is attributed to the complex structure of the free energy.</description>

      <title>Fluid-particle interactions and fluctuation-dissipation relations I -- General linear theory and basic fluctuational patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article provides a unitary and complete solution to the fluctuation-dissipation relations for particle hydromechanics in a generic fluid, accounting for the hydrodynamic fluid-particle interactions (including arbitrary memory kernels in the description of dissipative and fluid inertial effects) in linear hydrodynamic regimes, via the concepts of fluctuational patterns. This is achieved by expressing the memory kernels as a linear superposition of exponentially decaying modes. Given the structure of the interaction with the internal degrees of freedom, and assuming the representation of the thermal force as a superposition of modal contributions, the fluctuation-dissipation relation follows simply from the moment analysis of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation, imposing the condition that at equilibrium all the internal degrees of freedom are uncorrelated with particle velocity. Moreover, the functional structure of the resulting equation of motion corresponds to the principle of complete decoupling amongst the internal degrees of freedom. The theory is extended to the case of confined geometries, by generalizing previous results including the effect of fluid inertia.</description>

      <title>Fluid-particle interactions and fluctuation-dissipation relations II -- Gaussianity and Gaussianity breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of fluctuation-dissipation relations developed in Giona et al. (2024) for particle hydromechanics is extended to stochastic forcings alternative to Wiener processes, with the aim of addressing the occurrence of Gaussian equilibrium densities or alternatively the breaking of the Gaussian paradigm at equilibrium. Preliminarly, it is discussed how the determination of the fluctuational patterns starting from the Gaussian approach to Markov processes is practically unfeasible, and the moment analysis provides the simplest way to achieve it. We show the existence of an uncountable family of white-noise processes, different from the distributional derivatives of Wiener processes, and satisfying the requirement of fluctuational independence, i.e. the basic assumption on thermal fluctuations in the Kubo theory based on the Langevin condition. The importance of this extension is that it may provide a transition from mesoscopic to microscopic (event-based) stochastic modeling. In this framework, the derivatives of Wiener processes constitute a very peculiar, albeit continuous, element of this class. The fluctuational patterns driven by non-Wiener stochastic forcings display in general non-Gaussian velocity fluctuations at equilibrium, and the Gaussian case is recovered in the limit of small perturbations. Finally, a fully hydromechanic approach to anomalous diffusion is provided, both in the subdiffusive and in the superdiffusive cases.</description>

      <title>Fluid-particle interactions and fluctuation-dissipation relations III -- Correlated fluctuations, regularity and added mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation theory is grounded on the Langevin condition expressing the local independence between the thermal force and the particle velocity history. Upon hydrodynamic grounds, it is reasonable to relax this condition in order to account for the correlated fluid fluctuations, especially in the case of liquids, consistently with the inclusion of acoustic effects and with the finite speed of propagation of internal shear stresses. We show that the introduction of correlated stochastic processes in the basic fluctuational patterns defined in Giona et al. (2024), preserves the global fluctuation-dissipation relation, connecting diffusivity to the global friction factor, and the resulting velocity fluctuations become almost everywhere smooth functions of time. Moreover, a fluctuational added mass arises as a consequence of correlations. This leads to a fluctuation-inertia relation, connecting the fluctuational added mass at microscale to its occurrence for macroscopic objects.</description>

      <title>Low temperature nucleation rate calculations using the N-Fold way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical study to determine nucleation rates for magnetisation reversal within the Ising model (lattice gas model) in the low-temperature regime, a domain less explored in previous research. To achieve this, we implemented the N-Fold way algorithm, a well-established method for low-temperature simulations, alongside a novel, highly efficient cluster identification algorithm. Our method can access nucleation rates up to 50 orders of magnitude lower than previously reported results. We examine three cases: homogeneous pure system, system with static impurities, and system with mobile impurities, where impurities are defined as sites with zero interactions with neighbouring spins (spin value of impurities is set to 0). Classical nucleation theory holds across the entire temperature range studied in the paper, for both the homogeneous system and the static impurity case. However, in the case of mobile impurities, the umbrella sampling technique seems ineffective at low mobility values. These findings provide valuable insights into nucleation phenomena at low temperatures, contributing to theoretical and experimental understanding.</description>

      <title>The XY model with vision cone: non-reciprocal vs. reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the classical XY model on a two-dimensional square lattice, with interactions occurring within a vision cone of each spin. Via Monte Carlo simulations, we explore one non-reciprocal and two reciprocal implementations of these interactions. The corresponding energy involves couplings that depend non-trivially on the system's configuration, leading to both long-range and quasi-long-range ordered phases at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that non-reciprocity is not essential for achieving long-range order at low temperatures. Using symmetry arguments, we provide a theoretical framework to explain these findings, and additionally we uncover an unexpected order-by-disorder transition.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase transitions in certain non-ergodic stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of stochastic processes in which the large deviation functions of time-integrated observables exhibit singularities that relate to dynamical phase transitions of trajectories. These illustrative examples include Brownian motion with a death rate or in the presence of an absorbing wall, for which we consider a set of empirical observables such as the net displacement, local time, residence time, and area under the trajectory. Using a backward Fokker-Planck approach, we derive the large deviation functions of these observables, and demonstrate how singularities emerge from a competition between survival and diffusion. Furthermore, we analyse this scenario using an alternative approach with tilted operators, showing that at the singular point, the effective dynamics undergoes an abrupt transition. Extending this approach, we show that similar transitions may generically arise in Markov chains with transient states. This scenario is robust and generalizable for non-Markovian dynamics and for many-body systems, potentially leading to multiple dynamical phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resetting in a nonequilibrium environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the dynamics of a tracer particle diffusing in a nonequilibrium medium under stochastic resetting. The nonequilibrium state is induced by harmonic coupling between the tracer and bath particles, generating memory effects with exponential decay in time. We explore the tracer's behavior under a Poissonian resetting protocol, where resetting does not disturb the bath environment, with a focus on key dynamical behavior and first-passage properties, both in the presence and absence of an external force. The interplay between coupling strength and diffusivity of bath particle significantly impacts both the tracer's relaxation dynamics and search time, with external forces further modulating these effects. Our analysis identifies distinct hot and cold bath particles based on their diffusivities, revealing that coupling to a hot particle facilitates the searching process, whereas coupling to a cold particle hinders it. Using a combination of numerical simulations and analytical methods, this study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding resetting mechanisms in non-Markovian systems, with potential applications to complex environments such as active and viscoelastic media, where memory-driven dynamics and nonequilibrium interactions are significant.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Response Theory: From Precision Limits to Strong Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuation-response relations lie at the heart of statistical physics, yet their formulation in nonequilibrium steady states remains challenging. This Letter makes two key contributions to this field: First, we establish fundamental limits on nonequilibrium steady-state responses by deriving upper bounds on response precisions using steady-state Fisher information. Our analysis reveals that the sensitivity of observables to perturbations is governed by mean first passage times, steady-state currents, and activities, though it cannot be enhanced indefinitely by increasing these quantities. Notably, we demonstrate that the role of activity in response precision parallels that of repeated measurements in metrology. Second, we develop novel identities connecting the responses to arbitrarily strong perturbations with those to small perturbations. These identities significantly extend previous nonequilibrium response theories, which primarily focused on small perturbations, to encompass arbitrarily strong perturbations.</description>

      <title>Global thermodynamics for isothermal fluids under gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a formulation of global thermodynamics for equilibrium systems under the influence of gravity. The free energy for simple fluids is extended to include a dependence on $(T, V, N, mgL)$, where $L$ represents the vertical system length in the direction of gravity. A central idea in this formulation is to uniquely fix the reference point of the gravitational potential, ensuring a consistent thermodynamic framework. Using this framework, we derive the probability density of thermodynamic quantities, which allows us to define a variational function for determining equilibrium liquid-gas coexistence under gravity. The resulting free energy landscape, derived from the variational function, reveals the local stability of liquid-gas configurations. Specifically, the liquid phase resides at the lower portion of the system due to gravity, while the inverted configuration (with liquid on top) is also locally stable in this landscape. Furthermore, we characterize the transition between these liquid-gas configurations as a first-order phase transition using the thermodynamic free energy of $(T,V,N,mgL)$. Finally, we validate the predictions of global thermodynamics through molecular dynamics simulations, demonstrating the applicability and accuracy of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal interactions preserve the universality class of Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $q$-state Potts model on a square lattice with directed nearest-neighbor spin-spin interactions that are inherently non-reciprocal. Both equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics are investigated. Analytically, we demonstrate that non-reciprocal interactions do not alter the critical exponents of the model under equilibrium dynamics. In contrast, numerical simulations with selfish non-equilibrium dynamics reveal distinctive behavior. For $q=2$ (non-reciprocal non-equilibrium Ising model), the critical exponents remain consistent with those of the equilibrium Ising universality class. However, for $q=3$ and $q=4$, the critical exponents vary continuously. Remarkably, a super-universal scaling function -- Binder cumulant as a function of $\xi_2/\xi_0$, where $\xi_2$ is the second moment correlation length and $\xi_0$ its maximum value -- remains identical to that of the equilibrium $q=3,4$ Potts models. These findings indicate that non-reciprocal Potts models belong to the superuniversality class of their respective equilibrium counterparts.</description>

      <title>Physics of 2D magnets and magnetic thin films: Surface structure and surface phase transition, criticality and skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there is an increasing renewed interest in 2D magnetism such as Van der Waals magnets. The physics of 2D magnetism and ultra-thin magnetic films has a long history. This chapter is a review devoted to some fundamental theoretical properties of 2D magnets and and magnetic thin films including frustrated systems and topological spin textures. These properties allow to understand macroscopic behaviors experimentally observed in thin films and superlattices where the surface and the interface play a crucial role. The chapter begins with a review on 2D magnets, their spin structures and phase transitions. Next, the case of thin films is considered. The theory of surface spin waves is discussed in various situations with and without surface reconstruction of spin ordering. Various interactions are taken into account: surface interaction different from the bulk one, competing interactions, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Surface phase transitions are shown in some particularly striking cases. Finally, some cases of topological spin textures called "skyrmions" are reviewed. All the results shown in this chapter have been published in various research papers cited in the text. Therefore, we will discuss some important results but avoid to enter complicated methods. Instead, the reader is referred to original papers for detailed demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Direct estimates of irreversibility from time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The arrow of time can be quantified through the Kullback-Leibler divergence ($D_{KL}$) between the distributions of forward and reverse trajectories in a system. Many approaches to estimate this rely on specific models, but the use of incorrect models can introduce uncontrolled errors. Here, we describe a model-free method that uses trajectory data directly to estimate the evidence for irreversibility over finite windows of time. To do this we build on previous work to identify and correct for errors that arise from limited sample size. Importantly, our approach accurately recovers $D_{KL} = 0$ in systems that adhere to detailed balance, and the correct nonzero $D_{KL}$ for data generated by well understood models of nonequilibrium systems. We apply our method to trajectories of neural activity in the retina as it responds to naturalistic inputs, and find evidence of irreversibility in single neurons, emphasizing the non-Markovian character of these data. These results open new avenues for investigating how the brain represents the arrow of time.</description>

      <title>Using a quantum SWAP engine to experimentally validate thermodynamic uncertainty relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) arise from the bounds on fluctuations of thermodynamics quantities during a non-equilibrium process and they impose constraints on the corresponding process. We experimentally implement a quantum SWAP engine on a nuclear magnetic resonance setup and demonstrate that a Gibbs thermal state can be prepared in two different ways, either directly from a thermal equilibrium state, or by first initializing the system in a pseudopure state. We show that the quantum SWAP engine can work both as a heat engine and as a refrigerator. Starting from a pseudopure state, we construct the SWAP engine, and investigate the violation of two different TURs, namely a generalized TUR and a tighter, more specific TUR. Our results validate that the generalized TUR is obeyed in all the working regimes of the SWAP engine, while the tighter TUR is violated in certain regimes. ~</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work done when a system at thermal equilibrium is externally driven by a unitary control parameter leads to irreversible entropy production. The entropy produced can be thought of as a combination of coherence generation and a population mismatch between the target equilibrium state and the actually achieved final state. We experimentally explored this out-of-equilibrium process in an NMR quantum processor and studied the contribution of coherence to irreversible entropy generation. We verified a generalized Clausius inequality, which affirms that irreversible entropy production is lower-bounded.</description>

      <title>BoostMD: Accelerating molecular sampling by leveraging ML force field features from previous time-steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating atomic-scale processes, such as protein dynamics and catalytic reactions, is crucial for advancements in biology, chemistry, and materials science. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as powerful tools that achieve near quantum mechanical accuracy, with promising generalization capabilities. However, their practical use is often limited by long inference times compared to classical force fields, especially when running extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations required for many biological applications. In this study, we introduce BoostMD, a surrogate model architecture designed to accelerate MD simulations. BoostMD leverages node features computed at previous time steps to predict energies and forces based on positional changes. This approach reduces the complexity of the learning task, allowing BoostMD to be both smaller and significantly faster than conventional MLFFs. During simulations, the computationally intensive reference MLFF is evaluated only every $N$ steps, while the lightweight BoostMD model handles the intermediate steps at a fraction of the computational cost. Our experiments demonstrate that BoostMD achieves an eight-fold speedup compared to the reference model and generalizes to unseen dipeptides. Furthermore, we find that BoostMD accurately samples the ground-truth Boltzmann distribution when running molecular dynamics. By combining efficient feature reuse with a streamlined architecture, BoostMD offers a robust solution for conducting large-scale, long-timescale molecular simulations, making high-accuracy ML-driven modeling more accessible and practical.</description>

      <title>The moments of the spectral form factor in SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In chaotic quantum systems the spectral form factor exhibits a universal linear ramp and plateau structure with superimposed erratic oscillations. The mean signal and the statistics of the noise can be probed by the moments of the spectral form factor, also known as higher-point spectral form factors. We identify saddle points in the SYK model that describe the moments during the ramp region. Perturbative corrections around the saddle point indicate that SYK mimics random matrix statistics for the low order moments, while large deviations for the high order moments arise from fluctuations near the edge of the spectrum. The leading correction scales inversely with the number of random parameters in the SYK Hamiltonian and is amplified in a sparsified version of the SYK model, which we study numerically, even in regimes where a linear ramp persists. Finally, we study the $q=2$ SYK model, whose spectral form factor exhibits an exponential ramp with increased noise. These findings reveal how deviations from random matrix universality arise in disordered systems and motivate their interpretation from a bulk gravitational perspective.</description>

      <title>Emergent Intermediate Phase in the $J_1$-$J_2$ XY model from Tensor Network Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-temperature phase diagram of the classical $J_1$-$J_2$ XY model on a square lattice using a tensor network approach designed for frustrated spin systems. This model, characterized by competing nearest-neighbor and next-to-nearest-neighbor interactions, exhibits a complex interplay between $U(1)$ and $Z_2$ symmetries. Our study reveals an emergent intermediate phase around $J_2/J_1 \sim 0.505$, which is characterized by a $Z_2$ long-range stripe order without phase coherence in the XY spins. The intermediate phase features two well-separated phase transitions: a higher-temperature Ising transition and a lower-temperature Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. The relative separation between these transitions is significantly larger than previously reported, enabling a clearer investigation of their distinct thermodynamic properties. For $0.5&lt;J_2/J_1 &lt; 0.501$, two transitions merge into a single first-order phase transition, a phenomenon that cannot be explained solely by mapping to the Ising-XY model. As $J_2/J_1 \to \infty$, the transition evolves continuously into the BKT universality class. These findings advance the understanding of the mechanisms driving phase transitions in frustrated spin systems and suggest potential experimental realizations in platforms such as ultracold atoms, Josephson junction arrays, and optical lattices.</description>

Abstract: We study a lattice Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with certain continuous chiral and two-flavor symmetries. For the Hamiltonian of the model, we construct a ground state which breaks the parity and flavor symmetries. In our argument, the chiral symmetry plays a crucial role for proving the violation of the parity and flavor symmetries, although the model does not contain the so-called Wilson term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In physical networks trained using supervised learning, physical parameters are adjusted to produce desired responses to inputs. An example is electrical contrastive local learning networks of nodes connected by edges that are resistors that adjust their conductances during training. When an edge conductance changes, it upsets the current balance of every node. In response, physics adjusts the node voltages to minimize the dissipated power. Learning in these systems is therefore a coupled double-optimization process, in which the network descends both a cost landscape in the high-dimensional space of edge conductances, and a physical landscape -- the power -- in the high-dimensional space of node voltages. Because of this coupling, the physical landscape of a trained network contains information about the learned task. Here we demonstrate that all the physical information relevant to the trained input-output relation can be captured by a susceptibility, an experimentally measurable quantity. We supplement our theoretical results with simulations to show that the susceptibility is positively correlated with functional importance and that we can extract physical insight into how the system performs the task from the conductances of highly susceptible edges.</description>

Abstract: We present a generalized Einstein relation for the friction coefficients associated with an underlying memory kernel in terms of observable time correlation functions. There is considerable freedom in the correlations involved, and this allows the expression to be tailored to the particular system to achieve numerical stability. We demonstrate this by recovering the site-specific friction coefficients from trajectories of a freely diffusing model trimer, and we show that the accuracy is greatly improved over established Volterra inversion methods for kernel extraction.</description>

We discuss stability of non-periodic tilings and one-dimensional sequences of symbols seen as ground states of some hamiltonians.

      <title>Continuous majorization in quantum phase space with Wigner negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different variants of partial orders among quantum states arise naturally in the context of various quantum resources. For example, in discrete variable quantum computation, stabilizer operations naturally produce an order between input and output states; in technical terms this order is vector majorization of discrete Wigner functions in discrete phase space. The order results in inequalities for magic monotones. In the continuous variable case, a natural counterpart would be continuous majorization of Wigner functions in quantum phase space. Indeed, this concept was recently proposed and explored (mostly restricting to the single-mode case) in Van Herstraeten, Jabbour, Cerf, Quantum 7, 1021 (2023). In this work, we develop the theory of continuous majorization in the general $N$-mode case. In particular, we propose extensions to include states with finite Wigner negativity. Among our results, we prove a conjecture made by Van Herstraeten, Jabbour and Cerf for the convex hull of $N$-mode Gaussian states, and a phase space counterpart of Uhlmann's theorem of majorization.</description>

Abstract: We generalize Krylov construction to periodically driven (Floquet) quantum systems using the theory of orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. Compared to other approaches, our method works faster and maps any quantum dynamics to a one-dimensional tight-binding Krylov chain. We also suggest a classification of chaotic and integrable Floquet systems based on the asymptotic behavior of Krylov chain hopping parameters (Verblunsky coefficients). We illustrate this classification with random matrix ensembles, kicked top, and kicked Ising chain.</description>

      <title>Concentration of ergotropy in many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ergotropy -- the maximal amount of unitarily extractable work -- measures the ``charge level'' of quantum batteries. We prove that in large many-body batteries ergotropy exhibits a concentration of measure phenomenon. Namely, the ergotropy of such systems is almost constant for almost all states sampled from the Hilbert--Schmidt measure. We establish this by first proving that ergotropy, as a function of the state, is Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the Bures distance, and then applying Levy's measure concentration lemma. In parallel, we showcase the analogous properties of von Neumann entropy, compiling and adapting known results about its continuity and concentration properties. Furthermore, we consider the situation with the least amount of prior information about the state. This corresponds to the quantum version of the Jeffreys prior distribution -- the Bures measure. In this case, there exist no analytical bounds guaranteeing exponential concentration of measure. Nonetheless, we provide numerical evidence that ergotropy, as well as von Neumann entropy, concentrate also in this case.</description>

Abstract: We construct a local decoder for the 2D toric code using ideas from the hierarchical classical cellular automata of Tsirelson and G\'acs. Our decoder is a circuit of strictly local quantum operations preserving a logical state for exponential time in the presence of circuit-level noise without the need for non-local classical computation or communication. Our construction is not translation invariant in spacetime, but can be made time-translation invariant in 3D with stacks of 2D toric codes. This solves the open problem of constructing a local topological quantum memory below four dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We develop the hypothesis that the dynamics of a given system may lead to the activity being constricted to a subset of space, characterized by a fractal dimension smaller than the space dimension. We also address how the response function might be sensitive to this change in dimensionality. We discuss how this phenomenon is observable in growth processes and near critical points for systems in equilibrium. In particular, we determine the fractal dimension $d_f$ for the Ising model and validate it via computer simulations for two dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The coupling between defects and extended critical degrees of freedom gives rise to the intriguing theory known as defect conformal field theory (CFT). In this work, we introduce a novel family of boundary and interface CFTs by coupling $N$ Majorana chains with SYK$_q$ interactions at the defect. Our analysis reveals that the interaction with $q=2$ constitutes a new marginal defect. Employing a versatile saddle-point method, we compute unique entanglement characterizations, including the $g$ function and effective central charge, of the defect CFT. Furthermore, we analytically evaluate the transmission coefficient using CFT techniques. Surprisingly, the transmission coefficient deviates from the universal relation with the effective central charge across the defect at the large $N$ limit, suggesting that our defect CFT extends beyond all known examples of Gaussian defect CFT.</description>

Abstract: In practical measurements, it is widely recognized that reducing the measurement time leads to decreased accuracy. However, whether an inherent speed-accuracy trade-off exists as a fundamental physical constraint for quantum measurements is not obvious, and the answer remains unknown. Here, we establish a fundamental speed-accuracy trade-off relation based on the energy conservation law and the locality. Our trade-off works as a no-go theorem that the zero-error measurement for the operators that are non-commutative with the Hamiltonian cannot be implemented with finite time. This relation universally applies to various existing errors and disturbances defined for quantum measurements. We furthermore apply our methods to quantum computations and provide another speed-accuracy trade-off relation for unitary gate implementations, which works as another no-go theorem that any error-less implementations of quantum computation gates changing energy cannot be implemented with finite time, and a speed-disturbance trade-off for general quantum operations.</description>

      <title>Site-percolation transition of run-and-tumble particles</title>

Abstract: We study percolation transition of run and tumble particles (RTPs) on a two dimensional square lattice. RTPs in these models run to the nearest neighbour along their internal orientation with unit rate, and to other nearest neighbours with rates $p$. In addition, they tumble to change their internal orientation with rate $\omega$. We show that for small tumble rates, RTP-clusters created by joining occupied nearest neighbours irrespective of their orientation form a phase separated state when the rate of positional diffusion $p$ crosses a threshold; with further increase of $p$ the clusters disintegrate and another transition to a mixed phase occurs. The critical exponents of this re-entrant site-percolation transition of RTPs vary continuously along the critical line in the $\omega$-$p$ plane, but a scaling function remains invariant. This function is identical to the corresponding universal scaling function of percolation transition observed in the Ising model. We also show that the critical exponents of the underlying motility induced phase separation transition are related to corresponding percolation-critical-exponents by constant multiplicative factors known from the correspondence of magnetic and percolation critical exponents of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>State-dependent mobility edge in kinetically constrained models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we show that the kinetically constrained quantum East model lies between a quantum scarred and a many-body localized system featuring an unconventional type of mobility edge in the spectrum. We name this scenario $\textit{state-dependent}$ mobility edge: while the system does not exhibit a sharp separation in energy between thermal and non-thermal eigenstates, the abundance of non-thermal eigenstates results in slow entanglement growth for $\textit{many}$ initial states, such as product states, below a finite energy density. We characterize the state-dependent mobility edge by looking at the complexity of classically simulating dynamics using tensor network for system sizes well beyond those accessible via exact diagonalization. Focusing on initial product states, we observe a qualitative change in the dynamics of the bond dimension needed as a function of their energy density. Specifically, the bond dimension typically grows $\textit{polynomially}$ in time up to a certain energy density, where we locate the state-dependent mobility edge, enabling simulations for long times. Above this energy density, the bond dimension typically grows $\textit{exponentially}$ making the simulation practically unfeasible beyond short times, as generally expected in interacting theories. We correlate the polynomial growth of the bond dimension to the presence of many non-thermal eigenstates around that energy density, a subset of which we compute via tensor network. The outreach of our findings encompasses quantum sampling problems and the efficient simulation of quantum circuits beyond Clifford families.</description>

      <title>Generalised BBGKY hierarchy for near-integrable dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00593v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider quantum or classical many-body Hamiltonian systems characterized by integrable contact interactions supplemented by a generic two-body potential, potentially long-range. We show how the dynamics of local observables is given in terms of a generalised version of Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon hierarchy, which we denote as gBBGKY, which is built for the densities, and their correlations, of the quasiparticles of the underlying integrable model. Unlike the usual cases of perturbation theory from free gases, the presence of local interactions in the integrable model "lifts" the so-called kinetic blocking, and the second layer of the hierarchy reproduces the dynamics at all time-scales. The latter consists of a fast pre-equilibration to a non-thermal steady state, and its subsequent thermalisation to a Gibbs ensemble. We show how the final relaxation is encoded into a Boltzmann scattering integral involving three or higher body-scatterings, and which, remarkably, is entirely determined by the diffusion constants of the underlying integrable model. We check our results with exact molecular dynamics simulations, finding perfect agreement. Our results show how gBBGKY can be successfully employed in quantum systems to compute scattering integrals and Fermi's golden rule transition rates.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical analysis of spin dynamics in the non-Hermitian Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a specific limit of the one-dimensional non-Hermitian Hubbard Hamiltonian with complex interactions. In this framework, fermions with different spin quantum numbers are mapped onto two distinct spin species, resulting in two $XY$ spin chains that are coupled through Ising $ZZ$ interaction. The spin ladder model is then examined within the semiclassical limit using a spin-coherent state basis, where the dynamics is governed by a set of coupled Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations. The non-Hermitian interactions in this model generate a spin-transfer torque term. We analyze the system's evolution toward several potential steady states, including a state of decoupled chains that is accessible when each chain has uniform initial conditions. Other possible steady states involve dimerized configurations with decoupled rungs, where the rung spins are either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically coupled, depending on the sign of the imaginary interactions. The spin dynamics is then studied in the infinite-temperature limit, which favors dimerized steady states. Despite the decoupled rungs, we observe the formation of ferromagnetic domains along each chain in the steady state. Additionally, we investigate the spin correlation functions and identify signatures of anomalous spin dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum annealing can efficiently obtain solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. Size-reduction methods are used to treat large-scale combinatorial optimization problems that cannot be input directly into a quantum annealer because of its size limitation. Various size-reduction methods using fixing spins have been proposed as quantum-classical hybrid methods to obtain solutions. However, the high performance of these hybrid methods is yet to be clearly elucidated. In this study, we adopted a parameterized fixing spins method to verify the effects of fixing spins. The results revealed that setting the appropriate number of spins of the subproblem is crucial for obtaining a satisfactory solution, and the energy gap expansion is confirmed after fixing spins.</description>

      <title>Emptiness Instanton in Quantum Polytropic Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emptiness formation problem is addressed for a one-dimensional quantum polytropic gas characterized by an arbitrary polytropic index $\gamma$, which defines the equation of state $P \sim \rho^\gamma$, where $P$ is the pressure and $\rho$ is the density. The problem involves determining the probability of the spontaneous formation of an empty interval in the ground state of the gas. In the limit of a macroscopically large interval, this probability is dominated by an instanton configuration. By solving the hydrodynamic equations in imaginary time, we derive the analytic form of the emptiness instanton. This solution is expressed as an integral representation analogous to those used for correlation functions in Conformal Field Theory. Prominent features of the spatiotemporal profile of the instanton are obtained directly from this representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19157v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The structure of a complex network plays a crucial role in determining its dynamical properties. In this work, we show that the the degree to which a network is directed and hierarchically organised is closely associated with the degree to which its dynamics break detailed balance and produce entropy. We consider a range of dynamical processes and show how different directed network features affect their entropy production rate. We begin with an analytical treatment of a 2-node network followed by numerical simulations of synthetic networks using the preferential attachment and Erd\"os-Renyi algorithms. Next, we analyse a collection of 97 empirical networks to determine the effect of complex real-world topologies. Finally, we present a simple method for inferring broken detailed balance and directed network structure from multivariate time-series and apply our method to identify non-equilibrium dynamics and hierarchical organisation in both human neuroimaging and financial time-series. Overall, our results shed light on the consequences of directed network structure on non-equilibrium dynamics and highlight the importance and ubiquity of hierarchical organisation and non-equilibrium dynamics in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Exact Solution of Bipartite Fluctuations in One-Dimensional Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emergence of hydrodynamics in quantum many-body systems has recently garnered growing interest. The recent experiment of ultracold atoms [J. F. Wienand {\it et al.}, Nat. Phys. (2024), doi:10.1038/s41567-024-02611-z] studied emergent hydrodynamics in hard-core bosons using a bipartite fluctuation, which quantifies how the particle number fluctuates in a subsystem. In this Letter, we theoretically study the variance of a bipartite fluctuation in one-dimensional noninteracting fermionic dynamics starting from an alternating state, deriving the exact solution of the variance and its asymptotic linear growth law for the long-time dynamics. To compare the theoretical prediction with the experiment, we generalize our exact solution by incorporating the incompleteness of the initial alternating state, deriving the general linear growth law analytically. We find that it shows good agreement with the experimentally observed variance growth without any fitting parameters. Furthermore, we estimate a time scale for the local equilibration using our exact solution, finding that the time scale is independent of the initial incompleteness. To investigate the interaction effect, we implement numerical studies for the variance growth in interacting fermions, which has yet to be explored experimentally. As a result, we find that the presence of interactions breaks the linear variance growth derived in the noninteracting fermions. Our exact solutions and numerical findings here lay a foundation for growing bipartite fluctuations in quantum many-body dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We show that the information loss at the cosmological apparent horizon in an expanding universe does not obey Landauer's principle for efficient information erasure. This is in contrast to what happens for black holes, where the principle is upheld exactly. We discuss about the implications this result provides for the differences between information loss at black holes and that at the cosmological apparent horizon, which we term the "Cosmological Information Paradox". We also discuss how this result may point towards incompleteness of quasi-local descriptions of energy and could also point towards different thermodynamic settings in gravitational systems and how information thermodynamics as we know it may have limits to its applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of locally generating unitary designs, which capture statistical notions of quantum pseudorandomness, lies at the heart of wide-ranging areas in physics and quantum information technologies. While there are extensive potent methods and results for this problem, the evidently important setting where continuous symmetries or conservation laws (most notably U(1) and SU(d)) are involved is known to present fundamental difficulties. In particular, even the basic question of whether any local symmetric circuit can generate 2-designs efficiently (in time that grows at most polynomially in the system size) remains open with no circuit constructions provably known to do so, despite intensive efforts. In this work, we resolve this long-standing open problem for both U(1) and SU(d) symmetries by explicitly constructing local symmetric quantum circuits which we prove to converge to symmetric unitary 2-designs in polynomial time using a combination of representation theory, graph theory, and Markov chain methods. As a direct application, our constructions can be used to efficiently generate near-optimal covariant quantum error-correcting codes, confirming a conjecture in [PRX Quantum 3, 020314 (2022)].</description>

      <title>Fluctuations in Various Regimes of Non-Hermiticity and a Holographic Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the variance of both smooth linear statistics and rough linear statistics (counting statistics) of random normal matrices. The two classical ensembles of random matrices, the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) and the complex Ginibre ensemble, enjoy an exact map to the ground state of noninteracting Fermions in a harmonic trap in one, respectively two dimensions. Both feature that the variance of the number of Fermions (the number variance) in a set $A$, and the respective entanglement entropy are proportional. For the Ginibre ensemble this statement about the entropy was known for radial symmetric sets $A$, and we prove it in generality for subsets $A$ of the bulk, thus establishing a holographic principle. Moreover, for generic random normal matrix ensembles depending on some potential $V$, not necessarily exhibiting radial symmetry, we show that for large matrix size $n$ the number variance is proportional to the circumference of $A$, $\sim\sqrt{n}|\partial A|$. A special focus is on the variance of linear statistics of the elliptic Ginibre ensemble, which interpolates between the GUE and Ginibre ensemble, in various regimes of non-Hermiticity, where we enlarge the concept of weak non-Hermiticity to mesoscopic scales. Within the elliptic Ginibre ensemble we prove that for smooth test functions $f$ its variance interpolates between that of the GUE and Ginibre ensemble. The interpolation depends on two positive parameters, the rescaling $\alpha$ of the weak non-Hermiticity parameter $\tau=1-\kappa n^{-\alpha}$, and the rescaling $\gamma$ of the test function $f(n^\gamma z)$, for a continuous range of values of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$. In the mesoscopic regime and when $\alpha=\gamma&lt;1$, we prove an interpolating central limit theorem with an adaptation of the method of Ward identities.</description>

      <title>Selection rules for RG flows of minimal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimal d=2 CFTs are usually classified through modular invariant partition functions. There is a finer classification of ``non complete'' models when S-duality is not imposed. We approach this classification by starting with the local chiral algebra and adding primaries sequentially. At each step, we only impose locality (T-duality) and closure of the operator algebra. For each chiral algebra, this produces a tree-like graph. Each tree node corresponds to a local d=2 CFT, with an intrinsic Jones index measuring the size of Haag duality violation. This index can be computed with the partition function and is related to the total quantum dimension of the category of superselection sectors of the node, and to the relative size between the node and a modular invariant completion. In this way, we find in a very explicit manner a classification of local minimal (c&lt;1) d=2 CFTs. When appropriate, this matches Kawahigashi-Longo's previous results. We use this finer classification to constrain RG flows. For a relevant perturbation, the flow can be restricted to the subalgebra associated with it, typically corresponding to a non-modular invariant node in the tree. The structure of the graph above such node needs to be preserved by the RG flow. In particular, the superselection sector category for the node must be preserved. This gives selection rules that recover in a unified fashion several known facts while unraveling new ones.</description>
