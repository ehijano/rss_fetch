      <title>Canonical torus action on symplectic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of an algebraic torus of dimension $r \geq 1$, which is canonical. In particular, it admits a good $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This proves Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form.
  Our key idea is to relate Donaldson-Sun theory on local Kahler metrics in complex differential geometry to the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties. We also prove results on the local behaviour of (singular) hyperKahler metrics. For instance, we show that the singular hyperKahler metric of any smoothable projective symplectic variety around isolated singularity is close to a Riemannian cone in a polynomial order.
  Most of our results also work for symplectic singularities on hyperKahler quotients under some conditions.</description>

      <title>Simplification of exponential factors of irregular connections on $\mathbb P^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit algorithm to reduce the ramification order of any exponential factor of an irregular connection on $\mathbb P^1$, using the same types of basic operations as in the Katz-Deligne-Arinkin algorithm for rigid irregular connections. The exponential factor reached when the algorithm terminates is, up to admissible deformations, the unique factor with minimal ramification order in the orbit of the initial factor under successive applications of basic operations. Furthermore, we show that for every even integer $n\geq 0$, there is up to admissible deformations a finite number of non-simplifiable exponential factors at infinity such that the corresponding elementary wild character variety has complex dimension $n$, which conjecturally implies that there is a finite number of isomorphism classes of elementary wild character varieties in any dimension. These results can be viewed as saying that the set of all possible level data of exponential factors has the structure of a disjoint union of an infinite number of infinite rooted trees, each tree being associated to a given dimension $n$ and with a finite number of trees for each $n$. In particular, in dimension 2 there is a unique tree, corresponding to the Painlev\'e I moduli space.</description>

Abstract: We exhibit a simple uniruledness criterion for general orthogonal modular varieties in terms of invariants of the corresponding lattice. As an application, we obtain the uniruledness of almost all Nikulin--Vinberg moduli spaces parameterizing projective K3 surfaces of Picard number at least 3 and fixed finite automorphism group.</description>

      <title>Some reducible and irreducible Brill-Noether loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate limit linear series on chains of elliptic curves, giving a simple proof of a conjecture of Farkas stating the existence of curves with a theta-characteristic with a given number of sections for the expected range of genera. Using the additional structure afforded by considering limit linear series on chains of elliptic curves, we find examples of reducible Brill-Noether loci, admitting at least two components, with and without a theta-characteristic respectively. This allows us to display reducible Hilbert schemes for $r\ge 3$ and the largest possible value of $d$, namely $d=g-1$. We also give examples of Brill-Noether loci with three components. On the positive side, we provide optimal bounds on the degree under which Brill-Noether loci are irreducible when $r=2$.</description>

      <title>Log-Concavity of the Grothendieck Classes of Banana Graphs and Clasped Necklaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Grothendieck classes of melonic graphs satisfy a recursive relation and may be written as polynomials in the class of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{0,4}$ with nonnegative integer coefficients, conjectured to be log-concave. In this article, we investigate log-concavity and ultra-log-concavity for the Grothendieck class of banana graphs and the three families of polynomials involved in the recursive relation. We prove that all four are log-concave, establishing the specific case of banana graphs for the log-concavity conjecture. We additionally introduce the infinite family of clasped necklaces, melonic graphs obtained by replacing an edge of a $2$-banana with a string of $m$-bananas. Using the recursive relation, we explicitly compute the classes of clasped necklaces and prove that they too are log-concave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a smooth affine algebraic group $G$ over an algebraically closed field, we consider several two-variables generalizations of the affine Grassmannian $G(\!(t)\!)/G[\![t]\!]$, given by quotients of the double loop group $G(\!(x)\!)(\!(y)\!)$. We prove that they are representable by ind-schemes if $G$ is solvable. Given a smooth surface $X$ and a flag of subschemes of $X$, we provide a geometric interpretation of the two-variables Grassmannians, in terms of bundles and trivialisation data defined on appropriate loci in $X$, which depend on the flag.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Grothendieck constructed a Cousin complex for abelian sheaves on an arbitrary topological space. In a special setting, its dual called the BGG resolution is applicable in representation theory. Arkhipov proposed a complex whose dual is only suitable for representation theory of quantum groups at roots of unity of prime order. It is desirable to get one which works for quantum groups at all roots of unity. For a quantum projective space, we provide such a complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We precisely uniform 3 theories that are widely used for symplectic geometers: (Almost) modules over Novikov ring, Persistence module, and Tamarkin category. Along with our method, we also give a neat understanding and language for the related results, in particular, Vaintrob's Novikov/log-perfectoid mirror symmetry for Novikov toric varieties. The results of this paper can also be treated as a study of persistent homology from a higher algebra point of view. Some of our results are shown in the literature, but our method is higher-categorical and sophisticated.
  As applications, we discuss a Novikov ring coefficient homological mirror symmetry for toric varieties and propose a conjecture for Novikov ring coefficient homological mirror symmetry for log Calabi-Yau varieties.</description>

      <title>Pinwheels in symplectic rational and ruled surfaces and non-squeezing of rational homology balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use almost toric fibrations and the symplectic rational blow-up to determine when certain Lagrangian pinwheels, which we call liminal, embed in symplectic rational and ruled surfaces. The case of $L_{2,1}$-pinwheels, namely Lagrangian $\mathbb{R}P^2$'s, answers a question of Kronheimer in the negative, exhibiting a symplectic non-spin $4$-manifold that does not carry a Lagrangian $\mathbb{R}P^2$. In addition, we provide applications to symplectic embeddings of rational homology balls. In particular, we generalize Gromov's classical non-squeezing theorem by proving that a rational homology ball $B_{n,1}(1)$ embeds into the rational homology cylinder $B_{n,1}(\alpha,\infty)$ if and only if $\alpha\geq 1$. Along the way, we prove various properties of Lagrangian pinwheels of independent interest, such as describing their homological complement, providing a short proof that performing a symplectic rational blow-up of a Lagrangian pinwheel in a positive symplectic rational manifold yields a symplectic manifold which is also rational, and showing a self-intersection formula for Lagrangian pinwheels.</description>

      <title>Refined BPS numbers on compact Calabi-Yau 3-folds from Wilson loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We relate the counting of refined BPS numbers on compact elliptically fibred Calabi-Yau 3-folds $X$ to Wilson loop expectations values in the gauge theories that emerge in various rigid local limits of the 5d supergravity theory defined by M-theory compactification on $X$. In these local limits $X_*$ the volumes of curves in certain classes go to infinity, the corresponding very massive M2-brane states can be treated as Wilson loop particles and the refined topological string partition function on $X$ becomes a sum of terms proportional to associated refined Wilson loop expectation values. The resulting ansatz for the complete refined topological partition function on $X$ is written in terms of the proportionality coefficients which depend only on the $\epsilon$ deformations and the Wilson loop expectations values which satisfy holomorphic anomaly equations. Since the ansatz is quite restrictive and can be further constrained by the one-form symmetries and E-string type limits for large base curves, we can efficiently evaluate the refined BPS numbers on $X$, which we do explicitly for local gauge groups up to rank three and $h_{11}(X)=5$. These refined BPS numbers pass an impressive number of consistency checks imposed by the direct counting of these numbers using the moduli space of one dimensional stable sheaves on $X$ and give us numerical predictions for the complex structure dependency of the refined BPS numbers.</description>

      <title>Counting $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ connections on Seifert-fibered spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ character variety of a Seifert-fibered homology $3$-sphere from the point of view of gauge theory. Namely, we introduce a class of perturbations of the $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern--Simons functional and prove a localisation result: the perturbed critical points either approach a compact subset of the $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ character variety or else `escape to infinity'. Furthermore, the Euler characteristic and Poincar\'e polynomial of the stable locus of the character variety are obtained by suitably counting the localising critical points.
  As an application, we obtain formulae for the Euler characteristic and Poincar\'e polynomial of the stable locus of the $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ character variety of a Seifert-fibered homology $3$-sphere. In particular, we prove that the Euler characteristic equals the Milnor number (divided by four) of any weighted-homogeneous isolated complete intersection singularity whose link is the given $3$-manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the notions of Newton non-degenerate (NND) ideals and Newton polyhedra for regular local rings. These concepts were first defined in the context of complex analysis. We show that the characterization of NND ideals via their integral closures known in the analytical setting extends to regular local rings. We use the limiting body $\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{I})$ associated to a graded family $\mathcal{I}$ of ideals to provide a new understanding of the celebrated "Multiplicity $=$ Volume" formula. Particularly, we prove that, for a Noetherian graded family $\mathcal{I}$ of $\mathfrak{m}$-primary ideals in a regular local ring $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ of dimension $d$, the equality $$e(\mathcal{I}) = d!\text{co-vol}_d(\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{I}))$$ holds if and only if $\mathcal{I}$ contains certain subfamily of NND ideals.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of the diagonal, intermediate Jacobians, and universal codimension-2 cycles in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.07470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the connections among algebraic cycles, abelian varieties, and stable rationality of smooth projective varieties in positive characteristic. Recently Voisin constructed two new obstructions to stable rationality for rationally connected complex projective threefolds by giving necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a cohomological decomposition of the diagonal. In this paper, we show how to extend these obstructions to rationally chain connected threefolds in positive characteristic via ell-adic cohomological decomposition of the diagonal. This requires extending results in Hodge theory regarding intermediate Jacobians and Abel--Jacobi maps to the setting of algebraic representatives. For instance, we show that the algebraic representative for codimension-two cycle classes on a geometrically stably rational threefold admits a canonical auto-duality, which in characteristic zero agrees with the principal polarization on the intermediate Jacobian coming from Hodge theory. As an application, we extend a result of Voisin, and show that in characteristic greater than two, a desingularization of a very general quartic double solid with seven nodes fails one of these two new obstructions, while satisfying all of the classical obstructions. More precisely, it does not admit a universal codimension-two cycle class. In the process, we establish some results on the moduli space of nodal degree-four polarized K3 surfaces in positive characteristic.</description>

Abstract: I discuss mirrors of Landau-Ginzburg models formed by a minimal semisimple adjoint orbit of $\mathfrak{sl}(n)$ together with a potential obtained via the Cartan-Killing form. I show that the Landau-Ginzburg models produced by the Gross-Siebert recipe give precisely the objects of the desired mirrors.
  It is known that Landau-Ginzburg model $LG(2)$ over the semisimple adjoint orbit of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ does not have projective mirrors. I prove Homological Mirror Symmetry for $LG(2)$ by constructing a Landau-Ginzburg mirror and showing that its Orlov category of singularities is equivalent to $Fuk(LG(2))$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a sequel of our previous work, arXiv:2209.09686, on the development of derived contact geometry, in which we formally introduced shifted contact structures on derived stacks and proved some results for $k$-shifted contact derived schemes, with $k&lt;0$. In this paper, we extend these results from derived schemes to derived Artin stacks. In brief, we first show that for $k&lt;0$, every $k$-shifted contact derived Artin stack admits a contact Darboux atlas. Secondly, we canonically describe the symplectification of a derived Artin stack equipped with a $k$-shifted contact structure, where $k&lt;0$. Lastly, we give several constructions of contact derived stacks using certain cotangent stacks and shifted prequantization structures.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ceresa cycle is an algebraic 1-cycle on the Jacobian of an algebraic curve. Although it is homologically trivial, Ceresa famously proved that for a very general complex curve of genus at least 3, it is non-trivial in the Chow group. In this paper we study the Ceresa cycle attached to the complete modular curve $X_{0}(N)$ modulo rational equivalence. For prime level $p$ we give a complete description, namely we prove that if $X_{0}(p)$ is not hyperelliptic, then its Ceresa cycle is non-torsion. For general level $N$, we prove that there are finitely many $X_{0}(N)$ with torsion Ceresa cycle. Our method relies on the relationship between the vanishing of the Ceresa cycle and Chow-Heegner points on the Jacobian. We use the geometry and arithmetic of modular Jacobians to prove that such points are of infinite order and therefore deduce non-vanishing of the Ceresa cycle.</description>

      <title>If Terao's conjecture fails in $\mathbb{P}^{2}$, then it fails in $\mathbb{P}^{n &gt; 2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an elementary technique, we construct a first example of Ziegler pairs of hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{P}^{3}$. Then, using this construction, we show how to obtain possible counterexamples to Terao's freeness conjecture in $\mathbb{P}^{n}$ with $n&gt;2$ using arrangements of lines in $\mathbb{P}^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Duality for Supermanifolds, Higher Cartan Structures and Geometric Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study relative differential and integral forms on families of supermanifolds and investigate their cohomology. In particular, we establish a relative version of Poincar\'e-Verdier duality, relating the cohomology of differential and integral forms, and provide a concrete interpretation via Berezin fiber integration, which we introduce. To complement Poincar\'e duality, we prove compactly supported Poincar\'e lemmas for both differential and integral forms, filling a gap in the literature. We then apply our results to the mathematical foundations of supergravity. Specifically, we rigorously define picture-changing operators via relative Poincar\'e duality and use them to formulate a general action principle for geometric supergravity in a mathematically rigorous manner. As an example, we explicitly describe three-dimensional supergravity via higher Cartan structures, which are defined by certain classes of connections valued in $L_\infty$-superalgebras. Our construction provides a unified framework interpolating between two equivalent formulations of supergravity in the physics literature: the superspace approach and the group manifold approach.</description>

      <title>Simplicial complexes and matroids with vanishing $T^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quotients by radical monomial ideals for which $T^2$, the second cotangent cohomology module, vanishes. The dimension of the graded components of $T^2$, and thus their vanishing, depends only on the combinatorics of the corresponding simplicial complex. We give both a complete characterization and a full list of one dimensional complexes with $T^2=0$. We characterize the graded components of $T^2$ when the simplicial complex is a uniform matroid. Finally, we show that $T^2$ vanishes for all matroids of corank at most two and conjecture that all connected matroids with vanishing $T^2$ are of corank at most two.</description>

      <title>The positive orthogonal Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pl\"ucker positive region $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,2k)$ of the orthogonal Grassmannian emerged as the positive geometry behind the ABJM scattering amplitudes. In this paper we initiate the study of the positive orthogonal Grassmannian $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,n)$ for general values of $k,n$. We determine the boundary structure of the quadric $\mathrm{OGr}_+(1,n)$ in $\mathbb{P}^{n-1}_{+}$ and show that it is a positive geometry. We show that $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,2k+1)$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k+1, 2k+2)$ and connect its combinatorial structure to matchings on $[2k+2]$. Finally, we show that in the case $n&gt;2k+1$, the \emph{positroid cells} of $\mathrm{Gr}_+(k,n)$ do not induce a CW cell decomposition of $\mathrm{OGr}_+(k,n)$.</description>

      <title>Nonsmooth Calabi-Yau structures for algebras and coalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that generalised Calabi-Yau dg (co)algebras are Koszul dual to generalised symmetric dg (co)algebras, without needing to assume any smoothness or properness hypotheses. Similarly, we show that Gorenstein and Frobenius are Koszul dual properties. As an application, we give a new characterisation of Poincar\'e duality spaces, which extends a theorem of F\'elix- Halperin-Thomas to the non-simply connected setting.</description>
