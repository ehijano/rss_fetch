      <title>Taking the Leap: Efficient and Reliable Fine-Grained NUMA Migration in User-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern multi-socket architectures offer a single virtual address space, but physically divide main-memory across multiple regions, where each region is attached to a CPU and its cores. While this simplifies the usage, developers must be aware of non-uniform memory access (NUMA), where an access by a thread running on a core-local NUMA region is significantly cheaper than an access from a core-remote region. Obviously, if query answering is parallelized across the cores of multiple regions, then the portion of the database on which the query is operating should be distributed across the same regions to ensure local accesses. As the present data placement might not fit this, migrating pages from one NUMA region to another can be performed to improve the situation. To do so, different options exist: One option is to rely on automatic NUMA balancing integrated in Linux, which is steered by the observed access patterns and frequency. Another option is to actively trigger migration via the system call move_pages(). Unfortunately, both variants have significant downsides in terms of their feature set and performance. As an alternative, we propose a new user-space migration method called page_leap() that can perform page migration asynchronously at a high performance by exploiting features of the virtual memory subsystem. The method is (a) actively triggered by the user, (b) ensures that all pages are eventually migrated, (c) handles concurrent writes correctly, (d) supports pooled memory, (e) adaptively adjusts its migration granularity based on the workload, and (f) supports both small pages and huge pages.</description>

      <title>ProphetKV: User-Query-Driven Selective Recomputation for Efficient KV Cache Reuse in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The prefill stage of long-context Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is severely bottlenecked by computational overhead. To mitigate this, recent methods assemble pre-calculated KV caches of retrieved RAG documents (by a user query) and reprocess selected tokens to recover cross-attention between these pre-calculated KV caches. However, we identify a fundamental "crowding-out effect" in current token selection criteria: globally salient but user-query-irrelevant tokens saturate the limited recomputation budget, displacing the tokens truly essential for answering the user query and degrading inference accuracy.
  We propose ProphetKV, a user-query-driven KV Cache reuse method for RAG scenarios. ProphetKV dynamically prioritizes tokens based on their semantic relevance to the user query and employs a dual-stage recomputation pipeline to fuse layer-wise attention metrics into a high-utility set. By ensuring the recomputation budget is dedicated to bridging the informational gap between retrieved context and the user query, ProphetKV achieves high-fidelity attention recovery with minimal overhead. Our extensive evaluation results show that ProphetKV retains 96%-101% of full-prefill accuracy with only a 20% recomputation ratio, while achieving accuracy improvements of 8.8%-24.9% on RULER and 18.6%-50.9% on LongBench over the state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., CacheBlend, EPIC, and KVShare).</description>

      <title>Horizon-LM: A RAM-Centric Architecture for LLM Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the evolution of single-GPU hardware, making model scale increasingly constrained by memory capacity rather than computation. While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain a GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As a result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multi-GPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, a memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for large-model optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through a CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing a pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint. On a single H200 GPU with 1.5\,TB host RAM, Horizon-LM reliably trains models up to 120B parameters. On a standard single A100 machine, Horizon-LM achieves up to 12.2$\times$ higher training throughput than DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 with CPU offloading while preserving numerical correctness. Across platforms and scales, Horizon-LM sustains high device utilization and predictable memory growth, demonstrating that host memory, not GPU memory, defines the true feasibility boundary for node-scale large-model training.</description>
