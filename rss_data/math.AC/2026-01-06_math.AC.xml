      <title>Toward a unified theory for common affine roots of general sets of multivariate polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For univariate polynomials over arbitrary field the degree gives an upper bound on the number of roots (factor theorem) and as a related result for any finite point-set one can construct a polynomial of degree equal to the cardinality having all the points as roots (interpolation theorem). Terence Tao noted in [39] that the theory of multivariate polynomials is not yet sufficiently matured to provide similar theorems with an equally simple relation between them. In the present paper we argue that for general multivariate polynomials the right measure for the size of the polynomial should not be the degree, but the leading monomial. In this setting the footprint bound [23] becomes a natural enhancement of the factor theorem providing a bound on the number of common roots of general multivariate polynomials which is sharp for all finite Cartesian product point sets. Furthermore, by using methods from the theory of error-correcting codes we establish a natural formulation of the interpolation theorem to the case of common roots of multivariate polynomials. In short the two theorems reduce to the same result, but for dual spaces, establishing the unification requested in [39]. We leave it for further research to possibly establish similar related results taking multiplicity into account.</description>

      <title>Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of generalized binomial edge ideals of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the generalized binomial edge ideals of graphs. We show that this number can be any integer number from $2$ to $n-1$ where $n$ is the number of vertices in the underlying graph. We are able to show this, after giving some tight lower and upper bounds for the regularity of generalized binomial edge ideals of the join product of graphs. In particular, we characterize all generalized binomial edge ideals with the regularity equal to~$2$ as well as extremal Gorenstein ideals. For this purpose, we give a new combinatorial characterization for the class of $P_4$-free graphs.</description>

      <title>The existence of valuative interpolation at a singular point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper studies the existence of valuative interpolation on the local ring of an irreducible analytic subvariety at singular points. We firstly develop the concepts and methods of Zhou weights and Tian functions near singular points of irreducible analytic subvarieties. By applying these tools, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of valuative interpolations on the rings of germs of holomorphic functions and weakly holomorphic functions at a singular point.
  As applications, we characterize the existence of valuative interpolations on the quotient ring of the ring of convergent power series in real variables. We also present separated necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of valuative interpolations on the quotient ring of polynomial rings with complex coefficients and real coefficients. Furthermore, we show that the conditions become both necessary and sufficient under certain conditions on the zero set of the given polynomials.</description>

      <title>Nontrivial vector bundles with trivial Chern classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let ${\mathbb F}_0$ be an algebraically closed field, with $char({\mathbb F}_0)=0$. In this article, for prime numbers $p\geq 2$, we construct smooth affine algebras $B$ over ${\mathbb F}_0$, with $\dim B=p+2$. Further, we construct projective $B$-modules $Q$ with $rank(Q)=p$, such that $x=[Q] -[B^p]\neq 0$ in $K_0(B)$ and the total Chern class $C(Q)=1+\sum_{i=1}^{p}C^k(Q) =1$ is trivial. We use the splitting theorem in \cite{ABH} that for projective $B$-modules $P$ with $rank(P)=r=\dim B-1$, vanishing $C^r(P)=0 \Longrightarrow P\cong Q\oplus B$.</description>

      <title>A special subring of the Nagata ring and the Serre's conjecture ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08758v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many ring theorists researched various properties of Nagata rings and Serre's conjecture rings. In this paper, we introduce a subring (refer to the Anderson ring) of both the Nagata ring and the Serre's conjecture ring (up to isomorphism), and investigate properties of the Anderson ring. Additionally, we compare the properties of the Anderson ring with those of the Nagata ring and the Serre's conjecture ring.</description>

      <title>New versions of Frobenius and integral closure of ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we define three new operations on ideals which generalize integral closure and Frobenius closure of ideals, whose definitions incorporate an auxiliary ideal and a real parameter. These additional ingredients are common in adjusting old definitions of ideal closures in order to generalize them to pairs, with an eye towards further applications in algebraic geometry. In the case of tight closure, similar generalizations exist due to N. Hara and K.I. Yoshida, as well as A. Vraciu, and in the case of Frobenius closure, to K. Schwede. We study their basic properties and give computationally effective calculations of the adjusted tight, Frobenius, and integral closures in the case of affine semigroup rings in terms of the convex geometry of the associated exponent sets. Finally, as applications, we study submodules of the fraction field of a domain defined in terms of our adjusted closures and an $F$-nilpotent property for pairs.</description>

      <title>Fields of Fractions in Rigid Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an affinoid integral domain over a non-Archimedean field $K$, and let $L$ be its field of fractions. We prove that the normalization of $A$ can be reconstructed from $L$ by taking the intersection of all maximal discrete valuation subrings. As a corollary, taking the field of fractions induces a fully faithful functor from the category of normal affinoid integral domains over $K$ to the category of field extensions of $K$. This provides another $p$-adic analogue of the Riemann Hebbarkeitssatz.</description>

      <title>On the arithmetic and geometry of spaces $L_{m+1,n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. Motivated by the local lifting problem for $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^n$ with $n&gt;1$, we prove several new results on certain $\mathbb{F}_p$-vector spaces of logarithmic differential forms on the projective line in characteristic $p$, called "spaces $L_{m+1,n}$". Expanding the previous work by the first two authors, we prove positive and negative results for the existence of spaces $L_{m+1,n}$ in many situations. Moreover, we classify all spaces $L_{4p,2}$ for any $p$, and all spaces $L_{15,2}$ for $p=3$. Among the novel tools we use, Moore determinants and computational algebra play a prominent role.</description>

      <title>Code Equivalence, Point Set Equivalence, and Polynomial Isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear code equivalence (LCE) problem is shown to be equivalent to the point set equivalence (PSE) problem, i.e., the problem to check whether two sets of points in a projective space over a finite field differ by a linear change of coordinates. For such a point set $\mathbb{X}$, let $R$ be its homogeneous coordinate ring and $\mathfrak{J}_{\mathbb{X}}$ its canonical ideal. Then the LCE problem is shown to be equivalent to an algebra isomorphism problem for the doubling $R/\mathfrak{J}_{\mathbb{X}}$. As this doubling is an Artinian Gorenstein algebra, we can use its Macaulay inverse system to reduce the LCE problem to a Polynomial Isomorphism (PI) problem for homogeneous polynomials. The last step is polynomial time under some mild assumptions about the codes. Moreover, for indecomposable iso-dual codes we can reduce the LCE search problem to the PI search problem of degree 3 by noting that the corresponding point sets are self-associated and arithmetically Gorenstein, so that we can use the isomorphism problem for the Artinian reductions of the coordinate rings and form their Macaulay inverse systems.</description>
