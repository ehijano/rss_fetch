      <title>Understanding and Modeling the Dynamics of Storm-time Atmospheric Neutral Density using Random Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric neutral density is a crucial component to accurately predict and track the motion of satellites. During periods of elevated solar and geomagnetic activity atmospheric neutral density becomes highly variable and dynamic. This variability and enhanced dynamics make it difficult to accurately model neutral density leading to increased errors which propagate from neutral density models through to orbit propagation models. In this paper we investigate the dynamics of neutral density during geomagnetic storms. We use a combination of solar and geomagnetic variables to develop three Random Forest machine learning models of neutral density. These models are based on (1) slow solar indices, (2) high cadence solar irradiance, and (3) combined high-cadence solar irradiance and geomagnetic indices. Each model is validated using an out-of-sample dataset using analysis of residuals and typical metrics. During quiet-times, all three models perform well; however, during geomagnetic storms, the combined high cadence solar irradiance/geomagnetic model performs significantly better than the models based solely on solar activity. The combined model capturing an additional 10\% in the variability of density and having an error up to six times smaller during geomagnetic storms then the solar models. Overall, this work demonstrates the importance of including geomagnetic activity in the modeling of atmospheric density and serves as a proof of concept for using machine learning algorithms to model, and in the future forecast atmospheric density for operational use.</description>

      <title>Medium-scale thermospheric gravity waves in the high-resolution Whole Atmosphere Model: Seasonal, local time, and longitudinal variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the global medium-scale (scales&lt;620 km) gravity wave (GW) activity (in terms of zonal wind variance) and its seasonal, local time and longitudinal variations by employing the enhanced-resolution (~50 km) Whole Atmosphere Model (WAMT254) and space-based observations for geomagnetically quiet conditions. It is found that the GW hotspots produced by WAMT254 in the troposphere and stratosphere agree well with previously well-studied orographic and non-orographic sources. In the ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) region, GWs spread out forming latitudinal band-like hotspots. During solstices, a primary maximum in GW activity is observed in WAMT254 and GOCE over winter mid-high latitudes, likely associated with higher-order waves with primary sources in polar night jet, fronts and polar vortex. During all the seasons, the enhancement of GWs around the geomagnetic poles as observed by GOCE (at ~250 km) is well captured by simulations. WAMT254 GWs in the IT region also show dependence on local time due to their interaction with migrating tides leading to diurnal and semidiurnal variations. The GWs are more likely to propagate up from the MLT region during westward/weakly-eastward phase of thermospheric tides, signifying the dominance of eastward GW momentum flux in the MLT. Additionally, as a novel finding, a wavenumber-4 signature in GW activity is predicted by WAMT254 between 6-12 LT in the tropics at ~250 km, which propagates eastward with local time. This behavior is likely associated with the modulation of GWs by wave-4 signal of non-migrating tides in the lower thermospheric zonal winds.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the actuation system of the inertial sensor for high-precision space missions using torsion pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision space inertial sensors are imperative to Earth geodesy missions, gravitational wave observations and several fundamental physics experiments in space. In these missions, the residual acceleration noise of the test mass(TM) caused by the forces from inertial sensor components and environment is supposed to be kept below a certain level. As a number of forces contributing to residual acceleration are related to actuation system, developing a precise actuation system to exclude any erroneous force and obtain an ultra sensitive value for TM acceleration noise is necessary and essential. However, it is difficult to test the actuation system on ground. In this paper, a torsion pendulum is established to test the influence of actuation system on TM torque noise and a closed-loop control system combined torsion pendulum and parts of actuation modules is designed to assess the performance of actuation control algorithm. The experimental results show that the parameters in an actuation system will introduce additional torque noise and the maximum noise can reach as much as 10^{-13}Nm /Hz^{1/2} at 1 mHz. The stable tracking error for the closed-loop system is about 10^{-7}, indicating that the combination system achieves good tracking performance and robustness for TM rotation control in different conditions of inertial sensors.</description>

      <title>Identification of coupled Landau and anomalous resonances in space plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave-particle resonance, a ubiquitous process in the plasma universe, occurs when resonant particles observe a constant wave phase to enable sustained energy transfer. Here, we present spacecraft observations of simultaneous Landau and anomalous resonances between oblique whistler waves and the same group of protons, which are evidenced, respectively, by phase-space rings in parallel-velocity spectra and phase-bunched distributions in gyro-phase spectra. Our results indicate the coupling between Landau and anomalous resonances via the overlapping of the resonance islands.</description>

      <title>Potential Flow Formulation of Parker's Unsteady Solar Wind Model and Nonlinear Stability Aspects Near the Parker Sonic Critical Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present the first ever systematic theoretical formulation addressing the long-standing open issue of regularization of the singularity associated with the Parker sonic critical point in the linear perturbation problem for Parker's unsteady solar wind model. This is predicated on the necessity to go outside the framework of the linear perturbation problem and incorporate the dominant nonlinearities in this dynamical system. This is accomplished by constructing a whole new theoretical formulation of Parker's unsteady solar wind model based on the potential flow theory in ideal gas dynamics, which provides an appropriate optimal theoretical framework for this purpose. The stability of Parker's steady solar wind solution is shown to extend also to the neighborhood of the Parker sonic critical point by going to the concomitant nonlinear problem.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Reflectarrays for Interplanetary Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interplanetary links (IPL) serve as crucial enablers for space exploration, facilitating secure and adaptable space missions. An integrated IPL with inter-satellite communication (IP-ISL) establishes a unified deep space network, expanding coverage and reducing atmospheric losses. The challenges, including irregularities in charged density, hardware impairments, and hidden celestial body brightness are analyzed with a reflectarray-based IP-ISL between Earth and Moon orbiters. It is observed that $10^{-8}$ order severe hardware impairments with intense solar plasma density drops an ideal system's spectral efficiency (SE) from $\sim\!38~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$ down to $0~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$. An ideal full angle of arrival fluctuation recovery with full steering range achieves $\sim\!20~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$ gain and a limited beamsteering with a numerical reflectarray design achieves at least $\sim\!1~\textrm{(bit/s)/Hz}$ gain in severe hardware impairment cases.</description>

      <title>The Black Hole Explorer: Preliminary Antenna Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the basic design of a large, light weight, spaceborne antenna for the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX) space Very Long Baseline Interferometry (space-VLBI) mission, achieving high efficiency operation at mm/sub-mm wavelengths. An introductory overview of the mission and its science background are provided. The BHEX mission targets fundamental black hole physics enabled by the detection of the finely structured image feature around black holes known as the photon ring, theoretically expected due to light orbiting the black hole before reaching the observer. Interferometer baselines much longer than an earth diameter are necessary to attain the spatial resolution required to detect the photon ring, leading to a space component. The science goals require high sensitivity observations at mm/sub-mm wavelengths, placing stringent constraints on antenna performance. The design approach described, seeks to balance the antenna aperture, volume and mass constraints of the NASA Explorers mission opportunity profile and the desired high performance. A 3.5 m aperture with a 40 $\mu$m surface rms is targeted. Currently, a symmetric, dual reflector, axially displaced ellipse (Gregorian ring focus) optical design and metallized carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) sandwich construction have been chosen to deliver high efficiency and light weight. Further exploration of design choices and parameter space and reflector shaping studies are in progress</description>
