      <title>The transformative capability of quantum-accurate machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many materials's properties and phase boundaries are generally not well known under extreme pressure and temperature conditions. This is a consequence of the scarcity of experimental information and the difficulty of extrapolating approximations to the atomic interactions in such conditions. Nguyen-Cong and colleagues, in their publication (J.Phys.Chem.Lett. 15, 1152 (2024)), achieved an impressive result using a SNAP (Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential), an interatomic potential for carbon obtained by machine learning techniques. In a way, their contribution closes a full circle of research that spanned more than three decades.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Simulation of Coupled Biochemical and Two-Phase Compositional Flow in Underground Hydrogen Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating microbial activity into underground hydrogen storage models is crucial for simulating long-term reservoir behavior. In this work, we present a coupled framework that incorporates bio-geochemical reactions and compositional flow models within the Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST). Microbial growth and decay are modeled using a double Monod formulation, with populations influenced by hydrogen and carbon dioxide availability. First, a refined Equation of State (EoS) is employed to accurately capture hydrogen dissolution, thereby improving phase behavior and modeling of microbial activity. The model is then discretized using a cell-centered finite-volume method with implicit Euler time discretization. A fully coupled fully implicit strategy is considered. Our implementation builds upon MRST's compositional module by incorporating the S{\o}reide-Whitson EoS, microbial reaction kinetics, and specific effects such as bio-clogging and molecular diffusion. Through a series of 1D, 2D and 3D simulations, we analyze the effects of microbial-induced bio-geochemical transformations on underground hydrogen storage in porous media.These results highlight that accounting for bio-geochemical effects can substantially impact hydrogen loss, purity, and overall storage performance.</description>

      <title>An efficient GPU-accelerated adaptive mesh refinement framework for high-fidelity compressible reactive flows modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a heterogeneous adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework for efficient simulation of moderately stiff reactive problems. This framework features an elaborate subcycling-in-time algorithm along with a specialized refluxing algorithm, all unified in a highly parallel codebase. We have also developed a low-storage variant of explicit chemical integrators by optimizing the register usage of GPU, achieving respectively 6x and 3x times speedups as compared to the implicit and standard explicit methods with comparable order of accuracy. A suite of benchmarks have confirmed the framework's fidelity for both non-reactive and reactive simulations with/without AMR. By leveraging our parallelization strategy that is developed on AMReX, we have demonstrated remarkable speedups on various problems on a NVIDIA V100 GPU than using a Intel i9 CPU within the same codebase; in problems with complex physics and spatiotemporally distributed stiffness such as the hydrogen detonation propagation, we have achieved an overall 6.49x acceleration ratio. The computation scalability of the framework is also validated through the weak scaling test, demonstrating excellent parallel efficiency across multiple GPU nodes. At last, a practical application of this GPU-accelerated SAMR framework to large-scale direct numerical simulations is demonstrated by successful simulation of the three-dimensional reactive shock-bubble interaction problem; we have saved significant computational costs while maintaining the comparable accuracy, as compared to a prior uniform DNS study performed on CPUs.</description>

      <title>An open-source finite element toolbox for anisotropic creep and irradiation growth: Application to tube and spacer grid assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an open-source interface that couples the viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) model capable of simulating anisotropic creep and irradiation growth in polycrystalline materials with the finite element solver Code_Aster. The interface enables the simulation of the micromechanical response of irradiated zirconium alloy components by integrating grain-level constitutive behavior into a structural FEM framework. A key feature is the automated rotation of stress and strain tensors between the global FEM frame and the local crystallographic axes, a transformation not natively supported by Code_Aster. The elastic strain is recovered analytically using the inverse of the self-consistently stiffness tensor provided by VPSC. As a demonstration, the framework is applied to an actual model of a pressurized water reactor (PWR) spacer grid, based on a patented design, capturing nonlinear contact and the anisotropic response of the cladding and grid. Simulations reveal the micromechanisms controlling the evolution of clearance between components and highlight the role of crystallographic texture in mitigating wear. In particular, a texture with a high fraction of prismatic planes oriented in the normal direction of the grid appears to be the most suitable for spacer design, as it minimizes clearance and contributes to wear resistance. The interface offers a flexible, extensible platform for high-fidelity simulations in nuclear fuel performance analysis.</description>

      <title>Accuracy and scalability of asynchronous compressible flow solver for transitional flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To overcome the communication bottlenecks observed in state-of-the-art parallel time-dependent flow solvers at extreme scales, an asynchronous computing approach that relaxes communication and synchronization at a mathematical level was previously developed. This approach preserves high-order accuracy of computations near processing element boundaries using asynchrony-tolerant (AT) schemes while significantly improving the scalability. The numerical properties of the AT schemes were studied based on simple linear and nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in previous works. Allowing asynchrony in numerical schemes can minimize communication overheads in a parallel setting in two ways: one that avoids communication over a few predetermined time steps, and the other that initiates communications without enforcing synchronization. In this study, the asynchronous algorithms are incorporated into the high-order compressible flow solver COMP-SQUARE, which solves practically relevant flow problems in complex geometries in a multi-block framework. The numerical efficacy and scalability of the two asynchronous algorithms are demonstrated for three test cases: isentropic advection of a vortex, the Taylor-Green vortex, and a much more sensitive case of the flow transitioning on a NACA0012 airfoil. Speed-ups of up to $4\times$ with respect to the baseline synchronous algorithm are observed in the scaling experiments performed on up to 18,432 cores. The results of this study demonstrate the applicability of AT schemes on established CFD solvers to improve scalability at extreme scales as the scientific computing environment moves to the exascale era.</description>

      <title>NELM: Modern Open-Source Software for Multipurpose Impedance Spectra Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nowadays electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has become an advanced experimental technique with a wide range of applications: from simple passive circuits diagnostics to semiconductor high-end device development and breakthrough technologies in bio-sensing. Although hardware for EIS today is well developed, the EIS analysis software is mainly custom, old fashioned, i.e. it is limited by features, does not utilize the progress in the modern computer science and hardware, and is usually implemented in close-source code or written on outdated programming languages, which causes slow progress in field of the EIS and complicates researchers attempts of development in EIS autonomous devices, such as implants. In this article, we introduce a free and open-sourced MatLab/GNU Octave package for EIS analysis called NELM, which provides powerful equipment tools for matching experimental impedance data with theoretical equivalent circuits. Our software has an user friendly interface and supports different formats of input data, fitting programs, and impedance models. In addition, we have developed NELM with implementation of the latest progress in computation science such as symbolic calculations, parallel computing, and artificial intelligence. The abilities of NELM were validated by its applications in the different fields of science, such as semiconductor studies, bioimpedance and electrochemestry, which demonstrated high-efficiency of the proposed software package and showed that it is a promising tool for solving actual problems in electronic industry, biosensorics, and healthcare technologies.</description>

      <title>Sorcha: Optimized Solar System Ephemeris Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sorcha is a solar system survey simulator built for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and future large-scale wide-field surveys. Over the ten-year survey, the LSST is expected to collect roughly a billion observations of minor planets. The task of a solar system survey simulator is to take a set of input objects (described by orbits and physical properties) and determine what a real or hypothetical survey would have discovered. Existing survey simulators have a computational bottleneck in determining which input objects lie in each survey field, making them infeasible for LSST data scales. Sorcha can swiftly, efficiently, and accurately calculate the on-sky positions for sets of millions of input orbits and surveys with millions of visits, identifying which exposures these objects cross, in order for later stages of the software to make detailed estimates of the apparent magnitude and detectability of those input small bodies. In this paper, we provide the full details of the algorithm and software behind Sorcha's ephemeris generator. Like many of Sorcha's components, its ephemeris generator can be easily used for other surveys.</description>

      <title>Inverse design for robust inference in integrated computational spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For computational spectrometers, we propose an inverse-design approach in which the scattering media are topology-optimized to achieve better performance in inference, without the need of a training set of spectra and a distribution of detector noise. Our approach also allows the selection of the inference algorithm to be decoupled from that of the scatterer. For smooth spectra, we additionally devise a regularized reconstruction algorithm based on Chebyshev interpolation, which yields higher accuracy compared with conventional methods in which the spectra are sampled at equally spaced frequencies/wavelengths with equal weights. Our approaches are numerically demonstrated via inverse design of integrated computational spectrometers and reconstruction of example spectra. The inverse-designed spectrometers exhibit significantly better performance in the presence of noise than their counterparts with random scatterers.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for dynamic evaporation of liquid in isothermal condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analytical solution based on a diffuse interface model is presented for an isothermal evaporation problem under sub-saturation pressure. The macroscopic equations are derived from the free-energy method, widely recognized in the lattice Boltzmann literature, distinguishing our approach from conventional evaporation models that rely on jump conditions or pure kinetic theory. The interface behavior is fully described by differential equations, eliminating the need for assumptions such as local equilibrium at the interface. We derive an exact analytical solution for the inviscid case and propose an approximate solution when viscosity effects are considered. Our model unveils a novel relationship between evaporation rate and viscosity, providing new insights that have not been thoroughly explored in the literature. The analytical results are validated through numerical simulations using the open-source parallel library OpenLB, demonstrating excellent agreement in predicting the physical behavior of the evaporation phenomena within the framework of diffuse interface methods.</description>

      <title>Particle-in-Cell Simulations of Burning ICF Capsule Implosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalies observed in the neutron spectral shift of high-yield shots at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) suggest the presence of suprathermal ions, implying that kinetic effects play a significant role in burning inertial confinement fusion (ICF) plasmas. Furthermore, recent measurements of reaction-in-flight (RIF) neutrons offer a direct probe of the stopping power in the burning fuel region of high energy alpha particles and up-scattered fuel ions. We have developed the particle-in-cell code PICNIC, an exactly energy-conserving particle-in-cell Monte-Carlo collision (PIC-MCC) code to simulate the burn stage in ICF. We present results from 1D spherical simulations of NIF shot N210808. We find that the suprathermal ions generated by large-angle Rutherford and nuclear elastic scattering (NES) with fusion alphas produce an alpha knock-on neutron (AKN) signal consistent with experiments. We also find that the inclusion of large-angle scattering physics does not explain the anomalously large spectral shift observed in experiment.</description>

      <title>Greedy recursion parameter selection for the One-Way Navier-Stokes (OWNS) equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The One-Way Navier-Stokes (OWNS) equations use recursive filtering to construct efficient, well-posed one-way approximations to linear hyperbolic systems. The recursion parameters are critical to the accuracy and stability of the method, and have previously been chosen based on heuristic estimates of key eigenvalues (or their branches), which converges slowly and requires trial-and-error tuning for new systems. We review the projection and recursive OWNS formulations (OWNS-P and OWNS-R) for inhomogeneous equations and propose a greedy algorithm for parameter selection. We show that it converges faster and leads to a net decrease in computational cost.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Probabilistic Dirichlet-to-Neumann Maps on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps enable the coupling of multiphysics simulations across computational subdomains by ensuring continuity of state variables and fluxes at artificial interfaces. We present a novel method for learning Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps on graphs using Gaussian processes, specifically for problems where the data obey a conservation constraint from an underlying partial differential equation. Our approach combines discrete exterior calculus and nonlinear optimal recovery to infer relationships between vertex and edge values. This framework yields data-driven predictions with uncertainty quantification across the entire graph, even when observations are limited to a subset of vertices and edges. By optimizing over the reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm while applying a maximum likelihood estimation penalty on kernel complexity, our method ensures that the resulting surrogate strictly enforces conservation laws without overfitting. We demonstrate our method on two representative applications: subsurface fracture networks and arterial blood flow. Our results show that the method maintains high accuracy and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates even under severe data scarcity, highlighting its potential for scientific applications where limited data and reliable uncertainty quantification are critical.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic local Gauss's law preserving PIC method: A self-consistent field-particle update scheme for plasma simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to perform physically faithful particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, the Gauss's law stands as a critical requirement, since its violation often leads to catastrophic errors in long-term plasma simulations. This work proposes a novel method that intrinsically enforces the Gauss's law for the Vlasov-Amp\`ere/Vlasov-Poisson system without requiring auxiliary field corrections or specialized current deposition techniques. The electric field is managed to get updated locally and consistently with the motion of particles via splitting the motion into sub-steps along each dimension of the computational mesh. To further obtain a curl-free electric field, a local update scheme is developed to relax the electric-field free energy subject to the Gauss's law. The proposed method avoids solving the Poisson's or Amp\`ere's equation, resulting in a local algorithm of linear complexity for each time step which can be flexibly combined with various temporal discretization for particle motion in PIC simulations. Theoretical analysis verifies that the proposed method indeed maintains the discrete Gauss's law exactly. Numerical tests on classical benchmarks, including the Landau damping, two-stream instability and Diocotron instability, demonstrate the key advantages of the proposed method. It is expected that the local nature of the proposed method makes it a promising tool in parallel simulations of large-scale plasmas.</description>

      <title>Bound excited states of Fr\"ohlich polarons in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional Fr\"ohlich model describing the motion of a single electron interacting with optical phonons is a paradigmatic model of quantum many-body physics. We predict the existence of an arbitrarily large number of bound excited states in the strong coupling limit and calculate their excitation energies. Numerical simulations of a discretized model demonstrate the complete amelioration of the projector Monte Carlo sign problem by walker annihilation in an infinite Hilbert space. They reveal the threshold for the occurrence of the first bound excited states at a value of $\alpha \approx 1.73$ for the dimensionless coupling constant. This puts the threshold into the regime of intermediate interaction strength. We calculate the spectral weight and the number density of the dressing cloud in the discretized model.</description>

      <title>Navigating Phase Transitions with Path-Finding Algorithms: A Strategic Approach to Replica Exchange Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The replica exchange method is a powerful tool for overcoming slow relaxation in molecular simulations, but its efficiency depends strongly on the choice of the number and interval of replicas and their exchange probabilities. Here, we propose a new optimization scheme based on the Dijkstra algorithm that constructs an optimal exchange path by representing replicas and their exchange probabilities as a graph. Inspired by path-finding techniques widely used in computer science, including applications in game algorithms, our approach ensures that transitions follow a minimum entropy gradient path and effectively speeds up sampling even in systems exhibiting slow relaxation near critical points or phase transition regions. The method provides a systematic way to improve replica exchange efficiency and offers new insights into the control of relaxation dynamics, as demonstrated through applications to the solid-liquid phase transition of the Lennard-Jones bulk system.</description>

      <title>Reentrant localization in a quasiperiodic chain with correlated hopping sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic systems are known to exhibit localization transitions in low dimensions, wherein all electronic states become localized beyond a critical disorder strength. Interestingly, recent studies have uncovered a reentrant localization (RL) phenomenon: upon further increasing the quasiperiodic disorder strength beyond the localization threshold, a subset of previously localized states can become delocalized again within a specific parameter window. While RL transitions have been primarily explored in systems with simple periodic modulations, such as dimerized or long-range hopping integrals, the impact of more intricate or correlated hopping structures on RL behavior remains largely elusive. In this work, we investigate the localization behavior in a one-dimensional lattice featuring staggered, correlated on-site potentials following the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper model, along with off-diagonal hopping modulations structured according to quasiperiodic Fibonacci and Bronze Mean sequences. By systematically analyzing the fractal dimension, inverse participation ratio, and normalized participation ratio, we demonstrate the occurrence of RL transitions induced purely by the interplay between quasiperiodic on-site disorder and correlated hopping. Our findings highlight the crucial role of underlying structural correlations in governing localization-delocalization transitions in low-dimensional quasiperiodic systems, where the correlated disorder manifests in both diagonal and off-diagonal terms.</description>

      <title>Exploring metrics for analyzing dynamic behavior in MPI programs via a coupled-oscillator model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel, lightweight, and physically inspired approach to modeling the dynamics of parallel distributed-memory programs. Inspired by the Kuramoto model, we represent MPI processes as coupled oscillators with topology-aware interactions, custom coupling potentials, and stochastic noise. The resulting system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations opens a path to modeling key performance phenomena of parallel programs, including synchronization, delay propagation and decay, bottlenecks, and self-desynchronization.
  This paper introduces interaction potentials to describe memory- and compute-bound workloads and employs multiple quantitative metrics -- such as an order parameter, synchronization entropy, phase gradients, and phase differences -- to evaluate phase coherence and disruption. We also investigate the role of local noise and show that moderate noise can accelerate resynchronization in scalable applications. Our simulations align qualitatively with MPI trace data, showing the potential of physics-informed abstractions to predict performance patterns, which offers a new perspective for performance modeling and software-hardware co-design in parallel computing.</description>

      <title>Convergence and efficiency proof of quantum imaginary time evolution for bounded order systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many current and near-future applications of quantum computing utilise parametric families of quantum circuits and variational methods to find optimal values for these parameters. Solving a quantum computational problem with such variational methods relies on minimising some cost function, e.g., the energy of a physical system. As such, this is similar to the training process in machine learning and variational quantum simulations can therefore suffer from similar problems encountered in machine learning training. This includes non-convergence to the global minimum due to local minima as well as critical slowing down. In this article, we analyse the imaginary time evolution as a means of compiling parametric quantum circuits and finding optimal parameters, and show that it guarantees convergence to the global minimum without critical slowing down. We also show that the compilation process, including the task of finding optimal parameters, can be performed efficiently up to an arbitrary error threshold if the underlying physical system is of bounded order. This includes many relevant computational problems, e.g., local physical theories and combinatorial optimisation problems such as the flight-to-gate assignment problem. In particular, we show a priori estimates on the success probability for these combinatorial optimisation problems. There seem to be no known classical methods with similar efficiency and convergence guarantees. Meanwhile the imaginary time evolution method can be implemented on current quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving and thermodynamically compatible cell-centered Lagrangian finite volume scheme for continuum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a novel structure-preserving scheme for the discretization of the Godunov-Peshkov-Romenski (GPR) model of continuum mechanics written in Lagrangian form. This model admits an extra conservation law for the total energy (first principle of thermodynamics) and satisfies the entropy inequality (second principle of thermodynamics). Furthermore, in the absence of algebraic source terms, the distortion field of the continuum and the specific thermal impulse satisfy a curl-free condition, provided the initial data are curl-free. Last but not least, the determinant of the distortion field is related to the density of the medium, i.e. the system is also endowed with a nonlinear algebraic constraint.
  The objective of this work is to construct and analyze a new semi-discrete thermodynamically compatible cell-centered Lagrangian finite volume scheme on moving unstructured meshes that satisfies the following structural properties of the governing PDE exactly at the discrete level: i) compatibility with the first law of thermodynamics, i.e. discrete total energy conservation; ii) compatibility with the second law of thermodynamics, i.e. discrete entropy inequality; iii) exact discrete compatibility between the density and the determinant of the distortion field; iv) exact preservation of the curl-free property of the distortion field and of the specific thermal impulse in the absence of algebraic source terms. We show that it is possible to achieve all above properties simultaneously. Unlike in existing schemes, we choose to directly discretize the entropy inequality, hence obtaining total energy conservation as a consequence of an appropriate and thermodynamically compatible discretization of all the other equations.</description>

Abstract: While experimental advancements continue to expand the capabilities to control and probe non-equilibrium quantum matter at an unprecedented level, the numerical simulation of the dynamics of correlated quantum systems remains a pivotal challenge - especially in intermediate spatial dimensions. Neural quantum states are emerging as a new computational tool to investigate the time evolution of many-body quantum systems in previously inaccessible regimes. We review the recent progress in the field with a focus on the different time propagation methods, an overview of the reported applications, and a discussion of the major current challenges.</description>

      <title>Continuous Approximation of the Ising Hamiltonian: Exact Ground States and Applications to Fidelity Assessment in Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel analytical approach to solving large-scale Ising problems by reformulating the discrete Ising Hamiltonian into a continuous framework. This transformation enables us to derive exact solutions for a non-trivial class of fully connected Ising models. To validate our method, we conducted numerical experiments comparing our analytical solutions with those obtained from a quantum-inspired Ising algorithm and a quantum Ising machine. The results demonstrate that the quantum-inspired algorithm and brute-force method successfully align with our solutions, while the quantum Ising machine exhibits notable deviations. Our method offers promising avenues for analytically solving diverse Ising problem instances, while the class of Ising problems addressed here provides a robust framework for assessing the fidelity of Ising machines.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian transformation for accurate and efficient band structure interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic band structure is a cornerstone of condensed matter physics and materials science. Conventional methods like Wannier interpolation (WI), which are commonly used to interpolate band structures onto dense k-point grids, often encounter difficulties with complex systems, such as those involving entangled bands or topological obstructions. We introduce the Hamiltonian transformation (HT) method, a novel framework that enhances interpolation accuracy by localizing the Hamiltonian. Using a pre-optimized transformation, HT produces a far more localized Hamiltonian than WI-SCDM (where Wannier functions are generated via the selected columns of the density matrix projection), achieving up to two orders of magnitude greater accuracy for entangled bands. Although HT utilizes a slightly larger, nonlocal numerical basis set, its construction is rapid and requires no optimization, resulting in significant computational speedups. These features make HT a more precise, efficient, and robust alternative to WI-SCDM for band structure interpolation, as verified by high-throughput calculations.</description>

      <title>Photoluminescence-Based Gas Sensing with MoS2 Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly appealing for gas sensors, lab-on-a-chip devices and bio-sensing applications because of their strong light-matter interaction and high surface-to-volume ratio. The ability to grow these van der Waals materials on different substrates and waveguide geometries opens a horizon toward scalable on-chip photonic nanodevices. Here, we report on a versatile technique for real time remote optical gas sensing using two-dimensional TMDs. The adsorption of the gas molecules on the monolayer surface provides a gateway for gas sensing based on charge-transfer-induced photoluminescence variation. For gases that are weakly adsorbed on the surface of monolayer TMDs, purging the monolayers' surface by an inert gas like N2 can desorb gases from the monolayers at room temperature. We demonstrate CO, NO and NO2 detection by monitoring photoluminescence from semiconducting MoS2 monolayers grown on SiO2/Si chips at a level of 10 ppm with fast response time. Observations are supported by our density functional theory calculations, which predict a significant interaction between these gases and MoS2 monolayers. These findings may lead to advances in remote sensing, surface-sensitive bioanalytics and lab-on-a-chip sensors.</description>

      <title>A linearly-implicit energy-momentum preserving scheme for geometrically nonlinear mechanics based on non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel formulation and numerical strategy for the simulation of geometrically nonlinear structures. First, a non-canonical Hamiltonian (Poisson) formulation is introduced by including the dynamics of the stress tensor. This framework is developed for von-K\'arm\'an nonlinearities in beams and plates, as well as geometrically nonlinear elasticity with Saint-Venant material behavior. In the case of plates, both negligible and non-negligible membrane inertia are considered. For the former case the two-dimensional elasticity complex is leveraged to express the dynamics in terms of the Airy stress function. The finite element discretization employs a mixed approach, combining a conforming approximation for displacement and velocity fields with a discontinuous stress tensor representation. A staggered, linear implicit time integration scheme is proposed, establishing connections with existing explicit-implicit energy-preserving methods. The stress degrees of freedom are statically condensed, reducing the computational complexity to solving a system with a positive definite matrix. The integration strategy preserves energy and angular momentum exactly. The methodology is validated through numerical experiments on the Duffing oscillator, a von-K\'arm\'an beam, and a column undergoing finite deformations. Comparisons with fully implicit energy-preserving method and the leapfrog scheme demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy while maintaining energy stability. Additionally, it enables larger time steps compared to explicit schemes and exhibits computational efficiency comparable to the leapfrog method.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Local Optimization in Complex Disordered Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Limited resources motivate decomposing large-scale problems into smaller, "local" subsystems and stitching together the so-found solutions. We explore the physics underlying this approach and discuss the concept of "local hardness", i.e., complexity from the local solver perspective, in determining the ground states of both P- and NP-hard spin-glasses and related systems. Depending on the model considered, we observe varying scaling behaviors in how errors associated with local predictions decay as a function of the size of the solved subsystem. These errors stem from global critical threshold instabilities, characterized by gapless, avalanche-like excitations that follow scale-invariant size distributions. Away from criticality, local solvers quickly achieve high accuracy, aligning closely with the results of the more computationally intensive global minimization. These findings shed light on how Nature may operate solely through local actions at her disposal.</description>
