      <title>Encoding and Decoding Algorithms of ANS Variants and Evaluation of Their Average Code Lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetric Numeral Systems (ANS) proposed by Jarek Duda are high-performance distortionless data compression schemes that can achieve almost the same compression performance as arithmetic codes with less arithmetic operations than arithmetic coding. The ANS is widely used in various practical systems like Facebook, Apple, Google, Dropbox, Microsoft, and Pixar, due to their high performance, but many researchers still lack much knowledge about the ANS. This paper thoroughly explains the encoding and decoding algorithms of the ANS, and theoretically analyzes the average code length achievable by the ANS.</description>

      <title>Iterative Equalization of CPM With Unitary Approximate Message Passing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous phase modulation (CPM) has extensive applications in wireless communications due to its high spectral and power efficiency. However, its nonlinear characteristics pose significant challenges for detection in frequency selective fading channels. This paper proposes an iterative receiver tailored for the detection of CPM signals over frequency selective fading channels. This design leverages the factor graph framework to integrate equalization, demodulation, and decoding functions. The equalizer employs the unitary approximate message passing (UAMP) algorithm, while the unitary transformation is implemented using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) with the aid of a cyclic prefix (CP), thereby achieving low computational complexity while with high performance. For CPM demodulation and channel decoding, with belief propagation (BP), we design a message passing-based maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm, and the message exchange between the demodulator, decoder and equalizer is elaborated. With proper message passing schedules, the receiver can achieve fast convergence. Simulation results show that compared with existing turbo receivers, the proposed receiver delivers significant performance enhancement with low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Memory-Assisted Quantized LDPC Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We enhance coarsely quantized LDPC decoding by reusing computed check node messages from previous iterations. Typically, variable and check nodes generate and replace old messages in every iteration. We show that, under coarse quantization, discarding old messages involves a significant loss of mutual information. The loss is avoided with additional memory, improving performance up to 0.36 dB. We propose a modified information bottleneck algorithm to design node operations taking messages from the previous iteration(s) into account as side information. Finally, we reveal a 2-bit row-layered decoder that can operate within 0.25 dB w.r.t. 32-bit belief propagation.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Measures on Lattices for High-Order Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional models reliant solely on pairwise associations often prove insufficient in capturing the complex statistical structure inherent in multivariate data. Yet existing methods for identifying information shared among groups of $d&gt;3$ variables are often intractable; asymmetric around a target variable; or unable to consider all factorisations of the joint probability distribution. Here, we present a framework that systematically derives high-order measures using lattice and operator function pairs, whereby the lattice captures the algebraic relational structure of the variables and the operator function computes measures over the lattice. We show that many existing information-theoretic high-order measures can be derived by using divergences as operator functions on sublattices of the partition lattice, thus preventing the accurate quantification of all interactions for $d&gt;3$. Similarly, we show that using the KL divergence as the operator function also leads to unwanted cancellation of interactions for $d&gt;3$. To characterise all interactions among $d$ variables, we introduce the Streitberg information defined on the full partition lattice using generalisations of the KL divergence as operator functions. We validate our results numerically on synthetic data, and illustrate the use of the Streitberg information through applications to stock market returns and neural electrophysiology data.</description>

      <title>Information-Set Decoding for Convolutional Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for generic decoding of convolutional codes, which allows us to do cryptanalysis of code-based systems that use convolutional codes. We then apply this framework to information set decoding, study success probabilities and give tools to choose variables. Finally, we use this to attack two cryptosystems based on convolutional codes. In the first, our code recovered about 74% of errors in less than 10 hours each, and in the second case, we give experimental evidence that 80% of the errors can be recovered in times corresponding to about 60 bits of operational security, with some instances being significantly lower.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multiparty Entanglement Distribution with DODAG-X Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce the DODAG-X protocol for multipartite entanglement distribution in quantum networks. Leveraging the power of Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs), our protocol optimizes resource consumption and enhances robustness to noise in dynamic and lossy networks. Implementing a variation on the X-protocol within the DODAG, we minimize graph verification and path-finding calculations, significantly reducing computational overhead when compared to other entanglement routing schemes. Additionally, our benchmarks on grid lattice and small-world topologies reveal substantial measurement reduction compared to existing protocols. We demonstrate the success of DODAG-X for generating maximal three-party entanglement in arbitrary networks, and describe the potential for scaling to generic $n$-party entanglement. The DODAG-X protocol provides a scalable and efficient solution for entanglement routing, advancing current techniques for reliable quantum communication and network applications.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Perceptual Scores for Dataset Pruning in Computer Vision Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a score of an image to use for coreset selection in image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. The score is the entropy of an image as approximated by the bits-per-pixel of its compressed version. Thus the score is intrinsic to an image and does not require supervision or training. It is very simple to compute and readily available as all images are stored in a compressed format. The motivation behind our choice of score is that most other scores proposed in literature are expensive to compute. More importantly, we want a score that captures the perceptual complexity of an image. Entropy is one such measure, images with clutter tend to have a higher entropy. However sampling only low entropy iconic images, for example, leads to biased learning and an overall decrease in test performance with current deep learning models. To mitigate the bias we use a graph based method that increases the spatial diversity of the selected samples. We show that this simple score yields good results, particularly for semantic segmentation tasks.</description>

      <title>The MAGIC of Data Management: Understanding the Value and Activities of Data Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era dominated by information technology, the critical discipline of data management remains undervalued compared to the innovations it enables, such as artificial intelligence and social media. The ambiguity surrounding what constitutes data management and its associated activities complicates efforts to explain its importance and ensure data are collected, stored and used in a way that maximizes value and avoids failures. This paper aims to address these shortcomings by presenting a simple framework for understanding data management, referred to as MAGIC. MAGIC encompasses five key activities: Modeling, Acquisition, Governance, Infrastructuring, and Consumption support tasks. By delineating these components, the MAGIC framework provides a clear, accessible approach to data management that can be used for teaching, research and practice.</description>

      <title>Generic Reed-Solomon Codes Achieve List-decoding Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Brakensiek, Gopi and Makam introduced higher order MDS codes as a generalization of MDS codes. An order-$\ell$ MDS code, denoted by $\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$, has the property that any $\ell$ subspaces formed from columns of its generator matrix intersect as minimally as possible. An independent work by Roth defined a different notion of higher order MDS codes as those achieving a generalized singleton bound for list-decoding. In this work, we show that these two notions of higher order MDS codes are (nearly) equivalent.
  We also show that generic Reed-Solomon codes are $\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$ for all $\ell$, relying crucially on the GM-MDS theorem which shows that generator matrices of generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve any possible zero pattern. As a corollary, this implies that generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve list decoding capacity. More concretely, we show that, with high probability, a random Reed-Solomon code of rate $R$ over an exponentially large field is list decodable from radius $1-R-\epsilon$ with list size at most $\frac{1-R-\epsilon}{\epsilon}$, resolving a conjecture of Shangguan and Tamo.</description>

      <title>Information Theory for Complex Systems Scientists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 21st century, many of the crucial scientific and technical issues facing humanity can be understood as problems associated with understanding, modelling, and ultimately controlling complex systems: systems comprised of a large number of non-trivially interacting components whose collective behaviour can be difficult to predict. Information theory, a branch of mathematics historically associated with questions about encoding and decoding messages, has emerged as something of a lingua franca for those studying complex systems, far exceeding its original narrow domain of communication systems engineering. In the context of complexity science, information theory provides a set of tools which allow researchers to uncover the statistical and effective dependencies between interacting components; relationships between systems and their environment; mereological whole-part relationships; and is sensitive to non-linearities missed by commonly parametric statistical models.
  In this review, we aim to provide an accessible introduction to the core of modern information theory, aimed specifically at aspiring (and established) complex systems scientists. This includes standard measures, such as Shannon entropy, relative entropy, and mutual information, before building to more advanced topics, including: information dynamics, measures of statistical complexity, information decomposition, and effective network inference. In addition to detailing the formal definitions, in this review we make an effort to discuss how information theory can be interpreted and develop the intuition behind abstract concepts like "entropy," in the hope that this will enable interested readers to understand what information is, and how it is used, at a more fundamental level.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Age of Information with Generate at Will Status Updates and Age-Agnostic Cyclic Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the scheduling problem for a multi-source single-server generate-at-will (GAW) status update system with sources having heterogeneous service times and weights, with the goal of minimizing the weighted sum age of information (AoI). In particular, we study \emph{age-agnostic} schedulers which rely only on the first two moments of the source service times and they are relatively easier to implement than their age-aware counterparts which make use of the actual realizations of the service times. In particular, we focus on age-agnostic cyclic schedulers with $O(1)$ runtime complexity where status updates from multiple sources are scheduled according to a fixed finite transmission pattern. We first develop an analytical method to obtain the exact average AoI of each source when a transmission pattern is given. Then, we derive the optimum transmission pattern in closed form for the specific case of two sources. For general number of sources, we propose a novel algorithm, called IS (Insertion Search), for constructing transmission patterns, and we show that IS is capable of producing the optimum pattern for two-source systems, and it outperforms other existing age-agnostic schemes, for the case of more than two sources. Numerical examples are presented to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: A weakly constrained code is a collection of finite-length strings over a finite alphabet in which certain substrings or patterns occur according to some prescribed frequencies. Buzaglo and Siegel (ITW 2017) gave a construction of weakly constrained codes based on row-by-row coding, that achieved the capacity of the weak constraint. In this paper, we propose a method to make this row-by-row coding scheme resilient to errors.</description>

Abstract: A random access code (RAC), corresponding to a communication primitive with various applications in quantum information theory, is an instance of a preparation-and-measurement scenario. In this work, we consider (n,d)-RACs constituting an "n"-length string, constructed from a "d" size set of letters, and send an encoding of the string in a single d-level physical system and present their quantum advantages. We first characterize optimal classical RACs, proving that the well-known classical strategy known as majority-encoding-identity-decoding is indeed optimal. We then construct a quantum protocol by exploiting only two incompatible measurements, the minimal requirement, and show the advantages beyond the classical one. We also discuss the generality of our results and whether quantum advantages are valid for all types of (n, d)-&gt;1 RACs.</description>

      <title>$L$-systems and the Lov\'asz number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05818v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given integers $n &gt; k &gt; 0$, and a set of integers $L \subset [0, k-1]$, an \emph{$L$-system} is a family of sets $\mathcal{F} \subset \binom{[n]}{k}$ such that $|F \cap F'| \in L$ for distinct $F, F'\in \mathcal{F}$. $L$-systems correspond to independent sets in a certain generalized Johnson graph $G(n, k, L)$, so that the maximum size of an $L$-system is equivalent to finding the independence number of the graph $G(n, k, L)$. The \emph{Lov\'asz number} $\vartheta(G)$ is a semidefinite programming approximation of the independence number $\alpha$ of a graph $G$.
  In this paper, we determine the leading order term of $\vartheta(G(n, k, L))$ of any generalized Johnson graph with $k$ and $L$ fixed and $n\rightarrow \infty$. As an application of this theorem, we give an explicit construction of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with a large gap between the Lov\'asz number and the Shannon capacity $c(G)$. Specifically, we prove that for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, for infinitely many $n$ there is a generalized Johnson graph $G$ on $n$ vertices which has ratio $\vartheta(G)/c(G) = \Omega(n^{1-\epsilon})$, which improves on all known constructions. The graph $G$ \textit{a fortiori} also has ratio $\vartheta(G)/\alpha(G) = \Omega(n^{1-\epsilon})$, which greatly improves on the best known explicit construction.</description>
