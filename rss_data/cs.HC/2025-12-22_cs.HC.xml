      <title>Explorable Ideas: Externalizing Ideas as Explorable Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working with abstract information often relies on static, symbolic representations that constrain exploration. We introduce Explorable Ideas, a framework that externalizes abstract concepts into explorable environments where physical navigation coordinates conceptual exploration. To investigate its practical value, we designed Idea Islands, a VR probe for ideation tasks, and conducted two controlled studies with 19 participants. Results show that overview perspectives foster strategic breadth while immersion sustains engagement through embodied presence, and that seamless transitions enable flexible workflows combining both modes. These findings validate the framework's design considerations and yield design implications for building future systems that treat information as explorable territory across creative, educational, and knowledge-intensive domains.</description>

      <title>Designing Virtual Reality Games for Grief: A Workshop Approach with Mental Health Professionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although serious games have been increasingly used for mental health applications, few explicitly address coping with grief as a core mechanic and narrative experience for patients. Existing grief-related digital games often focus on clinical training for medical professionals rather than immersive storytelling and agency in emotional processing for the patient. In response, we designed Road to Acceptance, a VR game that presents grief through first-person narrative and gameplay. As the next phase of evaluation, we propose a workshop-based study with 12 licensed mental health professionals to assess the therapeutic impacts of the game and the alignment with best practices in grief education and interventions. This will inform iterative game design and patient evaluation methods, ensuring that the experience is clinically appropriate. Potential findings can contribute to the design principles of grief-related virtual reality experiences, bridging the gap between interactive media, mental health interventions, and immersive storytelling.</description>

      <title>Bots Don't Sit Still: A Longitudinal Study of Bot Behaviour Change, Temporal Drift, and Feature-Structure Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social bots are now deeply embedded in online platforms for promotion, persuasion, and manipulation. Most bot-detection systems still treat behavioural features as static, implicitly assuming bots behave stationarily over time. We test that assumption for promotional Twitter bots, analysing change in both individual behavioural signals and the relationships between them. Using 2,615 promotional bot accounts and 2.8M tweets, we build yearly time series for ten content-based meta-features. Augmented Dickey-Fuller and KPSS tests plus linear trends show all ten are non-stationary: nine increase over time, while language diversity declines slightly.
  Stratifying by activation generation and account age reveals systematic differences: second-generation bots are most active and link-heavy; short-lived bots show intense, repetitive activity with heavy hashtag/URL use; long-lived bots are less active but more linguistically diverse and use emojis more variably. We then analyse co-occurrence across generations using 18 interpretable binary features spanning actions, topic similarity, URLs, hashtags, sentiment, emojis, and media (153 pairs). Chi-square tests indicate almost all pairs are dependent. Spearman correlations shift in strength and sometimes polarity: many links (e.g. multiple hashtags with media; sentiment with URLs) strengthen, while others flip from weakly positive to weakly or moderately negative. Later generations show more structured combinations of cues.
  Taken together, these studies provide evidence that promotional social bots adapt over time at both the level of individual meta-features and the level of feature interdependencies, with direct implications for the design and evaluation of bot-detection systems trained on historical behavioural features.</description>

      <title>Virtual Reality in Service Design for Plastics Recycling: Two Application Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastics recycling depends on everyday sorting practices and on how recycling services are communicated and experienced. Virtual reality (VR) can present these practices and services in situated, interactive form, yet its role in service design for plastics recycling is still emerging. This paper examines how VR tools can contribute to designing plastics recycling services through two application cases that address different stages of the recycling journey. The first case, Clean Cabin Escape, is a household scale VR escape room where players collect and sort waste items into locally relevant categories, with immediate feedback that supports practice with plastics recycling decisions. The second case is a VR simulation of a plastics recycling center that represents a real planned site and is used in service design workshops where stakeholders explore layout, signage and customer paths for plastics fractions. Across the cases, we analyse how VR supported learning, engagement and shared sensemaking, and how it interacted with other service design methods such as workshops, customer path mapping and physical artefacts. The findings show that VR can make domestic sorting tasks and complex recycling centers more concrete for both citizens and professionals, but also highlight trade offs related to hardware access, onboarding effort, visual fidelity and localisation of recycling rules. The paper concludes by outlining opportunities for integrating VR into broader service design toolsets for plastics recycling and circular economy services, and by pointing to directions for future research on long term impact and inclusive design.</description>

      <title>Alignment, Exploration, and Novelty in Human-AI Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-AI interactions are increasingly part of everyday life, yet the interpersonal dynamics that unfold during such exchanges remain underexplored. This study investigates how emotional alignment, semantic exploration, and linguistic innovation emerge within a collaborative storytelling paradigm that paired human participants with a large language model (LLM) in a turn-taking setup. Over nine days, more than 3,000 museum visitors contributed to 27 evolving narratives, co-authored with an LLM in a naturalistic, public installation. To isolate the dynamics specific to human involvement, we compared the resulting dataset with a simulated baseline where two LLMs completed the same task. Using sentiment analysis, semantic embeddings, and information-theoretic measures of novelty and resonance, we trace how humans and models co-construct stories over time. Our results reveal that affective alignment is primarily driven by the model, with limited mutual convergence in human-AI interaction. At the same time, human participants explored a broader semantic space and introduced more novel, narratively influential contributions. These patterns were significantly reduced in the simulated AI-AI condition. Together, these findings highlight the unique role of human input in shaping narrative direction and creative divergence in co-authored texts. The methods developed here provide a scalable framework for analysing dyadic interaction and offer a new lens on creativity, emotional dynamics, and semantic coordination in human-AI collaboration.</description>

      <title>Bridging Psychometric and Content Development Practices with AI: A Community-Based Workflow for Augmenting Hawaiian Language Assessments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and evaluation of a community-based artificial intelligence (AI) workflow developed for the Kaiapuni Assessment of Educational Outcomes (K\=A'EO) program, the only native language assessment used for federal accountability in the United States. The project explored whether document-grounded language models could ethically and effectively augment human analysis of item performance while preserving the cultural and linguistic integrity of the Hawaiian language. Operating under the K\=A'EO AI Policy Framework, the workflow used NotebookLM for cross-document synthesis of psychometric data and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for developer-facing interpretation, with human oversight at every stage. Fifty-eight flagged items across Hawaiian Language Arts, Mathematics, and Science were reviewed during Round 2 of the AI Lab, producing six interpretive briefs that identified systemic design issues such as linguistic ambiguity, Depth-of-Knowledge (DOK) misalignment, and structural overload. The findings demonstrate that AI can serve as an ethically bounded amplifier of human expertise, accelerating analysis while simultaneously prioritizing fairness, human expertise, and cultural authority. This work offers a replicable model for responsible AI integration in Indigenous-language educational measurement.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Modeling of User Interaction Sequences for Dwell Time Prediction in Human-Computer Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the task of dwell time prediction and proposes a Transformer framework based on interaction behavior modeling. The method first represents user interaction sequences on the interface by integrating dwell duration, click frequency, scrolling behavior, and contextual features, which are mapped into a unified latent space through embedding and positional encoding. On this basis, a multi-head self-attention mechanism is employed to capture long-range dependencies, while a feed-forward network performs deep nonlinear transformations to model the dynamic patterns of dwell time. Multiple comparative experiments are conducted with BILSTM, DRFormer, FedFormer, and iTransformer as baselines under the same conditions. The results show that the proposed method achieves the best performance in terms of MSE, RMSE, MAPE, and RMAE, and more accurately captures the complex patterns in interaction behavior. In addition, sensitivity experiments are carried out on hyperparameters and environments to examine the impact of the number of attention heads, sequence window length, and device environment on prediction performance, which further demonstrates the robustness and adaptability of the method. Overall, this study provides a new solution for dwell time prediction from both theoretical and methodological perspectives and verifies its effectiveness in multiple aspects.</description>

      <title>PILAR: Personalizing Augmented Reality Interactions with LLM-based Human-Centric and Trustworthy Explanations for Daily Use Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven augmented reality (AR) systems are becoming increasingly integrated into daily life, and with this growth comes a greater need for explainability in real-time user interactions. Traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods, which often rely on feature-based or example-based explanations, struggle to deliver dynamic, context-specific, personalized, and human-centric insights for everyday AR users. These methods typically address separate explainability dimensions (e.g., when, what, how) with different explanation techniques, resulting in unrealistic and fragmented experiences for seamless AR interactions. To address this challenge, we propose PILAR, a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to generate context-aware, personalized explanations, offering a more intuitive and trustworthy experience in real-time AI-powered AR systems. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on multiple techniques for different aspects of explanation, PILAR employs a unified LLM-based approach that dynamically adapts explanations to the user's needs, fostering greater trust and engagement. We implement the PILAR concept in a real-world AR application (e.g., personalized recipe recommendations), an open-source prototype that integrates real-time object detection, recipe recommendation, and LLM-based personalized explanations of the recommended recipes based on users' dietary preferences. We evaluate the effectiveness of PILAR through a user study with 16 participants performing AR-based recipe recommendation tasks, comparing an LLM-based explanation interface to a traditional template-based one. Results show that the LLM-based interface significantly enhances user performance and experience, with participants completing tasks 40% faster and reporting greater satisfaction, ease of use, and perceived transparency.</description>

      <title>LUMIA: A Handheld Vision-to-Music System for Real-Time, Embodied Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most digital music tools emphasize precision and control, but often lack support for tactile, improvisational workflows grounded in environmental interaction. Lumia addresses this by enabling users to "compose through looking"--transforming visual scenes into musical phrases using a handheld, camera-based interface and large multimodal models. A vision-language model (GPT-4V) analyzes captured imagery to generate structured prompts, which, combined with user-selected instrumentation, guide a text-to-music pipeline (Stable Audio). This real-time process allows users to frame, capture, and layer audio interactively, producing loopable musical segments through embodied interaction. The system supports a co-creative workflow where human intent and model inference shape the musical outcome. By embedding generative AI within a physical device, Lumia bridges perception and composition, introducing a new modality for creative exploration that merges vision, language, and sound. It repositions generative music not as a task of parameter tuning, but as an improvisational practice driven by contextual, sensory engagement.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Augmented Reality as an Educational Tool for Practice in Early Childhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning Wudhu for young children requires engaging and interactive media to foster a deep understanding of the worship procedures. This study aims to develop a Wudhu learning application based on Augmented Reality (AR) as an interactive and fun educational medium. The development method used includes the stages of needs analysis, system design, implementation, and testing using Black Box Testing. The system utilizes marker-based tracking to display 3D animations of Wudhu movements in real-time when the camera detects a marker on the printed media. The test results indicate that all main functions run well, and a limited trial on children aged 5-7 years showed an increase in learning interest and a better understanding of the Wudhu sequence. Thus, the application of AR technology is proven effective in improving the quality of basic worship instruction for young children.</description>

      <title>Psychological Factors Influencing University Students Trust in AI-Based Learning Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) based learning assistants and chatbots are increasingly integrated into higher education. While these tools are often evaluated in terms of technical performance, their successful and ethical use also depends on psychological factors such as trust, perceived risk, technology anxiety, and students general attitudes toward AI. This paper adopts a psychology oriented perspective to examine how university students form trust in AI based learning assistants. Drawing on recent literature in mental health, human AI interaction, and trust in automation, we propose a conceptual framework that organizes psychological predictors of trust into four groups: cognitive appraisals, affective reactions, social relational factors, and contextual moderators. A narrative review approach synthesizes empirical findings and derives research questions and hypotheses for future studies. The paper highlights that trust in AI is a psychological process shaped by individual differences and learning environments, with practical implications for instructors, administrators, and designers of educational AI systems.</description>

      <title>VAIR: Visual Analytics for Injury Risk Exploration in Sports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Injury prevention in sports requires understanding how bio-mechanical risks emerge from movement patterns captured in real-world scenarios. However, identifying and interpreting injury prone events from raw video remains difficult and time-consuming. We present VAIR, a visual analytics system that supports injury risk analysis using 3D human motion reconstructed from sports video. VAIR combines pose estimation, bio-mechanical simulation, and synchronized visualizations to help users explore how joint-level risk indicators evolve over time. Domain experts can inspect movement segments through temporally aligned joint angles, angular velocity, and internal forces to detect patterns associated with known injury mechanisms. Through case studies involving Achilles tendon and Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in basketball, we show that VAIR enables more efficient identification and interpretation of risky movements. Expert feedback confirms that VAIR improves diagnostic reasoning and supports both retrospective analysis and proactive intervention planning.</description>

      <title>Digital Bricolage: Design Speculations for Embodied Approaches to Digitized Print-based Cultural Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: COVID-related closures of public and academic libraries have underlined the importance of online platforms that provide access to digitized print-based collections. However, they also have highlighted the value of in-person handling of print artefacts for sensing and making sense of them. How do existing dominant digital platforms invite and/or discourage embodied forms of exploration and sense-making? What opportunities for embodied experience might we discover if we embrace the material qualities of print-based collections when designing interfaces for digital access? In this paper, we present findings from a speculative exercise where we invited creative professionals and experts in curating and handling access to collections to reflect on existing approaches to digitized print-based collections and to speculate about alternative design opportunities and modes of engagement. We argue for digital bricolage-a design approach that values working with materials that are "on hand" and embracing our ability to "handle" them in ways that foster both casual and curious exploration.</description>

      <title>Playful but Persuasive: Deceptive Designs and Advertising Strategies in Popular Mobile Apps for Children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile gaming apps are woven into children's daily lives. Given their ongoing cognitive and emotional development, children are especially vulnerable and depend on designs that safeguard their well-being. When apps feature manipulative interfaces or heavy advertising, they may exert undue influence on young users, contributing to prolonged screen time, disrupted self-regulation, and accidental in-app purchases. In this study, we examined 20 popular, free-to-download children's apps in German-speaking regions to assess the prevalence of deceptive design patterns and advertising. Despite platform policies and EU frameworks like the General Data Protection Regulation and the Digital Services Act, every app contained interface manipulations intended to nudge, confuse, or pressure young users, averaging nearly six distinct deceptive patterns per app. Most also displayed high volumes of non-skippable ads, frequently embedded within core gameplay. These findings indicate a systemic failure of existing safeguards and call for stronger regulation, greater platform accountability, and child-centered design standards.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive training for sustained attention and working memory is vital across domains relying on robust mental capacity such as education or rehabilitation. Adaptive systems are essential, dynamically matching difficulty to user ability to maintain engagement and accelerate learning. Current adaptive systems often rely on simple performance heuristics or predict visual complexity and affect instead of cognitive load. This study presents the first implementation of real-time adaptive cognitive load control in Virtual Reality cognitive training based on eye-tracking and physiological data. We developed a bidirectional LSTM model with a self-attention mechanism, trained on eye-tracking and physiological (PPG, GSR) data from 74 participants. We deployed it in real-time with 54 participants across single-task (sustained attention) and dual-task (sustained attention + mental arithmetic) paradigms. Difficulty was adjusted dynamically based on participant self-assessment or model's real-time cognitive load predictions. Participants showed a tendency to estimate the task as too difficult, even though they were objectively performing at their best. Over the course of a 10-minute session, both adaptation methods converged at equivalent difficulty in single-task scenarios, with no significant differences in subjective workload or game performance. However, in the dual-task conditions, the model successfully pushed users to higher difficulty levels without performance penalties or increased frustration, highlighting a user tendency to underestimate capacity under high cognitive load. Findings indicate that machine learning models may provide more objective cognitive capacity assessments than self-directed approaches, mitigating subjective performance biases and enabling more effective training by pushing users beyond subjective comfort zones toward physiologically-determined optimal challenge levels.</description>

      <title>Map2Video: Street View Imagery Driven AI Video Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI video generation has lowered barriers to video creation, but current tools still struggle with inconsistency. Filmmakers often find that clips fail to match characters and backgrounds, making it difficult to build coherent sequences. A formative study with filmmakers highlighted challenges in shot composition, character motion, and camera control. We present Map2Video, a street view imagery-driven AI video generation tool grounded in real-world geographies. The system integrates Unity and ComfyUI with the VACE video generation model, as well as OpenStreetMap and Mapillary for street view imagery. Drawing on familiar filmmaking practices such as location scouting and rehearsal, Map2Video enables users to choose map locations, position actors and cameras in street view imagery, sketch movement paths, refine camera motion, and generate spatially consistent videos. We evaluated Map2Video with 12 filmmakers. Compared to an image-to-video baseline, it achieved higher spatial accuracy, required less cognitive effort, and offered stronger controllability for both scene replication and open-ended creative exploration.</description>

      <title>XAgen: An Explainability Tool for Identifying and Correcting Failures in Multi-Agent Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in real-world workflows, users with diverse technical backgrounds are now building and refining their own agentic processes. However, these systems can fail in opaque ways, making it difficult for users to observe, understand, and correct errors. We conducted formative interviews with 12 practitioners to identify mismatches between existing observability tools and users' needs. Based on these insights, we designed XAgen, an explainability tool that supports users with varying AI expertise through three core capabilities: log visualization for glanceable workflow understanding, human-in-the-loop feedback to capture expert judgment, and automatic error detection via an LLM-as-a-judge. In a user study with 8 participants, XAgen helped users more easily locate failures, attribute to specific agents or steps, and iteratively improve configurations. Our findings surface human-centered design guidelines for explainable agentic AI development and highlights opportunities for more context-aware interactive debugging.</description>

      <title>Adversarial VR: An Open-Source Testbed for Evaluating Adversarial Robustness of VR Cybersickness Detection and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL)-based automated cybersickness detection methods, along with adaptive mitigation techniques, can enhance user comfort and interaction. However, recent studies show that these DL-based systems are susceptible to adversarial attacks; small perturbations to sensor inputs can degrade model performance, trigger incorrect mitigation, and disrupt the user's immersive experience (UIX). Additionally, there is a lack of dedicated open-source testbeds that evaluate the robustness of these systems under adversarial conditions, limiting the ability to assess their real-world effectiveness. To address this gap, this paper introduces Adversarial-VR, a novel real-time VR testbed for evaluating DL-based cybersickness detection and mitigation strategies under adversarial conditions. Developed in Unity, the testbed integrates two state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL models: DeepTCN and Transformer, which are trained on the open-source MazeSick dataset, for real-time cybersickness severity detection and applies a dynamic visual tunneling mechanism that adjusts the field-of-view based on model outputs. To assess robustness, we incorporate three SOTA adversarial attacks: MI-FGSM, PGD, and C&amp;W, which successfully prevent cybersickness mitigation by fooling DL-based cybersickness models' outcomes. We implement these attacks using a testbed with a custom-built VR Maze simulation and an HTC Vive Pro Eye headset, and we open-source our implementation for widespread adoption by VR developers and researchers. Results show that these adversarial attacks are capable of successfully fooling the system. For instance, the C&amp;W attack results in a $5.94x decrease in accuracy for the Transformer-based cybersickness model compared to the accuracy without the attack.</description>

      <title>A Service Robot's Guide to Interacting with Busy Customers</title>

Abstract: The growing use of service robots in hospitality highlights the need to understand how to effectively communicate with pre-occupied customers. This study investigates the efficacy of commonly used communication modalities by service robots, namely, acoustic/speech, visual display, and micromotion gestures in capturing attention and communicating intention with a user in a simulated restaurant scenario. We conducted a two-part user study (N=24) using a Temi robot to simulate delivery tasks, with participants engaged in a typing game (MonkeyType) to emulate a state of busyness. The participants' engagement in the typing game is measured by words per minute (WPM) and typing accuracy. In Part 1, we compared non-verbal acoustic cue versus baseline conditions to assess attention capture during a single-cup delivery task. In Part 2, we evaluated the effectiveness of speech, visual display, micromotion and their multimodal combination in conveying specific intentions (correct cup selection) during a two-cup delivery task. The results indicate that, while speech is highly effective in capturing attention, it is less successful in clearly communicating intention. Participants rated visual as the most effective modality for intention clarity, followed by speech, with micromotion being the lowest ranked.These findings provide insights into optimizing communication strategies for service robots, highlighting the distinct roles of attention capture and intention communication in enhancing user experience in dynamic hospitality settings.</description>

      <title>Learning Spatio-Temporal Feature Representations for Video-Based Gaze Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video-based gaze estimation methods aim to capture the inherently temporal dynamics of human eye gaze from multiple image frames. However, since models must capture both spatial and temporal relationships, performance is limited by the feature representations within a frame but also between multiple frames. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), a model that combines a CNN backbone with dedicated channel attention and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features optimally. The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation. Additionally, our ablation study provides further insights into the model performance, showing that preserving and modelling intra-frame spatial context with our spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling. As such, our results pave the way towards more robust video-based gaze estimation using commonly available cameras.</description>

      <title>ShareChat: A Dataset of Chatbot Conversations in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into distinct platforms with unique interface designs and capabilities, existing public datasets treat models as generic text generators, stripping away the interface context that actively shapes user interaction. To address this limitation, we present ShareChat, a large-scale, cross-platform corpus comprising 142,808 conversations and over 660,000 turns collected from publicly shared URLs across five major platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, and Grok. ShareChat distinguishes itself by preserving native platform affordances often lost in standard logs, including reasoning traces, source links, and code artifacts, while spanning 101 languages over the period from April 2023 to October 2025. Furthermore, ShareChat offers substantially longer context windows and greater interaction depth than prior datasets. We demonstrate the dataset's multifaceted utility through three representative analyses: (1) analyzing conversation completeness to measure user intent satisfaction; (2) evaluating source citation behaviors in content generation; and (3) conducting temporal analysis to track evolving usage patterns. This work provides the community with a vital and timely resource for understanding authentic user-LLM chatbot interactions in the wild.</description>

      <title>Integrating Computational Methods and AI into Qualitative Studies of Aging and Later Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter demonstrates how computational social science (CSS) tools are extending and expanding research on aging. The depth and context from traditionally qualitative methods such as participant observation, in-depth interviews, and historical documents are increasingly employed alongside scalable data management, computational text analysis, and open-science practices. Machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP), provide resources to aggregate and systematically index large volumes of qualitative data, identify patterns, and maintain clear links to in-depth accounts. Drawing on case studies of projects that examine later life--including examples with original data from the DISCERN study (a team-based ethnography of life with dementia) and secondary analyses of the American Voices Project (nationally representative interview)--the chapter highlights both uses and challenges of bringing CSS tools into more meaningful dialogue with qualitative aging research. The chapter argues such work has potential for (1) streamlining and augmenting existing workflows, (2) scaling up samples and projects, and (3) generating multi-method approaches to address important questions in new ways, before turning to practices useful for individuals and teams seeking to understand current possibilities or refine their workflow processes. The chapter concludes that current developments are not without peril, but offer potential for new insights into aging and the life course by broadening--rather than replacing--the methodological foundations of qualitative research.</description>

      <title>Designing an LLM-Based Behavioral Activation Chatbot for Young People with Depression: Insights from an Evaluation with Artificial Users and Clinical Experts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLMs promise to overcome limitations of rule-based mental health chatbots through improved natural language capabilities, yet their ability to deliver evidence-based psychological interventions remains largely unverified because evaluations rarely apply the validated fidelity measures used to assess psychotherapists. We developed an LLM-based chatbot that delivers behavioral activation for depression and generated 48 complete chat sessions with diverse artificial users. Ten psychotherapists assessed these sessions using the Quality of Behavioral Activation Scale (Q-BAS), a validated fidelity instrument. Results show that the chatbot reliably executed the intervention across all phases and maintained safety protocols, but it struggled with clinical judgment, particularly when verifying the feasibility of proposed activities. Overall, our findings suggest that LLM-based chatbots can execute therapeutic protocols with high fidelity, while robust clinical reasoning remains an open challenge. We outline design implications to address this gap and provide the chatbot and artificial user prompts.</description>

Abstract: Interaction with sensor-augmented earphones, referred to as earables or hearables, represents a major area of earable research. Proximate to the head and reachable by hand, earables support diverse interactions and can detect multiple inputs simultaneously. Yet this diversity has fragmented research, complicating the tracking of developments. To address this, we introduce EarXplore, a curated, interactive online database on earable interaction research. Designed through a question-centered approach that guided the development of 33 criteria applied to annotate 118 studies and the structure of the platform, EarXplore comprises four integrated views: a Tabular View for structured exploration, a Graphical View for visual overviews, a Similarity View for conceptual links, and a Timeline View for scholarly trends. We demonstrate how the platform supports tailored exploration and filtering, and we leverage its capabilities to discuss gaps and opportunities. With community update mechanisms, EarXplore evolves with the field, serving as a living resource to accelerate future research</description>

      <title>Emoji Reactions on Telegram: Unreliable Indicators of Emotional Resonance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emoji reactions are a frequently used feature of messaging platforms, yet their communicative role remains understudied. Prior work on emojis has focused predominantly on in-text usage, showing that emojis embedded in messages tend to amplify and mirror the author's affective tone. This evidence has often been extended to emoji reactions, treating them as indicators of emotional resonance or user sentiment. However, they may reflect broader social dynamics. Here, we investigate the communicative function of emoji reactions on Telegram. We analyze over 650k crypto-related messages that received at least one reaction, annotating each with sentiment, emotion, persuasion strategy, and speech act labels, and inferring the sentiment and emotion of emoji reactions using both lexicons and LLMs. We uncover a systematic mismatch between message and reaction sentiment, with positive reactions dominating even for neutral or negative content. This pattern persists across rhetorical strategies and emotional tones, indicating that emojis used as reactions do not reliably function as indicators of emotional mirroring or resonance of the content, in contrast to findings reported for in-text emojis. Finally, we identify the features that most predict emoji engagement. Overall, our findings caution against treating emoji reactions as sentiment labels, highlighting the need for more nuanced approaches in sentiment and engagement analysis.</description>

Abstract: As recommender systems increasingly guide physical actions, often through wearables and coaching tools, new challenges arise around how users interpret, trust, and respond to this advice. This paper introduces a conceptual framework for tangible recommendations that influence users' bodies, routines, and well-being. We describe three design dimensions: trust and interpretation, intent alignment, and consequence awareness. These highlight key limitations in applying conventional recommender logic to embodied settings. Through examples and design reflections, we outline how future systems can support long-term well-being, behavioral alignment, and socially responsible personalization.</description>

      <title>Temporal Drift in Privacy Recall: Users Misremember From Verbatim Loss to Gist-Based Overexposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With social media content traversing the different platforms, occasionally resurfacing after periods of time, users are increasingly prone to unintended disclosure resulting from a misremembered acceptance of privacy. Context collapse and interface cues are two factors considered by prior researchers, yet we know less about how time-lapse basically alters recall of past audiences destined for exposure. Likewise, the design space for mitigating this temporal exposure risk remains underexplored. Our work theorizes temporal drift in privacy recall as verbatim memory of prior settings blowing apart and eventually settling with gist-based heuristics, which more often than not select an audience larger than the original one. Grounded in memory research, contextual integrity, and usable privacy, we examine why such a drift occurs, why it tends to bias toward broader sharing, and how it compounds upon repeat exposure. Following that, we suggest provenance-forward interface schemes and a risk-based evaluation framework that mutates recall into recognition. The merit of our work lies in establishing a temporal awareness of privacy design as an essential safety rail against inadvertent overexposure.</description>

Abstract: NLP-assisted solutions have gained considerable traction to support qualitative data analysis. However, there does not exist a unified evaluation framework that can account for the many different settings in which qualitative researchers may employ them. In this paper, we take a first step in this direction by proposing an evaluation framework to study the way in which different tools may result in different outcomes depending on the collaboration strategy employed. Specifically, we study the impact of synchronous vs. asynchronous collaboration using two different NLP-assisted qualitative research tools and present a comprehensive analysis of significant differences in the consistency, cohesiveness, and correctness of their outputs.</description>

      <title>Understanding and supporting how developers prompt for LLM-powered code editing in practice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming software engineering, with coding assistants embedded in an IDE becoming increasingly prevalent. While research has focused on improving the tools and understanding developer perceptions, a critical gap exists in understanding how developers actually use these tools in their daily workflows, and, crucially, where they struggle. This paper addresses part of this gap through a multi-phased investigation of developer interactions with an LLM-powered code editing feature, Transform Code, in an IDE widely used at Google. First, we analyze telemetry logs of the feature usage, revealing that frequent re-prompting can be an indicator of developer struggles with using Transform Code. Second, we conduct a qualitative analysis of unsatisfactory requests, identifying five key categories of information often missing from developer prompts. Finally, based on these findings, we propose and evaluate a tool, AutoPrompter, for automatically improving prompts by inferring missing information from the surrounding code context, leading to a 27% improvement in edit correctness on our test set.</description>

      <title>Upgrading Democracies with Fairer Voting Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14349</link>

Abstract: Voting methods are instrumental design elements of democracies. Citizens use them to express and aggregate their preferences to reach a collective decision. However, voting outcomes can be as sensitive to voting rules as they are to people's voting choices. Despite significance and interdisciplinary scientific progress, several democracies keep relying on outdated voting methods that do not fit modern, pluralistic societies well, while lacking social innovation. Here, we demonstrate how one can upgrade real-world democracies, namely by using alternative preferential voting methods such as cumulative voting and the method of equal shares designed for a proportional representation of voters' preferences. We rigorously evaluate the striking voting outcomes of these fair voting methods in a new participatory budgeting approach applied in the city of Aarau, Switzerland, including past and follow-up evidence. Results show more winning projects with the same budget. They also show broader geographic and preference representation of citizens by the elected projects, in particular for voters who used to be under-represented. We provide causal evidence showing that citizens prefer proportional voting methods, which possess strong legitimacy without the need of very specialized technical explanations. We also reveal strong underlying democratic values exhibited by citizens who support fair voting methods such as altruism and compromise. These findings come with the momentum to unleash a new and long-awaited participation blueprint of how to upgrade democracies globally.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Large Audio-Language Models with LoRA for Precise Temporal Localization of Prolonged Exposure Therapy Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09707v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy is an effective treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but evaluating therapist fidelity remains labor-intensive due to the need for manual review of session recordings. We present a method for the automatic temporal localization of key PE fidelity elements, identifying their start and stop times, directly from session audio and transcripts. Our approach fine-tunes a large pre-trained audio-language model, Qwen2-Audio, using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to process focused 30-second windows of audio-transcript input. Fidelity labels for three core protocol phases, therapist orientation (P1), imaginal exposure (P2), and post-imaginal processing (P3), are generated via LLM-based prompting and verified by trained raters. The model is trained to predict normalized boundary offsets using soft supervision guided by task-specific prompts. On a dataset of 308 real PE sessions, our best configuration (LoRA rank 8, 30s windows) achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.3s across tasks, within typical rater tolerance for timestamp review, enabling practical fidelity QC. We further analyze the effects of window size and LoRA rank, highlighting the importance of context granularity and model adaptation. This work introduces a privacy-preserving, scalable framework for fidelity tracking in PE therapy, with potential to support clinician training, supervision, and quality assurance.</description>

      <title>MILE: A Mechanically Isomorphic Exoskeleton Data Collection System with Fingertip Visuotactile Sensing for Dexterous Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imitation learning provides a promising approach to dexterous hand manipulation, but its effectiveness is limited by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity data. Existing data-collection pipelines suffer from inaccurate motion retargeting, low data-collection efficiency, and missing high-resolution fingertip tactile sensing. We address this gap with MILE, a mechanically isomorphic teleoperation and data-collection system co-designed from human hand to exoskeleton to robotic hand. The exoskeleton is anthropometrically derived from the human hand, and the robotic hand preserves one-to-one joint-position isomorphism, eliminating nonlinear retargeting and enabling precise, natural control. The exoskeleton achieves a multi-joint mean absolute angular error below one degree, while the robotic hand integrates compact fingertip visuotactile modules that provide high-resolution tactile observations. Built on this retargeting-free interface, we teleoperate complex, contact-rich in-hand manipulation and efficiently collect a multimodal dataset comprising high-resolution fingertip visuotactile signals, RGB-D images, and joint positions. The teleoperation pipeline achieves a mean success rate improvement of 64%. Incorporating fingertip tactile observations further increases the success rate by an average of 25% over the vision-only baseline, validating the fidelity and utility of the dataset.

      <title>ParamExplorer: A framework for exploring parameters in generative art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative art systems often involve high-dimensional and complex parameter spaces in which aesthetically compelling outputs occupy only small, fragmented regions. Because of this combinatorial explosion, artists typically rely on extensive manual trial-and-error, leaving many potentially interesting configurations undiscovered. In this work we make two contributions. First, we introduce ParamExplorer, an interactive and modular framework inspired by reinforcement learning that helps the exploration of parameter spaces in generative art algorithms, guided by human-in-the-loop or even automated feedback. The framework also integrates seamlessly with existing p5js projects. Second, within this framework we implement and evaluate several exploration strategies, referred to as agents.</description>
