      <title>Time-invariance violation effect in $\bm{dd}$ scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A formalism has been developed for calculating the signal of violation of $T$ invariance, provided that $P$ invariance is preserved during the scattering of tensor-polarized deuterons on vector-polarized ones based on the Glauber theory with the full consideration of spin dependence of $NN$ elastic scattering amplitudes and spin structure of colliding deuterons. The numerical calculations have been carried out in the range of laboratory proton energies $T_p=0.1$--$1.2$ GeV using the SAID database for spin amplitudes and in the energy region of the SPD NICA experiment corresponding to the invariant mass of the interacting nucleon pairs $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 2.5$--$25$ GeV, using two phenomenological models of $pN$ elastic scattering. It is found that only one type of the $T$ non-invariant $P$-invariant $NN$ interaction gives a non-zero contribution to the signal in question, that is important for isolating an unknown constant of this interaction from the corresponding data.</description>

      <title>Mean-field approximation on steroids: exact description of the deuteron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present article demonstrates that the deuteron, i.e. the lightest bound nuclear system made of a single proton and a single neutron, can be accurately described within a mean-field-based framework.
  Although paradoxical at first glance, the deuteron ground-state binding energy, magnetic dipole moment, electric quadrupole moment and root-mean-square proton radius are indeed reproduced with sub-percent accuracy via a low-dimensional linear combination of non-orthogonal Bogoliubov states, i.e. with a method whose numerical cost scales as $n_{\text{dim}}^4$, where $n_{\text{dim}}$ is the dimension of the basis of the one-body Hilbert space. By further putting the system into a harmonic trap, the neutron-proton scattering length and effective range in the ${}^{3}S_1$ channel are also accurately reproduced.
  To achieve this task, (i) the inclusion of proton-neutron pairing through the mixing of proton and neutron single-particle states in the Bogoliubov transformation and (ii) the restoration of proton and neutron numbers before variation are shown to be mandatory ingredients.
  This unexpected result has implications regarding the most efficient way to capture necessary correlations as a function of nuclear mass and regarding the possibility to ensure order-by-order renormalizability of many-body calculations based on chiral or pionless effective field theories beyond light nuclei. In this context, the present study will be extended to $^{3}$H and $^{3,4}$He in the near future as well as to the leading order of pionless effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Simplified projection on total spin zero for state preparation on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple algorithm for projecting on $J=0$ states of a many-body system by performing a series of rotations to remove states with angular momentum projections greater than zero. Existing methods rely on unitary evolution with the two-body operator $J^2$, which when expressed in the computational basis contains many complicated Pauli strings requiring Trotterization and leading to very deep quantum circuits. Our approach performs the necessary projections using the one-body operators $J_x$ and $J_z$. By leveraging the method of Cartan decomposition, the unitary transformations that perform the projection can be parameterized as a product of a small number of two-qubit rotations, with angles determined by an efficient classical optimization. Given the reduced complexity in terms of gates, this approach can be used to prepare approximate ground states of even-even nuclei by projecting onto the $J=0$ component of deformed Hartree-Fock states. We estimate the resource requirements in terms of the universal gate set {$H$,$S$,CNOT,$T$} and briefly discuss a variant of the algorithm that projects onto $J=1/2$ states of a system with an odd number of fermions.</description>

      <title>Recent developments in relativistic hydrodynamic fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of thermal fluctuations in relativistic hydrodynamics has led to numerous important developments in the last decade. We present a bird's eye view of the recent advances on the theory of fluctuations on three fronts; stochastic hydrodynamics, hydro-kinetics where fluctuations are included as additional modes that satisfy deterministic evolution equations, and effective field theory formulation of relativistic hydrodynamics. We compare and contrast these different but complimentary frameworks and highlight various recent progresses in each of them.</description>

      <title>Light Nuclei Femtoscopy and Baryon Interactions in 3 GeV Au+Au Collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the measurements of proton-deuteron ($p$-$d$) and deuteron-deuteron ($d$-$d$) correlation functions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 3 GeV using fixed-target mode with the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). For the first time, the source size ($R_{G}$), scattering length ($f_{0}$), and effective range ($d_{0}$) are extracted from the measured correlation functions with a simultaneous fit. The spin-averaged $f_0$ for $p$-$d$ and $d$-$d$ interactions are determined to be -5.28 $\pm$ 0.11(stat.) $\pm$ 0.82(syst.) fm and -2.62 $\pm$ 0.02(stat.) $\pm$ 0.24(syst.) fm, respectively. The measured $p$-$d$ interaction is consistent with theoretical calculations and low-energy scattering experiment results, demonstrating the feasibility of extracting interaction parameters using the femtoscopy technique. The reasonable agreement between the experimental data and the calculations from the transport model indicates that deuteron production in these collisions is primarily governed by nucleon coalescence.</description>

      <title>Moments of Axial-Vector GPD from Lattice QCD: Quark Helicity, Orbital Angular Momentum, and Spin-Orbit Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the Mellin moments of the twist-2 axial-vector generalized parton distribution (GPD), $\widetilde{H}(x,\xi,t)$, at zero skewness, $\xi$, with multiple values of the momentum transfer, $t$. Our analysis employs the short-distance factorization framework on ratio-scheme renormalized quasi-GPD matrix elements. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermions ensemble with clover improvement, a lattice spacing of $a = 0.093$ fm, and a pion mass of $m_\pi = 260$ MeV. We consider both the iso-vector and iso-scalar cases, utilizing next-to-leading-order perturbative matching while ignoring the disconnected contributions and gluon mixing in the iso-scalar case. For the first time, we determine the Mellin moments of $\widetilde{H}$ up to the fifth order. From these moments, we discuss the quark helicity and orbital angular momentum contributions to the nucleon spin, as well as the spin-orbit correlations of the quarks. Additionally, we perform a Fourier transform over the momentum transfer, which allows us to explore the spin structure in the impact-parameter space.</description>

      <title>Description of $^7$Be and $^7$Li within the Gamow Shell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $^7$Li and $^7$Be play an important role in Big Bang nucleosynthesis and nuclear astrophysics. The $^3$H($^4$He,$\gamma$)$^7$Li radiative capture reaction is crucial for the determination of the primordial $^7$Li abundance. In nuclear astrophysics, lithium isotopes have attracted a great interest because of the puzzled abundance of $^6$Li and $^7$Li.
  Purpose: In this work we study spectra of $^7$Be, $^7$Li and elastic scattering cross sections $^4$He($^3$He, $^3$He), $^4$He($^3$H, $^3$H) within the Gamow shell model (GSM) in the coupled-channel formulation (GSM-CC). The evolution of channel amplitudes and spectroscopic factors in the vicinity of the channel threshold is studied for selected states.
  Methods: GSM provides the open quantum system formulation of nuclear shell model. In the representation of GSM-CC, GSM provides the unified theory of nuclear structure and reactions which is suited for the study of resonances in $^7$Be, $^7$Li and elastic scattering cross-sections involving $^3$H and $^3$He projectiles.
  Results: The GSM-CC in multi-mass partition formulation applied to a translationally invariant Hamiltonian with an effective finite-range two-body interaction reproduce well the spectra of $^7$Be, $^7$Li and elastic scattering reactions: $^4$He($^3$He, $^3$He), $^4$He($^3$H, $^3$H). Detailed analysis of the dependence of reaction channel amplitudes and spectroscopic factors on the distance from the particle decay threshold allowed to demonstrate the alignment of the wave function in the vicinity of the decay threshold. This analysis also demonstrates the appearance of clustering in the GSM-CC wave function in the vicinity of the cluster decay threshold.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic specific entropy on the transition line near the QCD critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) critical point on the isentropic trajectories in the QCD phase diagram. We point out that the universality of the critical equation of state and the third law of thermodynamics require the specific entropy (per baryon) along the coexistence (first-order transition) line to be nonmonotonic at least on one side of that line. Specifically, a maximum must occur. We show how the location of the maximum relative to the QCD critical point depends on the parameters of the critical equation of state commonly used in the literature. We then examine how the isentropic trajectories followed by adiabatically expanding heavy-ion collision fireballs behave near the critical point. We find that a crucial role is played by the sign of the isochoric temperature derivative of pressure at the critical point; this sign determines on which side of the coexistence curve the specific entropy must be nonmonotonic (i.e., has a maximum). We classify different scenarios of the adiabatic expansion that arise depending on the value of the discriminant parameter and the proximity of the trajectory to the critical point.</description>

      <title>Branch-cut in the shear-stress response function of massless $\lambda \varphi^4$ with Boltzmann statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an analytical result for the eigensystem of the linearized collision term for a classical system of massless scalar particles with quartic self-interactions, we show that the shear-stress linear response function possesses a branch-cut singularity that covers the whole positive imaginary semi-axis. This is demonstrated in two ways: (1) by truncating the exact, infinite linear system of linear equations for the rank-two tensor modes, which reveals the cut touching the origin; and (2) by employing the Trotterization techniques to invert the linear response problem. The former shows that the first pole tends towards the origin and the average separation between consecutive poles tends towards zero as power laws in the dimension of the basis. The latter allows one to obtain the response function in closed form in terms of Tricomi hypergeometrical functions, which possess a branch-cut on the above-mentioned semi-axis. This suggests that the presence of a cut along the imaginary frequency axis of the shear stress correlator, inferred from previous numerical analyses of weakly coupled scalar $\lambda \varphi^4$ theories, does not arise due to quantum statistics but instead emerges from the fundamental properties of this system's interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider gas of massless fermions at certain temperature T and acceleration a. We find a second order phase transition at temperature T approaching the Unruh temperature TU. The implications for hadronization of the quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy-ion collisions (HIC) and for black-hole physics are discussed. In particular, this novel phase transition may be associated with thermalization in HIC, indicating its analogy with falling into a black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present BHAC-QGP, a new numerical code to simulate the evolution of matter created in heavy-ion collisions in the presence of electromagnetic fields. It is derived from the Black Hole Accretion Code (BHAC), which has been designed to model astrophysical processes in a general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical description. As the original Black Hole Accretion Code, BHAC-QGP benefits from the use of Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR), which allows us to dynamically adjust the resolution where necessary, and makes use of time-dependent Milne coordinates and the ultrarelativistic equation of state, $P = e/3$. We demonstrate that BHAC-QGP accurately passes a number of systematic and rigorous tests.</description>

      <title>Study of electron-positron annihilation into $K\bar{K}\pi$ within resonance chiral theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a coherent study of the $e^+e^-$ annihilation into $K^+K^-\pi^0$, $K^0_SK^0_L\pi^0$ and $K^0_SK^\pm\pi^\mp$ is carried out within the framework of resonance chiral theory. The amplitudes are fixed by fitting to the experimental cross-section and invariant mass spectrum. With these amplitudes, one can calculate the hadronic vacuum polarization form factors of these processes. The leading order contributions of $\sigma(e^+e^- \to K\bar{K}\pi)$ to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$, is obtained as $a_\mu^{\rm HVP,LO}(e^+e^- \to K\bar{K}\pi)=(3.079\pm0.088)\times10^{-10}$ up to $E_{\rm cm}=2.3$ GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09994v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutrino experiments utilize heavy nuclear targets to achieve high statistics neutrino-nucleus interaction event rate, which leads to systematic uncertainties in the oscillation parameters due to the nuclear effects and uncertainties in the cross-section. Understanding the interaction of neutrinos with the nucleus becomes crucial in determining the oscillation parameters with high precision. We investigate the uncertainty in quasi-elastic interaction due to nuclear effects by selecting exactly 1 proton, 0 pions, and any number of neutrons in the final state in DUNE and MicroBooNE detectors, and the effects on the neutrino oscillation in the DUNE detector. The calorimetric method with this selection can be used for accurate neutrino energy reconstruction in the quasi-elastic channel where the nuclear effects are inevitable.</description>

Abstract: The modifications imprinted on jets due to their interaction with Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) are assessed by comparing samples of jets produced in nucleus-nucleus collisions and proton-proton collisions. The standard procedure ignores the effect of bin migration by comparing specific observables for jet populations at the same reconstructed jet transverse momentum ($p_T$). Since jet $p_T$ is itself modified by interaction with QGP, all such comparisons confound QGP induced modifications with changes that are simply a consequence of comparing jets that started out differently. The quantile matching procedure introduced by Brewer et al. directly estimates average fractional jet energy loss ($Q_{AA}$) and can thus mitigate this $p_T$ migration effect. In this work, we validate the procedure in more realistic scenarios that include medium response. We study the evolution of $Q_{AA}$ with jet radius, its sensitivity to minimum particle $p_T$ and medium response as implemented in two different models for jet evolution in heavy-ion collisions. Further, we use this procedure to establish that the difference between inclusive jet and $\gamma+$jet nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) is dominated by differences in the spectral shape, leaving the colour charge of the jet initiating parton with a lesser role to play. Additionally, we compare $Q_{AA}$ to an experimentally proposed proxy for fractional jet energy loss, $S_{loss}$, showing that both quantities are similar, although the former provides a more clear physical interpretation. Finally, we show the size of the $p_T$ migration correction for four different substructure observables and how to reliably use the quantile procedure experimentally to improve existing measurements.</description>
