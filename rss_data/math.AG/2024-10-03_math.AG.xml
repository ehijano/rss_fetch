      <title>Moduli space of weighted pointed stable curves and toric topology of Grassmann manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We relate the theory of moduli spaces $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,\mathcal{A}}$ of stable weighted curves of genus $0$ to the equivariant topology of complex Grassmann manifolds $G_{n,2}$, with the canonical action of the compact torus $T^n$. We prove that all spaces $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,\mathcal{A}}$ can be isomorphically or up to birational morphisms embedded in $G_{n,2}/T^n$ . The crucial role for proving this result play the chamber decomposition of the hypersimplex $\Delta _{n,2}$ which corresponds to $(\mathbb{C} ^{\ast})^{n}$-stratification of $G_{n,2}$ and the spaces of parameters over the chambers, which are subspaces in $G_{n,2}/T^n$. We show that the points of these moduli spaces $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0, \mathcal{A}}$ have the geometric realization as the points of the spaces of parameters over the chambers. We single out the characteristic categories among such moduli spaces. The morphisms in these categories correspond to the natural projections between the universal space of parameters and the spaces of parameters over the chambers. As a corollary, we obtain the realization of the orbit space $G_{n,2}/T^n$ as an universal object for the introduced categories. As one of our main results we describe the structure of the canonical projection from the Deligne-Mumford compactification to the Losev-Manin compactification of $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$, using the embedding of $\mathcal{M}_{0, n}\subset \bar{L}_{0, n, 2}$ in $(\mathbb{C} P^{1})^{N}$, $N=\binom{n-2}{2}$, the action of the algebraic torus $(\mathbb{C} ^{\ast})^{n-3}$ on $(\mathbb{C} P^{1})^{N}$ for which $\bar{L}_{0, n, 2}$ is invariant, and the realization of the Losev-Manin compactification as the corresponding permutohedral toric variety.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and parity in Frobenius action on cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Newton polygons of Frobenius on the crystalline cohomology of proper smooth varieties satisfy a symmetry that results, in the case of projective smooth varieties, from Poincar\'e duality and the hard Lefschetz theorem. As a corollary, we deduce that the Betti numbers in odd degrees of any proper smooth variety over a field are even (a consequence of Hodge symmetry in characteristic zero), answering an old question of Serre. Then we give a generalization and a refinement for arbitrary varieties over finite fields, in response to later questions of Serre and of Katz.</description>

      <title>Entire curves in C-pairs with large irregularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the fundamental theorem of Bloch-Ochiai to the context of C-pairs: If (X, D) is a C-pair with large irregularity, then no entire C-curve in X is ever dense. In its most general form, the paper's main theorem applies to normal K\"ahler pairs with arbitrary singularities. However, it also strengthens known results for compact K\"ahler manifolds without boundary, as it applies to some settings that the classic Bloch-Ochiai theorem does not address.
  The proof builds on work of Kawamata, Ueno, and Noguchi, recasting parabolic Nevanlinna theory as a "Nevanlinna theory for C-pairs". We hope the approach might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Periods in Families and Derivatives of Period Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth proper family $\phi:X\rightarrow S$, we study the (quasi)-periods of the fibers of $\phi$ as (germs of) functions on $S$. We show that they field they generate has the same algebraic closure as that given by the flag variety co-ordinates parametrizing the corresponding Hodge filtration, together with their derivatives. Moreover, in the more general context of an arbitrary flat vector bundle, we determine the transcendence degree of the function field generated by the flat coordinates of algebraic sections. Our results are inspired by and generalize work of Bertrand--Zudilin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a smooth scheme X with an action by an affine algebraic group G, we give a formula to compute the Nisnevich sheaf of the motivic connected components of the quotient stack [X/G] in the case of an orbifold. We apply it to identify all the $\mathbb{A}^1$-connected stacky curves and prove the $\mathbb{A}^1$ -connectedness of the moduli stack of elliptic curves. We also prove homotopy purity for the smooth algebraic stacks and recover a computation of the Picard group of stacky orbifold curves by computing their mixed motive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a connected reductive group G over the finite field of order p and a cocharacter of G over the algebraic closure of the finite field, we can define G-Zips. The collection of these G-Zips form an algebraic stack which is a stack quotient of G. In this paper we study the K-theory rings of this quotient stack, focusing on the Grothendieck group. Under the additional assumption that the derived group is simply connected, the Grothendieck group is described as a quotient of the representation ring of the Levi subgroup centralising the cocharacter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a general result on the existence of irreducible symplectic compactifications of non-compact Lagrangian fibrations. As an application, we show that the relative Jacobian fibration of cubic fivefolds containing a fixed cubic fourfold can be compactified by a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial terminal irreducible symplectic variety with the second Betti number at least 24, and admits a Lagrangian fibration whose base is a weighted projective space. In particular, it belongs to a new deformation type of irreducible symplectic varieties.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we present a topological proof of the generalized Lelong-Poincar\'e formula. More precisely, when the zero locus of a section has a pure codimension equal to the rank of a holomorphic vector bundle, the top Chern class of the vector bundle corresponds to the cycle class of the schematic zero locus of the section in complex Bott-Chern cohomology.</description>

      <title>Descent and generation for noncommutative coherent algebras over schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our work investigates a form of descent, in the fppf and h topologies, for generation of triangulated categories obtained from noncommutative coherent algebras over schemes. In addition, also the behaviour of generation with respect to the derived pushforward of proper morphisms is studied. This allows us to exhibit many new examples where the associated bounded derived categories of coherent sheaves admit strong generators. We achieve our main results by combining Matthew's concept of descendability with Stevenson's tensor actions on triangulated categories, allowing us to generalize statements regarding generation into the noncommutative setting. In particular, we establish a noncommutative generalization of Aoki's result to Azumaya algebras over quasi-excellent schemes. Moreover, as a byproduct of the tensor action, we extend Olander's result on countable Rouquier dimension to the noncommutative setting for Azumaya algebras over derived splinters, and we extend a result of Ballard-Iyengar-Lank-Mukhopadhyay-Pollitz regarding strong generation for schemes of prime characteristic to the case of Azumaya algebras.</description>

      <title>Ordinary primes in Hilbert modular varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01182v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture, often attributed to Serre, asserts that any motive over any number field has infinitely many ordinary reductions (in the sense that the Newton polygon coincides with the Hodge polygon). In the case of Hilbert modular cuspforms $f$ of parallel weight $(2, \cdots , 2)$, we show how to produce more ordinary primes by using the Sato-Tate equidistribution and combining it with the Galois theory of the Hecke field. Under the assumption of stronger forms of Sato-Tate equidistribution, we get stronger (but conditional) results. In the case of higher weights, we formulate the ordinariness conjecture for submotives of the intersection cohomology of proper algebraic varieties with motivic coefficients, and verify it for the motives whose $l$-adic Galois realisations are abelian on a finite index subgroup. We get some results for Hilbert cuspforms of weight $(3, \cdots , 3)$, weaker than those for $(2, \cdots , 2)$.</description>

      <title>Continuity of the solution map for hyperbolic polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbolic polynomials are monic real-rooted polynomials. By Bronshtein's theorem, the increasingly ordered roots of a hyperbolic polynomial of degree $d$ with $C^{d-1,1}$ coefficients are locally Lipschitz and this solution map ``coefficients-to-roots'' is bounded. We prove continuity of the solution map from hyperbolic polynomials of degree $d$ with $C^d$ coefficients to their increasingly ordered roots with respect to the $C^d$ structure on the source space and the Sobolev $W^{1,q}$ structure, for all $1 \le q&lt;\infty$, on the target space. Continuity fails for $q=\infty$. As a consequence, we obtain continuity of the local surface area of the roots.</description>

      <title>On the continuity of the solution map for polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we proved that the continuous roots of a monic polynomial of degree $d$ whose coefficients depend in a $C^{d-1,1}$ way on real parameters belong to the Sobolev space $W^{1,q}$ for all $1\le q&lt;d/(d-1)$. This is optimal. We obtained uniform bounds that show that the solution map ``coefficients-to-roots'' is bounded with respect to the $C^{d-1,1}$ and the Sobolev $W^{1,q}$ structures on source and target space, respectively. In this paper, we prove that the solution map is continuous, provided that we consider the $C^d$ structure on the space of coefficients. Since there is no canonical choice of an ordered $d$-tuple of the roots, we work in the space of $d$-valued Sobolev functions equipped with a strong notion of convergence. We also interpret the results in the Wasserstein space on the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Cyclic stratum of Frobenius manifolds, Borel-Laplace $(\boldsymbol\alpha,\boldsymbol\beta)$-multitransforms, and integral representations of solutions of Quantum Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.08262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2005.08262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we introduce the notion of "cyclic stratum" of a Frobenius manifold $M$. This is the set of points of the extended manifold $\mathbb C^*\times M$ at which the unit vector field is a cyclic vector for the isomonodromic system defined by the flatness condition of the extended deformed connection. The study of the geometry of the complement of the cyclic stratum is addressed. We show that at points of the cyclic stratum, the isomonodromic system attached to $M$ can be reduced to a scalar differential equation, called the "master differential equation" of $M$. In the case of Frobenius manifolds coming from Gromov-Witten theory, namely quantum cohomologies of smooth projective varieties, such a construction reproduces the notion of quantum differential equation.
  In the second part of the paper, we introduce two multilinear transforms, called "Borel-Laplace $(\boldsymbol \alpha,\boldsymbol\beta)$-multitransforms", on spaces of Ribenboim formal power series with exponents and coefficients in an arbitrary finite dimensional $\mathbb C$-algebra $A$. When $A$ is specialized to the cohomology of smooth projective varieties, the integral forms of the Borel-Laplace $(\boldsymbol \alpha,\boldsymbol\beta)$-multitransforms are used in order to rephrase the Quantum Lefschetz Theorem. This leads to explicit Mellin-Barnes integral representations of solutions of the quantum differential equations for a wide class of smooth projective varieties, including Fano complete intersections in projective spaces.
  In the third and final part of the paper, as an application, we show how to use the new analytic tools, introduced in the previous parts, in order to study the quantum differential equations of Hirzebruch surfaces. This finally leads to the proof of Dubrovin Conjecture for all Hirzebruch surfaces.</description>

      <title>Riemann-Hilbert-Birkhoff inverse problem for semisimple flat $F$-manifolds, and convergence of oriented associativity potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.06329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of classification of quasi-homogeneous formal power series providing solutions of the oriented associativity equations. Such a classification is performed by introducing a system of monodromy local moduli on the space of formal germs of homogeneous semisimple flat $F$-manifolds. This system of local moduli is well-defined on the complement of the "strictly doubly resonant" locus, namely a locus of formal germs of flat $F$-manifolds manifesting both coalescences of canonical coordinates at the origin, and resonances of their "conformal dimensions". It is shown how the solutions of the oriented associativity equations can be reconstructed from the knowledge of the monodromy local moduli via a Riemann-Hilbert-Birkhoff boundary value problem. Furthermore, standing on results of B.Malgrange and C.Sabbah, it is proved that any formal homogeneous semisimple flat $F$-manifold, which is not strictly doubly resonant, is actually convergent. Our semisimplicity criterion for convergence is also reformulated in terms of solutions of Losev-Manin commutativity equations, growth estimates of correlators of $F$-cohomological field theories, and solutions of open Witten-Dijkgraaf-Verlinde-Verlinde equations.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a four-term long exact sequence that relates the cohomology of a smooth variety admitting a projective morphism onto a projective base to the cohomology of the open set obtained by removing the preimage of a general linear section. We show that this sequence respects the perverse Leray filtration and induces exact sequences of mixed Hodge structures on its graded pieces. We conjecture that this exact sequence should be thought of as mirror to the Clemens-Schmid sequence, which describes the cohomology of degenerations. We exhibit this mirror relationship explicitly for all Type II and many Type III degenerations of K3 surfaces. In three dimensions, we show that for Tyurin degenerations of Calabi-Yau threefolds our conjecture is a consequence of existing mirror conjectures, and we explicitly verify our conjecture for a more complicated degeneration of the quintic threefold.</description>

      <title>On the universality of integrable deformations of solutions of degenerate Riemann-Hilbert-Birkhoff problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.14577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the classification problem of integrable deformations of solutions of "degenerate" Riemann-Hilbert-Birkhoff (RHB) problems. These consist of those RHB problems whose initial datum has diagonal pole part with coalescing eigenvalues. On the one hand, according to theorems of B.Malgrange, M.Jimbo, T.Miwa, and K.Ueno, in the non-degenerate case, there exists a universal integrable deformation inducing (via a unique map) all other deformations. On the other hand, in the degenerate case, C.Sabbah proved (arXiv:1711.08514v4), under sharp conditions, the existence of an integrable deformation of solutions, sharing many properties of the one constructed by Malgrange-Jimbo-Miwa-Ueno. Albeit the integrable deformation constructed by Sabbah is not, stricto sensu, universal, we prove that it satisfies a $relative$ universal property. We show the existence and uniqueness of a maximal class of integrable deformations all induced (via a unique map) by Sabbah's integrable deformation. Furthermore, we show that such a class is large enough to include all generic integrable deformations whose pole and deformation parts are locally holomorphically diagonalizable. In itinere, we also obtain a characterization of holomorphic matrix-valued maps which are locally holomorphically Jordanizable. This extends, to the case of several complex variables, already known results independently obtained by Ph.G.A.Thijsse and W.Wasow.</description>

      <title>Borel $(\alpha,\beta)$-multitransforms and Quantum Leray-Hirsch: integral representations of solutions of quantum differential equations for $\mathbb P^1$-bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the integration problem of the isomonodromic system of quantum differential equations ($qDE$s) associated with the quantum cohomology of $\mathbb P^1$-bundles on Fano varieties. It is shown that bases of solutions of the $qDE$ of the total space of the $\mathbb P^1$-bundle can be reconstructed from the datum of bases of solutions of the corresponding $qDE$ associated with the base space. This represents a quantum analog of the classical Leray-Hirsch theorem in the context of the isomonodromic approach to quantum cohomology. The reconstruction procedure of the solutions can be performed in terms of some integral transforms, introduced in arXiv:2005.08262, called $Borel$ $(\alpha,\beta)$-$multitransf\!orms$. We emphasize the emergence, in the explicit integral formulas, of an interesting sequence of special functions (closely related to iterated partial derivatives of the B\"ohmer-Tricomi incomplete Gamma function) as integral kernels. Remarkably, these integral kernels have a universal feature, being independent of the specifically chosen $\mathbb P^1$-bundle. When applied to projective bundles on products of projective spaces, our results give Mellin-Barnes integral representations of solutions of $qDE$s. As an example, we show how to integrate the $qDE$ of blow-up of $\mathbb P^2$ at one point via Borel multitransforms of solutions of the $qDE$ of $\mathbb P^1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the first example of a stable hyperholomorphic vector bundle of rank five on every hyper-K\"ahler manifold of $\mathrm{K3}^{[2]}$-type whose deformation space is smooth of dimension ten. Its moduli space is birational to a hyper-K\"ahler manifold of type OG10. This provides evidence for the expectation that moduli spaces of sheaves on a hyper-K\"ahler could lead to new examples of hyper-K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

      <title>Some results of the fake quadrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11175v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a criterion to assess both the effectiveness and ampleness of divisors on fake quadrics. As applications, we first demonstrate that the fake quadric $S$ possesses the bounded cohomology property. This property is characterized by the existence of a positive constant $c_{S}$ such that $$h^1(\CO_S(C))\leq c_S h^0(\CO_S(C))$$ for every curve $C \subset S$. Subsequently, we show that no fake quadric can be embedded in $\mathbb P^4$. Finally, we conclude that any simply-connected fake quadric $S$ is not a Mori dream space, and if the linear system $\rvert C \rvert &gt;0$, then arithmetic genus $p_{a}(C)\geq 6$. We believe that this result may offer insights for solving the problem of the existence of simply-connected fake quadric.</description>

      <title>Extension of relative rigid homomorphisms from the formal multiplicative group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theorem of L\"utkebohmert states that a rigid group homomorphism from the formal multiplicative group to a smooth commutative rigid group $G$, with relatively compact image, can be extended to a homomorphism from the rigid multiplicative group to $G$. In this paper, we prove a relative version of this theorem over a geometrically reduced quasi-compact quasi-separated rigid space. The relative theorem is proved under an additional hypothesis that some open relative subgroup of $G$ has good reduction. This theorem is useful for studying rigid uniformisation of abelian or semiabelian varieties in a relative setting.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth Fano threefold over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic. Assume that $|-K_X|$ is very ample and each of the index and the Picard number is equal to one. We prove that $3 \leq g \leq 12$ and $g \neq 11$ for the genus $g$ of $X$. Moreover, we show that there exists no smooth curve on $X$ along which the blowup is Fano.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13661v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note is concerned with generation in the derived category of bounded complexes with coherent cohomology over a Noetherian scheme. We demonstrate a flavor of `d\'{e}vissage' by identifying two explicit collections of structure sheaves for closed subschemes that classically generate the bounded derived category. Amongst the two, one consists of those supported on the singular locus of the scheme. Moreover, building from the work of Aoki, we show the essential image of the derived pushforward along a proper surjective morphism of Noetherian schemes strongly generates the targets bounded derived category.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we discuss a streamlined proof of a result due to Milne computing special values of zeta functions for smooth proper schemes over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. The proof will give a natural interpretation of the correction factor in terms of invariants constructed from prismatic cohomology, studied by Morin. We then discuss the modifications needed when passing from the smooth case to an arbitrary scheme $X$ of finite type over $\mathbb{F}_q$, at least assuming a strong form of resolution of singularities.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove a nonabelian Hodge correspondence for principal bundles on a smooth variety $X$ in positive characteristic, which generalizes the Ogus-Vologodsky correspondence for vector bundles. Then we extend the correspondence to logahoric torsors over a log pair $(X,D)$, where $D$ a reduced normal crossing divisor in $X$. As an intermediate step, we prove a correspondence between principal bundles on root stacks $\mathscr{X}$ and parahoric torsors on $(X,D)$, which generalizes the correspondence on curves given by Balaji--Seshadri to higher dimensional case.</description>

Abstract: In the first part of this paper, we give a new analytical proof of a theorem of C. Sabbah on integrable deformations of meromorphic connections on $\mathbb P^1$ with coalescing irregular singularities of Poincar\'e rank 1, and generalizing a previous result of B. Malgrange. In the second part of this paper, as an application, we prove that any semisimple formal Frobenius manifold (over $\mathbb C$), with unit and Euler field, is the completion of an analytic pointed germ of a Dubrovin-Frobenius manifold. In other words, any formal power series, which provides a quasi-homogenous solution of WDVV equations and defines a semisimple Frobenius algebra at the origin, is actually convergent under no further tameness assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.00249v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a quantum loop group $\mathbf{U}^+_Q$ associated to an arbitrary quiver $Q=(I,E)$ and maximal set of deformation parameters, with generators indexed by $I \times \mathbb{Z}$ and some explicit quadratic and cubic relations. We prove that $\mathbf{U}^+_Q$ is isomorphic to the (generic, small) shuffle algebra associated to the quiver $Q$ and hence, by [Neg21a], to the localized K-theoretic Hall algebra of $Q$. For the quiver with one vertex and $g$ loops, this yields a presentation of the spherical Hall algebra of a (generic) smooth projective curve of genus $g$ (invoking the results of [SV12]). We extend the above results to the case of non-generic parameters satisfying a certain natural metric condition. As an application, we obtain a description by generators and relations of the subalgebra generated by absolutely cuspidal eigenforms of the Hall algebra of an arbitrary smooth projective curve (invoking the results of [KSV17]).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a geometric relation between closed and open string amplitudes at one-loop. After imposing a homological splitting on the world-sheet torus twisted intersection theory is used to establish a one-loop double copy relation. The latter expresses a closed string amplitude by a pair of open string amplitudes and twisted intersection numbers. These inner products on the vector space of allowed differential forms are related to the twisted homology and cohomology groups associated with the Riemann-Wirtinger integral.</description>

Abstract: We consider the space of holomorphic maps from a compact Riemann surface to a projective space blown up at finitely many points. We show that the homology of this mapping space equals that of the space of continuous maps that intersect the exceptional divisors positively, once the degree of the maps is sufficiently positive compared to the degree of homology. The proof uses a version of Vassiliev's method of simplicial resolution. As a consequence, we obtain a homological stability result for rational curves on the degree $5$ del Pezzo surface, which is analogous to a case of the Batyrev--Manin conjectures on rational point counts.</description>

      <title>Fay identities for polylogarithms on higher-genus Riemann surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent construction of polylogarithms on Riemann surfaces of arbitrary genus in arXiv:2306.08644 is based on a flat connection assembled from single-valued non-holomorphic integration kernels that depend on two points on the Riemann surface. In this work, we construct and prove infinite families of bilinear relations among these integration kernels that are necessary for the closure of the space of higher-genus polylogarithms under integration over the points on the surface. Our bilinear relations generalize the Fay identities among the genus-one Kronecker-Eisenstein kernels to arbitrary genus. The multiple-valued meromorphic kernels in the flat connection of Enriquez are conjectured to obey higher-genus Fay identities of exactly the same form as their single-valued non-holomorphic counterparts. We initiate the applications of Fay identities to derive functional relations among higher-genus polylogarithms involving either single-valued or meromorphic integration kernels.</description>
