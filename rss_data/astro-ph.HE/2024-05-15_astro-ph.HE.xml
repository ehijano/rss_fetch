      <title>Plasma Effects on Resonant Phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of autoionizing resonances in atomic systems and processes is reviewed. Theoretical framework for treating resonances in the coupled channel approximation using the R-matrix method, as well as approximations related to plasma applications are described. The former entails large-scale atomic computations, and the latter is based on a new method for including collisional, Stark, thermal and other broadening mechanisms. We focus particularly on the problem of opacities calculations in high-energy-density (HED) plasmas such as stellar interiors and inertial confinement fusion devices. The treatment is generally relevant to radiative and collisional processes as the cross sections become energy-temperature-density dependent. While the computational difficulty increases considerably, the reaction rates are significantly affected. The related issue of the Boltzmann-Saha equation-of-state and its variants in local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (LTE) is also explored as the intermediary between atomic data on the one hand and plasma environments on the other.</description>

      <title>Extreme Nuclear Transients Resulting from the Tidal Disruption of Intermediate Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern transient surveys now routinely discover flares resulting from tidal disruption events (TDEs) which occur when stars, typically $\sim0.5-2$ M$_{\odot}$, are ripped apart after passing too close to a supermassive black hole. We present three examples of a new class of extreme nuclear transients (ENTs) that we interpret as the tidal disruption of intermediate mass ($\sim3-10$ M$_{\odot}$) stars. Each is coincident with their host-galaxy nucleus and exhibits a smooth ($&lt;10$% excess variability), luminous ($2-7\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$), and long-lived ($&gt;150$ days) flare. ENTs are extremely rare ($\geq1\times10^{-3}$ Gpc$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$) compared to any other known class of transients. They are at least twice as energetic ($0.5-2.5\times 10^{53}$ erg) as any other known transient and these extreme energetics rule out stellar origins.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric muons and their variations with temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seasonal variations of atmospheric muons are traditionally interpreted in terms of an effective temperature that relates the atmospheric temperature profile at a given time to the dependence of muon production on atmospheric depth. This paper aims to review and generalize the treatment of muon production and effective temperature that has been used to interpret seasonal variations of atmospheric muons by many experiments. The formalism is developed both in integral form -- for application to compact detectors at a fixed depth that record all muons with $E_\mu &gt; E_\mu^\mathrm{min}$ -- and in differential form -- for application to extended detectors like IceCube, KM3NeT, and Baikal-GVD, where the rates are proportional to energy-dependent effective areas.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical simulations of proton ingestion flashes in Type I X-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the first multidimensional fluid simulations of thermonuclear helium ignition underneath a hydrogen-rich shell. This situation is relevant to Type I X-ray bursts on neutron stars which accrete from a hydrogen-rich companion. Using the low Mach number fluid code MAESTROeX, we investigate the growth of the convection zone due to nuclear burning, and the evolution of the chemical abundances in the atmosphere of the star. We also examine the convective boundary mixing processes which cause the evolution to differ significantly from previous one-dimensional simulations that rely on mixing-length theory. We find that the convection zone grows outwards as penetrating fluid elements cool the overlying radiative layer, rather than directly from the increasing entropy of the convection zone itself. Simultaneously, these flows efficiently mix composition, carrying carbon out of, and protons into the convection zone even before contact with the hydrogen shell. We discuss the implications of these effects for future modeling of these events and observations.</description>

      <title>The X-ray rise and fall of the Recurrent Symbiotic System T CrB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of publicly available NuSTAR, Suzaku and XMM-Newton observations of the recurrent symbiotic system T CrB covering the 2006.77-2022.66 yr period. The X-ray spectra are analysed by adopting a model that includes a reflection component produced by the presence of the accretion disk. Our best-fit model requires a disk with a radius of 100 AU, effective thickness of 10 AU, averaged column density 10$^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$ and orientation of 50$^{\circ}$ with respect to the line of sight that contributes significantly to the total X-ray flux detected from T CrB, in addition to naturally producing the emission of the 6.4 keV Fe line. The spectral analysis suggests that the temperature of the boundary layer evolved from 14.8 keV in the steady-state phase (before 2016), to 2.8 keV in the 2017.24 epoch, to finally stabilise to about $\sim$8 keV in the subsequent epochs. Variations in the plasma temperature of the boundary layer are attributed to the evolution of the mass accretion rate using theoretical interpretations from an accretion disk model. The presence of emission lines in the high-resolution XMM-Newton RGS spectrum of 2017.24 prevents from adopting a black body emission model to fit the soft X-ray range. Instead, we use plasma emission models that suggest the presence of adiabatically-shocked gas produced by gas velocities of 110-200 km s$^{-1}$, very likely tracing jet-like ejections similar to what is found in other symbiotic systems. Given the the analysis of X-ray and optical data together, we show that T CrB has a similar evolution as black hole binaries, accreting neutron stars and AGN in the hardness-intensity diagram.</description>

      <title>Universality in supernova gravitational waves with proto-neutron star properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave signals from core-collapse supernovae are one of the important observables for extracting the information of dense matter. To extract the properties of proto-neutron stars produced via core-collapse supernovae by asteroseismology, we perform a linear perturbation analysis using data obtained from two-dimensional numerical simulations. We employ 12 and 20 solar-mass progenitors and compare two different treatments of gravity. One is a general relativistic one with a conformal flatness condition and the other is an effective gravitational potential mimicking the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff solution. We discuss how the frequencies of the proto-neutron star oscillations corresponding to the gravitational wave signals in the simulations depend on the proto-neutron star properties. In our models, we find that the gravitational wave frequencies of the proto-neutron stars determined with the Cowling approximation can be expressed to very good approximation as a function of the proto-neutron star average density almost independently of the progenitor mass, treatment of gravity in the simulations, and the interpolations in the simulations. On the other hand, if one considers the gravitational wave frequencies as a function of the surface gravity of proto-neutron stars, such a relation appears sensitive to the treatment of gravity and other numerical details in the simulations. Thus, the average density of proto-neutron stars seems more suitable for universally expressing the supernova gravitational wave frequencies, instead of the surface gravity.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Temperature Relaxation in the Postshock Plasma of the Northwestern Limb of SN 1006</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heating of charged particles via collisionless shocks, while ubiquitous in the universe, is an intriguing yet puzzling plasma phenomenon. One outstanding question is how electrons and ions approach an equilibrium after they were heated to different immediate-postshock temperatures. In order to fill the significant lack of observational information of the downstream temperature-relaxation process, we observe a thermal-dominant X-ray filament in the northwest of SN~1006 with Chandra. We divide this region into four layers with a thickness of 15$^{\prime\prime}$ or 0.16 pc each, and fit each spectrum by a non-equilibrium ionization collisional plasma model. The electron temperature was found to increase toward downstream from 0.52-0.62 keV to 0.82-0.95 keV on a length scale of 60 arcsec (or 0.64 pc). This electron temperature is lower than thermal relaxation processes via Coulomb scattering, requiring some other effects such as plasma mixture due to turbulence and/or projection effects, etc, which we hope will be resolved with future X-ray calorimeter missions such as XRISM and Athena.</description>

      <title>A closer look at the host-galaxy environment of high-velocity Type Ia supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggested that the ejecta velocity of Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) is a promising indicator in distinguishing the progenitor systems and explosion mechanisms. By classifying the SNe Ia based on their ejecta velocities, studies found SNe Ia with high Si II $\lambda$6355 velocities (HV SNe Ia; v&gt;12000 km/s) tend to be physically different from their normal-velocity counterparts (NV SNe Ia). In this work, we revisit the low-$z$ sample studied in previous work and closely look into the spatially resolved environment local to the site of SN explosion. Our results reveal a possible trend (at $2.4\sigma$ significance) that HV SNe Ia are likely associated with older stellar populations than NV SNe Ia. While the trend is inconclusive, the local host-galaxy sample studied in this work is likely skewed toward massive galaxies, limiting the parameter space that we would like to investigate from the original parent sample. Nevertheless, our results do not rule out the possibility that parameters other than the host-galaxy age (such as metallicity) could be the underlying factors driving the differences between HV and NV SNe Ia due to the limitation of our dataset.</description>

      <title>Two models for the orbital modulation of $\gamma$-rays in Cyg X-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the currently available $\gamma$-ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope on Cyg X-3. Thanks to its very strong $\gamma$-ray activity during 2018--2021, the data quality has significantly improved. We study the strong orbital modulation of the $\gamma$-rays observed during at high $\gamma$-ray fluxes. The modulation, as found earlier, is well modeled by anisotropic Compton scattering of the donor blackbody emission by relativistic electrons in a jet strongly misaligned with respect to the orbital axis. We confirm that this model fits well both the average $\gamma$-ray modulation light curve and the spectrum. However, we find that if the jet is aligned with the spin axis of a rotating black hole, it would undergo geodetic precession with the period of $\sim$50 years. However, its presence is ruled out by both the $\gamma$-ray and radio data. Therefore, we consider an alternative model in which the average jet direction jet is aligned, but it is bent to outside the orbit owing to the thrust of the donor stellar wind, and thus precesses at the orbital period. The $\gamma$-ray modulation appears then owing to the variable Doppler boosting of synchrotron self-Compton jet emission. The model also fits well the data. However, the fitted bending angle is much larger than the theoretical one based on the binary and wind parameters as currently known. Thus, both models disagree with important aspects of our current theoretical understanding of the system. We discuss possible ways to find the correct model.</description>

      <title>Continuum emission from within the plunging region of black hole discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal continuum emission observed from accreting black holes across X-ray bands has the potential to be leveraged as a powerful probe of the mass and spin of the central black hole. The vast majority of existing ``continuum fitting'' models neglect emission sourced at and within the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the black hole. Numerical simulations, however, find non-zero emission sourced from these regions. In this work we extend existing techniques by including the emission sourced from within the plunging region, utilising new analytical models which reproduce the properties of numerical accretion simulations. We show that in general the neglected intra-ISCO emission produces a hot-and-small quasi-blackbody component, but can also produce a weak power-law tail for more extreme parameter regions. A similar hot-and-small blackbody component has been added in by hand in an ad-hoc manner to previous analyses of X-ray binary spectra. We show that the X-ray spectrum of MAXI J1820+070 in a soft-state outburst is extremely well described by a full Kerr black hole disc, while conventional models which neglect intra-ISCO emission are unable to reproduce the data. We believe this represents the first robust detection of intra-ISCO emission in the literature, and allows additional constraints to be placed on the MAXI J1820+070 black hole spin which must be low $a_\bullet &lt; 0.5$ to allow a detectable intra-ISCO region. Emission from within the ISCO is the dominant emission component in the MAXI J1820+070 spectrum between $6$ and $10$ keV, highlighting the necessity of including this region. Our continuum fitting model is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>SRG/ART-XC all-sky X-ray survey: Catalog of sources detected during the first five surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated catalog of sources detected by the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope aboard the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory during its all-sky survey. It is based on the data of the first four and the partially completed fifth scans of the sky (ARTSS1-5). The catalog comprises 1545 sources detected in the 4-12 keV energy band. The achieved sensitivity ranges between $\sim 4\times 10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ near the ecliptic plane and $\sim 7\times 10^{-13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ near the ecliptic poles, which is a $\sim$30-50% improvement over the previous version of the catalog based on the first two all-sky scans (ARTSS12). There are $\sim 130$ objects, excluding the expected contribution of spurious detections, that were not known as X-ray sources before the SRG/ART-XC all-sky survey. We provide information, partly based on our ongoing follow-up optical spectroscopy program, on the identification and classification of the majority of the ARTSS1-5 sources (1463), of which 173 are tentative at the moment. The majority of the classified objects (964) are extragalactic, a small fraction (30) are located in the Local Group of galaxies, and 469 are Galactic. The dominant classes of objects in the catalog are active galactic nuclei (911) and cataclysmic variables (192).</description>

      <title>Mixing of hot shocked plasma with cold gas in Nova YZ Ret 2020</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of bright X-ray emission lines that appear late in a nova eruption remains largely a puzzle. We present two high-resolution X-ray grating spectra of the classical nova YZ Ret, observed 77 and 115 days post-eruption, using XMM-Newton and Chandra , respectively. Both spectra feature resolved emission lines blueshifted by $v = -1500$ km s$^{-1}$ and broadened by $\sigma_v=500$ km s$^{-1}$. The two spectra are well described by a collisionally ionized plasma of $kT\sim 70$ eV that dimmed by a factor of $\sim40$ between the two exposures. The spectra also show narrow radiative recombination continua (RRCs) of C$^{+4}$, C$^{+5}$, and N$^{+5}$, indicating the interaction of the hot ionized plasma with cold electrons of $kT\sim 2$ eV. The high-$n$ Rydberg series of C$^{+4}$ is anomalously bright, allowing us to measure the electron density through continuum lowering, which is in agreement with the He-like N$^{+5}$ density diagnostic of $n_e=(1.7\pm0.4)\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$. The high population of these high-$n$ levels constitutes the best evidence to date of charge exchange (CX) with neutral H in an astrophysical ionized plasma. The remarkable fact that the velocity and plasma temperature are the same after 38 days, despite the high density and decreasing flux is evidence for ongoing heating. We suggest the heating is due to a reverse shock in the nova ejecta, which forms a thin X-ray shell. The narrow RRCs and CX are attributed to direct mixing with cold gas, which overtakes the hot plasma either from the shock front, or through the contact discontinuity.</description>

      <title>Searches for Galactic Neutrinos with the IceCube Neutrino observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sources of galactic charged cosmic rays are so far unknown, because their arrival directions are randomized in the galactic magnetic field. Objects accelerating hadrons are expected to produce high-energy neutrinos. In addition, a diffuse galactic neutrino flux is predicted from interactions of galactic cosmic rays with matter during propagation through the galaxy. The IceCube neutrino observatory at the geographic South Pole instruments a cubic kilometer of ice with optical modules to detect the Cherenkov light of particles produced in neutrino interactions. Operating for more than a decade in its complete detector configuration, IceCube is in a unique position to search for neutrino sources. This contribution discusses the searches for a diffuse flux of neutrinos as wells as for neutrinos from candidate point sources and extended sources in the galactic plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present recent work on the Spectra of IceCube Neutrino (SIN) candidate sources project. We defined a selection of candidate neutrino sources by identifying blazars in the vicinity of IceCube's highest-energy neutrinos. We now want to shed light on these source candidates' nature, starting at their redshift, continuing with their black hole masses, their variability, and, for the first time, a combined photon-neutrino spectral energy distribution. We present their hybrid spectral energy distributions (combining photon and neutrino fluxes), investigate the sources' variability in the near-infrared, optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray bands, and compare the variability with a blazar sample of non-candidate sources. Furthermore, we search for flares at the arrival time of the high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Production Mechanism of High-Energy Neutrinos from NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of high-energy neutrino signals from the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 provides us with an opportunity to study nonthermal processes near the center of supermassive black holes. Using the IceCube and latest Fermi-LAT data, we present general multimessenger constraints on the energetics of cosmic rays and the size of neutrino emission regions. In the photohadronic scenario, the required cosmic-ray luminosity should be larger than about 1-10% of the Eddington luminosity and the emission radius should be 15 Schwarzschild radii in low-beta plasma and 3 Schwarzschild radii in high-beta plasma. The leptonic scenario overshoots the NuSTAR or Fermi-LAT data for any emission radii we consider, and the required gamma-ray luminosity is much larger than the Eddington luminosity. The beta decay scenario also violates not only the energetics requirement but also gamma-ray constraints especially when the Bethe-Heitler and photomeson production processes are consistently considered. Our results rule out the leptonic and beta decay scenarios in a nearly model-independent manner, and support hadronic mechanisms in magnetically-powered coronae if NGC 1068 is a source of high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent models of AGN disks with radiation from embedded stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brightest steady sources of radiation in the universe, active galactic nuclei (AGN), are powered by gas accretion onto a central supermassive black hole (SMBH). The large sizes and accretion rates implicated in AGN accretion disks are expected to lead to gravitational instability and fragmentation, effectively cutting off mass inflow to the SMBH. Radiative feedback from disk-embedded stars has been invoked to yield marginally stable, steady-state solutions in the outer disks. Here, we examine the consequences of this star formation with a semi-analytical model in which stellar-mass black hole (sBH) remnants in the disk provide an additional source of stabilizing radiative feedback. Assuming star formation seeds the embedded sBH population, we model the time-evolving feedback from both stars and the growing population of accreting sBHs. We find that in the outer disk, the luminosity of the sBHs quickly dominates that of their parent stars. However, because sBHs consume less gas than stars to stabilize the disk, the presence of the sBHs enhances the mass flux to the inner disk. As a result, star formation persists over the lifetime of the AGN, damped in the outer disk, but amplified in a narrow ring in the inner disk. Heating from the embedded sBHs significantly modifies the disk's temperature profile and hardens its spectral energy distribution, and direct emission from the sBHs adds a new hard X ray component, resembling a Compton reflection "hump".</description>

      <title>Probing particle acceleration in Abell 2256: from to 16 MHz to gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Merging galaxy clusters often host spectacular diffuse radio synchrotron sources. These sources can be explained by a non-thermal pool of relativistic electrons accelerated by shocks and turbulence in the intracluster medium. The origin of the pool and details of the cosmic ray transport and acceleration mechanisms in clusters are still open questions. Due to the often extremely steep spectral indices of diffuse radio emission, it is best studied at low frequencies. However, the lowest frequency window available to ground-based telescopes (10-30 MHz) has remained largely unexplored, as radio frequency interference and calibration problems related to the ionosphere become severe. Here, we present LOFAR observations from 16 to 168 MHz targeting the famous cluster Abell 2256. In the deepest-ever images at decametre wavelengths, we detect and resolve the radio halo, radio shock and various steep spectrum sources. We measure standard single power-law behaviour for the radio halo and radio shock spectra and find significant spectral index and curvature fluctuations across the radio halo, indicating an inhomogeneous emitting volume. In contrast to the straight power-law spectra of the large-scale diffuse sources, the various AGN-related sources often show extreme steepening towards higher frequencies and flattening towards low frequencies. We also discover a new fossil plasma source with a steep spectrum between 23 and 144 MHz, with $\alpha=-1.9\pm 0.1$. Finally, by comparing radio and gamma-ray observations, we rule out purely hadronic models for the radio halo origin in Abell 2256, unless the magnetic field strength in the cluster is exceptionally high, which is unsupportable by energetic arguments and inconsistent with the knowledge of other cluster magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave model for neutron star merger remnants with supervised learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a time-domain model for the gravitational waves emitted by equal-mass binary neutron star merger remnants for a fixed equation of state. We construct a large set of numerical relativity simulations for a single equation of state consistent with current constraints, totaling 157 equal-mass binary neutron star merger configurations. The gravitational-wave model is constructed using the supervised learning method of K-nearest neighbor regression. As a first step toward developing a general model with supervised learning methods that accounts for the dependencies on equation of state and the binary masses of the system, we explore the impact of the size of the dataset on the model. We assess the accuracy of the model for a varied dataset size and number density in total binary mass. Specifically, we consider five training sets of $\{ 20,40, 60, 80, 100\}$ simulations uniformly distributed in total binary mass. We evaluate the resulting models in terms of faithfulness using a test set of 30 additional simulations that are not used during training and which are equidistantly spaced in total binary mass. The models achieve faithfulness with maximum values in the range of $0.980$ to $0.995$. We assess our models simulating signals observed by the three-detector network of Advanced LIGO-Virgo. We find that all models with training sets of size equal to or larger than $40$ achieve an unbiased measurement of the main gravitational-wave frequency. We confirm that our results do not depend qualitatively on the choice of the (fixed) equation of state. We conclude that training sets, with a minimum size of $40$ simulations, or a number density of approximately $11$ simulations per $0.1\,M_\odot$ of total binary mass, suffice for the construction of faithful templates for the post-merger signal for a single equation of state and equal-mass binaries (abbreviated).</description>

      <title>Rapid parameter estimation for pulsar-timing-array datasets with variational inference and normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the gravitational-wave analysis of pulsar-timing-array datasets, parameter estimation is usually performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to explore posterior probability densities. We introduce an alternative procedure that relies instead on stochastic gradient-descent Bayesian variational inference, whereby we obtain the weights of a neural-network approximation of the posterior by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the approximation from the exact posterior. This technique is distinct from simulation-based inference with normalizing flows, since we train the network for a single dataset, rather than the population of all possible datasets, and we require the computation of the data likelihood and its gradient. Unlike Markov Chain methods, our technique can transparently exploit highly parallel computing platforms. This makes it extremely fast on modern graphical processing units, where it can analyze the NANOGrav 15-yr dataset in few tens of minutes, depending on the probabilistic model, as opposed to hours or days with the analysis codes used until now. We expect that this speed will unlock new kinds of astrophysical and cosmological studies of pulsar-timing-array datasets. Furthermore, variational inference would be viable in other contexts of gravitational-wave data analysis as long as differentiable and parallelizable likelihoods are available.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Resonant Axion-Photon Mixing: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many present-day axion searches attempt to probe the mixing of axions and photons, which occurs in the presence of an external magnetic field. While this process is well-understood in a number of simple and idealized contexts, a strongly varying or highly inhomogeneous background can impact the efficiency and evolution of the mixing in a non-trivial manner. In an effort to develop a generalized framework for analyzing axion-photon mixing in arbitrary systems, we focus in this work on directly solving the axion-modified form of Maxwell's equations across a simulation domain with a spatially varying background. We concentrate specifically on understanding resonantly enhanced axion-photon mixing in a highly magnetized plasma, which is a key ingredient for developing precision predictions of radio signals emanating from the magnetospheres of neutron stars. After illustrating the success and accuracy of our approach for simplified limiting cases, we compare our results with a number of analytic solutions recently derived to describe mixing in these systems. We find that our numerical method demonstrates a high level of agreement with one, but only one, of the published results. Interestingly, our method also recovers the mixing between the axion and magnetosonic-t and Alfv\'{e}n modes; these modes cannot escape from the regions of dense plasma, but could non-trivially alter the dynamics in certain environments. Future work will focus on extending our calculations to study resonant mixing in strongly variable backgrounds, mixing in generalized media (beyond the strong magnetic field limit), and the mixing of photons with other light bosonic fields, such as dark photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Horizons and bound photon orbits are defining features of black holes that translate into key features of black hole images. We present a purely geometric proof that spherically symmetric, isolated objects with horizons in gravity theories with null-geodesic propagation of light must display bound photon orbits forming a photon sphere. Identifying the key elements of the proof, we articulate a simpler argument that carries over to more general situations with modified light propagation and implies the existence of equatorial spherical photon orbits in axisymmetric spacetimes with reflection symmetry. We conclude that the \emph{non-}observation of photon rings with very-large-baseline interferometry would be a very strong indication against a horizon, irrespective of whether or not the image shows a central brightness depression.</description>

Abstract: Macroscopic dark matter like nontopological solitons can form either via the fusion and accumulation of free particles or during cosmological phase transitions. Both mechanisms can create dark matter with large masses ranging from TeV to solar mass. This can lead to interesting targets in direct detection, astrophysical, and cosmological searches.</description>

      <title>Digging into the ultraviolet luminosity functions of galaxies at high redshifts: galaxies evolution, reionization, and cosmological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the successful performance of the James Webb Space Telescope, our understanding of the epoch of reionization of the Universe has been advanced. The ultraviolet luminosity functions (UV LFs) of galaxies span a wide range of redshift, not only revealing the connection between galaxies and dark matter (DM) halos but also providing the information during reionization. In this work, we develop a model connecting galaxy counts and apparent magnitude based on UV LFs, which incorporates redshift-dependent star formation efficiency (SFE) and corrections for dust attenuation. By synthesizing some observations across the redshift range $4\le z \le 10$ from various galaxy surveys, we discern the evolving SFE with increasing redshift and DM halo mass through model fitting. Subsequent analyses indicate that the Thomson scattering optical depth was $\tau_{\rm e} = 0.052^{+0.003}_{-0.002}$ and the epoch of reionization started (ended) at $z=20.58^{+6.25}_{-6.75}$ ($z=5.38^{+0.65}_{-0.70}$) which is insensitive to the choice of the truncated magnitude of the UV LFs. Incorporating additional dataset and some reasonable constraints, the amplitude of matter perturbation is found to be $\sigma_8=0.79\pm0.05$, which is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Future galaxy surveys and the dynamical simulations of galaxy evolution will break the degeneracy between SFE and cosmological parameters, improving the accuracy and the precision of the UV LF model further.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves in the postmerger phase of binary neutron star mergers may become detectable with planned upgrades of existing gravitational-wave detectors or with more sensitive next-generation detectors. The construction of template banks for the postmerger phase can facilitate signal detection and parameter estimation. Here, we investigate the performance of an artificial neural network in predicting simulation-based waveforms in the frequency domain (restricted to the magnitude of the frequency spectrum and to equal-mass models) that depend on three parameters that can be inferred through observations, neutron star mass, tidal deformability, and the gradient of radius versus mass. Compared to a baseline study using multiple linear regression, we find that the artificial neural network can predict waveforms with higher accuracy and more consistent performance in a cross-validation study. We also demonstrate, through a recalibration procedure, that future reduction of uncertainties in empirical relations that are used in our hierarchical scheme will result in more accurate predicted postmerger spectra.</description>

      <title>A dissipative extension to ideal hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a formulation of special relativistic, dissipative hydrodynamics (SRDHD) derived from the well-established M\"uller- Israel-Stewart (MIS) formalism using an expansion in deviations from ideal behaviour. By re-summing the non-ideal terms, our approach extends the Euler equations of motion for an ideal fluid through a series of additional source terms that capture the effects of bulk viscosity, shear viscosity and heat flux. For efficiency these additional terms are built from purely spatial derivatives of the primitive fluid variables. The series expansion is parametrized by the dissipation strength and timescale coefficients, and is therefore rapidly convergent near the ideal limit. We show, using numerical simulations, that our model reproduces the dissipative fluid behaviour of other formulations. As our formulation is designed to avoid the numerical stiffness issues that arise in the traditional MIS formalism for fast relaxation timescales, it is roughly an order of magnitude faster than standard methods near the ideal limit.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel statistical method to extend Fermi-LAT catalogues of high-latitude $\gamma$-ray sources below their nominal threshold. To do so, we rely on a recent determination of the differential source-count distribution of sub-threshold sources via the application of deep learning methods to the $\gamma$-ray sky. By simulating ensembles of synthetic skies, we assess quantitatively the likelihood for pixels in the sky with relatively low-test statistics to be due to sources. Besides being useful to orient efforts towards multi-messenger and multi-wavelength identification of new $\gamma$-ray sources, we expect the results to be especially advantageous for statistical applications such as cross-correlation analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the kinematics of the parsec-scale jet in 3C 84 from 2003 November to 2022 June observed with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 43 GHz. We find that the C3 component, a bright feature at the termination region of the jet component ejected from the core in 2003, has maintained a nearly constant apparent velocity of 0.259 +/- 0.003c over the period covered by observations. We observe the emergence of four new subcomponents from C3, each exhibiting apparent speeds higher than that of C3. Notably, the last two subcomponents exhibit apparent superluminal motion, with the fastest component showing an apparent speed of 1.22 +/- 0.14c. Our analysis suggests that a change in viewing angle alone cannot account for the fast apparent speeds of the new subcomponents, indicating that they are intrinsically faster than C3. We identify jet precession (or reorientation), a jet-cloud collision, and magnetic reconnection as possible physical mechanisms responsible for the ejection of the new subcomponents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiral galaxies M31 and M33 are Fermi/LAT-detected gamma-ray sources. We model the broadband non-thermal (NT) emission of the central region of M31 (R &lt; 5.5 kpc) and of the disk of M33 (R ~ 9 kpc). For either galaxy, we self-consistently model the broadband SED of the diffuse NT emission based on published radio and gamma-ray data. All relevant radiative processes involving relativistic and thermal electrons (synchrotron, Compton scattering, bremsstrahlung, and free-free emission and absorption), along with relativistic protons (neutral-pion decay following interaction with thermal protons), are considered, using exact emissivity formulae. We also use the Fermi/LAT validated gamma-ray emissivities for pulsars. We find that, in both sources, the radio emission is composed of primary and secondary electron synchrotron and thermal bremsstrahlung. The M33 gamma-ray emission appears to be mainly hadronic, similar to the Magellanic Clouds (Persic &amp; Rephaeli 2022). In contrast, we find suggestions of a more complex situation in the central region of M31, whose emission could be a mix of pulsar emission and hadronic emission, with the latter possibly originating from both the disk and the vicinity of the nuclear black hole. The alternative modelling of the spectra of M31 and M33 is motivated by the different hydrogen distribution in the two galaxies: the hydrogen deficiency in the central region of M31 partially unveils emissions from the nuclear BH and the pulsar population in the bulge and inner disk. If this were to be the case in M33 as well, these emissions would be outshined by diffuse pionic emission originating within the flat central-peak gas distribution in M33.</description>

      <title>Magnetic amplification in premerger neutron stars through resonance-induced magnetorotational instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal resonances in the final seconds of a binary neutron-star inspiral can excite oscillation modes in one or both of the constituents to large amplitudes. Under favorable circumstances, resonant pulsations can overstrain the stellar crust and unleash a torrent of magnetoelastic energy that manifests as a gamma-ray ``precursor flare.'' We show that for realistic, stratified stars rotating with a spin frequency of $\gtrsim30\,$Hz, the fundamental $g$ or its first overtone can also execute a differential rotation in the crust such that a magnetic field of strength $\gtrsim10^{13}\,$G is generated via magnetorotational instabilities. This may help to explain observed precursor rates and their luminosities. Premerger magnetic growth would also provide seed magnetic energy for the postmerger remnant.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a toroidal magnetic field in the core of 3C 84</title>

Abstract: The spatial scales of relativistic radio jets, probed by relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic jet launching simulations (RMHDs) and by most very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations differ by an order of magnitude. Bridging the gap between these RMHD simulations and VLBI observations requires selecting nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN), the parsec-scale region of which can be resolved. 3C 84 is a nearby bright AGN fulfilling the necessary requirements: it is launching a powerful, relativistic jet powered by a central supermassive black hole, while also being very bright. Using 22 GHz global VLBI measurements of 3C 84 we aim to study its sub-parsec region in both total intensity and linear polarisation, to explore the properties of this jet, with a linear resolution of $\sim0.1$ parsec. We test different simulation setups by altering the bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ of the jet, as well as the magnetic field configuration (toroidal, poloidal, helical). We confirm the persistence of a limb brightened structure, which reaches deep into the sub-parsec region. The corresponding electric vector position angles (EVPAs) follow the bulk jet flow inside but tend to be orthogonal to it near the edges. Our state-of-the-art RMHD simulations show that this geometry is consistent with a spine-sheath model, associated with a mildly relativistic flow and a toroidal magnetic field configuration.</description>

      <title>Extracting the gamma-ray source-count distribution below the Fermi-LAT detection limit with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reconstruct the extra-galactic gamma-ray source-count distribution, or $dN/dS$, of resolved and unresolved sources by adopting machine learning techniques. Specifically, we train a convolutional neural network on synthetic 2-dimensional sky-maps, which are built by varying parameters of underlying source-counts models and incorporate the Fermi-LAT instrumental response functions. The trained neural network is then applied to the Fermi-LAT data, from which we estimate the source count distribution down to flux levels a factor of 50 below the Fermi-LAT threshold. We perform our analysis using 14 years of data collected in the $(1,10)$ GeV energy range. The results we obtain show a source count distribution which, in the resolved regime, is in excellent agreement with the one derived from catalogued sources, and then extends as $dN/dS \sim S^{-2}$ in the unresolved regime, down to fluxes of $5 \cdot 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The neural network architecture and the devised methodology have the flexibility to enable future analyses to study the energy dependence of the source-count distribution.</description>

      <title>Systematic bias from waveform modeling for binary black hole populations in next-generation gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will have increased sensitivity and observing volumes, enabling unprecedented precision in parameter estimation. However, this enhanced precision could also reveal systematic biases arising from waveform modeling, which may impact astrophysical inference. We investigate the extent of these biases over a year-long observing run with $10^5$ simulated binary black hole sources using the linear signal approximation. To establish a conservative estimate, we sample binaries from a smoothed truncated power-law population model and compute systematic parameter biases between the IMRPhenomXAS and IMRPhenomD waveform models. For sources with signal-to-noise ratios above 100, we estimate statistically significant parameter biases in $\sim 3\%-20\%$ of the events, depending on the parameter. We find that the average mismatch between waveform models required to achieve a bias of $\leq 1\sigma$ for $99\%$ of detections with signal-to-noise ratios $\geq 100$ should be $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$, or at least one order of magnitude better than current levels of waveform accuracy.</description>

      <title>On the formation of a $33\,M_{\odot}$ black hole in a low-metallicity binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A $33\,M_\odot$ black hole (BH) was recently discovered in an 11.6-year binary only 590 pc from the Sun. The system, Gaia BH3, contains a $0.8\,M_\odot$ low-metallicity giant ($\rm [M/H]=-2.2$) that is a member of the ED-2 stellar stream. This paper investigates whether the system could have formed via isolated binary evolution. I construct evolutionary models for metal-poor massive stars with initial masses ranging from $35-55\,M_{\odot}$, which reach maximum radii of $1150-1800\,R_{\odot}$ as red supergiants. I then explore what combinations of initial orbit, mass loss, and natal kick can produce the period and eccentricity of Gaia BH3. Initial orbits wide enough to accommodate the BH progenitor as a red supergiant can match the observed period and eccentricity, but only if the BH formed with a significant natal kick ($v_{\rm kick}\gtrsim 20\, {\rm km\,s^{-1}}$). These models are disfavored because such a kick would have ejected the binary from the ED-2 progenitor cluster. I conclude that Gaia BH3 likely formed through dynamical interactions, unless the BH progenitor did not expand to become a red supergiant. Only about 1 in 10,000 stars in the solar neighborhood have metallicities as low as Gaia BH3. This suggests that BH companions are dramatically over-represented at low-metallicity, though caveats related to small number statistics apply. The fact that the luminous star in Gaia BH3 has been a giant -- greatly boosting its detectability -- only for $\sim$1% of the time since the system's formation implies that additional massive BHs remain to be discovered with only moderately fainter companions. Both isolated and dynamically-formed BH binaries with orbits similar to Gaia BH3 are likely to be discovered in Gaia DR4.</description>

      <title>Gravitational lensing of a Schwarzschild-like black hole in Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03284v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gravitational lensing effect for the Schwarzschild-like black hole spacetime in the background of a Kalb-Ramond (KR) field proposed in [K. Yang et. al., Phys. Rev. D 108 (2023) 124004]. The solution is characterized by a single extra parameter $l$, which is associated to the Lorentz symmetry breaking induced by the KR field. First, we calculate the exact deflection angle of massive and massless particles for finite distances using elliptic integrals. Then we study this effect in the weak and strong field regimes, discussing the correction of the KR parameter on the coefficients of the expansions in both limits. We also find that increasing $l$ decreases the deflection angle. Furthermore, we use the available data from the Sagittarius $A^{\star}$ object, which is believed to be a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, to calculate relevant observables, such as, the image position, luminosity, and delay time. The values found could be potentially measured in the weak field regime, though for strong fields one would have to wait for the next generation of interferometers.</description>

      <title>Detecting environmental effects in gravitational waves from binaries perturbed by periodic forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational wave (GW) emission of sources perturbed by periodic dynamical forces which do not cause secular evolution in the orbital elements. We construct a corresponding post-Newtonian waveform model and provide estimates for the detectability of the resulting GW phase perturbations, for both space-based and future ground-based detectors. We validate our results by performing a set of Bayesian parameter recovery experiments with post-Newtonian waveforms. We find that, in stark contrast to the more commonly studied secular dephasing, periodic phase perturbations do not suffer from degeneracies with any of the tested vacuum binary parameters. We discuss the applications of our findings to a range of possible astrophysical scenarios, finding that such periodic perturbations may be detectable for massive black hole binaries embedded in circum-binary discs, extreme mass-ratio inspirals in accretion discs, as well as stellar-mass compact objects perturbed by tidal fields. We argue that modelling conservative sub-orbital dynamics opens up a promising new avenue to detect environmental effects in binary sources of GWs that should be included in state-of-the-art waveform templates.</description>
