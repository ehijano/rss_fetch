      <title>A general and systematic approach for kinetic energy density functional: Green's function formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate expression of the kinetic energy density of an electronic distribution in terms of a single particle reduced density matrix for atomic/molecular systems is a long-standing problem in electronic structure theory. Existing kinetic energy density functionals are based on model potentials and require empirical parametrizations to fit the accurate values of the kinetic energy of atoms. Moreover, the correct kinetic energy density which produces proper atomic shell structure is still an unsolved problem. In this work, we have developed an exact methodology which can be used to systematically derive kinetic energy of an electronic system. We have also shown how the kinetic energy is dependent upon number of electrons $N$ and the atomic charge $Z$ using a qualitatively similar model system. We have also connected our methodology with other forms of Green's functions.</description>

      <title>Selected Configuration Interaction for Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic resonances are metastable states that can decay by electron loss. They are ubiquitous across various fields of science, such as chemistry, physics, and biology. However, current theoretical and computational models for resonances cannot yet rival the level of accuracy achieved by bound-state methodologies. Here, we generalize selected configuration interaction (SCI) to treat resonances using the complex absorbing potential (CAP) technique. By modifying the selection procedure and the extrapolation protocol of standard SCI, the resulting CAP-SCI method yields resonance positions and widths of full configuration interaction quality. Initial results for the shape resonances of \ce{N2-} and \ce{CO-} reveal the important effect of high-order correlation, which shifts the values obtained with CAP-augmented equation-of-motion coupled-cluster with singles and doubles by more than \SI{0.1}{\eV}. The present CAP-SCI approach represents a cornerstone in the development of highly-accurate methodologies for resonances.</description>

      <title>Description of the hydrogen atom and the He+ ion in an optical cavity using the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of one electron in a Coulomb potential in an optical cavity is solved using a tensor-product light-matter basis. The problem was treated at the level of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian describing both light and matter quantum mechanically. The effect of cavity size on the energy levels and high harmonics generation (HHG) spectrum is studied. We have shown that the energy levels, transition states, entanglement, and the HHG spectrum can be strongly influenced by changing the cavity size.</description>

      <title>An "ultimate" coupled cluster method based entirely on $T_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic structure methods built around double-electron excitations have a rich history in quantum chemistry. However, it seems to be the case that such methods are only suitable in particular situations and are not naturally equipped to simultaneously handle the variety of electron correlations that might be present in chemical systems. To this end, the current work seeks a computationally efficient, low-rank, "ultimate" coupled cluster method based exclusively on $T_2$ and its products which can effectively emulate more "complete" methods that explicitly consider higher-rank, $T_{2m}$ operators. We introduce a hierarchy of methods designed to systematically account for higher, even order cluster operators - like $T_4, T_6, \cdots, T_{2m}$ - by invoking tenets of the factorization theorem of perturbation theory and expectation-value coupled cluster theory. It is shown that each member within this methodological hierarchy is defined such that both the wavefunction and energy are correct through some order in many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), and can be extended up to arbitrarily high orders in $T_2$. The efficacy of such approximations are determined by studying the potential energy surface of several prototypical systems that are chosen to represent both non-dynamic, static, and dynamic correlation regimes. We find that the proposed hierarchy of augmented $T_2$ methods essentially reduce to standard CCD for problems where dynamic electron correlations dominate, but offer improvements in situations where non-dynamic and static correlations become relevant. A notable highlight of this work is that the cheapest methods in this hierarchy - which are correct through fifth-order in MBPT - consistently emulate the behavior of the $\mathcal{O}(N^{10})$ CCDQ method, yet only require a $\mathcal{O}(N^{6})$ algorithm by virtue of factorized intermediates.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Quantum Computation of Molecular Ground State Energies using Bayesian Optimization with Priors over Surface Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) represent a promising approach to computing molecular ground states and energies on modern quantum computers. These approaches use a classical computer to optimize the parameters of a trial wave function, while the quantum computer simulates the energy by preparing and measuring a set of bitstring observations, referred to as shots, over which an expected value is computed. Although more shots improve the accuracy of the expected ground state, it also increases the simulation cost. Hence, we propose modifications to the standard Bayesian optimization algorithm to leverage few-shot circuit observations to solve VQEs with fewer quantum resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, Bayesian optimization with priors on surface topology (BOPT), by comparing optimizers for molecular systems and demonstrate how current quantum hardware can aid in finding ground state energies.</description>

      <title>Density Estimation via Binless Multidimensional Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Binless Multidimensional Thermodynamic Integration (BMTI) method for nonparametric, robust, and data-efficient density estimation. BMTI estimates the logarithm of the density by initially computing log-density differences between neighbouring data points. Subsequently, such differences are integrated, weighted by their associated uncertainties, using a maximum-likelihood formulation. This procedure can be seen as an extension to a multidimensional setting of the thermodynamic integration, a technique developed in statistical physics. The method leverages the manifold hypothesis, estimating quantities within the intrinsic data manifold without defining an explicit coordinate map. It does not rely on any binning or space partitioning, but rather on the construction of a neighbourhood graph based on an adaptive bandwidth selection procedure. BMTI mitigates the limitations commonly associated with traditional nonparametric density estimators, effectively reconstructing smooth profiles even in high-dimensional embedding spaces. The method is tested on a variety of complex synthetic high-dimensional datasets, where it is shown to outperform traditional estimators, and is benchmarked on realistic datasets from the chemical physics literature.</description>

      <title>On the interplay of electronic and lattice screening on exciton binding in two-dimensional lead halide perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use path integral Monte Carlo to study the energetics of excitons in layered, hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites in order to elucidate the relative contributions of dielectric confinement and electron-phonon coupling. While the dielectric mismatch between polar perovskite layers and non-polar ligand layers significantly increases the exciton binding energy relative to their three dimensional bulk crystal counterparts, formation of exciton polarons attenuates this effect. Dielectric confinement is well described by a fractional dimension scaling law as a function of layer thickness. The contribution from polaron formation is found to be a non-monotonic function of the lead halide layer thickness, which is clarified by a general variational theory. Accounting for both of these effects provides a description of exciton binding energies in good agreement with experimental measurements. By studying isolated layers and stacked layered crystals of various thicknesses, with ligands of varying polarity, we provide a systematic understanding of the excitonic behavior of this class of materials and how to engineer their photophysics.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Artifacts of Kohn-Sham Density Functionals for Biosimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of unphysical charge density delocalization/fractionalization induced by the self-interaction error of common approximate Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory functionals on simulation of small to medium-size proteins in vacuum. Aside from producing unphysical electron densities and total energies, the vanishing of the HOMO-LUMO gap associated with the unphysical charge delocalization leads to an unphysical low-energy spectrum and catastrophic failure of most popular solvers for the Kohn-Sham (KS) self-consistent field (SCF) problem. We apply a robust quasi-Newton SCF solver [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 26, 6557 (2024)] to obtain solutions for some of these difficult cases. The anatomy of the charge delocalization is revealed by the natural deformation orbitals obtained from the density matrix difference between the Hartree-Fock and KS solutions; the charge delocalization can occur not only between charged fragments (such as in zwitterionic polypeptides) but also may involve neutral fragments. The vanishing-gap phenomenon and troublesome SCF convergence are both attributed to the unphysical KS Fock operator eigenspectra of molecular fragments (e.g., amino acids or their side chains). Analysis of amino acid pairs suggests that the unphysical charge delocalization can be partially ameliorated by the use of {\em some} range-separated hybrid functionals, but not by semilocal or standard hybrid functionals. Last, we demonstrate that solutions without the unphysical charge delocalization can be located even for semilocal KS functionals highly prone to such defects, but such solutions have non-Aufbau character and are unstable with respect to mixing of the non-overlapping "frontier" orbitals.</description>

      <title>Majorana Tensor Decomposition: A unifying framework for decompositions of fermionic Hamiltonians to Linear Combination of Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) decompositions have appeared as one of the main tools for encoding operators on quantum computers, allowing efficient implementations of arbitrary operators. In particular, LCU approaches present a way of encoding information from the electronic structure Hamiltonian into a quantum circuit. Over the past years, many different decomposition techniques have appeared for the electronic structure Hamiltonian. Here we present the Majorana Tensor Decomposition (MTD), a framework that unifies existing LCUs and offers novel decomposition methods by using popular low-rank tensor factorizations.</description>
