      <title>CDEMapper: Enhancing NIH Common Data Element Normalization using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common Data Elements (CDEs) standardize data collection and sharing across studies, enhancing data interoperability and improving research reproducibility. However, implementing CDEs presents challenges due to the broad range and variety of data elements. This study aims to develop an effective and efficient mapping tool to bridge the gap between local data elements and National Institutes of Health (NIH) CDEs. We propose CDEMapper, a large language model (LLM) powered mapping tool designed to assist in mapping local data elements to NIH CDEs. CDEMapper has three core modules: (1) CDE indexing and embeddings. NIH CDEs were indexed and embedded to support semantic search; (2) CDE recommendations. The tool combines Elasticsearch (BM25 similarity methods) with state of the art GPT services to recommend candidate CDEs and their permissible values; and (3) Human review. Users review and select the NIH CDEs and values that best match their data elements and value sets. We evaluate the tool recommendation accuracy against manually annotated mapping results. CDEMapper offers a publicly available, LLM-powered, and intuitive user interface that consolidates essential and advanced mapping services into a streamlined pipeline. It provides a step by step, quality assured mapping workflow designed with a user-centered approach. The evaluation results demonstrated that augmenting BM25 with GPT embeddings and a ranker consistently enhances CDEMapper mapping accuracy in three different mapping settings across four evaluation datasets. This work opens up the potential of using LLMs to assist with CDE recommendation and human curation when aligning local data elements with NIH CDEs. Additionally, this effort enhances clinical research data interoperability and helps researchers better understand the gaps between local data elements and NIH CDEs.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Generative AI on Student Churn and the Future of Formal Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the contemporary educational landscape, the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents unprecedented opportunities for personalised learning, fundamentally challenging the traditional paradigms of education. This research explores the emerging trend where high school students, empowered by tailored educational experiences provided by Generative AI, opt to forgo traditional university degrees to pursue entrepreneurial ventures at a younger age. To understand and predict the future of education in the age of Generative AI, we employ a comprehensive methodology to analyse social media data. Our approach includes sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion, topic modelling to identify key themes and emerging trends, and user demographic analysis to understand the engagement of different age groups and regions. We also perform influencer analysis to identify key figures shaping the discourse and engagement metrics to measure the level of interest and interaction with AI-related educational content. Content analysis helps us to determine the types of content being shared and the prevalent narratives, while hashtag analysis reveals the connectivity of discussions. The temporal analysis tracks changes over time and identifies event-based spikes in discussions. The insights derived from this analysis include the acceptance and adoption of Generative AI in education, its impact on traditional education models, the influence on students' entrepreneurial ambitions, and the educational outcomes associated with AI-driven personalised learning. Additionally, we explore public sentiment towards policies and regulations and use predictive modelling to forecast future trends. This comprehensive social media analysis provides a nuanced understanding of the evolving educational landscape, offering valuable perspectives on the role of Generative AI in shaping the future of education.</description>

      <title>Needle: A Generative-AI Powered Monte Carlo Method for Answering Complex Natural Language Queries on Multi-modal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal data, such as image data sets, often miss the detailed descriptions that properly capture the rich information encoded in them. This makes answering complex natural language queries a major challenge in these domains. In particular, unlike the traditional nearest-neighbor search, where the tuples and the query are modeled as points in a data cube, the query and the tuples are of different natures, making the traditional query answering solutions not directly applicable for such settings. Existing literature addresses this challenge for image data through vector representations jointly trained on natural language and images. This technique, however, underperforms for complex queries due to various reasons.
  This paper takes a step towards addressing this challenge by introducing a Generative-AI (GenAI) powered Monte Carlo method that utilizes foundation models to generate synthetic samples that capture the complexity of the natural language query and transform it to the same space of the multi-modal data. Following this method, we develop a system for image data retrieval and propose practical solutions that enable leveraging future advancements in GenAI and vector representations for improving our system's performance. Our comprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets verify that our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Improving Vietnamese Legal Document Retrieval using Synthetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of legal information retrieval, effective embedding-based models are essential for accurate question-answering systems. However, the scarcity of large annotated datasets poses a significant challenge, particularly for Vietnamese legal texts. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models to generate high-quality, diverse synthetic queries for Vietnamese legal passages. This synthetic data is then used to pre-train retrieval models, specifically bi-encoder and ColBERT, which are further fine-tuned using contrastive loss with mined hard negatives. Our experiments demonstrate that these enhancements lead to strong improvement in retrieval accuracy, validating the effectiveness of synthetic data and pre-training techniques in overcoming the limitations posed by the lack of large labeled datasets in the Vietnamese legal domain.</description>

      <title>Scaling New Frontiers: Insights into Large Recommendation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems are essential for filtering data and retrieving relevant information across various applications. Recent advancements have seen these systems incorporate increasingly large embedding tables, scaling up to tens of terabytes for industrial use. However, the expansion of network parameters in traditional recommendation models has plateaued at tens of millions, limiting further benefits from increased embedding parameters. Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), a new approach has emerged that scales network parameters using innovative structures, enabling continued performance improvements. A significant development in this area is Meta's generative recommendation model HSTU, which illustrates the scaling laws of recommendation systems by expanding parameters to thousands of billions. This new paradigm has achieved substantial performance gains in online experiments. In this paper, we aim to enhance the understanding of scaling laws by conducting comprehensive evaluations of large recommendation models. Firstly, we investigate the scaling laws across different backbone architectures of the large recommendation models. Secondly, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to explore the origins of these scaling laws. We then further assess the performance of HSTU, as the representative of large recommendation models, on complex user behavior modeling tasks to evaluate its applicability. Notably, we also analyze its effectiveness in ranking tasks for the first time. Finally, we offer insights into future directions for large recommendation models.

      <title>Oracle-guided Dynamic User Preference Modeling for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation methods can capture dynamic user preferences from user historical interactions to achieve better performance. However, most existing methods only use past information extracted from user historical interactions to train the models, leading to the deviations of user preference modeling. Besides past information, future information is also available during training, which contains the ``oracle'' user preferences in the future and will be beneficial to model dynamic user preferences. Therefore, we propose an oracle-guided dynamic user preference modeling method for sequential recommendation (Oracle4Rec), which leverages future information to guide model training on past information, aiming to learn ``forward-looking'' models. Specifically, Oracle4Rec first extracts past and future information through two separate encoders, then learns a forward-looking model through an oracle-guiding module which minimizes the discrepancy between past and future information. We also tailor a two-phase model training strategy to make the guiding more effective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Oracle4Rec is superior to state-of-the-art sequential methods. Further experiments show that Oracle4Rec can be leveraged as a generic module in other sequential recommendation methods to improve their performance with a considerable margin.</description>

      <title>QABISAR: Query-Article Bipartite Interactions for Statutory Article Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce QABISAR, a novel framework for statutory article retrieval, to overcome the semantic mismatch problem when modeling each query-article pair in isolation, making it hard to learn representation that can effectively capture multi-faceted information. QABISAR leverages bipartite interactions between queries and articles to capture diverse aspects inherent in them. Further, we employ knowledge distillation to transfer enriched query representations from the graph network into the query bi-encoder, to capture the rich semantics present in the graph representations, despite absence of graph-based supervision for unseen queries during inference. Our experiments on a real-world expert-annotated dataset demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Patent-publication pairs for the detection of knowledge transfer from research to industry: reducing ambiguities with word embeddings and references</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of medical research can be viewed and evaluated not only from the perspective of publication output, but also from the perspective of economic exploitability. Patents can represent the exploitation of research results and thus the transfer of knowledge from research to industry. In this study, we set out to identify publication-patent pairs in order to use patents as a proxy for the economic impact of research. To identify these pairs, we matched scholarly publications and patents by comparing the names of authors and investors. To resolve the ambiguities that arise in this name-matching process, we expanded our approach with two additional filter features, one used to assess the similarity of text content, the other to identify common references in the two document types. To evaluate text similarity, we extracted and transformed technical terms from a medical ontology (MeSH) into numerical vectors using word embeddings. We then calculated the results of the two supporting features over an example five-year period. Furthermore, we developed a statistical procedure which can be used to determine valid patent classes for the domain of medicine. Our complete data processing pipeline is freely available, from the raw data of the two document types right through to the validated publication-patent pairs.</description>

      <title>Precision Profile Pollution Attack on Sequential Recommenders via Influence Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation approaches have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in modeling user preferences. Nevertheless, they are susceptible to profile pollution attacks (PPA), wherein items are introduced into a user's interaction history deliberately to influence the recommendation list. Since retraining the model for each polluted item is time-consuming, recent PPAs estimate item influence based on gradient directions to identify the most effective attack candidates. However, the actual item representations diverge significantly from the gradients, resulting in disparate outcomes.To tackle this challenge, we introduce an INFluence Function-based Attack approach INFAttack that offers a more accurate estimation of the influence of polluting items. Specifically, we calculate the modifications to the original model using the influence function when generating polluted sequences by introducing specific items. Subsequently, we choose the sequence that has been most significantly influenced to substitute the original sequence, thus promoting the target item. Comprehensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets illustrate that INFAttack surpasses all baseline methods and consistently delivers stable attack performance for both popular and unpopular items.</description>

      <title>Lossless and Privacy-Preserving Graph Convolution Network for Federated Item Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) has emerged as a state-of-the-art solution for item recommendation. However, existing GNN-based recommendation methods rely on a centralized storage of fragmented user-item interaction sub-graphs and training on an aggregated global graph, which will lead to privacy concerns. As a response, some recent works develop GNN-based federated recommendation methods by exploiting decentralized and fragmented user-item sub-graphs in order to preserve user privacy. However, due to privacy constraints, the graph convolution process in existing federated recommendation methods is incomplete compared with the centralized counterpart, causing a degradation of the recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a novel lossless and privacy-preserving graph convolution network (LP-GCN), which fully completes the graph convolution process with decentralized user-item interaction sub-graphs while ensuring privacy. It is worth mentioning that its performance is equivalent to that of the non-federated (i.e., centralized) counterpart. Moreover, we validate its effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical studies. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our LP-GCN outperforms the existing federated recommendation methods. The code will be publicly available once the paper is accepted.</description>

      <title>Global Estimation of Building-Integrated Facade and Rooftop Photovoltaic Potential by Integrating 3D Building Footprint and Spatio-Temporal Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research tackles the challenges of estimating Building-Integrated Photovoltaics (BIPV) potential across various temporal and spatial scales, accounting for different geographical climates and urban morphology. We introduce a holistic methodology for evaluating BIPV potential, integrating 3D building footprint models with diverse meteorological data sources to account for dynamic shadow effects. The approach enables the assessment of PV potential on facades and rooftops at different levels-individual buildings, urban blocks, and cities globally. Through an analysis of 120 typical cities, we highlight the importance of 3D building forms, cityscape morphology, and geographic positioning in measuring BIPV potential at various levels. In particular, our simulation study reveals that among cities with optimal facade PV performance, the average ratio of facade PV potential to rooftop PV potential is approximately 68.2%. Additionally, approximately 17.5% of the analyzed samples demonstrate even higher facade PV potentials compared to rooftop installations. This finding underscores the strategic value of incorporating facade PV applications into urban sustainable energy systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-Facet Blending for Faceted Query-by-Example Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing demand to fit fine-grained user intents, faceted query-by-example (QBE), which retrieves similar documents conditioned on specific facets, has gained recent attention. However, prior approaches mainly depend on document-level comparisons using basic indicators like citations due to the lack of facet-level relevance datasets; yet, this limits their use to citation-based domains and fails to capture the intricacies of facet constraints. In this paper, we propose a multi-facet blending (FaBle) augmentation method, which exploits modularity by decomposing and recomposing to explicitly synthesize facet-specific training sets. We automatically decompose documents into facet units and generate (ir)relevant pairs by leveraging LLMs' intrinsic distinguishing capabilities; then, dynamically recomposing the units leads to facet-wise relevance-informed document pairs. Our modularization eliminates the need for pre-defined facet knowledge or labels. Further, to prove the FaBle's efficacy in a new domain beyond citation-based scientific paper retrieval, we release a benchmark dataset for educational exam item QBE. FaBle augmentation on 1K documents remarkably assists training in obtaining facet conditional embeddings.</description>

      <title>Robust Table Integration in Data Lakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenge of integrating tables from data lakes, focusing on three core tasks: 1) pairwise integrability judgment, which determines whether a tuple pair in a table is integrable, accounting for any occurrences of semantic equivalence or typographical errors; 2) integrable set discovery, which aims to identify all integrable sets in a table based on pairwise integrability judgments established in the first task; 3) multi-tuple conflict resolution, which resolves conflicts among multiple tuples during integration. We train a binary classifier to address the task of pairwise integrability judgment. Given the scarcity of labeled data, we propose a self-supervised adversarial contrastive learning algorithm to perform classification, which incorporates data augmentation methods and adversarial examples to autonomously generate new training data. Upon the output of pairwise integrability judgment, each integrable set is considered as a community, a densely connected sub-graph where nodes and edges correspond to tuples in the table and their pairwise integrability, respectively. We proceed to investigate various community detection algorithms to address the integrable set discovery objective. Moving forward to tackle multi-tuple conflict resolution, we introduce an novel in-context learning methodology. This approach capitalizes on the knowledge embedded within pretrained large language models to effectively resolve conflicts that arise when integrating multiple tuples. Notably, our method minimizes the need for annotated data. Since no suitable test collections are available for our tasks, we develop our own benchmarks using two real-word dataset repositories: Real and Join. We conduct extensive experiments on these benchmarks to validate the robustness and applicability of our methodologies in the context of integrating tables within data lakes.</description>

      <title>FairSort: Learning to Fair Rank for Personalized Recommendations in Two-Sided Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems focus on maximizing user satisfaction by suggesting their favorite items. This user-centric approach may lead to unfair exposure distribution among the providers. On the contrary, a provider-centric design might become unfair to the users. Therefore, this paper proposes a re-ranking model FairSort\footnote{\textbf{Reproducibility:}The code and datasets are available at \url{https://github.com/13543024276/FairSort}} to find a trade-off solution among user-side fairness, provider-side fairness, and personalized recommendations utility. Previous works habitually treat this issue as a knapsack problem, incorporating both-side fairness as constraints.
  In this paper, we adopt a novel perspective, treating each recommendation list as a runway rather than a knapsack. In this perspective, each item on the runway gains a velocity and runs within a specific time, achieving re-ranking for both-side fairness. Meanwhile, we ensure the Minimum Utility Guarantee for personalized recommendations by designing a Binary Search approach. This can provide more reliable recommendations compared to the conventional greedy strategy based on the knapsack problem. We further broaden the applicability of FairSort, designing two versions for online and offline recommendation scenarios.

      <title>Predictive Models in Sequential Recommendations: Bridging Performance Laws with Data Quality Insights</title>

Abstract: Sequential Recommendation (SR) plays a critical role in predicting users' sequential preferences. Despite its growing prominence in various industries, the increasing scale of SR models incurs substantial computational costs and unpredictability, challenging developers to manage resources efficiently. Under this predicament, Scaling Laws have achieved significant success by examining the loss as models scale up. However, there remains a disparity between loss and model performance, which is of greater concern in practical applications. Moreover, as data continues to expand, it incorporates repetitive and inefficient data. In response, we introduce the Performance Law for SR models, which aims to theoretically investigate and model the relationship between model performance and data quality. Specifically, we first fit the HR and NDCG metrics to transformer-based SR models. Subsequently, we propose Approximate Entropy (ApEn) to assess data quality, presenting a more nuanced approach compared to traditional data quantity metrics. Our method enables accurate predictions across various dataset scales and model sizes, demonstrating a strong correlation in large SR models and offering insights into achieving optimal performance for any given model configuration.</description>

      <title>Rank It, Then Ask It: Input Reranking for Maximizing the Performance of LLMs on Symmetric Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have quickly emerged as practical and versatile tools that provide new solutions for a wide range of domains. In this paper, we consider the application of LLMs on symmetric tasks where a query is asked on an (unordered) bag of elements. Examples of such tasks include answering aggregate queries on a database table. In general, when the bag contains a large number of elements, LLMs tend to overlook some elements, leading to challenges in generating accurate responses to the query. LLMs receive their inputs as ordered sequences. However, in this problem, we leverage the fact that the symmetric input is not ordered, and reordering should not affect the LLM's response.
  Observing that LLMs are less likely to miss elements at certain positions of the input, we introduce the problem of LLM input reranking: to find a ranking of the input that maximizes the LLM's accuracy for the given query without making explicit assumptions about the query. Finding the optimal ranking requires identifying (i) the relevance of each input element for answering the query and (ii) the importance of each rank position for the LLM's attention. We develop algorithms for estimating these values efficiently utilizing a helper LLM. We conduct comprehensive experiments on different synthetic and real datasets to validate our proposal and to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms. Our experiments confirm that our reranking approach improves the accuracy of the LLMs on symmetric tasks by up to $99\%$ proximity to the optimum upper bound.</description>

      <title>Contextual Bandits in Payment Processing: Non-uniform Exploration and Supervised Learning at Adyen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uniform random exploration in decision-making systems supports off-policy learning via supervision but incurs high regret, making it impractical for many applications. Conversely, non-uniform exploration offers better immediate performance but lacks support for off-policy learning. Recent research suggests that regression oracles can bridge this gap by combining non-uniform exploration with supervised learning. In this paper, we analyze these approaches within a real-world industrial context at Adyen, a large global payments processor characterized by batch logged delayed feedback, short-term memory, and dynamic action spaces under the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework. Our analysis reveals that while regression oracles significantly improve performance, they introduce challenges due to rigid algorithmic assumptions. Specifically, we observe that as a policy improves, subsequent generations may perform worse due to shifts in the reward distribution and increased class imbalance in the training data. This degradation occurs de spite improvements in other aspects of the training data, leading to decreased performance in successive policy iterations. We further explore the long-term impact of regression oracles, identifying a potential "oscillation effect." This effect arises when regression oracles influence probability estimates and the realizability of subsequent policy models, leading to fluctuations in performance across iterations. Our findings highlight the need for more adaptable algorithms that can leverage the benefits of regression oracles without introducing instability in policy performance over time.</description>

      <title>CoRNStack: High-Quality Contrastive Data for Better Code Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective code retrieval plays a crucial role in advancing code generation, bug fixing, and software maintenance, particularly as software systems increase in complexity. While current code embedding models have demonstrated promise in retrieving code snippets for small-scale, well-defined tasks, they often underperform in more demanding real-world applications such as bug localization within GitHub repositories. We hypothesize that a key issue is their reliance on noisy and inconsistent datasets for training, which impedes their ability to generalize to more complex retrieval scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce CoRNStack, a large-scale, high-quality contrastive training dataset for code that spans multiple programming languages. This dataset is curated using consistency filtering to eliminate noisy positives and is further enriched with mined hard negatives, thereby facilitating more effective learning. We demonstrate that contrastive training of embedding models using CoRNStack leads to state-of-the-art performance across a variety of code retrieval tasks. Furthermore, the dataset can be leveraged for training code reranking models, a largely underexplored area compared to text reranking. Our finetuned code reranking model significantly improves the ranking quality over the retrieved results. Finally, by employing our code retriever and reranker together, we demonstrate significant improvements in function localization for GitHub issues, an important component of real-world software development.</description>

      <title>e-Fold Cross-Validation for Recommender-System Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To combat the rising energy consumption of recommender systems we implement a novel alternative for k-fold cross validation. This alternative, named e-fold cross validation, aims to minimize the number of folds to achieve a reduction in power usage while keeping the reliability and robustness of the test results high. We tested our method on 5 recommender system algorithms across 6 datasets and compared it with 10-fold cross validation. On average e-fold cross validation only needed 41.5% of the energy that 10-fold cross validation would need, while it's results only differed by 1.81%. We conclude that e-fold cross validation is a promising approach that has the potential to be an energy efficient but still reliable alternative to k-fold cross validation.</description>

      <title>Automated Extraction of Acronym-Expansion Pairs from Scientific Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project addresses challenges posed by the widespread use of abbreviations and acronyms in digital texts. We propose a novel method that combines document preprocessing, regular expressions, and a large language model to identify abbreviations and map them to their corresponding expansions. The regular expressions alone are often insufficient to extract expansions, at which point our approach leverages GPT-4 to analyze the text surrounding the acronyms. By limiting the analysis to only a small portion of the surrounding text, we mitigate the risk of obtaining incorrect or multiple expansions for an acronym. There are several known challenges in processing text with acronyms, including polysemous acronyms, non-local and ambiguous acronyms. Our approach enhances the precision and efficiency of NLP techniques by addressing these issues with automated acronym identification and disambiguation. This study highlights the challenges of working with PDF files and the importance of document preprocessing. Furthermore, the results of this work show that neither regular expressions nor GPT-4 alone can perform well. Regular expressions are suitable for identifying acronyms but have limitations in finding their expansions within the paper due to a variety of formats used for expressing acronym-expansion pairs and the tendency of authors to omit expansions within the text. GPT-4, on the other hand, is an excellent tool for obtaining expansions but struggles with correctly identifying all relevant acronyms. Additionally, GPT-4 poses challenges due to its probabilistic nature, which may lead to slightly different results for the same input. Our algorithm employs preprocessing to eliminate irrelevant information from the text, regular expressions for identifying acronyms, and a large language model to help find acronym expansions to provide the most accurate and consistent results.</description>

      <title>CPRM: A LLM-based Continual Pre-training Framework for Relevance Modeling in Commercial Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01269v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relevance modeling between queries and items stands as a pivotal component in commercial search engines, directly affecting the user experience. Given the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, LLM-based relevance modeling is gradually being adopted within industrial search systems. Nevertheless, foundational LLMs lack domain-specific knowledge and do not fully exploit the potential of in-context learning. Furthermore, structured item text remains underutilized, and there is a shortage in the supply of corresponding queries and background knowledge. We thereby propose CPRM (Continual Pre-training for Relevance Modeling), a framework designed for the continual pre-training of LLMs to address these issues. Our CPRM framework includes three modules: 1) employing both queries and multi-field item to jointly pre-train for enhancing domain knowledge, 2) applying in-context pre-training, a novel approach where LLMs are pre-trained on a sequence of related queries or items, and 3) conducting reading comprehension on items to produce associated domain knowledge and background information (e.g., generating summaries and corresponding queries) to further strengthen LLMs. Results on offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate that our model achieves convincing performance compared to strong baselines.</description>

      <title>Learning Smooth Distance Functions via Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the problem of learning distance functions within the query-based learning framework, where a learner is able to pose triplet queries of the form: ``Is $x_i$ closer to $x_j$ or $x_k$?'' We establish formal guarantees on the query complexity required to learn smooth, but otherwise general, distance functions under two notions of approximation: $\omega$-additive approximation and $(1 + \omega)$-multiplicative approximation. For the additive approximation, we propose a global method whose query complexity is quadratic in the size of a finite cover of the sample space. For the (stronger) multiplicative approximation, we introduce a method that combines global and local approaches, utilizing multiple Mahalanobis distance functions to capture local geometry. This method has a query complexity that scales quadratically with both the size of the cover and the ambient space dimension of the sample space.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models in Automatic Hint Ranking and Generation Tasks</title>

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly recently, with individuals frequently interacting with chatbots to receive answers to a wide range of questions. In an era where information is readily accessible, it is crucial to stimulate and preserve human cognitive abilities and maintain strong reasoning skills. This paper addresses such challenges by promoting the use of hints as an alternative or a supplement to direct answers. We first introduce a manually constructed hint dataset, WIKIHINT, which includes 5,000 hints created for 1,000 questions. We then finetune open-source LLMs such as LLaMA-3.1 for hint generation in answer-aware and answer-agnostic contexts. We assess the effectiveness of the hints with human participants who try to answer questions with and without the aid of hints. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight evaluation method, HINTRANK, to evaluate and rank hints in both answer-aware and answer-agnostic settings. Our findings show that (a) the dataset helps generate more effective hints, (b) including answer information along with questions generally improves hint quality, and (c) encoder-based models perform better than decoder-based models in hint ranking.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Model Update Strategy for Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern online platforms are increasingly employing recommendation systems to address information overload and improve user engagement. There is an evolving paradigm in this research field that recommendation network learning occurs both on the cloud and on edges with knowledge transfer in between (i.e., edge-cloud collaboration). Recent works push this field further by enabling edge-specific context-aware adaptivity, where model parameters are updated in real-time based on incoming on-edge data. However, we argue that frequent data exchanges between the cloud and edges often lead to inefficiency and waste of communication/computation resources, as considerable parameter updates might be redundant. To investigate this problem, we introduce Intelligent Edge-Cloud Parameter Request Model, abbreviated as IntellectReq.
  IntellectReq is designed to operate on edge, evaluating the cost-benefit landscape of parameter requests with minimal computation and communication overhead. We formulate this as a novel learning task, aimed at the detection of out-of-distribution data, thereby fine-tuning adaptive communication strategies. Further, we employ statistical mapping techniques to convert real-time user behavior into a normal distribution, thereby employing multi-sample outputs to quantify the model's uncertainty and thus its generalization capabilities. Rigorous empirical validation on four widely-adopted benchmarks evaluates our approach, evidencing a marked improvement in the efficiency and generalizability of edge-cloud collaborative and dynamic recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Unifying Multimodal Retrieval via Document Screenshot Embedding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the real world, documents are organized in different formats and varied modalities. Traditional retrieval pipelines require tailored document parsing techniques and content extraction modules to prepare input for indexing. This process is tedious, prone to errors, and has information loss. To this end, we propose Document Screenshot Embedding (DSE), a novel retrieval paradigm that regards document screenshots as a unified input format, which does not require any content extraction preprocess and preserves all the information in a document (e.g., text, image and layout). DSE leverages a large vision-language model to directly encode document screenshots into dense representations for retrieval. To evaluate our method, we first craft the dataset of Wiki-SS, a 1.3M Wikipedia web page screenshots as the corpus to answer the questions from the Natural Questions dataset. In such a text-intensive document retrieval setting, DSE shows competitive effectiveness compared to other text retrieval methods relying on parsing. For example, DSE outperforms BM25 by 17 points in top-1 retrieval accuracy. Additionally, in a mixed-modality task of slide retrieval, DSE significantly outperforms OCR text retrieval methods by over 15 points in nDCG@10. These experiments show that DSE is an effective document retrieval paradigm for diverse types of documents. Model checkpoints, code, and Wiki-SS collection will be released.</description>

Abstract: excel in delivering comprehensive suggestions by deeply analyzing content and user behavior. However, they often inherit biases from skewed training data, favoring mainstream content while underrepresenting diverse or non-traditional options. This study explores the interplay between bias and LLM-based recommendation systems, focusing on music, song, and book recommendations across diverse demographic and cultural groups. This paper analyzes bias in LLM-based recommendation systems across multiple models (GPT, LLaMA, and Gemini), revealing its deep and pervasive impact on outcomes. Intersecting identities and contextual factors, like socioeconomic status, further amplify biases, complicating fair recommendations across diverse groups. Our findings reveal that bias in these systems is deeply ingrained, yet even simple interventions like prompt engineering can significantly reduce it. We further propose a retrieval-augmented generation strategy to mitigate bias more effectively. Numerical experiments validate these strategies, demonstrating both the pervasive nature of bias and the impact of the proposed solutions.</description>

      <title>Scalable Cross-Entropy Loss for Sequential Recommendations with Large Item Catalogs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalability issue plays a crucial role in productionizing modern recommender systems. Even lightweight architectures may suffer from high computational overload due to intermediate calculations, limiting their practicality in real-world applications. Specifically, applying full Cross-Entropy (CE) loss often yields state-of-the-art performance in terms of recommendations quality. Still, it suffers from excessive GPU memory utilization when dealing with large item catalogs. This paper introduces a novel Scalable Cross-Entropy (SCE) loss function in the sequential learning setup. It approximates the CE loss for datasets with large-size catalogs, enhancing both time efficiency and memory usage without compromising recommendations quality. Unlike traditional negative sampling methods, our approach utilizes a selective GPU-efficient computation strategy, focusing on the most informative elements of the catalog, particularly those most likely to be false positives. This is achieved by approximating the softmax distribution over a subset of the model outputs through the maximum inner product search. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SCE in reducing peak memory usage by a factor of up to 100 compared to the alternatives, retaining or even exceeding their metrics values. The proposed approach also opens new perspectives for large-scale developments in different domains, such as large language models.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Movie Genres through Cross-Attention Fusion of Bi-Modal Synergy of Poster</title>

Abstract: Movie posters are not just decorative; they are meticulously designed to capture the essence of a movie, such as its genre, storyline, and tone/vibe. For decades, movie posters have graced cinema walls, billboards, and now our digital screens as a form of digital posters. Movie genre classification plays a pivotal role in film marketing, audience engagement, and recommendation systems. Previous explorations into movie genre classification have been mostly examined in plot summaries, subtitles, trailers and movie scenes. Movie posters provide a pre-release tantalizing glimpse into a film's key aspects, which can ignite public interest. In this paper, we presented the framework that exploits movie posters from a visual and textual perspective to address the multilabel movie genre classification problem. Firstly, we extracted text from movie posters using an OCR and retrieved the relevant embedding. Next, we introduce a cross-attention-based fusion module to allocate attention weights to visual and textual embedding. In validating our framework, we utilized 13882 posters sourced from the Internet Movie Database (IMDb). The outcomes of the experiments indicate that our model exhibited promising performance and outperformed even some prominent contemporary architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance information retrieval and query response systems for university-related question answering. By systematically extracting data from the university official webpage and employing advanced prompt engineering techniques, we generate accurate, contextually relevant responses to user queries.
  We developed a comprehensive university benchmark, UniversityQuestionBench (UQB), to rigorously evaluate our system performance, based on common key metrics in the filed of RAG pipelines, assessing accuracy and reliability through various metrics and real-world scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the precision and relevance of generated responses, enhancing user experience and reducing the time required to obtain relevant answers. In summary, this paper presents a novel application of RAG pipelines and LLMs, supported by a meticulously prepared university benchmark, offering valuable insights into advanced AI techniques for academic data retrieval and setting the stage for future research in this domain.</description>

      <title>G-RAG: Knowledge Expansion in Material Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of Material Science, effective information retrieval systems are essential for facilitating research. Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches in Large Language Models (LLMs) often encounter challenges such as outdated information, hallucinations, limited interpretability due to context constraints, and inaccurate retrieval. To address these issues, Graph RAG integrates graph databases to enhance the retrieval process. Our proposed method processes Material Science documents by extracting key entities (referred to as MatIDs) from sentences, which are then utilized to query external Wikipedia knowledge bases (KBs) for additional relevant information. We implement an agent-based parsing technique to achieve a more detailed representation of the documents. Our improved version of Graph RAG called G-RAG further leverages a graph database to capture relationships between these entities, improving both retrieval accuracy and contextual understanding. This enhanced approach demonstrates significant improvements in performance for domains that require precise information retrieval, such as Material Science.</description>

      <title>DUET: A Tuning-Free Device-Cloud Collaborative Parameters Generation Framework for Efficient Device Model Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05227v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Device Model Generalization (DMG) is a practical yet under-investigated research topic for on-device machine learning applications. It aims to improve the generalization ability of pre-trained models when deployed on resource-constrained devices, such as improving the performance of pre-trained cloud models on smart mobiles. While quite a lot of works have investigated the data distribution shift across clouds and devices, most of them focus on model fine-tuning on personalized data for individual devices to facilitate DMG. Despite their promising, these approaches require on-device re-training, which is practically infeasible due to the overfitting problem and high time delay when performing gradient calculation on real-time data. In this paper, we argue that the computational cost brought by fine-tuning can be rather unnecessary. We consequently present a novel perspective to improving DMG without increasing computational cost, i.e., device-specific parameter generation which directly maps data distribution to parameters. Specifically, we propose an efficient Device-cloUd collaborative parametErs generaTion framework DUET. DUET is deployed on a powerful cloud server that only requires the low cost of forwarding propagation and low time delay of data transmission between the device and the cloud. By doing so, DUET can rehearse the device-specific model weight realizations conditioned on the personalized real-time data for an individual device. Importantly, our DUET elegantly connects the cloud and device as a 'duet' collaboration, frees the DMG from fine-tuning, and enables a faster and more accurate DMG paradigm. We conduct an extensive experimental study of DUET on three public datasets, and the experimental results confirm our framework's effectiveness and generalisability for different DMG tasks.</description>

      <title>Potential Field Based Deep Metric Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) involves training a network to learn a semantically meaningful representation space. Many current approaches mine n-tuples of examples and model interactions within each tuplets. We present a novel, compositional DML model, inspired by electrostatic fields in physics that, instead of in tuples, represents the influence of each example (embedding) by a continuous potential field, and superposes the fields to obtain their combined global potential field. We use attractive/repulsive potential fields to represent interactions among embeddings from images of the same/different classes. Contrary to typical learning methods, where mutual influence of samples is proportional to their distance, we enforce reduction in such influence with distance, leading to a decaying field. We show that such decay helps improve performance on real world datasets with large intra-class variations and label noise. Like other proxy-based methods, we also use proxies to succinctly represent sub-populations of examples. We evaluate our method on three standard DML benchmarks- Cars-196, CUB-200-2011, and SOP datasets where it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>RIRAG: Regulatory Information Retrieval and Answer Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Regulatory documents, issued by governmental regulatory bodies, establish rules, guidelines, and standards that organizations must adhere to for legal compliance. These documents, characterized by their length, complexity and frequent updates, are challenging to interpret, requiring significant allocation of time and expertise on the part of organizations to ensure ongoing compliance. Regulatory Natural Language Processing (RegNLP) is a multidisciplinary field aimed at simplifying access to and interpretation of regulatory rules and obligations. We introduce a task of generating question-passages pairs, where questions are automatically created and paired with relevant regulatory passages, facilitating the development of regulatory question-answering systems. We create the ObliQA dataset, containing 27,869 questions derived from the collection of Abu Dhabi Global Markets (ADGM) financial regulation documents, design a baseline Regulatory Information Retrieval and Answer Generation (RIRAG) system and evaluate it with RePASs, a novel evaluation metric that tests whether generated answers accurately capture all relevant obligations while avoiding contradictions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Data-aware Distance Comparison Operations for High-Dimensional Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional approximate $K$ nearest neighbor search (AKNN) is a fundamental task for various applications, including information retrieval. Most existing algorithms for AKNN can be decomposed into two main components, i.e., candidate generation and distance comparison operations (DCOs). While different methods have unique ways of generating candidates, they all share the same DCO process. In this study, we focus on accelerating the process of DCOs that dominates the time cost in most existing AKNN algorithms. To achieve this, we propose an Data-Aware Distance Estimation approach, called DADE, which approximates the exact distance in a lower-dimensional space. We theoretically prove that the distance estimation in DADE is unbiased in terms of data distribution. Furthermore, we propose an optimized estimation based on the unbiased distance estimation formulation. In addition, we propose a hypothesis testing approach to adaptively determine the number of dimensions needed to estimate the exact distance with sufficient confidence. We integrate DADE into widely-used AKNN search algorithms, e.g., IVF and HNSW, and conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority.</description>
