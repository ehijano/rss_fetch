      <title>Inverse scattering without phase: Carleman convexification and phase retrieval via the Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenging and interesting inverse problem of reconstructing the spatially varying dielectric constant of a medium from phaseless backscattering measurements generated by single-point illumination. The underlying mathematical model is governed by the three-dimensional Helmholtz equation, and the available data consist solely of the magnitude of the scattered wave field. To address the nonlinearity and severe ill-posedness of this phaseless inverse scattering problem, we introduce a robust, globally convergent numerical framework combining several key regularization strategies. Our method first employs a phase retrieval step based on the Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin (WKB) ansatz, where the lost phase information is reconstructed by solving a nonlinear optimization problem. Subsequently, we implement a Fourier-based dimension reduction technique, transforming the original problem into a more stable system of elliptic equations with Cauchy boundary conditions. To solve this resulting system reliably, we apply the Carleman convexification approach, constructing a strictly convex weighted cost functional whose global minimizer provides an accurate approximation of the true solution. Numerical simulations using synthetic data with high noise levels demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, confirming its capability to accurately recover both the geometric location and contrast of hidden scatterers.</description>

      <title>Genuinely multi-dimensional stationarity preserving global flux Finite Volume formulation for nonlinear hyperbolic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Finite Volume methods for multi-dimensional problems include stabilization (e.g. via a Riemann solver), that is derived by considering several one-dimensional problems in different directions. Such methods therefore ignore a possibly existing balance of contributions coming from different directions, such as the one characterizing multi-dimensional stationary states. Instead being preserved, they are usually diffused away by such methods. Stationarity preserving methods use a better suited stabilization term that vanishes at the stationary state, allowing the method to preserve it. This work presents a general approach to stationarity preserving Finite Volume methods for nonlinear conservation/balance laws. It is based on a multi-dimensional extension of the global flux approach. The new methods are shown to significantly outperform existing ones even if the latter are of higher order of accuracy and even on non-stationary solutions.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Mixed Quantum Channels via Projected Gradient Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing a mixed quantum channel is challenging due to the complexity of the transformations and the probabilistic mixtures of more straightforward channels involved. Fully characterizing a quantum channel generally requires preparing a complete set of input states, such as a basis for the state space, and measuring the corresponding output states. In this work, we begin by investigating a single input-output pair using projected gradient dynamics. This approach applies optimization flows constrained to the Stiefel manifold and the probabilistic simplex to identify the original quantum channel. The convergence of the flow is guaranteed by its relationship to the Zariski topology. We present numerical investigations of models adapted to various scenarios, including those with multiple input-output pairs, highlighting the flexibility and efficiency of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Semi Analytical Solution of a Nonlinear Oblique Boundary Value Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new numerical method is developed to approximate the solution of Laplace's equation in the exterior of the sphere with a strongly nonlinear boundary value of oblique type. A functional analysis attempt to solve this type of boundary condition is not straight forward since results about existence and uniqueness of solution are still limited. Hence, a semi analytical method is described here to approach a solution. A perturbation solution around the monopole converts the nonlinear oblique problem into a series of known Neumann problems in the exterior of the sphere. The corresponding Green's function representation for the exterior Neumann problem gives an exact analytic solution for each perturbation step as an integral on the surface of the sphere. Nevertheless, the boundary conditions become very complicated and require to be approximated numerically. The perturbation solutions given by integrals of the Green's function on the sphere are computed at each perturbation step using different subdivisions of the surface integrals with the help of adaptive quadrature method. We call icosahedron method to the integration on the sphere with an icosahedron mesh using Gauss 5-point or adaptive quadrature, according to the integration parameter. This method was very effective to deal with the singularity of the Green's function successfully avoiding inaccuracies on the numerical approximation and is an important contribution of this work. The numerical perturbation scheme is performed for two given exact solutions. The icosahedron method is found to be very precise. The approximations show the desired properties: they get closer to the exact solutions as the perturbation parameter gets smaller, show rapid convergence in the exterior of the unit sphere and converge to zero as the radius grows.</description>

      <title>StructMG: A Fast and Scalable Structured Algebraic Multigrid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parallel multigrid is widely used as preconditioners in solving large-scale sparse linear systems. However, the current multigrid library still needs more satisfactory performance for structured grid problems regarding speed and scalability. Based on the classical 'multigrid seesaw', we derive three necessary principles for an efficient structured multigrid, which instructs our design and implementation of StructMG, a fast and scalable algebraic multigrid that constructs hierarchical grids automatically. As a preconditioner, StructMG can achieve both low cost per iteration and good convergence when solving large-scale linear systems with iterative methods in parallel. A stencil-based triple-matrix product via symbolic derivation and code generation is proposed for multi-dimensional Galerkin coarsening to reduce grid complexity, operator complexity, and implementation effort. A unified parallel framework of sparse triangular solver is presented to achieve fast convergence and high parallel efficiency for smoothers, including dependence-preserving Gauss-Seidel and incomplete LU methods. Idealized and real-world problems from radiation hydrodynamics, petroleum reservoir simulation, numerical weather prediction, and solid mechanics, are evaluated on ARM and X86 platforms to show StructMG's effectiveness. In comparison to \textit{hypre}'s structured and general multigrid preconditioners, StructMG achieves the fastest time-to-solutions in all cases with average speedups of 15.5x, 5.5x, 6.7x, 7.3x over SMG, PFMG, SysPFMG, and BoomerAMG, respectively. StructMG also significantly improves strong and weak scaling efficiencies.</description>

      <title>Computing rough solutions of the KdV equation below ${\bf L^2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a novel numerical and analytical framework for solving the Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) equation in the negative Sobolev spaces, where classical numerical methods fail due to their reliance on high regularity and inability to control nonlinear interactions at low regularities. Numerical analysis is established by combining a continuous reformulation of the numerical scheme, the Bourgain-space estimates for the continuous reformulation, and a rescaling strategy that reduces the reformulated problem to a small initial value problem, which allow us to bridge a critical gap between numerical analysis and theoretical well-posedness by designing the first numerical method capable of solving the KdV equation in the negative Sobolev spaces. The numerical scheme is proved to have nearly optimal-order convergence with respect to the spatial degrees of freedom in the $H^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ norm for initial data in $H^s$, with $-\frac{1}{2} &lt; s \leq 0$, a result unattainable by existing numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Do locking-free finite element schemes lock for holey Reissner-Mindlin plates with mixed boundary conditions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit finite element discretizations of the Reissner-Mindlin plate in the case of non-simply connected (holey) domains with mixed boundary conditions. Guided by the de Rham complex, we develop conditions under which schemes deliver locking-free, optimal rates of convergence. We naturally recover the typical assumptions arising for clamped, simply supported plates. More importantly, we also see new conditions arise naturally from the presence of holes in the domain or in the case of mixed boundary conditions. We show that, fortunately, many of the existing popularly used schemes do, in fact, satisfy all of the conditions, and thus are locking-free.</description>

      <title>Scalable inference of large-scale random kronecker graphs via tensor decomposition and Einstein summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the analysis of random Kronecker graphs to multi-dimensional networks represented as tensors, enabling a more detailed and nuanced understanding of complex network structures. We decompose the adjacency tensor of such networks into two components: a low-rank signal tensor that captures the essential network structure and a zero-mean noise tensor that accounts for random variations. Building on recent advancements in tensor decomposition and random tensor theory, we introduce a generalized denoise-and-solve framework that leverages the Einstein summation convention for efficient tensor operations. This approach significantly reduces computational complexity while demonstrating strong performance in network inference tasks, providing a scalable and efficient solution for analyzing large-scale, multi-dimensional networks.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Finite Difference WENO-like Scheme with Physical Constraint Preservation for Divergence-Preserving Hyperbolic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alternative finite difference Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (AFD-WENO) schemes allow us to very efficiently update hyperbolic systems even in complex geometries. Recent innovations in AFD-WENO methods allow us to treat hyperbolic system with non-conservative products almost as efficiently as conservation laws. However, some PDE systems,like computational electrodynamics (CED) and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), have involution constraints that require divergence-free or divergence-preserving evolution of vector fields. In such situations, a Yee-style collocation of variables proves indispensable; and that collocation is retained in this work. In previous works, only higher order finite volume discretization of such involution constrained systems was possible. In this work, we show that substantially more efficient AFD-WENO methods have been extended to encompass divergence-preserving hyperbolic PDEs.
  Our method retains the Yee-style collocation of normal components of...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on a phase field approximation of Plateau's problem. Inspired by Reifenberg's point of view, we introduce a model that combines the Ambrosio-Torterelli energy with a geodesic distance term, which can be considered as a generalization of the approach developed by Bonnivard, Lemenant and Santambrogio to approximate solutions to Steiner's problem. First, we present a Gamma-convergence analysis of this model in the simple case of a single curve located on the edge of a cylinder. In a numerical section, we detail the numerical optimisation schemes used to minimize this energy for numerous examples, for which good approximations of solutions to Plateau's problem are found.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Bridging the Divide Between Conservative and Non-Conservative Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of computational fluid dynamics, traditional numerical methods, which heavily rely on discretization, typically necessitate the formulation of partial differential equations (PDEs) in conservative form to accurately capture shocks and other discontinuities in compressible flows. Conversely, utilizing non-conservative forms often introduces significant errors near these discontinuities or results in smeared shocks. This dependency poses a considerable limitation, particularly as many PDEs encountered in complex physical phenomena, such as multi-phase flows, are inherently non-conservative. This inherent non-conservativity restricts the direct applicability of standard numerical solvers designed for conservative forms. This work aims to thoroughly investigate the sensitivity of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to the choice of PDE formulation (conservative vs. non-conservative) when solving problems involving shocks and discontinuities. We have conducted this investigation across a range of benchmark problems, specifically the Burgers equation and both steady and unsteady Euler equations, to provide a comprehensive understanding of PINNs capabilities in this critical area.</description>

      <title>Augmented Lagrangian methods for infeasible convex optimization problems and diverging proximal-point algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the convergence behavior of augmented Lagrangian methods (ALMs) when applied to convex optimization problems that may be infeasible. ALMs are a popular class of algorithms for solving constrained optimization problems. We establish progressively stronger convergence results, ranging from basic sequence convergence to precise convergence rates, under a hierarchy of assumptions. In particular, we demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, the sequences of iterates generated by ALMs converge to solutions of the ``closest feasible problem''.
  This study leverages the classical relationship between ALMs and the proximal-point algorithm applied to the dual problem. A key technical contribution is a set of concise results on the behavior of the proximal-point algorithm when applied to functions that may not have minimizers. These results pertain to its convergence in terms of its subgradients and of the values of the convex conjugate.</description>

      <title>Numerical entropy production in finite volume $P_0P_M$ ADER schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider conservation laws endowed with an entropy inequality and we study the residual of this inequality, which represents the numerical entropy production by the approximation scheme we are considering. This idea has been introduced and exploited in Runge-Kutta finite volume methods, where the numerical entropy production has been used as an indicator in adaptive schemes, since it scales as the local truncation error of the method for smooth solutions and it highlights the presence of discontinuities and their kind.
  The aim of this work is to extend this idea to finite volume $P_0P_M$ ADER timestepping techniques. We show that the numerical entropy production can be defined also in this context and it provides a scalar quantity computable for each space-time volume which, under grid refinement, decays to zero with the same rate of convergence of the scheme for smooth solutions. Its size gradually increases when the local solution regularity lowers, remaining bounded up to contact discontinuities and divergent on shock waves. Theoretical results are proven in a multi-dimensional setting on arbitrary grids. We also present numerical evidence showing that it is essentially negative definite. Moreover, we propose an example of $p$-adaptive scheme that uses the numerical entropy production as a-posteriori smoothness indicator. The scheme locally modifies its order of convergence with the purpose of removing the oscillations due to the high-order of accuracy of the scheme.</description>

      <title>PhysicsSolver: Transformer-Enhanced Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Forward and Forecasting Problems in Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-dependent partial differential equations are a significant class of equations that describe the evolution of various physical phenomena over time. One of the open problems in scientific computing is predicting the behaviour of the solution outside the given temporal region. Most traditional numerical methods are applied to a given time-space region and can only accurately approximate the solution of the given region. To address this problem, many deep learning-based methods, basically data-driven and data-free approaches, have been developed to solve these problems. However, most data-driven methods require a large amount of data, which consumes significant computational resources and fails to utilize all the necessary information embedded underlying the partial differential equations (PDEs). Moreover, data-free approaches such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) may not be that ideal in practice, as traditional PINNs, which primarily rely on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), tend to overlook the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in real-world physical systems. We propose a method denoted as \textbf{PhysicsSolver} that merges the strengths of two approaches: data-free methods that can learn the intrinsic properties of physical systems without using data, and data-driven methods, which are effective at making predictions. Extensive numerical experiments have demonstrated the efficiency and robustness of our proposed method. We provide the code at \href{https://github.com/PhysicsSolver/PhysicsSolver}{https://github.com/PhysicsSolver}.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of the Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch equation with spin-torques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current-induced magnetisation dynamics in a ferromagnet at elevated temperatures can be described by the Landau--Lifshitz--Bloch (LLB) equation with spin-torque terms. In this paper, we focus on the regime above the Curie temperature. We first establish the existence and uniqueness of a global strong solution to the model in spatial dimensions $d=1,2,3$, under an additional smallness assumption on the initial data if $d=3$. Relevant smoothing and decay estimates are also derived. We then propose a fully discrete, linearly implicit finite element scheme for the problem and prove that it achieves optimal-order convergence, assuming adequate regularity of the exact solution. In addition, we introduce an unconditionally energy-stable finite element method for the case of negligible non-adiabatic torque. This scheme is also shown to converge optimally and, in the absence of current, preserves energy dissipation at the discrete level. Finally, we present numerical simulations that support the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Least Squares with Equality constraints Extreme Learning Machines for the resolution of PDEs</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the use of single hidden-layer neural networks as a family of ansatz functions for the resolution of partial differential equations (PDEs). In particular, we train the network via Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) on the residual of the equation collocated on -- eventually randomly chosen -- points. Because the approximation is done directly in the formulation, such a method falls into the framework of Physically Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and has been named PIELM. Since its first introduction, the method has been refined variously, and one successful variant is the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (XTFC). However, XTFC strongly takes advantage of the description of the domain as a tensor product. Our aim is to extend XTFC to domains with general shapes. The novelty of the procedure proposed in the present paper is related to the treatment of boundary conditions via constrained imposition, so that our method is named Least Squares with Equality constraints ELM (LSEELM). An in-depth analysis and comparison with the cited methods is performed, again with the analysis of the convergence of the method in various scenarios. We show the efficiency of the procedure both in terms of computational cost and in terms of overall accuracy.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for O-RAN Slicing: A Semi-Supervised Approach with VAE and Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08861v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel generative AI (GAI)-driven, unified semi-supervised learning architecture for optimizing resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. Termed Generative Semi-Supervised VAE-Contrastive Learning, our approach maximizes the weighted user equipment (UE) throughput and allocates physical resource blocks (PRBs) to enhance the quality of service for eMBB and URLLC services. The GAI framework utilizes a dedicated xApp for intelligent power control and PRB allocation. This integrated GAI model synergistically combines the generative power of a VAE with contrastive learning to achieve robustness in an end-to-end trainable system. It is a semi-supervised training approach that concurrently optimizes supervised regression of resource allocation decisions (i.e., power, UE association, PRB) and unsupervised contrastive objectives. This intrinsic fusion improves the precision of resource management and model generalization in dynamic mobile networks. We evaluated our GAI methodology against exhaustive search and deep Q-Network algorithms using key performance metrics. Results show our integrated GAI approach offers superior efficiency and effectiveness in various scenarios, presenting a compelling GAI-based solution for critical network slicing and resource management challenges in next-generation O-RAN systems.</description>
