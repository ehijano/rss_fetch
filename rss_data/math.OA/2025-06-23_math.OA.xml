      <title>On the classification of $C^*$-algebras of twisted isometries with finite dimensional wandering spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \( m, n \in \mathbb{N}_0 \), and let \( X \) be a closed subset of \( \mathbb{T}^{\binom{m+n}{2}} \). We define \( C^{m,n}_X \) to be the universal \( C^* \)-algebra among those generated by \( m \) unitaries and \( n \) isometries satisfying doubly twisted commutation relations with respect to a twist \( \mathcal{U} = \{U_{ij}\}_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq m+n} \) of commuting unitaries having joint spectrum \( X \).
  We provide a complete list of the irreducible representations of \( C^{m,n}_X \) up to unitary equivalence and, under a denseness assumption on \( X \), explicitly construct a faithful representation of \( C^{m,n}_X \). Under the same assumption, we also give a necessary and sufficient condition on a fixed tuple \( \mathcal{U} \) of commuting unitaries with joint spectrum \( X \) for the existence of a universal tuple of \( \mathcal{U} \)-doubly twisted isometries.
  For \( X = \mathbb{T}^{\binom{m+n}{2}} \), we compute the \( K \)-groups of \( C^{m,n}_X \). We further classify the \( C^* \)-algebras generated by a pair of doubly twisted isometries with a fixed parameter \( \theta \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Q} \), whose wandering spaces are finite-dimensional. Finally, for a fixed unitary \( U \), we classify all the \( C^* \)-algebras generated by a pair of \( U \)-doubly twisted isometries with finite-dimensional wandering spaces.</description>

      <title>Inclusions of Standard Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard subspaces are closed real subspaces of a complex Hilbert space that appear naturally in Tomita-Takesaki modular theory and its applications to quantum field theory. In this article, inclusions of standard subspaces are studied independently of von Neumann algebras. Several new methods for their investigation are developed, related to polarizers, Gelfand triples defined by modular data, and extensions of modular operators. A particular class of examples that arises from the fundamental irreducible building block of a conformal field theory on the line is analyzed in detail.</description>

      <title>Higher reflections and entropy of canonical shifts for inclusions of $C^*$-algebras with finite Watatani index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a unital inclusion of simple $C^*$-algebras equipped with a conditional expectation of index-finite type, we study higher Fourier transforms and rotation operators and introduce the reflection operators on the relative commutants. We prove that the reflections are unital, involutive, $*$-preserving anti-homomorphisms that preserve certain Markov-type traces. As an application, we prove Fourier theoretic inequalities on the higher relative commutants and improve the existing constant in the Young's inequality found in the literature. By employing the reflection operators, we define a canonical shift on the von Neumann algebra generated by the relative commutants. We establish a connection between the Connes-St{\o}rmer entropy of the canonical shift and the minimal Watatani index.</description>

      <title>Cuntz--Pimsner algebras of partial automorphisms twisted by vector bundles II: Nuclear dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Cuntz--Pimsner algebras associated to partial automorphisms twisted by vector bundles are classifiable in the sense of the Elliott program whenever the action is minimal and the base space is compact, infinite and has finite covering dimension. We also investigate the tracial state space of our algebras, and show that traces are in bijection to certain conformal measures. This generalizes results about partial crossed products by Geffen and complements results about the $C^*$-algebras associated to homeomorphisms twisted by vector bundles of Adamo, Archey, Forough, Georgescu, Jeong, Strung and Viola. We use our findings to generalize various existing statements about orbit-breaking subalgebras.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansion for groupoids and Roe type algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of expansion for groupoids, which recovers the classical notion of expander graphs by a family of pair groupoids and expanding actions in measure by transformation groupoids. We also consider an asymptotic version for expansion and establish structural theorems, showing that asymptotic expansion can be approximated by domains of expansions. On the other hand, we introduce dynamical propagation and quasi-locality for operators on groupoids and the associated Roe type algebras. Our main results characterise when these algebras possess block-rank-one projections by means of asymptotic expansion, which generalises the crucial ingredients in previous works to provide counterexamples to the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate linear operators $A:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. We give explicit operators $A$ such that, for fixed $d\in\mathbb{N}_0$ and closed $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, $e^A\mathrm{Pos}(K)_{\leq 2d}\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]_{\leq d}^2$. We give an explicit operator $A$ such that $e^A\mathrm{Pos}(\mathbb{R}^n)\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]^2$. For $K\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, we give a condition such that $A$ exists with $e^A\mathrm{Pos}(K)\subseteq\sum\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]^2$. In the framework of regular Fr\'echet Lie groups and Lie algebras we investigate the linear operators $A$ such that $e^{tA}:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is well-defined for all $t\in\mathbb{R}$. We give a three-line-proof of Stochel's Theorem.</description>

Abstract: This is a thorough investigation on the real $K$-theory of the sphere $S^d$ associated with the antipodal involution. We calculate the algebraic structure of real $K$-theory and united $K$-theory for all $d$, we write down explicit unitaries representing the generators of all the non-trivial $K$-theory groups for $d \leq 4$, and we describe a recipe for generating such unitaries for all $d$.</description>

      <title>The odd spectral localiser via asymptotic morphisms and quasi-projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the index pairing between an odd K-theory class and an odd unbounded Kasparov module by a pair of quasi-projections, supported on a submodule obtained from a finite spectral truncation. We achieve this by pairing the K-theory class with an asymptotic morphism determined by the unbounded Kasparov module. We interpret the spectral localiser of Loring and Schulz-Baldes as an instance of such an index pairing.</description>

      <title>Cuntz--Pimsner algebras of partial automorphisms twisted by vector bundles I: Fixed point algebra, simplicity and the tracial state space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We associate a $C^*$-algebra to a partial action of the integers acting on the base space of a vector bundle, using the framework of Cuntz--Pimsner algebras. We investigate the structure of the fixed point algebra under the canonical gauge action, and show that it arises from a continuous field of $C^*$-algebras over the base space, generalising results of Vasselli. We also analyse the ideal structure, and show that for a free action, ideals correspond to open invariant subspaces of the base space. This shows that if the action is free and minimal, then the Cuntz--Pimsner algebra is simple. In the case of a line bundle, we establish a bijective corrrespondence between tracial states on the algebra and invariant measures on the base space. This generalizes results about the $C^*$-algebras associated to homeomorphisms twisted by vector bundles of Adamo, Archey, Forough, Georgescu, Jeong, Strung and Viola.</description>

      <title>Cup and cap products for cohomology and homology groups of ample groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the cup and cap products within the cohomology and homology groups of ample groupoids, focusing on their applications and fundamental properties. Ample groupoids, which are \'etale groupoids with a totally disconnected unit space, play a crucial role in the study of topological dynamical systems and operator algebras. We introduce the cup product, which defines a bilinear map on cohomology classes, providing a graded ring structure, and the cap product, which defines a bilinear map relating homology and cohomology. The paper aims to make these concepts accessible to a broader mathematical audience, offering clear definitions and detailed explanations. We also demonstrate an application of the cap product in the analysis of automorphisms of groupoid $C^*$-algebras. Specifically, we show how it helps determine the asymptotic innerness of automorphisms. Our results include the first explicit computations of cup products in the cohomology of tiling spaces, which may pave the way for new research in this area.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms for matrix geometric means</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix geometric means between two positive definite matrices can be defined from distinct perspectives - as solutions to certain nonlinear systems of equations, as points along geodesics in Riemannian geometry, and as solutions to certain optimisation problems. We devise quantum subroutines for the matrix geometric means, and construct solutions to the algebraic Riccati equation - an important class of nonlinear systems of equations appearing in machine learning, optimal control, estimation, and filtering. Using these subroutines, we present a new class of quantum learning algorithms, for both classical and quantum data, called quantum geometric mean metric learning, for weakly supervised learning and anomaly detection. The subroutines are also useful for estimating geometric R\'enyi relative entropies and the Uhlmann fidelity, in particular achieving optimal dependence on precision for the Uhlmann and Matsumoto fidelities. Finally, we provide a BQP-complete problem based on matrix geometric means that can be solved by our subroutines.</description>

      <title>Conjugating trivial automorphisms of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)/\mathrm{Fin}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A trivial automorphism of the Boolean algebra $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ is an automorphism induced by the action of some function $\mathbb N \rightarrow \mathbb N$. In models of forcing axioms all automorphisms are trivial, and therefore two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if they have the same (modulo finite) cycle structure. We show that the Continuum Hypothesis implies that two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if there are neither first-order obstructions nor index obstructions for their conjugacy. This is equivalent to given trivial automorphisms being conugate in some forcing extension of the universe.
  To each automorphism $\alpha$ of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ we associate the first-order structure $\mathfrak{A}_\alpha=(\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin},\alpha)$ and compute the existential theories of these structures.
  These results are applied to resolve a question of Braga, Farah, and Vignati and prove that there are coarse metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ such that the isomorphism between their uniform Roe coronas is independent from $\mathsf{ZFC}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Absolute continuity of polynomially bounded $n$-tuples of commuting contractions is studied. A necessary and sufficient condition is found in Constantin Apostol's "weakened $C_{0,\cdot}$ assumption", asserting the convergence to 0 of the powers of each operator in a specific topology. Kosiek with Octavio considered tuples of Hilbert space contractions satisfying the von-Neumann Inequality. We extend their results to a wider class of tuples, where there may be no unitary dilation and the bounding constant may be greater than 1. This proof also applies to Banach space contractions and uses decompositions of A-measures with respect to bands of measures related to Gleason parts of the polydisc algebra.</description>

      <title>Thirty-six officers, artisanally entangled</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A perfect tensor of order $d$ is a state of four $d$-level systems that is maximally entangled under any bipartition. These objects have attracted considerable attention in quantum information and many-body theory. Perfect tensors generalize the combinatorial notion of orthogonal Latin squares (OLS). Deciding whether OLS of a given order exist has historically been a difficult problem. The case $d=6$ proved particularly thorny, and was popularized by Leonhard Euler in terms of a putative constellation of "36 officers". It took more than a century to show that Euler's puzzle has no solution. After yet another century, its quantum generalization was resolved in the affirmative: 36 entangled officers can be suitably arranged. However, the construction and verification of known instances relies on elaborate computer codes. In this paper, we present the first human-made order-$6$ perfect tensors. We decompose the Hilbert space $(\mathbb{C}^6)^{\otimes 2}$ of two quhexes into the direct sum $(\mathbb{C}^3)^{\otimes 2}\oplus(\mathbb{C}^3)^{\otimes 3}$ comprising superpositions of two-qutrit and three-qutrit states. Perfect tensors arise when certain Clifford unitaries are applied separately to the two sectors. Technically, our construction realizes solutions to the perfect functions ansatz recently proposed by Rather. Generalizing an observation of Bruzda and \.Zyczkowski, we show that any solution of this kind gives rise to a two-unitary complex Hadamard matrix, of which we construct infinite families. Finally, we sketch a formulation of the theory of perfect tensors in terms of quasi-orthogonal decompositions of matrix algebras.</description>
