      <title>$N$-photon bundles emission in high-spin Jaynes-Cummings model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-spin quantum systems, endowed with rich internal degrees of freedom, constitute a promising platform for manipulating high-quality $n$-photon states. In this study, we explore $n$-photon bundles emission by constructing a high-spin Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) within a single-mode cavity interacting with a single spin-$3/2$ atom. Our analysis reveals that the $n$-photon dressed state splittings can be significantly enhanced by adjusting the linear Zeeman shift inherent to the internal degrees of freedom in high-spin systems, thereby yielding well-resolved $n$-photon resonance. The markedly enhanced energy-spectrum anharmonicity, stemming from strong nonlinearities, enables the realization of high-quality $n$-photon bundles emission with large steady-state photon numbers, in contrast to conventional spin-1/2 JCM setups. Of particular interest is the realization of an optical multimode transducer capable of transitioning among single-photon blockade, two- to four-photon bundles emission, and photon-induced tunneling by tuning the light-cavity detuning in the presence of both cavity and atomic pump fields. This work unveils significant opportunities for diverse applications in nonclassical all-optical switching and high-quality multiphoton sources, deepening our understanding of creating specialized nonclassical states and fundamental physics in high-spin atom-cavity systems.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation of THz photons in an optical microcavity with Landau-quantized electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical model for a coherent terahertz radiation source based on Bose-Einstein condensate of incoherently pumped microcavity photons. Energy relaxation is provided by inelastic photon scattering on a two-dimensional electron gas in magnetic field. The proposed setup evades the standard lasing mechanisms: neither population inversion nor light wave amplification is utilized. We study the kinetics of photon condensation and describe a semiconductor-crystal based device.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced inversion of chiral transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the chiral transport of interacting bosons in a two-leg flux ladder with on-site interactions. Focusing on the flux-induced chiral current along the two legs, we show that, counter-intuitively, on-site interactions can reverse the direction of the chiral flow. For a Bose-Einstein condensate whose dynamical evolution is driven by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation under the mean-field approximation, this reversal can be understood as an interaction-induced dynamic occupation inversion, under which single-particle band with opposing chirality becomes heavily populated in the dynamics. This chirality inversion also persists in the two-body dynamics with strong quantum fluctuations beyond the mean-field regime, as demonstrated through time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group and exact diagonalization analyses. Herein, besides the band-occupation-inversion mechanism, we find that the formation of two-body bound states with opposite chirality contributes significantly to the reversed chiral transport. Our discovery highlights the significance of correlation effects in quantum transport, and can be readily demonstrated using cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Topological phases protected by projective PT symmetry in alkaline-earth-like atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important aspect in categorizing topological phases is whether the system is spinless or spinful, given that these classes exhibit distinct symmetry algebras, leading to disparate topological classifications. By utilizing the projective presentation strategy, the topological phases of spinless (or spinful) systems can be emulated using spinful (or spinless) systems augmented with gauge fields. In this study, we propose to implement the topological phases safeguarded by the unique projective space-time (PT) symmetry inherent to spinful models, using synthetic spinless alkaline-earth-like atoms. Employing the separation of orbital and nuclear-spin degrees of freedom, the model is configured as a rectangular tube penetrated by a uniform magnetic flux through each plaquette, which simulates a spinless ladder endowed with projective PT symmetry satisfying the algebraic properties of a spinful model. For interacting topological phases with inter-orbital spin-exchange interactions, which also adhere to PT symmetry, the four-fold degeneracy of edge modes is split into two pairs of edge modes with two-fold degeneracy. We map the complete phase diagram in the end and discover that these interacting topological phases ultimately evolve into distinct charge-density-wave phases via spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Vortex shedding patterns in holographic superfluids at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of superfluid systems exhibit significant similarities to their classical counterparts, particularly in the phenomenon of vortex shedding triggered by a moving obstacle. In such systems, the universal behavior of shedding patterns can be classified using the classical concept of the Reynolds number $Re=\frac{v \sigma}{\nu}$ (characteristic length scale $\sigma$, velocity $v$ and viscosity $\nu$), which has been shown to generalize to quantum systems at absolute zero temperature. However, it remains unclear whether this universal behavior holds at finite temperatures, where viscosity arises from two distinct sources: thermal excitations and quantum vortex viscosity. Using a holographic model of finite-temperature superfluids, we investigate the vortex shedding patterns and identify two distinct regimes without quantum counterparts: a periodic vortex dipole pattern and a vortex dipole train pattern. By calculating the shedding frequency, Reynolds number, and Strouhal number, we find that these behaviors are qualitatively similar to empirical observations in both classical and quantum counterparts, which imply the robustness of vortex shedding dynamics at finite-temperature superfluid systems.</description>

      <title>Scheme to Detect the Strong-to-weak Symmetry Breaking via Randomized Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking plays a central role in classifying the phases of quantum many-body systems. Recent developments have highlighted a novel symmetry-breaking pattern, in which the strong symmetry of a density matrix spontaneously breaks to the week symmetry. This strong-to-weak symmetry breaking is typically detected using multi-replica correlation functions, such as the R\'enyi-2 correlator. In this letter, we propose a practical protocol for detecting strong-to-weak symmetry breaking in experiments using the randomized measurement toolbox. Our scheme involves collecting the results of random Pauli measurements for (i) the original quantum state and (ii) the quantum state after evolution with the charged operators. Based on the measurement results, with a large number of samples, we can obtain the exact solution to the R\'enyi-2 correlator. With a small sample size, we can still provide an alternative approach to estimate the phase boundary to a decent accuracy. We perform numerical simulations of Ising chains with all-to-all decoherence as an exemplary demonstration. Our result opens the opportunity for the experimental studies of the novel quantum phases in mixed quantum states.</description>

      <title>Phases and dynamics of quantum droplets in the crossover to two-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the ground states and dynamics of ultracold atomic droplets in the crossover region from three to two dimensions by solving the two-dimensional and the quasi two-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii equations numerically and with a variational approach. By systematically comparing the droplet properties, we determine the validity regions of the pure two-dimensional description, and therefore the dominance of the logarithmic nonlinear coupling, as a function of the sign of the averaged mean-field interactions and the size of the transverse confinement. One of our main findings is that droplets become substantially extended upon transitioning from negative-to-positive averaged mean-field interactions. This is accompanied by a significant reduction of their binding energies which are approximately inversely proportional to the square of their size. To explore fundamental dynamical properties in the cross-over region, we study interaction quenches and show that the droplets perform a periodic breathing motion for modest quench strengths, while larger quench amplitudes lead to continuous expansion exhibiting density ring structures. We also showcase that it is possible to form complex bulk and surface density patterns in anisotropic geometries following the quench. Since we are working with realistic parameters, our results can directly facilitate future experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Steering spin fluctuations in lattice systems via two-tone Floquet engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the control of spin pair fluctuations using two-tone Floquet engineering. We consider a one-dimensional spin-1/2 lattice with periodically modulated spin exchanges using parametric resonances. The stroboscopic dynamics generated from distributed spin exchange modulations lead to spin pair fluctuations reaching quasi-maximally correlated states and a subharmonic response in local observables, breaking the discrete-time translational symmetry. We present a protocol to control the interacting many-body dynamics, producing spatial and temporal localization of correlated spin pairs via dynamically breaking correlated spin pairs from the edges towards the center of the lattice. Our result reveals how spin fluctuations distribute in a heterogeneous lattice depending on parametric resonances. This may open new routes for exploring distinct nonequilibrium states of matter and the conduction of quasiparticles in quantum materials.</description>
