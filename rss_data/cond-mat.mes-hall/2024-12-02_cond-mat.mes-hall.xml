      <title>Independently Tunable Flat Bands and Correlations in a Graphene Double Moir\'e System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a double moir\'e system consisting of four graphene layers, where the top and bottom pairs form small-twist-angle bilayer graphene, and the middle interface has a large rotational mismatch. This system shows clear signatures of two sets of spatially separated flat bands associated with the top and bottom twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) subsystems, each independently tunable. Thermodynamic analysis reveals weak correlations between layers that allow the chemical potential to be measured as a function of carrier density for each constituent TBG. We find that correlated insulating states at integer number of electrons per moir\'e unit cell are most robust near magic angle, whereas gapped states at neutrality are more robust at larger twist angles.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Orbital and Spin Magnetism in $3d$, $4d$, and $5d$ Transition Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the coherent interplay of light with the magnetization in metals has been a long-standing problem in ultrafast magnetism. While it is known that when laser light acts on a metal it can induce magnetization via the process known as the inverse Faraday effect (IFE), the most basic ingredients of this phenomenon are still largely unexplored. In particular, given a strong recent interest in orbital non-equilibrium dynamics and its role in mediating THz emission in transition metals, the exploration of distinct features in spin and orbital IFE is pertinent. Here, we present a first complete study of the spin and orbital IFE in $3d$, $4d$ and $5d$ transition metals of groups IV$-$XI from first-principles. By examining the dependence on the light polarization and frequency, we show that the laser-induced spin and orbital moments may vary significantly both in magnitude and sign. We underpin the interplay between the crystal field splitting and spin-orbit interaction as the key factor which determines the magnitude and key differences between the spin and orbital response. Additionally, we highlight the anisotropy of the effect with respect to the ferromagnetic magnetization and to the crystal structure. The provided complete map of IFE in transition metals is a key reference point in the field of optical magnetism.</description>

      <title>Moir\'{e} band theory for M-valley twisted transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the viability of twisted bilayers of group IV and IVB trigonal transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) MX$_{2}$ (M$=$Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn and X$=$S, Se, Te) as a moir\'{e} material platform. We show that the low energy conduction band states in these systems are accurately described by a set of three emergent periodic Hamiltonians which we derive for a representative homobilayer from small unit cell density functional theory calculations using a local displacement approximation. In monolayer form, these TMDs have conduction band minima with anisotropic effective masses near the three inequivalent Brillouin zone $M$ points, implying a moir\'e band model that has six flavors when spin is included. Because each $M$ point is time-reversal invariant, spontaneous valley polarization is signaled in transport by anisotropy instead of by the anomalous Hall and magnetic circular dichroism effects commonly seen in graphene and $K$-valley TMD based moir\'{e} multilayers.</description>

      <title>Universal Reconstruction of Complex Magnetic Profiles with Minimum Prior Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the intricate magnetic structures of materials is crucial for the advancements in material science, spintronics, and geology. Recent developments of quantum-enabled magnetometers, such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, have enabled direct imaging of magnetic field distributions associated with a wide variety of magnetic profiles. However, reconstructing the magnetization of a sample from a measured magnetic field map poses a complex inverse problem, which can be further complicated by the presence of measurement noise, finite spatial resolution, and the sample-to-sensor distance. While magnetic field distributions are typically measured through various available imaging methods, accurately reconstructing the underlying structures from these maps remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient GPU-based method for reconstructing magnetic source quantities (i.e. spatially varying magnetization density) from measured magnetic fields with minimum prior assumptions. We validate our method by simulating diverse magnetic structures under realistic experimental conditions, including multi-domain ferromagnetism and magnetic spin textures such as skyrmion, anti-skyrmion, and meron. Experimentally, we apply our technique to investigate the magnetic field maps from a lunar rock (Apollo lunar mare basalt sample 10003,184) obtained using a wide-field quantum diamond microscope. The reconstructed magnetic domains of the lunar rock are consistent with current paleomagnetic knowledge. Our approach provides a versatile and universal tool for investigating complex magnetization profiles, paving the way for future quantum sensing experiments.</description>

      <title>Controlling particle-hole symmetry of fractional quantum hall states in trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed experimental study of the particle-hole symmetry (PHS) of the Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) states about half filling in a multiband system. Specifically, we focus on the lowest Landau level of the monolayer-like band of Bernal stacked trilayer graphene (TLG). In pristine TLG, the excitation energy gaps, Land\'e g-factor, effective mass, and disorder broadening of the FQH states are identical to their hole-conjugate counterpart. This precise PH symmetry stems from the lattice mirror symmetry that precludes Landau-level mixing. Introducing a non-zero displacement field \(D\) disrupts this mirror symmetry, facilitating the hybridization between the \(LL_{M}^{0}\) monolayer-like and \(LL_{B}^{2}\) bilayer-like Landau levels. This band hybridization eventually leads to a violation of the PHS of the FQH states. We find the one-third and two-fifth FQH states to be more robust against Landau level mixing than their hole-conjugate states, which agrees with theoretical predictions [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{113}, 086401 (2014)]. The Landau level mixing parameter $\kappa$ is found to increase sharply with $D$. We stress that the PHS breaking in TLG is of extrinsic origin and differs from the intrinsic, interaction-driven symmetry breaking observed in the lowest Landau levels of single-layer and bilayer graphene. Our research identifies an external factor that can manipulate the PHS in FQH states. Further probing this modulation may help experimentally differentiate between the composite fermion model and the Dirac composite fermion model [Phys. Rev. X \textbf{5}, 031027 (2015)].</description>

      <title>Edge dependece of nonlocal transport in gapped bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological properties of gapped graphene have been explored for valleytronics applications. Prior transport experiments indicated their topological nature through large nonlocal resistance in Hall-bar devices, but the origin of this resistance was unclear. This study focused on dual-gate bilayer graphene (BLG) devices with naturally cleaved edges, examining how edge-etching with an oxygen plasma process affects electron transport. Before etching, local resistance at the charge neutral point increased exponentially with the displacement field and nonlocal resistance was well explained by ohmic contribution, which is typical of gapped BLG. After-etching, however, local resistance saturated with increasing displacement field, and nonlocal resistance deviated by three orders of magnitude from ohmic contribution. We suggest that these significant changes in local and nonlocal resistance arise from the formation of edge conducting pathways after the edge-etching, rather than from a topological property of gapped BLG that has been claimed in previous literatures.</description>

      <title>Band Curvature Effects on Quantum Transport of Spin-1 Chiral Fermion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the quantum transport properties of three-dimensional spin-1 chiral fermion systems with a curved trivial band. In the multiband system with two distinct characters--a linear Dirac band and a quadratic trivial band--the hybridization induced by impurity effects leads to pronounced energy and temperature dependences in the electrical conductivity. We show that the conductivity is suppressed by the trivial band in the low-energy regime near the threefold degenerate point and enhanced in the band-crossing point of the Dirac and trivial bands. These results are derived using the self-consistent Born approximation within the framework of linear response theory.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic spin-split states with canted persistent spin textures in two-dimensional Janus $1T^{'}$ $MXX'$ ($M$ = Mo, W; $X\neq X'$= S, Se, Te) controlled by surface alloying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional tungsten-based transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), $MX_{2}$ ($M$: W, Mo; $X$: S, Se, Te) monolayers (MLs) with a $1T'$ structure, serve as significant-gap quantum spin Hall insulators. However, due to the centrosymmetric nature of these crystals, spin degeneracy persists throughout their electronic band structures, limiting their potential for spintronic applications. By modifying the chalcogen ($X$) atoms in the TMDCs ML surface to create a highly stable Janus $MXX'$ MLs structure, we demonstrate through density-functional theory calculations that substantial spin splitting of the electronic states can be achieved. Using the Janus $1T'$ WSTe ML as an example, we observe strongly anisotropic spin-splitting bands exhibiting canted persistent spin textures (PST) near the Fermi level, which differ significantly from those in commonly studied PST materials. We show that this intricate spin splitting and spin textures arise from the strong in-plane $p-d$ orbital coupling between the chalcogen atoms (Te and Se) and tungsten (W) atoms, driven by the reduced symmetry of the crystal's point group. The observed anisotropic spin splitting, along with canted PST, are further explained using a $\vec{k}\cdot\vec{p}$ model derived from symmetry analysis. Importantly, the spin-split states are highly sensitive to surface imperfections induced by the surface alloying effect, such as variations in the concentration of different chalcogen atoms on the ML surface. This highlights the potential of Janus $1T'$ $MXX'$ MLs as promising platforms for future spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Stimulated down-conversion of single-photon emission in a quantum dot placed in a target-frequency microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, two optical processes are mainly used to realize single photon sources: deterministic transitions in a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) placed in a microcavity and spontaneous frequency down-conversion in materials with intrinsic nonlinearity. In this work, we consider another approach that combines the advantages of both, such as high power with on-demand generation from QDs and the possibility of frequency tuning from nonlinear sources. For this purpose, we use stimulated frequency down-conversion occurring directly in the QD inside a microcavity designed not to the exciton frequency in the QD but to the target single photon frequency, which is set by the difference between the exciton resonance and the stimulating laser energies. This down-conversion arises from the second-order nonlinear interaction of an exciton (bright heavy-hole or dark) and a light-hole exciton in the stimulating laser field. We present an analytical model for such a down-conversion process and evaluate its efficiency for a widely sought-after single photon source for the telecom C-band (1530-1565 nm). We show that the emission rate of down-converted single photons can approach MHz. At certain conditions, this process is comparable in efficiency to direct emission from an InAs/GaAs QD at 920 nm, which is outside the cavity mode.</description>

      <title>Designer gapped and tilted Dirac cones in lateral graphene superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a planar array of bipolar waveguides in graphene can be used to engineer gapped and tilted two-dimensional Dirac cones within the electronic band structure. The presence of these gapped and tilted Dirac cones is demonstrated through a superlattice tight-binding model and verified using a transfer matrix calculation. By varying the applied gate voltages, the tilt parameter of these Dirac cones can be controlled and their gaps can be tuned to fall in the terahertz range. The possibility of gate-tunable gapped Dirac cones gives rise to terahertz applications via interband transitions and designer Landau level spectra both of which can be controlled via Dirac cone engineering. We anticipate that our paper will encourage Dirac cone tilt and gap engineering for gate-tunable device applications in lateral graphene superlattices.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Magnetism in CrI$_3$ Monolayers and Bilayers: A DFT+U Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of CrI$_3$ monolayers, which were recently measured, have been investigated considering electronic repulsion and localization effects in Cr 3d orbitals. In this study, we propose a DFT approach using Hubbard U corrections to improve accuracy. We compare the valence density-of-states using the HSE06 hybrid functional and the DFT+U approach, which includes U parameters for both Cr 3d and I 5p orbitals. The results of our study indicate that the optimal values for U(Cr$_{3d}$) and U(I$_{5p}$) are 3.5 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. This approach is further applied to improve calculations of electronic and magnetic properties in CrI$_3$ monolayers and, more importantly, in bilayers combined with van der Waals functionals. These refinements hold promise for further studies of complex CrI$_3$ nanostructures, and may also be of interest for other trihalide few-layer systems.</description>

      <title>Atom probe composition and in situ electronic structure of epitaxial quantum dot ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense arrays of semiconductor quantum dots are currently employed in highly efficient quantum dot lasers for data communications and other applications. Traditionally, the electronic properties of such quantum nanostructures have been treated as isolated objects, with the degree of hybridization between neighboring quantum dots and the wetting layer left unexplored. Here, we use atom probe tomography and transmission electron microscopy to uncover the three-dimensional composition profile of a high-density ensemble of epitaxial InAs/GaAs quantum dots. The sub-nanometer compositional data is used to construct the 3D local band structure and simulate the electronic eigenstates within the dense quantum dot ensemble using finite element method. This in situ electronic simulation reveals a high degree of hybridization between neighboring quantum dots and the wetting layer, in stark contrast to the usual picture of isolated quantum nanostructures. The simulated transition energies are compared with low temperature photoluminescence. This work has important applications for quantum dot laser design and paves the way to engineering ensemble effects in quantum dot lasers and other quantum nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Current-driven motion of magnetic domain-wall skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain-wall skyrmions (DWSKs) are topological spin textures confined within domain walls that have recently attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in racetrack memory technologies. In this study, we theoretically investigated the motion of DWSKs driven by spin-polarized currents in ferromagnetic strips. Our findings reveal that the motion of DWSKs is contingent upon the direction of the current. When the current is applied parallel to the domain wall, both spin-transfer torque (STT) and spin-orbit torque (SOT) can drive the DWSK along the domain wall. Conversely, for currents applied perpendicular to the domain wall, STT can induce DWSK motion by leveraging the skyrmion Hall effect as a driving force, whereas SOT-driven DWSKs halt their motion after sliding along the domain wall. Furthermore, we demonstrated the current-driven motion of DWSKs along curved domain walls and proposed a racetrack memory architecture utilizing DWSKs. These findings advance the understanding of DWSK dynamics and provide insights for the design of spintronic devices based on DWSKs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor nanowires can be utilized to create quantum dot qubits. The formation of quantum dots is typically achieved by means of bottom gates created by a lift-off process. As an alternative, we fabricated flat buried bottom gate structures by filling etched trenches in a Si substrate with sputtered TiN, followed by mechanical polishing. This method achieved gate line pitches as small as 60 nm. The gate fingers have low gate leakage. As a proof of principle, we fabricated quantum dot devices using InAs nanowires placed on the gate fingers. These devices exhibit single electron tunneling and Coulomb blockade.</description>

Abstract: Heterostructures made from 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides are known as ideal platforms to explore excitonic phenomena ranging from correlated moir\'e excitons to degenerate interlayer exciton ensembles. So far, it is assumed that the atomic reconstruction appearing in some of the heterostructures gives rise to a dominating localization of the exciton states. We demonstrate that excitonic states in reconstructed MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructures can extend well beyond the moir\'e periodicity of the investigated heterostructures. The results are based on real-space calculations yielding a lateral potential map for interlayer excitons within the strain-relaxed heterostructures and corresponding real-space excitonic wavefunctions. We combine the theoretical results with cryogenic photoluminescence experiments, which support the computed level structure and relaxation characteristics of the interlayer excitons.</description>

      <title>Fractons on the edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of edge excitations of fractonic systems in two dimensions, and elucidate their connections to bulk transport properties and quantum statistics of bulk excitations. The system we consider has immobile point charges, dipoles constrained to move only along lines perpendicular to their moment, and freely mobile quadrupoles and higher multipoles, realizing a bulk fractonic analog of fractional quantum Hall phases. We demonstrate that a quantized braiding phase between two bulk excitations is obtained only in two cases: when a point quadrupole braids around an immobile point charge, or when two non-orthogonal point dipoles braid with one another. The presence of a boundary edge in the system entails $\textit{two}$ types of gapless edge excitation modes, one that is fractonic with immobile charges and longitudinal dipoles, and a second non-fractonic mode consisting of transverse dipoles. We derive a novel current algebra of the fractonic edge modes. Further, investigating the effect of local edge-to-edge tunneling on these modes, we find that such a process is a relevant perturbation suggesting the possibility of edge deformation.</description>

      <title>Vibrational excitations in magnetic triangular nanographenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) is a powerful measurement technique often used in scanning tunneling spectroscopy to probe excited states of various nanostructures, e.g., the magnetic properties of complex spin systems. The observed excited states can be of magnetic and vibrational origin and it is therefore necessary to differentiate between these two excitation mechanisms. Here, we investigate the spin S = 1/2 phenalenyl radical on Au(111). IETS measurements feature inelastic excitations, whereas the spatial distribution of their intensity excludes any spin excitations. Comparison to theoretical simulations proves the vibrational origin of those excitations and allows us to assign the observed features to distinct vibrational modes.</description>

      <title>Observation of a non-reciprocal skyrmion Hall effect of hybrid chiral skyrmion tubes in synthetic antiferromagnetic multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological spin textures in magnetic materials beyond two-dimensional skyrmions have attracted attention for electronics beyond CMOS technologies. In particular, three-dimensional (3D) topological spin textures are promising due to the expected complex non-linear dynamics as well as high static and dynamic thermal stability. In multilayer heterostructures, a hybrid chiral skyrmion tube is a well-known example of a 3D topological spin texture, exhibiting an intriguing chirality transition along the thickness direction. This transition progresses from left-handed to right-handed N\'eel-type chirality, passing through a Bloch-type intermediate state. Such an exotic spin configuration potentially exhibits distinctly different dynamics from that of the common skyrmion tube that exhibits a homogeneous chirality; yet these dynamics have not been ascertained so far. Here we reveal the distinct features of current-induced dynamics that result from the hybrid chiral skyrmion tube structure in synthetic antiferromagnetic (SyAFM) multilayers. Strikingly, the SyAFM hybrid chiral skyrmion tubes exhibit a non-reciprocal skyrmion Hall effect in the flow regime. The non-reciprocity can even be tuned by the degree of magnetic compensation in the SyAFM systems. Our theoretical modeling qualitatively corroborates that the non-reciprocity stems from the dynamic oscillation of skyrmion helicity during its current-induced motion. The findings highlight the critical role of the internal degrees of freedom of these complex skyrmion tubes for their current-induced dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dot Behaviour under the Influence of Non-Resonant Structured Laser Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study investigates and compares the impact of intense, non-diffractive, non-resonant structured laser beams with various intensity profiles on the properties of InAs/GaAs cylindrical quantum dot. The comparative study demon-strates that the different structured beams, having unique symmetries and hence properties, have significant effects on the confinement potentials and electron probability densities of the quantum dot. It is shown that the system is most sensitive to the intensity and peak position changes of the zeroth order Bessel beam. Drastic changes in the dressed confinement potentials and electron probability densities under the impact of the above-mentioned beams were demonstrated, which can lead to the usage of the following method in such applications, where the precise manipulation of the charge carrier location is required. This study provides new insights into the role of structured laser fields in quantum dot systems, offering possibilities for their use in advanced nanophotonics and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Chirality-Dependent Kinetics of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes from Machine-Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the chirality of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) has been a long-standing dispute. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations driven by machine-learning force fields (MLFF), which can study the interface dynamics under near ab-initio accuracy, provides a powerful technique to reveal the formation mechanism of SWCNTs. Here, we develop a cobalt-carbon MLFF and perform growth simulations on a cobalt catalyst to investigate the chirality preference of the growth of SWCNTs under the vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) regime. Through microkinetic modeling, we reproduce the observed growth and defect kinetics, demonstrating their dependence on the chirality. It is observed that while the initial chirality assignment is likely related to the configurational degeneracy of the nanotube caps, pentagon defects immediately form and resolve after nucleation. Such processes, which we name as diameter control mechanisms, not only control the diameter toward an optimum but also shift the chirality distribution drastically. Our work therefore offers a microkinetic modeling workflow for the chirality-dependent kinetics of the SWCNTs, highlighting the important contribution of the defect kinetics to the chirality origination.</description>

      <title>Polaron formation within quantum acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum acoustic framework has recently emerged as a non-perturbative, coherent approach to electron-lattice interactions, uncovering rich physics often obscured by perturbative methods with incoherent scattering events. Here, we model the coupled dynamics of electrons and acoustic lattice vibrations within this framework, representing lattice vibrations as coherent states and electrons as quantum wavepackets. We derive and numerically implement electron backaction on the lattice, providing both visual and quantitative insights into electron wavepacket evolution, self-trapping, and the formation of small acoustic polarons. We investigate polaron binding energies across varying material parameters and compute key observables-including mean square displacement, kinetic energy, potential energy, and vibrational energy-over time. Our findings reveal the conditions that favor polaron formation, which is enhanced by low temperatures, high deformation potential constants, slow sound velocities, high effective masses, and small Fermi surfaces. Additionally, we explore the impact of external electric and magnetic fields, showing that while polaron formation remains robust under moderate fields, it is weakly suppressed at higher field strengths. These results deepen our understanding of polaron dynamics and pave the way for future studies into non-trivial transport behavior in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Signatures of the Correlated-Hopping Interaction in Non-Linear Transport through a Quantum Dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In condensed matter systems with the Coulomb interaction playing an important role one expects, besides the on-site (local) Hubbard-type interaction, that also other (non-local) terms depending on the site occupancy, known as correlated or assisted hopping, exist. Even though such terms in quantum dots tunnel coupled to external electrodes may have quite an appreciable amplitude, the interpretation of experiments on these systems -- usually in the linear response regime -- seems not to require their presence. However, since the correlated-hopping term breaks the particle-hole symmetry of the standard Anderson model and modifies all transport characteristics of the system, the detailed knowledge of its influence on measurable characteristics, especially {\em in the non-linear regime}, is a prerequisite for its experimental detection. In this paper, we study the non-linear transport properties of junctions composed of a quantum dot tunnel coupled to external electrodes. We model the system by the single-impurity Anderson Hamiltonian with Hubbard on-site interaction and with a non-local correlated-hopping interaction. Using the previously found general expression for the spin-dependent transport and spectral Green functions as well as general formulae for charge and heat transport, we calculate relevant transport characteristics in the strongly non-linear regime</description>

      <title>Anti-topological crystal and non-Abelian liquid in twisted semiconductor bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that electron crystals compete closely with non-Abelian fractional Chern insulators in the half-full second moir\'e band of twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. Depending on the twist angle and microscopic model, these crystals can have non-zero or zero Chern numbers. The latter relies on cancellation between contributions from the full first miniband (+1) and the half-full second miniband (-1). For this reason, we call it an anti-topological crystal. Surprisingly, it occurs despite the lowest two non-interacting bands in a given valley having the same Chern number of +1. The anti-topological crystal is a novel type of electron crystal that may appear in systems with multiple Chern bands at filling factors $n &gt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Nanostructured micrometric-pore membranes for nanofiltration: Micrometric geometry may optimize performance, energy efficiency and operational lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Media and membranes composed of micrometric-diameter pores are well known in academia and industry to be capable of efficacious nanofiltration of fluids once the pore inner surfaces are coated with nanostructures. Given the large mismatch between the two very different scales of these hybrid systems, it could be expected that trapping of nanoimpurities would almost entirely depend on the characteristics of the nanostructures. However, we show here that the micrometric-scale nominal geometry does have noticeable impact on the nanofiltration performance, on its evolution with time, and on the energy spent per trapped impurity. For that, we apply stochastic calculations customized to combine the cumulative probabilities of wall-impurity attraction and binding, supplemented with continuity equations as the fluid flows; this allows tracking the nanofiltration without a many-particle simulation, prohibitive in such multi-scale system. We focus on the influence of the micrometric nominal geometry over filtration features like logarithmic removal value LRV, operational lifetimes, energy balances, or spatial profiles of the trapped-impurity layer in the pore inner walls. Our results identify some pore geometries (e.g., decreasing-conical and sinusoidal-corrugated) with about 4-fold larger initial nanofiltering performance and operational lifetime than simple cylinders of the same average diameter. The optimal geometry is also shown to depend on the LRV value acceptable for each specific application.</description>

      <title>Theory of the photonic Joule effect in superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a small system is coupled to a bath, it is generally assumed that the state of the bath remains unaffected by the system due to the bath's large number of degrees of freedom. Here we show theoretically that this assumption can be easily violated for photonic baths typically used in experiments involving superconducting circuits. We analyze the dynamics of a voltage-biased Josephson junction coupled to a photonic bath, represented as a long Josephson junction chain. Our findings show that the system can reach a non-equilibrium steady state where the photonic degrees of freedom become significantly overheated, leading to a qualitative change in the current-voltage $I-V$ curve. This phenomenon is analogous to the Joule effect observed in electrical conductors, where flowing current can substantially heat up electrons. Recognizing this effect is crucial for the many applications of high-impedance environments in quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we give three examples of applying high energy physics method or idea in strongly correlated electron system. The first one is considering a curved space-time hydrodynamics theory for twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) and rotating bilayer graphene (RBG).We have predicted the possible quantized Thouless pumping in RBG for low driven frequency as a new kind of floquet engineering. In the second example, we study the C=2 fractioanl Chern insulator (FCI) candidate in twisted bilayer checkboard lattice (TBCB). We interpret the quasi-hole counting in particle entanglement spectrum (PES) based on SU(2) Halperin spin singlet ansatz and generalized Pauli principle, which is similar to the SU(C) color singlet in high energy physics. Finally, we investigate the general ab-initio method for crystalline material based on quasi-classical U(1) lattice gauge theory (or QED based ab-initio). We design a simpler algorithm for fixing U(1) gauge when implementing Monte-Carlo sampling without introducing ghost field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter discusses recent experimental work exploring the optical properties and quantum dynamics of organic semiconductor nanostructures based on squaraine dyes. Squaraines are prototypical quadrupolar charge-transfer chromophores of interest for solu-tion-processed photovoltaics and as aggregates with large circular dichroism. Here, we demonstrate and exploit their unique properties as quantum emitters for implementing hy-brid nanostructures featuring strong exciton-plasmon couplings. We show that the unusual electronic properties of squaraines result in a substantial reduction of vibronic coupling to the ubiquitous high-frequency C-C-bond-stretching modes of organic materials and in the formation of spectrally narrow J-aggregated exciton resonances in squaraine thin films. This is exploited to create metallic nanostructures covered with squaraine thin films and to per-form the first time-domain study of coherent exciton-plasmon couplings using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy with 10-fs time resolution. The experiments present unexpected evidence for long-range coherent exciton transport driven by plasmonic fields. This opens up new opportunities for manipulating the coherent transport of matter excita-tions by coupling to vacuum fields.</description>

      <title>A New Moir\'e Platform Based on M-Point Twisting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of moir\'e systems and materials based on monolayers with triangular lattices and low-energy states at the M points of the Brillouin zone. These M-point moir\'e materials are fundamentally distinct from those derived from $\Gamma$- or K-point monolayers, featuring three time-reversal-preserving valleys related by three-fold rotational symmetry. We propose twisted bilayers of experimentally exfoliable 1T-SnSe$_2$ and 1T-ZrS$_2$ as realizations of this new class. Using extensive ab initio simulations, we develop quantitative continuum models and analytically show that the corresponding M-point moir\'e Hamiltonians exhibit emergent momentum-space non-symmorphic symmetries and a kagome plane-wave lattice in momentum space. This represents the first experimentally viable realization of a projective representation of crystalline space groups in a non-magnetic system. With interactions, these materials represent six-flavor Hubbard simulators with Mott physics, as can be seen by their flat Wilson loops. Furthermore, the presence of a non-symmorphic momentum-space in-plane mirror symmetry makes some of the M-point moir\'e Hamiltonians quasi-one-dimensional in each valley, suggesting the possibility of realizing Luttinger liquid physics. We predict the twist angles at which a series of (conduction) flat bands appear, provide a faithful continuum Hamiltonian, analyze its topology and charge density and briefly discuss several aspects of the physics of this new platform.</description>

      <title>All-passive upconversion imaging of incoherent near-infrared light at intensities down to 50 nW/cm$^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency upconversion, which converts low-energy photons into higher-energy ones, typically requires intense coherent illumination to drive nonlinear processes or the use of externally driven optoelectronic devices. Here, we demonstrate a high-resolution upconversion imaging system that converts low-intensity (down to 50 nW/cm$^2$) incoherent near-infrared (NIR) light into the visible, reaching intensities perceptible by the human eye, without the use of any external power input. Our upconverting element is enabled by the following ingredients: (1) photon upconversion via triplet-triplet annihilation in a bulk heterojunction of the organic semiconductors Y6 and rubrene; (2) plasmonic enhancement of absorption and field intensity in the heterojunction layer; (3) collection enhancement using a dichroic thin-film assembly. The upconverting element is inserted at an intermediate image plane of a dual-wavelength telescope system, which preserves the relative directionality of rays between the incident NIR light and output visible light. Our all-passive upconversion imaging system will enable NIR imaging and sensing in low-light environments under energy constraints.</description>

      <title>Model validation and error attribution for a drifting qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubit performance is often reported in terms of a variety of single-value metrics, each providing a facet of the underlying noise mechanism limiting performance. However, the value of these metrics may drift over long time-scales, and reporting a single number for qubit performance fails to account for the low-frequency noise processes that give rise to this drift. In this work, we demonstrate how we can use the distribution of these values to validate or invalidate candidate noise models. We focus on the case of randomized benchmarking (RB), where typically a single error rate is reported but this error rate can drift over time when multiple passes of RB are performed. We show that using a statistical test as simple as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic on the distribution of RB error rates can be used to rule out noise models, assuming the experiment is performed over a long enough time interval to capture relevant low frequency noise. With confidence in a noise model, we show how care must be exercised when performing error attribution using the distribution of drifting RB error rate.</description>

      <title>Generating non-Clifford gate operations through exact mapping between Majorana fermions and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Majorana fermions and their generalizations to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ parafermions are considered promising building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers for their ability to encode quantum information nonlocally. In such topological quantum computers, highly robust quantum gates are obtained by braiding pairs of these quasi-particles. However, it is well-known that braiding Majorana fermions or parafermions only leads to a Clifford gate, hindering quantum universality. This paper establishes an exact mapping between Majorana fermions to $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions in systems under total parity non-conserving and total parity conserving setting. It is revealed that braiding of Majorana fermions may lead to non-Clifford quantum gates in the 4-dimensional qudit representation spanned by $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions, whilst braiding of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions may similarly yield non-Clifford quantum gates in the qubit representation spanned by Majorana fermions. This finding suggests that topologically protected universal quantum computing may be possible with Majorana fermions ($\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions) by supplementing the usual braiding operations with the braiding of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions (Majorana fermions) that could be formed out of Majorana fermions ($\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions) via the mapping prescribed here. Finally, the paper discusses how braiding of Majorana fermions or $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions could be obtained via a series of parity measurements.</description>

      <title>Tip-Enhanced Sum Frequency Generation for Molecular Vibrational Nanospectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrational sum frequency generation (SFG) is a nonlinear spectroscopic technique widely used to study the molecular structure and dynamics of surface systems. However, the spatial resolution achieved by far-field observations is constrained by the diffraction limit, obscuring molecular details in inhomogeneous structures smaller than the wavelength of light. To overcome this limitation, we developed a system for tip-enhanced SFG (TE-SFG) spectroscopy based on a scanning tunneling microscope. We successfully detected vibrational TE-SFG signals from adsorbed molecules on a gold substrate under ambient conditions. The phase analysis of interferometric SFG spectra provided information on molecular orientation. Furthermore, the observed TE-SFG signal was confirmed to originate from a highly localized region within a gap between the tip apex and the sample substrate. This method offers a novel platform for nonlinear optical nanospectroscopy, paving the way for the investigation of surface molecular systems beyond the diffraction limit.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnets (AM) are a recently discovered third class of collinear magnets, and have been attracting significant interest in the field of condensed matter physics. Here, based on first-principles calculations and theoretical analysis, we propose four two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials--monolayer V$_2$Te$_2$O, V$_2$STeO, V$_2$SSeO, and V$_2$S$_2$O--as candidates for altermagnetic materials. We show that these materials are semiconductors with spin-splitting in their nonrelativistic band structures. Furthermore, in the band structure, there are a pair of Dirac-type valleys located at the time-reversal invariant momenta (TRIM) X and Y points. These two valleys are connected by crystal symmetry instead of time-reversal symmetry. We investigate the strain effect on the band structure and find that uniaxial strain can induce valley polarization, topological states in these monolayer materials. Moreover, piezomagnetism can be realized upon finite doping. Our result reveals interesting valley physics in monolayer V$_2$Te$_2$O, V$_2$STeO, V$_2$SSeO, and V$_2$S$_2$O, suggesting their great potential for valleytronics, spintronics, and multifunctional nanoelectronics applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum feedback control with a transformer neural network architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attention-based neural networks such as transformers have revolutionized various fields such as natural language processing, genomics, and vision. Here, we demonstrate the use of transformers for quantum feedback control through a supervised learning approach. In particular, due to the transformer's ability to capture long-range temporal correlations and training efficiency, we show that it can surpass some of the limitations of previous control approaches, e.g.~those based on recurrent neural networks trained using a similar approach or reinforcement learning. We numerically show, for the example of state stabilization of a two-level system, that our bespoke transformer architecture can achieve unit fidelity to a target state in a short time even in the presence of inefficient measurement and Hamiltonian perturbations that were not included in the training set. We also demonstrate that this approach generalizes well to the control of non-Markovian systems. Our approach can be used for quantum error correction, fast control of quantum states in the presence of colored noise, as well as real-time tuning, and characterization of quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Crystalline-equivalent topological phases of many-body fermionic systems in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore one-dimensional fermionic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases related by the crystalline equivalence principle. In particular, we study charge-conserving many-body topological phases of fermions protected respectively by chiral and reflection symmetries. While the classifications of the two crystalline-equivalent SPT phases are identical, their topological properties and phase structures can be very different, depending on the microscopic details. Specifically, we consider certain extensions of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, with and without interactions, that preserve both chiral and reflection symmetries, and explicitly compute the many-body topological invariants based on the systems' ground states. The phase structures determined by these topological invariants align perfectly with the many-body spectra of deformations among the models. As expected, gapped deformations exist only when all the topological invariants remain unchanged. Moreover, we show that decomposable systems -- those that can be decomposed into local and decoupled subsystems -- can be topologically characterized by real-space quantum numbers directly associated with the symmetries. For reflection-symmetric systems, these quantum numbers are related to the many-body topological invariants via a bulk-center correspondence, which can be justified using the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence in generalized homology theory. Finally, we discuss the role of transition symmetry in the many-body topologies of these SPT phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for investigating the effects of interactions on crystalline symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. Within this framework, one can establish a direct connection between the equivalence classes of free-fermion systems and their corresponding interacting classes. A central component of this framework is the Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence, which provides a systematic way to represent crystalline SPT phases as SPT phases with internal symmetries on subspaces. We demonstrate the application of this approach through examples in various dimensions: 1d systems with U(1) and reflection symmetry, 2d systems with U(1) and C_{n} rotation symmetry, and 3d systems with U(1) and inversion symmetry.</description>

      <title>Diode effect in Fraunhofer patterns of disordered multi-terminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the role of different spatial inhomogeneities in generating the conditions for the appearance of a superconducting diode effect in the Fraunhofer pattern of wide Josephson junctions. Through the scattering matrix approach, we highlight the role of mirror symmetry of the junction in forbidding the diode effect in both the two-terminal and the multi-terminal case. As sources of mirror symmetry breaking, we study spatial potentials of long and short wavelength with respect to the size of the system, mimicking the effect of side gates and atomic scale disorder, respectively, as well as the geometry of the junction, and assess their impact on the diode effect. As a common trend, we observe qualitatively similar rectification patterns magnified at the nodal points of the Fraunhofer pattern by destructing interference. In multi-terminal mirror-symmetric setups, we single out the phase at additional terminals as a controllable knob to tune the diode effect at the finite field. The work presents a comprehensive treatment of the role of pure spatial inhomogeneity in the emergence of a diode effect in wide junctions.</description>

      <title>Hot-carrier trapping preserves high quantum yields but limits optical gain in InP-based quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indium phosphide is the leading material for commercial applications of colloidal quantum dots. To date, however, the community has failed to achieve successful operation under strong excitation conditions, contrasting sharply with other materials. Here, we report how the unusual photophysics of state-of-the-art InP-based quantum dots make them unattractive as a gain material. A combination of ensemble-based time-resolved spectroscopy over timescales from femtoseconds to microseconds and single-quantum-dot spectroscopy reveals ultrafast trapping of hot charge carriers. This process leads to charge-carrier losses, thereby reducing the achievable population inversion which limits amplification of light in a gain material. Interestingly, fluorescence is only delayed, not quenched, by hot charge-carrier trapping, explaining why InP-based quantum dots are successful as bright luminescent colour convertors for low-intensity applications. Comparison with other popular quantum-dot materials, such as CdSe, Pb-halide perovskites, and CuInS2, indicate that the hot-carrier dynamics observed are unique to InP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While experimental measurements of photon correlations have become routine in laboratories, theoretical access to these quantities for the light generated in complex nanophotonic devices remains a major challenge. Current methods are limited to specific simplified cases and lack generality. Here we present a novel method that provides access to photon statistics resolved in space and frequency in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. Within the macroscopic QED framework, we develop a practical tool to compute electric field correlations for complex quantum systems by including lossy two-level systems that act as field detectors within the system. To make the implementation feasible, we use a recently developed multi-emitter few-mode quantization method to correctly account for fully retarded light propagation to the detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique by studying the photon correlations of one and two emitters in close proximity to a plasmonic nanoparticle. The simulations show that even in these relatively simple configurations, the light statistics exhibit a strong angular dependence. These results highlight the importance of going beyond conventional quantum-optical approaches to fully capture the analyzed physical effects and enable the study of the quantum light generation in realistic nanophotonic devices.</description>

Abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroics are highly sought after for applications in low-power electronics and for advancing fundamental research, including axion insulators and dark matter detection. However, achieving a combination of ferroic spin and electric orders, along with their controllable switching, remains a significant challenge in conventional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Here, we present first-principles evidence that time-reversal symmetry-breaking altermagnetic spin polarization with relatively high critical temperatures can emerge in ferroelectrics BaCuF$_4$ (T$_N$ $\sim$ 275K) and Ca$_3$Mn$_2$O$_7$ (T$_N$ $\sim$ 110K). Furthermore, we classify all possible altermagnetic polar spin groups, revealing altermagnetism in a collinear phase of BiFeO$_3$. We also propose an altermagnetoelectric effect, a nonrelativistic cross-coupling between altermagnetic spin polarization and ferroelectric polarization, mediated by a rotation of nonmagnetic polyhedra in the lattice structure. Our findings suggest an alternative pathway towards high-temperature magnetoelectric multiferroicity and the electric field control of altermagnetic order parameters.</description>

      <title>Efficient short-wave infrared upconversion by self-sensitized holmium-doped nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon upconversion, combining several low-energy photons to generate one high-energy photon is of wide interest for biomedical, catalytic and photonic applications. Lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (LnNP) are a unique type of upconversion nanoconverter, which can realize ultralarge anti-Stokes shift (&gt;1000 nm) and high photostability, without photo-bleaching and photo-blinking. The excitation wavelength of LnNPs has been limited to the second near-infrared window (1000-1700 nm), mainly sensitized by erbium ions with absorption centered around 1.5 $\mu$m. Here, we demonstrate novel self-sensitized holmium (Ho)-doped nanoconverters to further expand the sensitization range to the short-wave infrared at 2 $\mu$m and achieve efficient upconversion to 640 nm. We show that this upconversion is a 4-photon conversion process with an underlying energy transfer upconversion mechanism. Via careful control of dopant concentration and shelling we achieve a relative upconversion-to-downconversion efficiency up to 15.2%, more than half the theoretical maximum. The placement of the Ho doped LnNPs into a plasmonic nanocavity device enables large gains in emission intensity (up to 32-fold), due to the dramatic shortening of the emission lifetime of Ho from 29 $\mu$s to &lt;1 ns, indicating a high Purcell-enhancement factor of 3x10$^4$. These results open new possibilities at the frontier of short-wave infrared upconversion and the nanoplasmonic enhancement of LnNP emission, with potential applications in detection, theranostics, photonics and optoelectronics.</description>

Abstract: Theoretical calculations show that twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) under a transverse electric field develops a valley Chern number 2 at charge neutrality. Using thermodynamic and thermal activation measurements we report the experimental observation of a universal closing of the charge neutrality gap in the Hofstadter spectrum of TDBG at 1/2 magnetic flux per unit cell, in agreement with theoretical predictions for a valley Chern number 2 gap. Our theoretical analysis of the experimental data shows that the interaction energy, while larger than the flat-band bandwidth in TDBG near 1\deg does not alter the emergent valley symmetry or the single-particle band topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive theoretical model for the interaction strength between a pair of exciton-polaritons in microcavity devices. Ab initio numerical calculations for dipolar polaritons in one dimension are used as a starting point to build a Born-Oppenheimer theory that generally applies to generic -- dipolar or non-dipolar polaritons -- in both one and two dimensions. This theory anticipates that the strong coupling to the cavity mode leads to a drastic enhancement of the polariton interactions as compared to bare excitons, and predicts unexpected scaling laws in the interaction strength as a function of system parameters. Comparisons with available experimental data are drawn, and specific suggestions to validate it with new experiments are made. Promising strategies towards the observation of a strong polariton blockade regime are finally sketched.</description>

      <title>Neural information processing and time-series prediction with only two dynamical memristors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memristive devices are commonly benchmarked by the multi-level programmability of their resistance states. Neural networks utilizing memristor crossbar arrays as synaptic layers largely rely on this feature. However, the dynamical properties of memristors, such as the adaptive response times arising from the exponential voltage dependence of the resistive switching speed remain largely unexploited. Here, we propose an information processing scheme which fundamentally relies on the latter. We realize simple dynamical memristor circuits capable of complex temporal information processing tasks. We demonstrate an artificial neural circuit with one nonvolatile and one volatile memristor which can detect a neural spike pattern in a very noisy environment, fire a single voltage pulse upon successful detection and reset itself in an entirely autonomous manner. Furthermore, we implement a circuit with only two nonvolatile memristors which can learn the operation of an external dynamical system and perform the corresponding time-series prediction with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Limitations of Caldeira-Leggett model for description of phase transitions in superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inherent complexity of system-bath interactions often requires making critical approximations, which we here show to have a radical influence on the renormalization group flow and the resulting phase diagram. Specifically, for the Caldeira-Leggett model Schmid and Bulgadaev (SB) predicted a phase transition, whose experimental verification in resistive superconducting circuits is currently hotly debated. For normal metal and Josephson junction array resistors, we show that the mapping to Caldeira-Leggett is only exact when applying approximations which decompactify the superconducting phase. We show that there exist treatments that retain phase compactness, which immediately lead to a phase diagram depending on four instead of two parameters. While we still find an SB-like transition in the transmon regime, the critical parameter is controlled exclusively by the capacitive coupling. In contrast, the Cooper pair box maps to the anisotropic Kondo model, where a pseudoferromagnetic phase is not allowed for regular electrostatic interactions.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy of the anomalous Hall effect in the altermagnet candidate Mn$_5$Si$_3$ films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets are compensated magnets belonging to spin symmetry groups that allow alternating spin polarizations both in the coordinate space of the crystal and in the momentum space of the electronic structure. In these materials the anisotropic local crystal environment of the different sublattices lowers the symmetry of the system so that the opposite-spin sublattices are connected only by rotations, which results in an unconventional spin-polarized band structure in the momentum space. This low symmetry of the crystal structure is expected to be reflected in the anisotropy of the anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we study the anisotropy of the anomalous Hall effect in epitaxial thin films of Mn$_5$Si$_3$, an altermagnetic candidate material. We first demonstrate a change in the relative N\'eel vector orientation when rotating the external field orientation through systematic changes in both the anomalous Hall effect and the anisotropic longitudinal magnetoresistance. We then show that the anomalous Hall effect in this material is anisotropic with the N\'eel vector orientation relative to the crystal structure and that this anisotropy requires high crystal quality and unlikely correlates with the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Our results provide further systematic support to the case for considering epitaxial thin films of Mn$_5$Si$_3$ as an altermagnetic candidate material.</description>

      <title>Localization in two-dimensional fermions with arbitrary pseudospin</title>

Abstract: In condensed matter, limited symmetry constraints allow free fermionic excitations to exist beyond the conventional Weyl and Dirac electrons of high-energy physics. These excitations carry a higher pseudospin, naturally generalizing the Weyl fermion. How do electrons beyond the conventional Dirac and Weyl fermions localize under disorder? In this Letter, we solve the problem of localization of two-dimensional free fermionic excitations carrying an arbitrary pseudospin-$s$. We derive exact analytical expressions for fermionic wavefunctions and exploit their curious mathematical connection to Pascal's triangle to evaluate relevant quantities such as scattering time, renormalized velocity, Cooperon, and magnetoconductivity. We discover that the gapless Cooperon mode solely depends on the pseudospin even when the Fermi surface is composed of multiple pockets, leading to weak localization (antilocalization) behavior for integer (half-integer) $s$, irrespective of the band index. Remarkably, the localization corrections increase with $s$, but the relative localization corrections are found to decrease with $s$, i.e., faster-moving relativistic electrons are less susceptible to disorder effects. Coupled with our elementary analysis on electron-electron interactions, this sheds insights on Anderson and many-body localization in these materials.</description>

      <title>GW effects on the topology of type-II Dirac cones in NiTe$_2$, PtSe$_2$ and PtTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body correlations are known to be responsible for a broad range of fascinating physical phenomena, introducing corrections that appear elusive at the mean-field level. An example of this is the Lifshitz transition that occurs as the Fermi surface topology changes when {\it e.g.} Coulomb interaction effects break into the picture. In particular, the Fermi velocity renormalization can lead a type-II Weyl semimetal at mean-field level to become a trivial or a type-I Dirac material when correlations are accounted for, which is far from being obvious. In this work we scrutinize the band structure of NiTe$_2$, a material that features a type-II Dirac point near the Fermi level within the mean-field approach. Including GW-level correlations, our findings showcase anisotropic corrections on the Dirac carrier velocity exceeding $100 \, \%$ enhancements, underscoring the nuanced influence of electronic interactions in the band structure. We also consider type-II Dirac crossings in PtSe$_2$ and PtTe$_2$ and observe that including many-body effects via GW the band topology changes, featuring trivial topology and type-I Dirac crossings, respectively. Our findings highlights the necessity to evaluate the many-body effects on non-trivial bands, contributing essential insights to the broader exploration of many-body correlation effects in type-II Dirac points of condensed-matter systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Weyl semimetal (WSM) in a magnetic field, a semiclassical description of the Fermi-arc surface state dynamics is usually employed for explaining various unconventional magnetotransport phenomena, e.g., Weyl orbits, the three-dimensional Quantum Hall Effect, and the high transmission through twisted WSM interfaces. For a half-space geometry, we determine the low-energy quantum eigenstates for a four-band model of a WSM in a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface. The eigenstates correspond to in- and out-going chiral Landau level (LL) states, propagating (anti-)parallel to the field direction near different Weyl nodes, which are coupled by evanescent surface-state contributions generated by all other LLs. These replace the Fermi arc in a magnetic field. Computing the phase shift accumulated between in- and out-going chiral LL states, we compare our quantum-mechanical results to semiclassical predictions. We find quantitative agreement between both approaches.</description>

      <title>Gate control of magnon spin transport in unconventional magnon transistors based on the van der Waals antiferromagnet CrPS4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnon based spintronic devices require the modulation of magnon spin transport for their operations. We provide a proof-of-principle of an unconventional two-terminal non-local magnon transport device where the same contact is simultaneously used as injector and gate and an unconventional three-terminal non-local magnon transport device where the gate is positioned outside the magnon transport channel. In these devices we modulate the diffusive magnon transport of incoherent magnons in the van der Waals antiferromagnet Chromium thiophosphate, CrPS4. The non-local signals generated electrically by spin injection via the spin Hall effect (SHE) and thermally via the spin Seebeck effect (SSE) are altered by a modulator electrode. The current through the modulator increases or decreases the magnon chemical potential via the SHE and changes the magnon temperature through Joule heating. We achieve up to 25%/mA and 16%/mA modulation efficiencies for the electrically and thermally generated magnon spin transport, respectively, for CrPS4 in the collinear state at in plane fields &gt;7T at a temperature of 25K.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the wave function of electrons and holes injected by voltage pulses with non-integer flux quantum. We find that the wave function can be delocalized in the time domain, which is measured by using the inverse participation ratio. As the flux approaches an integer multiples of flux quantum, the wave function can either remain delocalized or undergo a localization-delocalization transition. The former case occurs for the neutral electron-hole pairs, while the latter case occurs for electrons and holes which are injected individually. We perform the finite-size scaling analysis of the inverse participation ratio to further clarify the nature of the localization-delocalization transition. The scaling function and correlation length are determined numerically by the data collapse method. We find that the localization-delocalization transition is universal in the sense that the scaling function and correlation length is insensitive to the pulse profile when the pulse is sufficiently sharp. In contrast, they exhibit quantitatively different behavior for the Lorentzian pulse, indicating the corresponding localization-delocalization transition belongs to a different universality class.</description>

      <title>Second-order correlation and squeezing of photons in cavities with ultrastrong magnon-photon interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the second-order photon correlation function in cavity-magnon systems, focusing on ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities within the ultra-strong coupling regime, and extending beyond the rotating-wave approximation. By deriving exact integral solutions for the second-order correlation function, we demonstrate that counter-rotating magnon-photon interactions induce quadrature squeezing in the cavity mode. Furthermore, we show that tuning the anisotropic magnon-cavity couplings enhance the squeezing effect by changing the level repulsion of the magnon-cavity photon hybrid mode without increasing cavity photon occupation number. Our study reveals distinct quantum correlation behaviors in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic cavities: For ferromagnetic cavities, we show that squeezing increases with coupling strength asymmetry, whereas in antiferromagnetic case, magnon modes with opposite chirality suppress quantum effects and imposes a lower bound on correlation functions. These findings provide a pathway to optimize photon blockade and quantum information processing in magnon-cavity systems in the ultrastrong coupling limit.</description>

Abstract: We study the coexistence of superconductivity (SC) and density-wave state and reconcile various puzzling experimental data in organic superconductors (TMTSF)$_{2}$PF$_{6}$ and (TMTSF)$_{2}$ClO$_{4}$. The anisotropic resistance drop above $T_c$ is qualitatively described by nascent isolated SC islands within a bulk analytical model. However, the observed anisotropic SC onset is explained only when the finite size and flat needle shape of samples is considered. Our results pave a way to estimate the volume fraction and the typical size of SC islands in far from the sample surface, and apply to many inhomogeneous superconductors, including high-$T_c$ cuprate or Fe-based ones.</description>

We consider a concrete setup involving Weyl semimetals, which hosts an axion-like effect on the electromagnetism, towards the measurement of the axionic effect on the Casimir force. Our setup realizes zero Casimir force between metals and may be useful for the search for new force mediated by light particles at the micrometer scale.</description>

      <title>Nearly perfect spin polarization of noncollinear antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ferromagnets with high spin polarization are known to be valuable for spintronics--a research field that exploits the spin degree of freedom in information technologies. Recently, antiferromagnets have emerged as promising alternative materials for spintronics due to their stability against magnetic perturbations, absence of stray fields, and ultrafast dynamics. For antiferromagnets,however, the concept of spin polarization and its relevance to the measured electrical response are elusive due to nominally zero net magnetization.Here, we define an effective momentum-dependent spin polarization and reveal an unexpected property of many noncollinear antiferromagnets to exhibit nearly 100% spin polarization in a broad area of the Fermi surface. This property leads to the emergence of an extraordinary tunneling magnetoresistance (ETMR) effect in antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions (AFMTJs). As a representative example, we predict that a noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn$_{3}$GaN exhibits nearly 100% spin-polarized states that can efficiently tunnel through low-decay-rate evanescent states of perovskite oxide SrTiO$_{3}$ resulting in ETMR as large as $10^{4}$%. Our results uncover hidden functionality of material systems with noncollinear spin textures and open new perspectives for spintronics.</description>

Abstract: The standard notion of a classical limit, represented schematically by $\hbar\rightarrow 0$, provides a method for approximating a quantum system by a classical one. In this work we explain why the standard classical limit fails when applied to subsystems, and show how one may resolve this by explicitly modelling the decoherence of a subsystem by its environment. Denoting the decoherence time $\tau$, we demonstrate that a double scaling limit in which $\hbar \rightarrow 0$ and $\tau \rightarrow 0$ such that the ratio $E_f =\hbar /\tau$ remains fixed leads to an irreversible open-system evolution with well-defined classical and quantum subsystems. The main technical result is showing that, for arbitrary Hamiltonians, the generators of partial versions of the Wigner, Husimi and Glauber-Sudarshan quasiprobability distributions may all be mapped in the above double scaling limit to the same completely-positive classical-quantum generator. This provides a regime in which one can study effective and consistent classical-quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Scaling Enhancement of Photon Blockade in Output Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon blockade enhancement is an exciting and promising subject that has been well studied for photons in cavities. However, whether photon blockade can be enhanced in the output fields remains largely unexplored. We show that photon blockade can be greatly enhanced in the mixing output field of a nonlinear cavity and an auxiliary (linear) cavity, where no direct coupling between the nonlinear and auxiliary cavities is needed. We uncover a biquadratic scaling relation between the second-order correlation of the photons in the output field and intracavity nonlinear interaction strength, in contrast to a quadratic scaling relation for the photons in a nonlinear cavity. We identify that this scaling enhancement of photon blockade in the output field is induced by the destructive interference between two of the paths for two photons passing through the two cavities. We then extend the theory to the experimentally feasible Jaynes-Cummings model consisting of a two-level system strongly coupled to one of the two uncoupled cavities and also predict a biquadratic scaling law in the mixing output field.

      <title>Impurity flat band states in the diamond chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat band (FB) systems, featuring dispersionless energy bands, have garnered significant interest due to their compact localized states (CLSs). However, a detailed account on how local impurities affect the physical properties of overlapping CLSs is still missing. Here we study a diamond chain with a finite magnetic flux per plaquette that exhibits a gapped midspectrum FB with non-orthogonal CLSs, and develop a framework for projecting operators onto such non-orthogonal bases. This framework is applied to the case of an open diamond chain with small local impurities in the midchain plaquette, and analytical expressions are derived for FB states influenced by these impurities. For equal impurities in top and bottom sites under diagonal disorder, we show how the impurity states experience an averaged disorder dependent on their spatial extension, leading to enhanced robustness against disorder. For a single impurity, an exotic topological phase with a half-integer winding number is discovered, which is linked to a single in-gap edge state under open boundary conditions. Numerical simulations validate the analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Mechanical Wannier-Stark Ladder of Diamond Spin-Mechanical Lamb Wave Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the design and theoretical analysis of Wannier-Stark ladders of diamond Lamb wave resonators that feature mechanical compression modes with ultralow damping rates and host spin qubits with excellent optical and spin properties. The degree of localization in the mechanical Wannier-Stark ladder, which is determined by the ratio of coupling rate to frequency spacing between adjacent resonators, sets the effective range of phonon-mediated coupling between spin qubits. Three nearest-neighbor coupling schemes with distinct geometric configurations and a large range of coupling rates have been developed and analyzed. Additional analysis on the effects of disorder indicates that the proposed Wannier-Stark ladder can be robust against realistic experimental imperfections. The development of quantum networks of spin qubits with long-range connectivity can open the door to the implementation of newly developed quantum low-density parity-check codes in a solid-state system.</description>

      <title>Broadband measurement of Feibelman's quantum surface response functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Feibelman $d$-parameter, a mesoscopic complement to the local bulk permittivity, describes quantum optical surface responses for interfaces, including nonlocality, spill-in and-out, and surface-enabled Landau damping. It has been incorporated into the macroscopic Maxwellian framework for convenient modeling and understanding of nanoscale electromagnetic phenomena, calling for the compilation of a $d$-parameter database for interfaces of interest in nano-optics. However, accurate first-principles calculations of $d$-parameters face computational challenges, whereas existing measurements of $d$-parameters are scarce and restricted to narrow spectral windows. We demonstrate a general broadband ellipsometric approach to measure $d$-parameters at a gold--air interface across the visible--ultraviolet regimes. Gold is found to spill in and spill out at different frequencies. We also observe gold's Bennett mode, a surface-dipole resonance associated with a pole of the $d$-parameter, around 2.5 eV. Our measurements give rise to and are further validated by the passivity and Kramers--Kronig causality analysis of $d$-parameters. Our work advances the understanding of quantum surface response and may enable applications like enhanced electron field emission.</description>

      <title>Comparison of various schemes to determine the Young's modulus of disordered carbon nanomembranes compared to crystalline graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The determination of mechanical properties such as the Young's modulus provides an important means to compare classical molecular dynamics simulations with materials. In this respect, ultra-thin materials hold several challenges: their volume is ambiguous, and different methods to determine a stress-strain relation deliver different result in particular for disordered systems. Using the example of carbon nanomembranes we discuss three common approaches to the problem and show that stress-strain simulations following experimental setups deliver correct results if adjusted carefully. We provide step-by-step instructions how to perform trustworthy simulations.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness in a Hartree-Fock model for graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene is a monolayer graphitic film where electrons behave like two-dimensional Dirac fermions without mass. Its study has attracted a wide interest in the domain of condensed matter physics. In particular, it represents an ideal system to test the comprehension of 2D massless relativistic particles in a laboratory, the Fermi velocity being $300$ times smaller than the speed of light. In this work, we present a global well-posedness result for graphene in the Hartree-Fock approximation. The model allows to describe the time evolution of graphene in the presence of external electric fields, such as those induced by local defects in the monolayer of carbon atoms. Our approach is based on a well established non-perturbative framework originating from the study of three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Synchronized motion of gold nanoparticles in an optothermal trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers have revolutionized particle manipulation at the micro- and nanoscale, playing a critical role in fields such as plasmonics, biophysics, and nanotechnology. While traditional optical trapping methods primarily rely on optical forces to manipulate and organize particles, recent studies suggest that optothermal traps in surfactant solutions can induce unconventional effects such as enhanced trapping stiffness and increased diffusion. Thus, there is a need for further exploration of this system to gain a deeper understanding of the forces involved. This work investigates the behaviour of gold nanoparticles confined in an optothermal trap around a heated anchor particle in a surfactant (CTAC) solution. We observe unexpected radial confinement and synchronized rotational diffusion of particles at micrometre-scale separations from the anchor particle. These dynamics differ from known optical binding and thermophoretic effects, suggesting unexplored forces facilitated by the surfactant environment. This study expands the understanding of optothermal trapping driven by anchor plasmonic particles and introduces new possibilities for nanoparticle assembly, offering insights with potential applications in nanoscale fabrication and materials science.</description>

      <title>Fast, accurate, and error-resilient noise spectroscopy via basis optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing scalable quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors that operate at molecular scales. Yet, existing methods for such noise spectroscopy face fundamental difficulties, including their reliance on severe approximations and the need for extensively averaged measurements. Here, we propose an alternative approach that processes the commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements using a novel self-consistent optimization framework to extract the noise power spectrum that characterizes the interaction between a qubit or quantum sensor and its environment. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is robust to the presence of measurement errors. We introduce a protocol to quantify confidence intervals and a physically motivated heuristic to determine which new dynamical decoupling measurement can improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that the previous measurements of low-frequency noise had overestimated its strength by an order of magnitude. Our method's noise spectrum reconstructions uncover previously unsuspected structure and offer unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</description>
