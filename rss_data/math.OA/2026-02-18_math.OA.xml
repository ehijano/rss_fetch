      <title>$C^*$-correspondences for ordinal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a family of $C^*$-correspondences $X_\alpha$ naturally associated to every ordinal graph $\Lambda$. When $\Lambda$ is a directed graph, $X_0$ is isomorphic to the usual $C^*$-correspondence associated to a graph. We show that ordinal graphs satisfying a weak assumption have the property that the $C^*$-algebra of $\Lambda_{\alpha + 1}$ is isomorphic to the Cuntz-Pimsner algebra of $X_\alpha$. As a consequence, the $C^*$-algebra of $\Lambda$ may be constructed starting from $c_0(\Lambda_0)$ by iteratively applying the Cuntz-Pimsner construction and inductive limits. We apply this result to strengthen the author's previous Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem.</description>

      <title>Partial actions of free groups and groupoid homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a length one projective resolution of the trivial module for the groupoid of a semi-saturated partial action (in the sense of Exel) of a free group on a compact Hausdorff and totally disconnected space. As a consequence we obtain an elementary computation of the homology of these groupoids, which include transformation groupoids of free group actions and Deaconu-Renault groupoids of systems $(X,T)$ where $X$ is compact Hausdorff and totally disconnected and $T$ is a local homeomorphism with domain a clopen subset of $X$. We also show that algebra of such a partial action groupoid over a field has global dimension at most $2$ when the space is second countable.</description>

      <title>Separable C*-algebras Without the Countable Axiom of Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is twofold. In addition to the results stated in the next paragraph, we present some classical results on absoluteness relevant to functional analysis that are well known to logicians but not nearly as well advertised as they should be. We show that the theory of separable C*-algebras can be developed in ZF (that is, without using any Choice). This includes proving the Gelfand-Naimark representation theorems as well as the Spectral Mapping Theorem for polynomials and developing continuous functional calculus for commuting normal elements. Some of our proofs are modifications of the standard ones, obtained by avoiding the use of Choice. Some other proofs require new ideas in order to avoid the use of Choice. Yet another batch of proofs proceeds by using the set-theoretic Shoenfield Absoluteness Theorem. This result (well known to logicians but regrettably not as well advertised as it deserves) implies that statements about standard Borel spaces of low quantifier complexity that are provable in ZFC, or even ZFC together with the Continuum Hypothesis are provable in ZF. One of the main objectives of this paper is to present these results in a convenient form that can be utilized by analysts not familiar with set theory. We also show that in the absence of Choice (more precisely, assuming the existence of a Russell set) there is a concretely representable unital commutative \cstar-algebra that is not isomorphic to C(X) for any compact Hausdorff space X. Finally, from the model-theoretic point of view, while the property of having a tracial state is provably axiomatizable in ZFC, it is not provably axiomatizable in ZF+DC.</description>

      <title>Quantization as a Categorical Equivalence for Hilbert Bimodules and Lagrangian Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that classical and quantum theories carry distinct types of representations, each type of representation corresponding to possible values of generalized charges in the classical or quantum context. This paper demonstrates a sense in the structure of these representation theories is preserved from classical to quantum physics. To show this, I discuss distinct representation-theory preserving morphisms in the classical and quantum contexts. Specifically, I consider categories whose morphisms are Lagrangian relations in the classical context and Hilbert bimodules in the quantum context. These morphisms are significant because they give rise to induced representations of classical and quantum theories, respectively. I consider quantization and the classical limit as determining functors between these categories. I treat quantization via the strict deformation quantization of a Poisson algebra and the classical limit via the extension of a uniformly continuous bundle of C*-algebras. With these tools, I prove that the quantization and classical limit functors are "almost-inverse" to each other, thus establishing a categorical equivalence.</description>

      <title>Clifford spectrum of three 2 by 2 matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Clifford spectrum associated to three 2 by 2 matrices is nonempty. The structure of Clifford is described in terms "moving" level curves. We discuss some implication of a conjecture formulated for arbitrary size n by n of three matrices and give an example in the case of three self-adjoint operators in the infinite dimensional Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Finite Free Information Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop finite free information theory for real-rooted polynomials, establishing finite free analogues of entropy and Fisher information monotonicity, as well as the Stam and entropy power inequalities. These results resolve conjectures by Shlyakhtenko and Gribinski and recover inequalities in free probability in the large-degree limit. Equivalently, our results may be interpreted as potential-theoretic inequalities for the zeros of real-rooted polynomials under differential operators which preserve real-rootedness. Our proofs leverage a new connection between score vectors and Jacobians of root maps, combined with convexity results for hyperbolic polynomials.</description>

      <title>The uniqueness theorem for Kasparov theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.23029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Answering a question of Carri\'on et al in their recent landmark paper on C*-algebra classification, we prove a general uniqueness theorem for $KK$-theory. Given arbitrary separable C*-algebras $A$ and $B$ and a Cuntz pair consisting of two absorbing representations $\varphi,\psi: A\to\mathcal{M}(B\otimes\mathcal{K})$, the induced element of $KK(A,B)$ vanishes if and only if $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are strongly asymptotically unitarily equivalent. This improves upon the Lin-Dadarlat-Eilers stable uniqueness theorem. The conclusion is deduced by first showing the $K_1$-injectivity of an auxiliary C*-algebra associated to the C*-pair $(A,B)$, which is sometimes called the Paschke dual algebra in the literature. Most of the article is concerned with the treatment of an umbrella theorem, which yields such a uniqueness theorem for other variants of $KK$-theory. This encompasses nuclear $KK$-theory, ideal-related $KK$-theory, equivariant $KK$-theory, or any combinations thereof.</description>

      <title>Unitary normalizers in finite-dimensional inclusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study regular inclusions of finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras from a matrix-theoretic perspective. To this end, we introduce a new combinatorial invariant of an inclusion, called the normalizer matrix, which encodes the structure of the normalizer purely at the level of the inclusion matrix. Using this invariant, we obtain a complete characterization of regular inclusions of finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras. As consequences, we show that every regular inclusion decomposes into finite direct sums and tensor products of basic building blocks, and that regular inclusions are necessarily of depth two. We further investigate the existence of unitary orthonormal bases in the sense of Pimsner-Popa and prove that, under a natural spectral condition, regularity is equivalent to the existence of a unitary orthonormal basis contained in the normalizer. These results provide a unified description of regularity, unitary bases, and depth through the normalizer matrix formalism.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative $L_p$-differentiability and trace formulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a semifinite von Neumann algebra equipped with a normal faithful semifinite trace $\tau$, and let $L_p(\mathcal{M})$ denote the associated noncommutative $L_p$-space for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Let $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and let $a, b$ be $\tau$-measurable self-adjoint operators such that $b\in L_p(\mathcal{M})\cap L_{np}(\mathcal{M})$. For a function $f\in C^n(\mathbb{R})$ whose derivatives $f^{(k)}$ are bounded for $1\le k\le n$, we prove that the map $\phi:t\in\mathbb{R}\mapsto f(a+tb)-f(a)$ is $n$-times differentiable in the $\|\cdot\|_{L_p}$-norm. This strengthens the corresponding result of de Pagter and Sukochev for $p\neq 2$ and extends it to higher-order derivatives. In addition, if $f^{(n)}\in C_0(\mathbb{R})$ or $b\in \mathcal{M}$, then $\phi^{(n)}$ is continuous on $\mathbb{R}$. Consequently, we extend the Potapov--Skripka--Sukochev higher-order trace formula from bounded $L_n$-perturbations to not necessarily bounded perturbations in $L_n(\mathcal{M})\cap L_{n^{2}}(\mathcal{M})$. Moreover, we show that this trace formula holds for a broader class of admissible functions than the classes previously considered in the literature.</description>

      <title>Curvature, Hodge-Dirac operators and Riesz transforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04203v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of Ricci curvature lower bound for strongly continuous semigroups of operators acting on a reflexive Banach space, endowed with a suitable pair of divergence and gradient operators. We use this notion to investigate the functional calculus of the Hodge-Dirac operator associated to the semigroup in link with the boundedness of suitable Riesz transforms. Our paper offers a unified framework that not only encapsulates existing results in some contexts but also yields new findings in others. This is demonstrated through applications in the frameworks of Riemannian manifolds, compact (quantum) groups, noncommutative tori, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup, $q$-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups and semigroups of Schur multipliers. We also provide an $\mathrm{L}^p$-Poincar\'e inequality that is applicable to all previously discussed contexts under suitable some assumptions of boundedness of functional calculus and Riesz transforms (and some uniform exponential stability). Finally, we prove the boundedness of some Riesz transforms in some contexts as compact Lie groups.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new kind of free independence, called real infinitesimal freeness. We show that independent orthogonally invariant with infinitesimal laws are asymptotically real infinitesimally free. We introduce new cumulants, called real infinitesimal cumulants and show that real infinitesimal freeness is equivalent to vanishing of mixed cumulants. We prove the formula for cumulants with products as entries.</description>
