      <title>On the Performance of Linear Adaptive Filters driven by the Ergodic Chaotic Logistic Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems are increasingly considered for use in coding and transmission systems. This stems from their parameter sensitivity and spectral characteristics. The latter are relevant for channel estimation methods. In particular the logistic map $f_\lambda =\lambda x\left( 1-x\right) $ has been employed in chaotic coding and spread spectrum transmission systems. For $\lambda =4$ the statistical properties of sequences generated by $f_4$ are considered as ideal drive signals for channel estimation schemes. This assumption is proven in the present paper. To this end the higher order statistical moments and the autocorrelation of time series generated by $f_4$ are derived. It is shown that for $\lambda =4$ the zero mean time series is uncorrelated. The adaptation performance of finite impulse response (FIR) digital adaptive filters (DAF) used for channel estimation is analyzed. It is shown that using zero mean sequences of $f_4$ leads to the maximal possible FIR DAF performance. An optimal value for the damping parameter in the LMS scheme is derived that leads to the maximal performance and ensures stability. The analytic considerations are confirmed by simulation results.</description>

      <title>Constrained Flips in Plane Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flip in a plane spanning tree $T$ is the operation of removing one edge from $T$ and adding another edge such that the resulting structure is again a plane spanning tree. For trees on a set of points in convex position we study two classic types of constrained flips: (1)~Compatible flips are flips in which the removed and inserted edge do not cross each other. We relevantly improve the previous upper bound of $2n-O(\sqrt{n})$ on the diameter of the compatible flip graph to~$\frac{5n}{3}-O(1)$, by this matching the upper bound for unrestricted flips by Bjerkevik, Kleist, Ueckerdt, and Vogtenhuber [SODA~2025] up to an additive constant of $1$. We further show that no shortest compatible flip sequence removes an edge that is already in its target position. Using this so-called happy edge property, we derive a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm to compute the shortest compatible flip sequence between two given trees. (2)~Rotations are flips in which the removed and inserted edge share a common vertex. Besides showing that the happy edge property does not hold for rotations, we improve the previous upper bound of $2n-O(1)$ for the diameter of the rotation graph to~$\frac{7n}{4}-O(1)$.</description>

      <title>On Vanishing of Gromov--Witten Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the decision problem of whether a particular Gromov--Witten invariant on a partial flag variety is zero. We prove that for the $3$-pointed, genus zero invariants, this problem is in the complexity class ${\sf AM}$ assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH), and therefore lies in the second level of polynomial hierarchy ${\sf PH}$.
  For the proof, we construct an explicit system of polynomial equations through a translation of the defining equations. We also need to prove an extension of the Parametric Hilbert's Nullstellensatz to obtain our central reduction.</description>

      <title>On Connections Between Association Schemes and Analyses of Polyhedral and Positive Semidefinite Lift-and-Project Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.08628v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore some connections between association schemes and the analyses of the semidefinite programming (SDP) based convex relaxations of combinatorial optimization problems in the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver lift-and-project hierarchy. Our analysis of the relaxations of the stable set polytope leads to bounds on the clique and stability numbers of some regular graphs reminiscent of classical bounds by Delsarte and Hoffman, as well as the notion of deeply vertex-transitive graphs -- highly symmetric graphs that we show arise naturally from some association schemes. We also study relaxations of the hypergraph matching problem, and determine exactly or provide bounds on the lift-and-project ranks of these relaxations. Our proofs for these results also inspire the study of a homogeneous coherent configuration based on hypermatchings, which is an association scheme except it is generally non-commutative. We then illustrate the usefulness of obtaining commutative subschemes from non-commutative homogeneous coherent configurations via contraction in this context.</description>

      <title>Reuniting $\chi$-boundedness with polynomial $\chi$-boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs is $\chi$-bounded if there is a function $f$ such that $\chi(H)\le f(\omega(H))$ for all induced subgraphs $H$ of a graph in $\mathcal{F}$. If $f$ can be chosen to be a polynomial, we say that $\mathcal{F}$ is polynomially $\chi$-bounded. Esperet proposed a conjecture that every $\chi$-bounded class of graphs is polynomially $\chi$-bounded. This conjecture has been disproved; it has been shown that there are classes of graphs that are $\chi$-bounded but not polynomially $\chi$-bounded. Nevertheless, inspired by Esperet's conjecture, we introduce Pollyanna classes of graphs. A class $\mathcal{C}$ of graphs is Pollyanna if $\mathcal{C}\cap \mathcal{F}$ is polynomially $\chi$-bounded for every $\chi$-bounded class $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs. We prove that several classes of graphs are Pollyanna and also present some proper classes of graphs that are not Pollyanna.</description>

      <title>2-covers of wide Young diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Young diagram $Y$ is called wide if every sub-diagram $Z$ formed by a subset of the rows of $Y$ dominates $Z'$, the conjugate of $Z$. A Young diagram $Y$ is called Latin if its squares can be assigned numbers so that for each $i$, the $i$th row is filled injectively with the numbers $1, \ldots ,a_i$, where $a_i$ is the length of $i$th row of $Y$, and every column is also filled injectively. A conjecture of Chow and Taylor, publicized by Chow, Fan, Goemans, and Vondrak is that a wide Young diagram is Latin. We prove a dual version of the conjecture.</description>
