      <title>Mini Honor of Kings: A Lightweight Environment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Games are widely used as research environments for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), but they pose three significant challenges: limited customization, high computational demands, and oversimplification. To address these issues, we introduce the first publicly available map editor for the popular mobile game Honor of Kings and design a lightweight environment, Mini Honor of Kings (Mini HoK), for researchers to conduct experiments. Mini HoK is highly efficient, allowing experiments to be run on personal PCs or laptops while still presenting sufficient challenges for existing MARL algorithms. We have tested our environment on common MARL algorithms and demonstrated that these algorithms have yet to find optimal solutions within this environment. This facilitates the dissemination and advancement of MARL methods within the research community. Additionally, we hope that more researchers will leverage the Honor of Kings map editor to develop innovative and scientifically valuable new maps. Our code and user manual are available at: https://github.com/tencent-ailab/mini-hok.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Misalignment Between Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing concerns about the AI alignment problem have emerged in recent years, with previous work focusing mainly on (1) qualitative descriptions of the alignment problem; (2) attempting to align AI actions with human interests by focusing on value specification and learning; and/or (3) focusing on a single agent or on humanity as a singular unit. Recent work in sociotechnical AI alignment has made some progress in defining alignment inclusively, but the field as a whole still lacks a systematic understanding of how to specify, describe, and analyze misalignment among entities, which may include individual humans, AI agents, and complex compositional entities such as corporations, nation-states, and so forth. Previous work on controversy in computational social science offers a mathematical model of contention among populations (of humans). In this paper, we adapt this contention model to the alignment problem, and show how misalignment can vary depending on the population of agents (human or otherwise) being observed, the domain in question, and the agents' probability-weighted preferences between possible outcomes. Our model departs from value specification approaches and focuses instead on the morass of complex, interlocking, sometimes contradictory goals that agents may have in practice. We apply our model by analyzing several case studies ranging from social media moderation to autonomous vehicle behavior. By applying our model with appropriately representative value data, AI engineers can ensure that their systems learn values maximally aligned with diverse human interests.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Algorithms for Finding Local Nash Equilibria in Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-sum games arise in a wide variety of problems, including robust optimization and adversarial learning. However, algorithms deployed for finding a local Nash equilibrium in these games often converge to non-Nash stationary points. This highlights a key challenge: for any algorithm, the stability properties of its underlying dynamical system can cause non-Nash points to be potential attractors. To overcome this challenge, algorithms must account for subtleties involving the curvatures of players' costs. To this end, we leverage dynamical system theory and develop a second-order algorithm for finding a local Nash equilibrium in the smooth, possibly nonconvex-nonconcave, zero-sum game setting. First, we prove that this novel method guarantees convergence to only local Nash equilibria with a local linear convergence rate. We then interpret a version of this method as a modified Gauss-Newton algorithm with local superlinear convergence to the neighborhood of a point that satisfies first-order local Nash equilibrium conditions. In comparison, current related state-of-the-art methods do not offer convergence rate guarantees. Furthermore, we show that this approach naturally generalizes to settings with convex and potentially coupled constraints while retaining earlier guarantees of convergence to only local (generalized) Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Amortized Equation Discovery in Hybrid Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid dynamical systems are prevalent in science and engineering to express complex systems with continuous and discrete states. To learn the laws of systems, all previous methods for equation discovery in hybrid systems follow a two-stage paradigm, i.e. they first group time series into small cluster fragments and then discover equations in each fragment separately through methods in non-hybrid systems. Although effective, these methods do not fully take advantage of the commonalities in the shared dynamics of multiple fragments that are driven by the same equations. Besides, the two-stage paradigm breaks the interdependence between categorizing and representing dynamics that jointly form hybrid systems. In this paper, we reformulate the problem and propose an end-to-end learning framework, i.e. Amortized Equation Discovery (AMORE), to jointly categorize modes and discover equations characterizing the dynamics of each mode by all segments of the mode. Experiments on four hybrid and six non-hybrid systems show that our method outperforms previous methods on equation discovery, segmentation, and forecasting.</description>

      <title>MARLander: A Local Path Planning for Drone Swarms using Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving safe and precise landings for a swarm of drones poses a significant challenge, primarily attributed to conventional control and planning methods. This paper presents the implementation of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) techniques for the precise landing of a drone swarm at relocated target locations. The system is trained in a realistic simulated environment with a maximum velocity of 3 m/s in training spaces of 4 x 4 x 4 m and deployed utilizing Crazyflie drones with a Vicon indoor localization system. The experimental results revealed that the proposed approach achieved a landing accuracy of 2.26 cm on stationary and 3.93 cm on moving platforms surpassing a baseline method used with a Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with an Artificial Potential Field (APF). This research highlights drone landing technologies that eliminate the need for analytical centralized systems, potentially offering scalability and revolutionizing applications in logistics, safety, and rescue missions.</description>

      <title>Towards Principled Superhuman AI for Multiplayer Symmetric Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiplayer games, when the number of players exceeds two, present unique challenges that fundamentally distinguish them from the extensively studied two-player zero-sum games. These challenges arise from the non-uniqueness of equilibria and the risk of agents performing highly suboptimally when adopting equilibrium strategies. While a line of recent works developed learning systems successfully achieving human-level or even superhuman performance in popular multiplayer games such as Mahjong, Poker, and Diplomacy, two critical questions remain unaddressed: (1) What is the correct solution concept that AI agents should find? and (2) What is the general algorithmic framework that provably solves all games within this class? This paper takes the first step towards solving these unique challenges of multiplayer games by provably addressing both questions in multiplayer symmetric normal-form games. We also demonstrate that many meta-algorithms developed in prior practical systems for multiplayer games can fail to achieve even the basic goal of obtaining agent's equal share of the total reward.</description>

      <title>Compressed and Sparse Models for Non-Convex Decentralized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent research highlights frequent model communication as a significant bottleneck to the efficiency of decentralized machine learning (ML), especially for large-scale and over-parameterized neural networks (NNs). To address this, we present Malcom-PSGD, a novel decentralized ML algorithm that combines gradient compression techniques with model sparsification. We promote model sparsity by adding $\ell_1$ regularization to the objective and present a decentralized proximal SGD method for training. Our approach employs vector source coding and dithering-based quantization for the compressed gradient communication of sparsified models. Our analysis demonstrates that Malcom-PSGD achieves a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{t})$ with respect to the iterations $t$, assuming a constant consensus and learning rate. This result is supported by our proof for the convergence of non-convex compressed Proximal SGD methods. Additionally, we conduct a bit analysis, providing a closed-form expression for the communication costs associated with Malcom-PSGD. Numerical results verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our method reduces communication costs by approximately $75\%$ when compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>NFT Wash Trading: Direct vs. Indirect Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies estimate around 70% of traded value on off-chain crypto exchanges like Binance is wash trading. This paper turns to NFT markets, where the on-chain nature of transactions-a key tenet of Web3 innovation-enables more direct estimation methods to be applied. Focusing on three of the largest NFT marketplaces, we find 30-40% of NFT volume and 25-95% of traded value involve wash trading. We leverage this direct approach to critically evaluate recent indirect estimation methods suggested in the literature, revealing major differences in effectiveness, with some failing altogether. Trade-roundedness filters, as suggested in Cong et al. (2023), emerge as the most accurate indirect estimation method. In fact, we show how direct and indirect approaches can be closely aligned via hyper-parameter fine-tuning. Our findings underscore the crucial role of technological innovation in detecting and regulating financial misconduct in digital finance.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal and Multi-Agent Systems Meet Rationality: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rationality is the quality of being guided by reason, characterized by logical thinking and decision-making that align with evidence and logical rules. This quality is essential for effective problem-solving, as it ensures that solutions are well-founded and systematically derived. Despite the advancements of large language models (LLMs) in generating human-like text with remarkable accuracy, they present biases inherited from the training data, inconsistency across different contexts, and difficulty understanding complex scenarios involving multiple layers of context. Therefore, recent research attempts to leverage the strength of multiple agents working collaboratively with various types of data and tools for enhanced consistency and reliability. To that end, this paper aims to understand whether multi-modal and multi-agent systems are advancing toward rationality by surveying the state-of-the-art works, identifying advancements over single-agent and single-modal systems in terms of rationality, and discussing open problems and future directions. We maintain an open repository at https://github.com/bowen-upenn/MMMA_Rationality.</description>

      <title>CityLight: A Universal Model Towards Real-world City-scale Traffic Signal Control Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traffic signal control (TSC) is a promising low-cost measure to enhance transportation efficiency without affecting existing road infrastructure. While various reinforcement learning-based TSC methods have been proposed and experimentally outperform conventional rule-based methods, none of them has been deployed in the real world. An essential gap lies in the oversimplification of the scenarios in terms of intersection heterogeneity and road network intricacy. To make TSC applicable in urban traffic management, we target TSC coordination in city-scale high-authenticity road networks, aiming to solve the three unique and important challenges: city-level scalability, heterogeneity of real-world intersections, and effective coordination among intricate neighbor connections. Since optimizing multiple agents in a parameter-sharing paradigm can boost the training efficiency and help achieve scalability, we propose our method, CityLight, based on the well-acknowledged optimization framework, parameter-sharing MAPPO. To ensure the unified policy network can learn to fit large-scale heterogeneous intersections and tackle the intricate between-neighbor coordination, CityLight proposes a universal representation module that consists of two key designs: heterogeneous intersection alignment and neighborhood impact alignment for coordination. To further boost coordination, CityLight adopts neighborhood-integrated rewards to transition from achieving local optimal to global optimal. Extensive experiments on datasets with hundreds to tens of thousands of real-world intersections and authentic traffic demands validate the surprising effectiveness and generalizability of CityLight, with an overall performance gain of 11.66% and a 22.59% improvement in transfer scenarios in terms of throughput.</description>
